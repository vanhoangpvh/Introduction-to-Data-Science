Ma La Nu Pei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41511/Ma_La_Nu_Pei,"['麻辣女配is a light-hearted, enjoyable Chinese romance anime. Nothing complicated here, it’s exactly what you expect in terms of characters, story, jokes… But it’s fresh and positive. If you have already heard about Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama! or Skip Beat!, it feels quite similar, i.e. the main character is a strong female lead lacking femininity and self-confidence and who wants to get consideration; and (in)fortunately she meets an amazing and successful guy who is also a pervert in private. Basically, this guy psychologically ‘tortures’ her but also enables her to gain confidence and abilities; and they ultimately realize how much they love each other…I will not...be much longer, I liked this anime because the format (~8 min per episode) was appropriate, the characters funny and attractive, animation was OK and last but not least – sound (OST, opening/ending, voices) was really good.Do not expect turnovers, and just take this one as a nice and enjoyable entertainment. be much longer, I liked this anime because the format (~8 min per episode) was appropriate, the characters funny and attractive, animation was OK and last but not least – sound (OST, opening/ending, voices) was really good.Do not expect turnovers, and just take this one as a nice and enjoyable entertainment.', ""a highly entertaining love comedy between an outrageously aggressive but hardworking actress and a cool-headed (sometimes-- love makes us all crazy XD) and perverted (and super conniving!) man (did i mention he's a nationally famous actor too lol) that's bound to make you laugh! although each episode is about 6 minutes long excluding the intro/outro, this show manages to showcase the growth between the couple as they begin to understand each other, their widely interesting chemistry, and even builds up the relationship through small moments within the show. best of all, it still continues to maintain the central plot of the female mc striving to...become a better and more talented actress with the help of the male mc and the people she has around her. her determination to do more for herself is super admirable and something definitely worth staying for. it's super funny in mandarin (just something about the female mc cursing all the time at him lol) but a good watch for anyone looking to enjoy something light and funny. definitely suited for fans who enjoy a bickering and bantering couple and a male mc who teases the female mc but would do anything to cheer her up! become a better and more talented actress with the help of the male mc and the people she has around her. her determination to do more for herself is super admirable and something definitely worth staying for. it's super funny in mandarin (just something about the female mc cursing all the time at him lol) but a good watch for anyone looking to enjoy something light and funny. definitely suited for fans who enjoy a bickering and bantering couple and a male mc who teases the female mc but would do anything to cheer her up!""]"
Maison Ikkoku: Shiki Utsuriyuku Kisetsu no Naka de,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3483/Maison_Ikkoku__Shiki_Utsuriyuku_Kisetsu_no_Naka_de,"[""This is basically a recap of the TV which tries to summarise the show in 1.5 hours (missing out the last episode wrap-up).As the title suggests, select scenes from the TV series were taken and divided into four seasons. The choices aren't too bad although I think it missed out a few good and major ones so I'd still recommend just sticking with the full TV series. It uses scenes from 36 of the 96 episodes.I'd still recommend watching the whole series to appreciate what lead to them and maybe just watch this as a quick reminder of what the show was about. "", 'So recap movies existed in that time too.Maison Ikkoku is an anime series which has 96 episodes. This movie is just 1 hour 30 minutes long. You can see where I\'m going with this.They basically picked a lot of scenes throughout the series from beginning to end and mashed them together in a feature length movie somehow. This series had a lot of plotpoints which makes it near impossible to cut up into a single movie. The overall plot stays the same but a lot of important scenes which added to the experience when watching the 96-episode anime gets the axe. And I think everyone...who watched the anime would feel the same way when watching this.The following parts of the review contains spoilers for those who didn\'t watch Maison Ikkoku.Maison Ikkoku is a long-running romcom anime. So it\'s bound that when they cut a scene it\'ll piss someone off who actually loved that scene. I\'ll tell you some of the scenes that I missed: the first kiss scene between Godai and Kyoko, the entire arc about Godai getting a job from Yagami\'s dad, the ""even if it\'s by a day, please live longer than me"" dialogue from Kyoko etc. I understand why the Godai getting a job arc was cut because it was too long to fit in this movie and it could be considered a filler arc when compared to the grand scheme of things. In fact, I can probably understand most of the cuts. It\'s because of time constraints.But they\'ve also edited scenes that are included in the film for the same reason. To me this was a bigger sin. The one scene that was obviously guilty of this was Kyoko slapping Godai at the train station before graduation exam. A beautiful scene got ruined due to the excessive amount of cuts.I\'ll stop here as anymore and I\'d be considered a whiner.Maybe I already am.One thing I like about some modern recap films is that they sometime add new content to the story. But this film is probably too backdated for that. I half-expected some new scene from the manga to make it here since the original series cut so many little things from the manga. The animation is probably also the same as the series. There\'s no touched up animation like you might\'ve expected.So yeah, I don\'t really recommend this movie if you\'ve recently finished watching Maison Ikkoku. But 96 episodes is a long journey, and you might want to rewatch some earlier episodes without accidentally rewatching the entire series. So this might be the solution you\'re looking for. Other than that I\'d say the filler ""Final Chapter"" movie and the 90\'s OVA is worth your time more.I\'ll rate this film the same score I rate every other recap film in my list that have no new interesting material.That\'s it.

Leadale no Daichi nite,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48239/Leadale_no_Daichi_nite,"[""A simple generic slice of life fantasy comedy, that manages to be well written and well executed.There is no main story, and it doesnt have anything outstanding to show, but also doesn't have any signs of something poorly made, or that feels flat.It kinda reminds me of Slime 300 but a more elaborate protagonist that feels more relatable and a with a better developed comedy.It also sums up with the slice of life aspect of Kami-Tachi, but having better execution. At least for now, its a good show to watch, but nothing that would make me go back to it later "", ""“I gotta say, tearing your own family limb from limb is a bit harsh.”“Sob. All I wanted was for my children to have a touching first encounter with their grandmother.”Easily one of the best isekai ever made, a hidden gem of a series that has more meat under its skin than it may look like at a first glance.Leadale is a slow-life isekai with a female protagonist and a VRMMO world turned real parallel world. I’ve seen about a dozen shows featuring these tropes in various combinations and all of them suck. And they always suck in the same way - either they forget the...part where they’re supposed to be isekai, turning into a generic CGDCT/shoujo/yuribait, or they forget the female MC + slow life part, turning into a generic SAO-clone dungeon crawler with a generic Kirito for a protagonist. Leadale, on the other hand, manages to succeed where those shows fail, and then raises the bar even higher. What truly makes it stand out is that it’s not an “isekai anime,” it’s a genuine work of dramatic fiction that happens to be in the isekai genre. The best comparison I can offer is with Monogatari - that one is also a genuine work of literature that makes use of anime harem tropes for storytelling, rather than just another harem anime. Here are some things Leadale does right:Wish-fulfillment.One of the easiest criticisms to make against an isekai is that it is pandering/power fantasy/wish-fulfillment. Usually, you can’t go wrong with that, but only because most isekai series offer a low-effort trash version of wish-fulfillment, not because the concept is bad in principle. Some basement-dwelling neckbeard getting handed status/power/women he doesn’t deserve and didn’t work for does not make for a very compelling narrative.Cayna, the MC of Leadale, starts the story as a 17-year-old girl that has been stuck on life support in a hospital bed for most of her life. The first thought she has upon being reincarnated is, “hey, my legs work!” The first thing she does is eat a hearty meal in an inn, and the first words out of her mouth are, “I can’t remember when was the last time I ate not through a plastic tube.” You look at that and think, yeah, I don’t mind watching a story about her getting a second chance to walk around, see places, meet people, get drank celebrating with friends, wake up with a hangover the day after, start a family, and see her grandchildren - that is, have a fulfilling life that she was robbed out of by a tragic accident.Actual intelligent thought put into isekai tropes.The paragraph above is just one of the numerous examples of how the typical isekai story elements make a refreshing amount of sense from the logical perspective. The reincarnated Cayna is an elf, and the first natives she meets comment that they’ve never seen an elf before. Just a single line answers the usual glaring question of how come the locals never question the blatant alienness of reincarnators. In fact, a centuries-old elf visiting human settlements for the first time is such an ingenious cover story for a reincarnator, I’m shocked that no one (I know of) did this before. Just think how *perfectly* it fits the portrait of someone who lacks common sense and is ignorant about the most obvious things, yet simultaneously possesses absurdly powerful “cheat” abilities and talks about arcane matters beyond common folks’ understanding.But wait, there is more - Leadale is the only series not just among isekai, but among all the elf-featuring fantasy I know of that does something with the implications of the fact that your world includes an “elder” race of people whose lifespan is counted in centuries and who don’t mind breeding with humans. And that is some mixed-blood characters having an awkward encounter with their great-grandmother that looks younger than them and whose thought process is incomprehensible to them.The purpose of being an isekai story.This is something very simple to test - ask yourself if the show would still work if it was just regular fantasy without the opening scene where a Japanese salaryman gets hit by a truck. For a depressingly high percentage of titles, the answer is yes, but Leadale isn’t one of them. There is another common elephant in the isekai room - how come reincarnators never give a fuck about their friends, family, and the entire world they left behind. It would make sense for Cayna to not care much for a life of being a bed-ridden vegetable, yet unexpectedly, she very much does. The only thing she has on her mind is to try and find the way back, or at least find some other people from her original world. There is a poignant scene where it dawns on her that it’s been 200 years, and everyone she knew is likely gone, so she has to hug her knees for a while in order to come to terms with it. This is how you do a reincarnation story.Female protagonist.There has been an outcropping of those in the isekai genre, and I’m not sure what for, as it is painfully obvious that most isekai writers have never been in a room with a female that isn’t their mom. Same deal, ask yourself if the story would still work if the MC was replaced by a male, and if the answer is yes, then the author has failed at writing a female protagonist. Take any iconic action heroine like Ellen Ripley from Aliens or Sarah Connor from Terminator 2. They kick ass and chew bubblegum, yet everything in their words and actions screams XX chromosomes, and it would’ve looked incongruous if male characters were saying and doing those things. And that’s how Cayna is, she might come with the standard isekai protag cheat powers package, but she shows very little interest in using those powers to assert her alpha-male dominance the way Kirito does. Her concerns are entirely private and/or interpersonal - helping people that make up her social circle, dealing with her newly-acquired isekai family, looking for clues connecting her to the original VRMMO, etc.On top of being an actual woman, Cayna’s personality matches her profile as a teen that missed out on living through the formative teen experiences. She’s generally well-meaning, yet also short-tempered, self-conscious, and naive. She has trouble processing complex emotions, and really, really hates surprises, which leads to unreasonable outbursts she later regrets and has to apologize for.Slow life.Does a minor side character being catastrophically bad at winking advance the plot in any way? Does the shoujo manga roses background that permanently follows another character do that? A tiny mute fairy mimicking the MC’s facial expressions? No, what those do is being cute. Even with plenty of drama and deaths in the story, it manages to keep a consistent wholesome atmosphere. I don't really need to tell this, I can just let the show speak for itself. Here's an exchange from the second episode:- Oneechan, you're leaving?- Yes. But I promise I'll come back to see you again.- Really?- I'll let you know something super amazing. But you can't tell anyone, okay?- O-Okay. I promise I'll keep it a secret.- You know that silver tower beyond the mountains?- The place where the bad witch lives, right?- Believe it or not... I'm that bad witch.-  What?! But you're not a bad person!- Make sure you keep it a secret, okay? I'm going to come back every once in a while to make sure you didn't tell anyone.- Okay! But if you don't come back for a really long time, I'm going to tell someone.- Then I'd better make sure I come back to this village.It just radiates heart and wit. If I were to recommend this show to myself from a parallel universe, I'd just show this dialogue, that would be all I need to know it’s a well-written story.The real character and story arcs.This one is the total of everything said above. As the story begins, Cayna has trouble truly comprehending that the world she is in is not a video game anymore. This isn’t shown through some idiotic exposition, “these NPCs aren’t people, ay lmao.” It is shown subtly with Cayna and other characters’ behavior. She casually suggests crafting attack magic “consumables” and doesn’t even notice that everyone around freaks out over the prospects of freely-circulated weapons of mass destruction. She thinks about rewriting the personalities of her isekai children (originally custom-ordered NPCs) because it hasn’t quite dawned on her that they are people whose personalities are shaped by 200 years' worth of life without her, life in which they’ve played prominent roles in society and created multi-generational extended families. But Cayna doesn’t stay oblivious forever. With every new realization that people die when they are killed, that her combat pokemons have names, consciousness, and culture, etc, etc - her new reality slowly sinks in. Slowly but surely Cayna comes to fully appreciate and embrace the position she occupies in her new world and the responsibilities that come with it. This is what the story of Leadale is about.The only reason I didn’t rate it 10 is that the adaptation adds some very unsound original scenes which stick out like a sore thumb.9/10 for “this is how isekai can be like when written by real writers as a real work of literature, not an embarrassing attempt at fanfiction by some hikineet.” part where they’re supposed to be isekai, turning into a generic CGDCT/shoujo/yuribait, or they forget the female MC + slow life part, turning into a generic SAO-clone dungeon crawler with a generic Kirito for a protagonist.

Does it have an interesting and balanced world? How does the main protagonist die and end up reborn into such a world? Does it have RPG elements? And most importantly, can I make it through more than three episodes? Don't worry, the last one thankfully doesn't apply to In the Land of Leadale.To put it into perspective, this is essentially a protagonist who ends up becoming a RPG character set in a world known as Leadale. Like most RPG games,...there are classes and our protagonist Cayna is an elf, who specalizes in magic. As a spellcaster and elf, she can heal, cast deadly magic, and has rare skills at her arsenal. It's very spellcaster's wet dream when we think about it. But for Cayna, she's not there to level up her character to beat a game. She's there to learn about the world of Leadale.As a common norm in most RPG games, there are NPCs, towns to visit, places to explore, weapons and gear to unlock, in-game crafting systems, quests, and monsters. If you've ever played a RPG game before, these should be common sense to understand. With Cayna's situation, she finds herself in the role of an adventurer while looking for other Leadale players. Be honest though, what would you do if you were in Cayna's shoes? You'd want to learn about other players as much as possible right? The only problem is that over 200 years has passed since she last played the game. That spells out problems of her familiarizing with the game she once played. And of course, a lot has since changed especially with wars. Cayna spends her days exploring Landale and learning as much as possible.Watching Land of Leadale was a challenge for me at first, not because of its overused content but because the story pacing. The initial start felt sluggish, with Cayne's adventure having seemingly no set direction. She's there exploring a fantasy world but it's confusing about the true purpose of the show. Is it set up as a fantasy adventure or some sort of mystery with suspense and hidden secrets? Cayna herself is actually an engima because of her circumstances. However, she retains the personailty of a normal girl, without any sort of special trait besides her in-game status and abilities. That being said, you should expect this story to have a mixture of fantasy, adventure, mystery, and sometimes, slice of life. If you've played JRPG games before, then you may be very familar with these genres already.Because she is the main protagonist, Cayne essentially carries this anime on her shoulders. She gets the most screen time and the majority of the supporting cast is overshadowed by her presence. Characters such as Key, Mai-Mai, Skargo, among others only have minor roles throughout the show. Their character development is very limited, if any. In fact, this anime treats them like side quest NPCs than party members or companions. Cayna's adventure often takes her to meet people and taking on quests that requires her to use in-game skills and knowledge. It's as if you're on the journey with her in the game.Adapted by Maho Film, this is another addition to their roster of fantasy portfolio. The colorful world of Leadale contains lush lands with old style architectures and towns crafted from RPG asthestics. Cayne is known for her charming figure and personality. Other characters in the show are protrayed with RPG elements. That's not a knockdown to the show but the anime pretty much plays for itself. There's nothing strinkingly unique about the art style at all.Land of Leadale won't hit different for what the story shows us. In fact, this anime represents some of the most oversatuarted RPG tropes you'll discover. Cayne herself is a character that you may or may not like.

Not at all."", ""To start off imma rant a little,Isekai, whether you hate it or not has limitless potential, the ability to have wish fulfillment and escapism to the level that it provides is simply impossible to achieve in any other genre, this success allows it to be a bit more Wild and inventive and has led to various sub-genre to pop up from within isekai, hence calling this or any isekai anime A GENERIC ISEKAI is stupid. Leadale is an isekai anime focused on power fantasy and comedy. so stop stigmatizing and not watching shows since the synopsis indicates Isekai, hell half the time I watch isekai...shows I forget they're isekai s midway through the shows, please stop jumping into the popular opinion and Anituber bandwagon, You know I and the other reviewers have a better opinion since we actually give every show a chance and not just hate on them on youtube to make money (yes I am calling you out joey).The only thing an Isekai has to get right however has to be Worldbuilding but that to depends on the case,Of course, since we don't know shit about this new world in any isekai, we need to have a good and clear understanding of the Working and principles of the world, Naturally, An action Isekai needs to nail this aspect perfectly like mushoku tensei , overlord, and tenshura or they will fail hard. the other isekai this season named Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja failed hard since its an action isekai with zero explanation and the MC is OP and LOLI just because YES xD.in the case of Leadale however, it does it in a very clean and proper manner, even if in a slice of life Isekai it's not entirely necessary it opens up many more possibilities. The situation is made clear in episode one, A good and proper demonstration is done on the scale and difference of power between MC and inhabitants of the world, And a clear goal of looking for other guardian towers is established without giving too much up (A good excuse to begin fun isekai exploration!). Hence this has much more potential to have great action later on. The character knows only just about enough about the world as we do hence we will mostly never be left in the dark just like Overlord everything is revealed to us and the MC at the same time and it only serves to remind us of their Overpowered nature xD. hence it would much more right to call it a power fantasy isekai like overlord but one with a much lighter tone.Since it has a  lighter tone, Comedy is much more light-hearted than the more profanity and DANK type we see in overlord, The faces the MC makes are pretty damn good and original and will induce a good laugh and lead to the creation of many GIFs or at least I am hoping for the same.There is also the interesting element of some of the old summons of the MC becoming her KIDS which lead to some awkward, hilarious situations which is a nice touch and will not disappoint the Slice of life and comedy lovers.The MC is pretty cool does not hold back and will definitely appease the Power fantasy lovers, however, do not expect great actions scenes since that appears to be not the primary focus here.I have already made this review a bit too long so let me go through the scores a little more briefly.Story 8/10Pretty well done, just enough is revealed at just the right times, the past of the MC is made pretty clear through clever dialogue and a good initial cutscene, and hence not a lot of time is wasted on making them look pathetic but still enough to gain our respect and love for all they have been through(no more opening of “hey I am loner no 78 I had a shit life, etc”). the world exploration and the addition of the Children who have been present since before the isekai can add many interesting plot and comedy bits later on and hence I am genuinely excited to see where this will go from here.Characters 8/10MC is cute and protecc worthy, The children have a very funny yet heartwarming relationship with their mother and all the other side characters are also a joy to watch.Sound 7/10Nicely done VA work especially the eldest son, daughter, and MC. The rest sound okay too. The majority of the Gags are delivered by VA s really well. The OST is pretty generic and nothing to be really excited about but does an okay job. the OP music or the art in it isn't that good. The ED is quite nice and the art is cutesy but not very inventive tbh.Art and animation 7/10Standard fantasy isekai level art which isn't bad but considering the quality of art this season it is certainly not up to the level but is definitely really good and has good enough immersion. animation isn't the strongest 2D animation is alright and can ramp up during important scenes but generally, only average. CGI usage is pretty competent, however, and not hard to look at, unlike many other examples.A very good Power fantasy comedy isekai anime with a much more open-ended scope can get very exciting in the long run. so far has done a solid job of setting things up. All my power fantasy and isekai BROS are sure to love this, the comedy aspect will depend on taste but I find it pretty funny hence to the audience that is looking for more comedy and SOL do give this a three-episode rule. shows I forget they're isekai s midway through the shows, please stop jumping into the popular opinion and Anituber bandwagon, You know I and the other reviewers have a better opinion since we actually give every show a chance and not just hate on them on youtube to make money (yes I am calling you out joey).The only thing an Isekai has to get right however has to be Worldbuilding but that to depends on the case,Of course, since we don't know shit about this new world in any isekai, we need to have a good and clear understanding of the Working and principles of the world, Naturally, An action Isekai needs to nail this aspect perfectly like mushoku tensei , overlord, and tenshura or they will fail hard. the other isekai this season named Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja failed hard since its an action isekai with zero explanation and the MC is OP and LOLI just because YES xD.in the case of Leadale however, it does it in a very clean and proper manner, even if in a slice of life Isekai it's not entirely necessary it opens up many more possibilities.

It’s a slice of life isekai more so than action, and is just ok. Wish they expanded on the game mechanics and why Leadale shut down in the first place a bit more.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 10/25The story is basic and inoffensive,...but rather uninteresting. Cayna is reincarnated in another world and goes on an adventure, helping people, having fun times with her quirky family, and meeting a whole bunch of people. Again, I wished they went more in depth about the game mechanics and why the game shut down in a more in depth way as well. There was much more they could have done with the story for sure.ART: 7.3/10Fine art, nothing much to say here. The creatures lot a bit ugly, but the fights are alright, and it’s ok to look at.MUSIC: 8/10The ED is awesome! One of my favourites of the season! Soundtrack otherwise is fine.CHARACTERS: 9.7/20Quite forgettable, but pleasant. We have Cayna, our pleasant overpowered MC that’s probably pretty old inside the world of Leadale, we have her kids, and her grandkids, and they’re kinda quirky and provide comedic relief. If anything, the comedic aspect of these characters were enjoyable at times, but forgettable at most.ENJOYMENT: 9/15It was decently enjoyable most of the time, the characters were fun to watch.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 10.5/20The theme is a bit muddled, is it a slice of life, or action? I suppose it’s both, but to me, the slice of life elements were handled well. Wish there was more world-building to create the fantasy atmosphere in a more interesting way.OVERALL: 54.5/100A simple generic isekai that was bland, but fine to watch. In a weaker anime season, this is definitely not the worst show, but also this is far from the best. Watch it if you want some nice comedy and simplistic story!

Many will say, what about grace? Well, you'll see, my dear mortal, the funny thing is that he has children that he should know... Ah, so that was it, of course, of course, I'm sorry I didn't think of that.Now completely out of jokes, I hate isekai, but I feel that with this one I can have enough willpower to finish it.Speaking about the characteristics of the series, I can say that the animation is not...bad, although the drawing seems to be taken from an H (I don't need to explain that).The CGI is good compared to what can be seen in other isekai.The story is weird, I really don't even know what it's about, I could say it's a slice of life, I think this because chapter 1 is a bit of a pain to swallow whole.For me, feeling very sorry, it stays at a 5, I don't see what's interesting about it and I don't like isekai, and since it's still boring for me, I'll be forced to require the dropped.I am starting in this and I would be glad if you support me, thank you very much for reading my review and I hope you have a good day. bad, although the drawing seems to be taken from an H (I don't need to explain that).The CGI is good compared to what can be seen in other isekai.The story is weird, I really don't even know what it's about, I could say it's a slice of life, I think this because chapter 1 is a bit of a pain to swallow whole.For me, feeling very sorry, it stays at a 5, I don't see what's interesting about it and I don't like isekai, and since it's still boring for me, I'll be forced to require the dropped.I am starting in this and I would be glad if you support me, thank you very much for reading my review and I hope you have a good day."", ""I wanna start this review by saying that this show has a certain style and charm to it. While it's not super action packed, or the sort. But what it is, is a fun little Isekai adventure. An Isekai that makes you feel happy watching it vibe. A nice and chill kind. While I understand that might not be everyone's cup of tea, but in terms for these kinds of shows, they're a blast. You'll enjoy it.Art and sound are the main best factors of this show. The sound is fit for purpose, along with the art style being that typical fresh and colourful kind....A style that is not only pleasing on the eyes, but is fitting in any kind of scene that this anime produces. You can go from bright and colourful. To the next, seemingly a more toned down kind of style. Depending the scene of course. It's what a good anime should have. A pleasing sound design, and a pleasing to look at artstyle. Along with the animation being great too.Now let's talk about the next part. While it's nothing to stand out against. But more that there are elements of cuteness. As I'll state further in this review, this type of Isekai is nice, casual, relaxing to a tee. With an ideal premise that'll carry the show forward, and make you more and more curious when it comes to the world it presents.The story is in proper isekai fashion. With someone being trapped, or moved into a different world. In this case, trapped inside a video game. To which our main character seems to have done a lot in said game. It'll remind you of Slime 300 in a sense, but with her being more famous, but not so famous. The story continues with us learning more about this world, along with the experiences she's had, like her children who are each quite the catch in their own right. Depending your enjoyment too, it might provide a few laughs here or there.But they're not the only set of characters. A lot of these seem to have a rather nice feel to them. As if everything feels and seems happy. Which really fits into the themes of this show. It's not the kind of super intense action Isekai. More just the relaxing kind. Which can be a hit or miss. But it does make for a decent product, that isn't bad by any stretch.  It's why I say this show depends your tastes. If you like a more relaxed and seemingly happy Isekai, then this is the show for you.I'd give this show a watch for sure. Wile it's not super entertaining, it is at least a good show to pick up on.

Watch as you see our MC, Cayna, explores the vast new world with limitless oppurtunities.Except, not really. Leadale no Daichi nite is a rehash of isekai genres, and does not really try to do anything new. Whether it be the comedy, combat, or storyline, Leadale no Daichi nite is a jack of all things that tries to implement every trope, and fails to do any of them justice.Animation is nothing special, perhaps below average, but that\'s not the reason why the show is bad.First off, we have Cayna trying to recover the ""guardian towers,"" which is essentially a...macguffin, since I mean, what exactly do these towers function? Cayna\'s goal has been to recover them so far, yet other than the little cutscene of Cayna regenerating the tower\'s MP, I haven\'t seen any relevance in them. They don\'t seem all that important, huh?Next is the other characters and of course, slice of life. They kind of go hand in hand. Having a ""slow, fluffy life"" in the other world isn\'t terribly unique, but there have been standouts here and there, perhaps. Too bad this show doesn\'t really care about their characters. You have a perfect setup for some fun slice of life, but all you get are repeated comedic sequences that get really old. Cayna actually does have family living in the world, yet these family members are just a single trait and always repeat the same thing over and over again. Skargo is a mom-con that is over the top, Mai-mai is a respected woman, but also fawns over Cayna, and Kartatz might be the only person in the family that\'s normal, but of course, he\'s relegated to Cayna just giving him head pats and him being embarrassed. On another note: really? Skargo is Jojo\'s voice actor, Sugita Tomokazu, and Kartatz is Gintoki\'s VA, Ono, Daisuke. What a lineup.Anyways, you kind of get the idea. the family members that Cayna regularly interacts are over the top and don\'t have an actual personality other than their fawning over Cayna. Or, Cayna just treats them like pets like Kartatz. There\'s no variety in their interactions, and the general sequence events is as follows: Skargo or Maimai does something stupid, and Cayna hits them in a slapstick fashion in annoyance and anger. Not really funny, and definitely does not contribute to a well balanced slice of life.Then comes the other portion of the story: other players from the VRMMORPG, Leadale. This is a more difficult way to navigate and execute well in an isekai. There\'s a reason why most isekai stories with transported to a game world tend to steer away from this concept. I wouldn\'t really say that Leadale no Daichi nite butchers the concept, but it also is only a shallow execution. These characters don\'t act any different from actual people living in the world. There also isn\'t any conflict, which you would generally expect from other players, since all of the characters seem to be still, much weaker than Cayna. Much worse, despite there being at least a decent number of players -we never actually know how many-they never really seem to gather together or form a guild, something that you\'d expect other players to be doing. Instead, they immerse themselves in their role in the game world turned real. Essentially, the players don\'t bring ANYTHING to the table that you would normally expect.This is highlighted with the only hostile player to Cayna: he gets caught and tried by the kingdom, despite being a player. I wouldn\'t know about you, but if there was a player with a potential to level up and take revenge on me, I surely wouldn\'t spare him. If I were to spare him, I probably wouldn\'t put him in jail for him rot for years on end, solidifying his plan for revenge on me. Either way, the situation was dealt with in a surface level and never mentioned again in the story.Other players that are friendly are just also, again, random encounters that don\'t impact the story as much as you\'d think. Cayna and the players have a small reunion, and that\'s it. This goes for players that Cayna actually knows from real life, before the isekai happened. That\'s crazy, considering that she cherishes her in-game familyThen are the other lazy staples of isekai stories, such as Cayna handling her ""first kill."" Sure, she says she\'s disgusted and that the act took out a lot of her, but 5 minutes later, and it\'s never mentioned again. Other annoying things is how the other characters react to Cayna. Despite Cayna doing unbelievably superhuman feats that no one has ever done before, the characters\' reactions to her are extremely mild. Even this portion of the story is bland and uninventive. None of the characters really perform the role of  tsukkomi, and I think Cayna is left unchecked. For the show to have been comedic, I think there had to be have had some sort of familiar, pet, or just character that keeps Cayna in check, making snarky comments here and there.Of course, these bad points is all appended by how Cayna is OP in the isekai, and no one is stronger than her. It\'s sort of wish-fulfillment story that tries to incorporate a story, comedy, and slice of life all in one package, which doesn\'t really make any sense. Even other players are much weaker than her. Cayna even ends up adopting a kid, really trying to milk the ""slow life"" sort of novel, but it\'s already too late. The story tried to diversify its genres so much that it feels fragmented, and more importantly, nothing stands out. macguffin, since I mean, what exactly do these towers function?

The plot is similar to Overlord, where the girl is the most OP entity in the world and she has a ton of servants following her. She goes around the world taking quests, killing bandits, meeting npcs created by former comrades, etc.Pros:+Good ed song+Good artCons:-Story is absurd and illogical-Lack of seriousness-MC is unmotivated and characterless...-MC's action are so illogicalI started watching this series casually with no expectation. The starting plot was good and hoped it would get better as the series progressed. But it only got worse and worse. I'm finally dropping it at the 6th episode, because of a very illogical action taken by MC.*Spoiler*So, after 6 episodes, the MC finally meets another player in the world. The player is a kid (boy) who also got trapped in this world. But the kid thinks this is still a game and continues to level up by attacking city soldiers. And our illogical MC, without any consideration for his age and immaturity, and without any warning, goes to kill him. Even the city soldiers took mercy on the boy and requests the MC to capture him instead. So, finally, the kid ends up in a dark dungeon, fully tied up and restrained (like that of those torture setups). And the MC goes on with her aimless adventure like nothing happened.TLDR: This is one of the worse isekai series.

Even a really bad show with a lot of issues would be more interesting, as trash shows can be amusing to some people.By the last episode it was a chore to keep watching....Overall, leadale isn't anything new for the genre, and it doesn't try to be, or make you think it is.

The problem is, the starting scene of the story which should be interesting and keep my confidences in order to enjoy this adaptation, really let me down.Well, what can I do, because it happens quicky...with no essence at all (still about the opening scene).. It\'s completely different from what I expected regarding to this adaptation.Just like when I tried to open my eyes in my real life, and I found it was mediocre without any particular hue. Likewise, there is no differs with the results of this anime.I\'ll be honest, ""Leadale No Daichi Nite"" has a unique story and bear more deeper essences than what you\'ve witnessed. Seriously, I can guarantee it, because long before this story being adapted, I\'ve been read the LN version.Unfortunately, the studio didn\'t seem serious about working on this adaptation in favor of slightly increase a meaningful story, so they left so much ratios afterward. As a result, many of viewers probably miss or even not realize the true potential of the story concept behind it.----Characters Development, Plot & A little about Cayna (MC).---Cayna is a character who had tragic accident in her past\'s world.. as  consequences, she completely lost the opportunity to be able to control most of her physical limbs (paralyzed), not only that, her parents also deceased at the accident. This means that Cayna grew up as a child without a fraught happiness since the tragedy occured (lost of family grace). However, Cayna, in her current isekai\'s world,  she plays the role as a Mother of 3 children and several grandchildren whom she tries to love in earnest slowly.(I mean at this point, Cayna vaguely teaching the viewers the meaning of pouring out affection, even though that Cayna\'s self was never fully loved as a daughter because she lost of her parents too early. But Cayna indirectly implies to you, that she also learns many things through the love she gives as a mother from now on).""this is a compound advantage of Cayna\'s character that\'s totally unseen in this adaptation"".Instead of being a character who can convey it all, Cayna\'s character in the anime series described in more flat without the slightest struggle and clash of hearts complexcity where it needs to be presented. This is closely related to the plot of the story which got trimmed extremely, caused the displacement per scene that feels bland, or even rather to say it confusing. There\'s no resolution of any situations that she has completed, Cayna\'s journey as an adventurer means nothing to remember (too easy to forget) which also devoid of the tantalizing adrenaline rush.The adventures of Cayna was completely replaced by a trivial story of a cheerful girl with limited unnatural emotion that can\'t make you flutter when you watch it..I also ensure that it doesn\'t promise you anything, including the background art in every moment that looks so desert and lifeless. They didn\'t even have the slightest intention of producing art that gave support to the lightning plot they had corrupted. Also the CGI quality is ~~ blah blah~~, coupled with awkward and not optimal animation movements.The only thing that satisfies me is the art appearances of Cayna\'s character which kinda made me fall in love with her, SHE IS INDEED A GOOD WAIFUS, although that she actually more than this in her origin.There\'s no need to go in further detail about Cayna tbh, her warm touches, her acts in loving her children, also her noble character in thickness of the taste to return the favor to the people she deems meaningful was also completely erased.Again, Cayna already described as a character who looks clumsy and strange in changes of her behavior and emotions now. I cried for Cayna, it\'s too bad that many people will probably misunderstood and think of Cayna as a middling character from now on T__T.

As the show focuses a lot on Slice of Life, there\'s less need for complex animations. The spell effects are quite pretty though.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10...------------------------------------------Solid production values across the board. Nothing to complain about.Story - 6/10-------------There isn\'t much of a story. It\'s a mostly generic fantasy isekai featuring a video game world. The MC dies, gets sucked into a game they were crushing as an OP character, becomes that character and now they can pretty much do whatever they want as they explore the world in their new form.Once NPC characters are now normal beings and so the MC spends most of her time interacting with the various characters, including her NPC children, who are now regular people with their own personalities.There\'s no real overarching story to talk about, so an epic world of fantasy with great adventures this is not.The entire show is extremely wholesome, and you won\'t have to worry about much tragedy and stuff.Characters - 7/10---------------------A pretty likeable bunch. The MC is a capable woman who\'s also quite confident and intelligent. She fully understands her own overpowered status and will happily utilize her skills to get stuff done.The various characters she meets are all nice enough, and some even have a decent personality. But that\'s all there is really. A bunch of wholesome characters that will bring a smile to your face but won\'t really make you feel much beyond that.---Total - 7/10---This show reminds me of the early seasons of Slime with its wholesomeness. It\'s a very nice ""feel-good"" anime that isn\'t going to wow you with anything specific, but will likely put a smile on your face and help your relax after a hard day\'s work. ------------------------------------------Solid production values across the board.

It is not good by any stretch of imagination, and yet it isn\'t bad enough to laugh at either. Just a dry, stale and un-imaginative show.The show has a pretty generic description, but could still have had promise, if not for a few things:1. The MC is too op. There are many shows that can get away with OP MCs, but they always have to find a way to challenge that MC, or make them interesting, forcing them to find interesting,...cool or funny solutions to problems. Leadale don\'t do this. Instead this show just makes the MC the most OP thing in the whole world. Even ""event monsters"" that ""requires at least 400 players of over lvl 300"" get one shot by her. She takes no damage from enemy attacks, and she ""knows every existing skill"". All solutions in this show is just the MC dragging another OP spell out of her ass, which instantly solves any problem.2. The comedy. Shows with OP main characters usually have to find a way of making it fun to watch, coming with jokes and scenarios that become so ridiculous that the viewer have to laugh. In Leadale all the comedy is ""Caina is OP and scary. Now, Caina angry. Get ready for Caina ass-whooping everyone."" rinse and repeat. Not funny, not interesting.3. The Plot and Characters. A good plot is not strictly necessary in comedy, though it is often good. What\'s most important is the characters the plot revolves around. In Leadale it all falls flat. Basically all the character are one-sided and puddle-deep, with no other purpose than to be propped up saying ""see! character!"". None of the characters have any depth or story to them, not even the main character, and the story is non-existent outside of the premise of ""girl dies while playing. girl gets trapped in game. others in game. girl gives mana to tower guardians"". Nothing...When it comes to the sound and visuals, Leadale shows that it has some nice enough scenes, but many animations feel lazy, and the sound, though not bad, is just mediocre.Ultimately I cannot recommend Leadale No Daichi Nite.

Everything are different because its happened 200 or 300 years later, so Leadale now pretty much different than she knows. Idk probably the most fastest move on from ""depressed state"" in the anime for me. Cayna didnt see really care about how she died and how she end up hereOk les get into episode, at 1st - 6th episode (if im not wrong, episode...when she meets grand daughter of cayna) are the best episodes for me, then its become boring when some random penguin boss show up nowhere, also zombie village and also loli show up then Cayna like hey she is my daughter now. Everything were perfect till they fight penguin boss which basically turn like ""action but not action"".Ok final review lineStory : Its basically turn down really fast after 6th episode, its basically boring fest when she comeback to village where she wake up at first time. overall story was really slow life. I really surprised this anime doesnt have ""Slice of life"" genreArt : Its average probably 4/10, because yea its kinda bad, but also good for new studioSound : the theme is totally good opening song but idk about closing songCharacter : lack of motive, Cayna basically didnt know where to go, she decide go to tower where player leave it, then what?Enjoyment : pretty much enjoy, i watch episode 1 till 6 few times but i abandon after that, i just watch 1 timeOverall : i give it 7 as final score (from 9) despite closure kinda boring, so she journey around end up settle in that place? kinda off for me, she can do it in first placeDo you recommended anime? Yes i totally recommended if you are into slow life adventurer and op char, if you are not, i suggest dont watchDo you want season 2 for this anime?

We do have the context here of girl being on life-support before a power-outage somehow cut her free from her body but this first episode does little to make you care about her situation before she woke up inside the game so I’m just going to put that to the side for now.From the somewhat obnoxious sounding OP ‘Happy Encount’ right through to the lacklustre ED there really wasn’t anything in this first episode that in any way made me...curious about the story or the main character.The opening scene, pre-OP has the city going dark, presumably the black-out that cuts off her life support but it lasts seconds and we’re given no context for what caused it or the impact that will have on anyone because we’ve met no characters yet so by the time the OP has ended you’d be forgiven for forgetting the scene even happened. After the OP we get a standard anime girl wakes up sequence followed by her eating an enormous number of bowls of foA joke or character point they clearly thought was interesting enough to repeat mere minutes later when we skipped the whole day until dinner.Visually there’s nothing particularly striking here. The main character design is nice enough but so far every other character is your standard mob fantasy design and none of them have really stood out.As for the world-building, so far this world feels narrow and limited and very much empty of new ideas or even just good building on standard fantasy tropes. It isn’t that there’s anything wrong with this perfectly serviceable representation of a fantasy RPG setting, its just that we’ve seen more than enough of these now and there’s nothing in Leadale no Daichi nite’s portrayal that is going to leave a lasting impression. At least not from this first episode.I’ll admit, Cayna, our protagonist elf, is a nice enough character and she is at least asking questions about the world which I guess will eventually lead to something resembling a story but she’s not particularly interesting. Her reactions are the usual over-the-top anime girl gasps or shock and/or embarrassment and there’s really nothing in this first episode that makes her compelling to watch.Largely that would come down to knowing nothing about her prior to this situation and having no clarity about what this character wants.Leadale no Daichi nite might well be setting up a more slice of life story rather than an adventure/fantasy one in which case this one has been poorly tagged. But if it is supposed to be an adventure or fantasy then this first episode is clearly lacking as it gives us no clarity about our lead character or what sort or adventure the story has in store for us.By the time our main character one shot kicked a horned bear to death on the way home from her fully stocked tower I was more or less already checked out of this title. It just didn’t grab me and while I might pick it up in a few episodes if other reviewers indicate that it finds some direction for now I’m pretty happy to let Leadale no Daichi nite slide by because honestly there’s just not enough going on here. curious about the story or the main character.The opening scene, pre-OP has the city going dark, presumably the black-out that cuts off her life support but it lasts seconds and we’re given no context for what caused it or the impact that will have on anyone because we’ve met no characters yet so by the time the OP has ended you’d be forgiven for forgetting the scene even happened.

I was a bit off put at first because the animation resembles older styles and I don't usually go for those shows.

I've watched a lot of isekai and yes it's a typical start, but the way they are going about it is very refreshing. I like the whole children aspect.If you are looking for complex story with twists and turns, this isn't for you. It is rather predictable, but in a charming way....I have read some of the manga.

Even before her death Cayna\'s life had ended before it could begin which put her in a more unique position compared to other isekai protagonists or even compared to other ""Players"" that ended up in Leadale. Her ""reincarnation"" into Leadale allowed her to live a life she could not have dreamed possible back in the hospital bed where she was once imprisoned. But while Cayna seemed to have the life she never had the other characters weren\'t in those positions which raises...some big problems with the show as a whole.Leadale is a mediocre isekai fantasy. There is no denying that. But the problems with the show as a whole come from the distinct lack of direction for the plot.Why did the players get trapped in the bodies of their video game avatars?How did the players get sent to Leadale?What are they going to do about this?Where are they going to get answers to these questions?Who was responsible for this?The driving plot for Leadale is Cayna activating the Guardian Towers that have been abandoned after 200 years since Leadale the Game was shut down. Okay. Nothing too remarkable but it\'s a start. Its a goal for the main character. The problem is there is no reason why beyond Cayna is bored. Will activating the towers magically give us the answers to those questions of why and how all these people ended up trapped in Leadale. Can they use the towers to contact someone who can help them? We don\'t know. There are no answers or hints given at any point during the 12 episodes. But its okay because no one seems concerned.Aside from the lack of a concrete plot, the characters are what makes and breaks Leadale as a series. Cayna is a problem character. Hot and cold. Psychotic and motherly. She is constantly bouncing between two if not more personality traits like a game of ping pong. It seems that the author couldn\'t nail down a personality for her so instead borrowed the traits of other isekai protagonist from across various series instead of making one from scratch. Her chaotic personality theoretically should have been enduring or funny but is neither and instead comes off as deranged and broken.The side characters are where Leadale shines. Lovable and funny the NPC\'s are the heart of the show and the world of Leadale. The other player characters are more complicated. While they are far improvements from Cayna, they lack drive and agency. Not once did any of them seem concerned or question how or why they ended up on Leadale. Years of their lives lost in this other world that they randomly found themselves in and they seem fine with it. Acceptance is a worthwhile trait to have since dwelling on the past won\'t get them anywhere, but they act like they don\'t even care at all about what they lost. 2, 3, even 10 years they were trapped there without answers and those answers are what they and the audience deserve. Cayna shows up, who is probably the one person who could possibly have or be able to get answers or call for help, but the thought doesn\'t cross their minds to ask. This makes their characters incredibly shallow and no different from the NPCs. It\'s painfully frustrating to watch these characters ignore what happened to them and settle for a state of ignorance and basically ignore the problem. Having them question how they ended up in Leadale or how do they get back home, would give them more agency and significance as characters beyond just appearing and disappearing on and off. Expressing some thought or feeling about their situation no matter what it is would give them much needed depth. Happy, Sad, frustrated, content? This ties back to the lack of direction for the plot.All in all things in Leadale just kinda happen. There is no driving narrative, only this happens and its easy resolved so another thing happens. There is nothing really connecting the events together to create a cohesive narrative. Its all the whims and desires of the author without a plan. I think Leadale would improve far beyond mediocrity it did have a more driving force behind Cayna\'s actions like trying to get the other players back home or even finding answers. The show is like Cayna, constantly shifting between light and dark and just doing whatever it wants to because there is no one there to guide it.

If i were to review this from a technical perspective, the story is bland, the pacing is everywhere, the plot is confusing, there were literally zero character development that i felt, and the art is hard to get used to. Leadale no Daichi nite, is definitely what i wouldn\'t call a masterpiece.But through watching this...anime, i finally realised what most other Slow Life anime had lacked. It\'s the feeling of Slow Life itself. I know it\'s hard to understand but bear with me on this one.Watching the first episode of this anime felt bland, i thought i was going to drop this anime, but after i got used to the absurdities and the quirkiness of the author\'s storytelling style, i finally understood what the author was trying to present. ""A life without worries and consequences"" was what i felt from the anime.[CONTAINS probably LIGHT SPOILERS]From the first episode, we knew that Keina Kagami, or the more familiar Cayna, was once a child with a sickness that forces her to be bedridden for the rest of her life. Well, she got transferred into a VRMMORPG world where nothing could stand a chance in front of her gaze.For some authors, this might be a *bit* too powerful. Other writers might start writing a new powerful enemies that the land have never seen, or a group of demons that might propose a threat to Cayna\'s existence. But no, exactly no other beings can stand in front of the strongest gamer weeb that had put in over thousands of hours of grind into the game. For me, this is the first reason why Leadale felt like a true slow life anime. The [Nothing and no one can defeat me] is one thing that every isekai slow life content should have.I\'ll be quick in this section as it\'s a spoiler. I want to talk about the relationship between Cayna and people around her.After a few episodes in, we can see how much of a jerk Cayna is towards her family members, as well as her newly found friends. I really like this aspect a lot. As a human being, everything that we do has consequences. If we were to act like Cayna towards other real people, i would 100% guarantee that you\'ll be labelled as an excrement. But after seeing how unchanged other people\'s view towards our main character, it gave this sense of [Life without fear of consequences] and honestly, this is the reason why i like this anime so much.God i wish BBcode still works[SPOILER ENDS]Last but not least, as you\'re able to see from Cayna\'s character design, she is an elf. The anime doesn\'t specifically say this but after years of watching anime and watching that movie about melting a ring in a volcano, i think it\'s safe to say that elf general have a long lifespan. As mere mortals, death is something most of us are afraid of, i too suffer from occasional existential crisis. [Living without worrying of death] is something i really felt while watching this anime.I really hope that can summarize what i feel towards this anime. This isn\'t an epic journey about an isekaied character that went through hardships that later developed their personalities and eventually saving the world. This about enjoying what life had gave us. From the perspective of someone who was hospitalised for who knows how long, we can explore a new world, a peaceful one, that the author had crafted for us to enjoy.TL;DR: This anime isn\'t perfect, but it gave me feelings that I\'ve never seen in other Slow Life anime.

What has now kept me here is also largely the art. is modern, not too bubbly, and has interesting and unique elements. The series is done by Maho, a relatively new studio, who has done a really great job on the overall execution. Due to this alone I will see this series through completion.The storyline is too kawaii for being a Seinen. To me it reads like a Shojo because of the feminine focus, sweet sort of wholesomeness, and is sort of juvenile. I...couldn't find much about the author but I would be interested in their backstory to understand the headspace of the writing style.Personally I think the writing is underdeveloped and does not match up to the maturity that the stage sets or the audience type calls for. The isekai plot is interesting enough but nothing new. And the overpowered lead character basically makes for no real realistic adversary growth, along with having some weirdly written character flaws. It almost feels like watching a 16 yo girl's daydream about becoming a character she plays in an mmorpg (yes, I would consider myself a bit of an expert on this lol). Or maybe a man's take on what woman's life experience would be like.It will be interesting to track development from here but so far it is an enjoyable watch. couldn't find much about the author but I would be interested in their backstory to understand the headspace of the writing style.Personally I think the writing is underdeveloped and does not match up to the maturity that the stage sets or the audience type calls for.

There are many good examples of Slice of Life in anime being used to it's fullest to create something simple yet engaging and relatable, yet In The Land of Leadale, despite production value, fails to do any of this.The main genres listed for the show 'In The Land of Leadale' are adventure and fantasy, while these genres are apparent when watching, it's commonly debated that the show executes a strong sense...of Slice-of-Life as well, which I agree is the case. However this doesn't mean Leadale did this properly. The writer of Leadale, Ceez, has a very apparent history of writing just by watching this show, as his only published novel on any site I can find is Leadale. Probably the one of the worst case of beginners luck, having their first work praised and even adapted to an anime, to support this kind of writing, which lacks progression, and proper execution of genre; While I definitely agree action is NOT needed to create an engaging work, or even a Shounen, it doesn't mean you can't do a bad job at executing something that doesn't have action.

In addition, the amount of generic, disposable, isekai tropes used in this show are innumerable, only emphasizing the blandness of the show, things such as the main character spawning in with no prior development, with overpowered abilities, being extremely old but looking like a teenager, medieval RPG setting, magic magic, MP, more magic, monsters, players, game tropes, and more magic. I think the only good comment I can make out of this is that even if the writer tried to do something new with it, it wouldn't go well or combine well no matter what they did, as they already has a terrible story plot to begin with, no amount of world building or art can make up for a boring story.In conclusion, while I think Slice-of-Life as a genre has a lot of potential, and can definitely be engaging when executed correctly, like March Comes in like a Lion, or even mixed with action, Violet Evergarden, it is used to it's minimum in this show, and turns the Slice-of-Life genre into everything that the Slice-of-Life haters have come to know. of Slice-of-Life as well, which I agree is the case.

I'd equate it to a childish, ridiculous, attempt at Overlord: a person who stays connected to a full-dive...VR game after the servers have gone offline because reasons, find themselves inside the game, is hundreds of levels beyond anyone in the world, can do pretty much anything, has unlimited wealth and a stash of super advanced gear and items, but that's where the similarities end.In Overlord, the PC, his NPCs and the base are transported to the game world, but they're invaders that have to scout a familiar but unknown world and find their place in it, while also searching for other transported humans (if they even exist), and although they're super powerful, they need to avoid becoming targets as they're no match for the combined might of whole nations (if they were to unite).

I found it pleasantly surprising...that it actually had good comedic bits & timing. Even still, the comedy being under the pretense of it being an isekai world tends to lend itself to fall in too much into isekai comedy tropes too easily so even though the delivery is great, one might not like its trope-ish context.Overall, it does nothing groundbreaking or even different to most other standardized power fantasy isekai worlds.

The fact that the Cayna starts with an NPC family she has to reconnect to is a cool idea, even if those characters are very one-note....She also has to reconcile with the reality that the world she's in is no longer a game and things she does, including violence, has some very real consequences.

In the Land of Leadale starts out as a unique power fantasy for a gamer girl that suddenly gets transported inside her favorite game.

One being that the protagonist is a mother of three adopted children (from an in game event from her world). Now you’d assume once she recalls that she is a mother that above all...else, she would want to reunite with them asap. This is not the case however. It honestly seems she has no clear objective other than to get wasted and explore. Once that becomes clear, the show devolves into a confusing and unfunny mess.I would like to really hit home how flat Leadale’s jokes are. The protagonist is inherently boring and seems to be the most narcissistic of protagonists I’ve seen in awhile. This is where the “jokes” come in. The creators seem to think people like watching, what I would describe as, an ill tempered single mother do whatever she feels like doing with no repercussions.  This is clear with the lack of urgency in seeing her own kids, and instead chasing thrills around town or participating in random events.Another key characteristic of the lead is her mandatory freak out session per episode. It seems every member of her family has received her wrath for such minor offenses, and this makes up about 20% of the overall interactions. In one episode her son hears she has fallen I’ll, so he rushed to her side only to get punched into the ceiling. Another is when her son and daughter are arguing and use magic to fight with one another. This leads to her threatening them with her immense and unoriginal abilities. Oh the protagonist is the most powerful person anyone’s ever seen?! Wow that’s never occurred in literally every isekai ever.Sure enough, the next episode has the lead…once again…getting mad and oozing her overwhelming power because her daughter never told her that she had a grandchild. On top of this, her grandson has the nerve to offer her a nicer place to stay and ends up insulting…INNS!! How dare he insult inns! First time meeting her lineage and just gets mad. This is the shows attempt at humor and it just fails.The protagonist here is one of the worst I’ve seen in awhile. Shes eerily similar to the “300 years killing slimes” girl…equally as powerful after being isekai’d to a new world to participate in a slice of life “comedy”. At least in Leadale there is an active male population, unlike the 300 years slums,  but they are made to look like weak jokes, so it’s almost like they only exist to be mocked. The Jain character has no personality and is incredibly fickle/bipolar. One moment she’s kind, then the next behaves like a spoiled gangster child, threatening anyone that says or does even the slightest wrong thing in her eyes.I dropped this series and suggest you never start. It’s incredibly frustrating and boring, as well as unoriginal. Yes the main character starts out pleasant and the world is somewhat of a mystery with certain revelations. Ultimately however, it becomes a 3 episode concept stretched and repeated to make 12 episodes. Some characters are interesting but the protagonist is so lame and annoying, she brings down the potential for anyone in her vicinity. Now, as I mentioned earlier, there is some intrigue in the pilot, but trust that it only goes down from there.

If you\'re looking for a more in-depth or narrative anime, this is not going to fit that bill. You\'d be better off searching for something else.I think if you enjoy anime such as ""I\'ve Been Killing...Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level"" and ""Life With an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated Into a Total Fantasy Knockout"" you\'ll enjoy this too!

I feel like watching a hanime with fantasy genre with that kind of art. I expected a bit of ""something"" but I\'m disappointed.

In any other anime ever created, even if it starts slow, there\'s bound to be something big coming up. Even if it starts with the MC steamrolling all obstacles, there will eventually come a fight or a challenge that looks perilous.There\'s nothing like that here. The MC simply travels around, gets drunk, kicks ass, gets rewarded, rinse repeat. No challenge anywhere, no real danger anywhere, nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat. It\'s like watching the first and last 5 minutes of every rom com out there - first...5 minutes are before anything interesting happens, last 5 minutes are essentially ""happily ever after"".

I am a bit speechless because of how happy this show made me feel. I was either laughing or surprisingly enjoying the exposition. It\'s been awhile since I\'ve watched a decent Isekai, and this one has to be among my top Isekai on the account of how wholesome and funny it is. Guess I can relate because I\'m a family person, but ultimately This show is great. I can\'t really name off any discrepancies that could make this show bad. I guess if you\'re not into certain types of comedy, then maybe...that\'d bore you easily.Regardless, I highly recommend this show.

Initially, from the PVs and synopsis, I was slightly interested in this. This turned out to be quite a slow pace, kind of isekai slice of life. It is something you would watch to kind of unwind.The TL;DR: Basically, don't expect top tier story telling, art, or character development. Simply watch it for enjoyment.Story (6): The synopsis on the main entry page explains it all. Essentially, the story follows Cayna and her adventures around the world of Leadale. As mentioned, this is quite a laid-back anime that you...would watch after a long day. Heck, you might even fall asleep to it. It's not boring, but simply slow (and it is by design).Art (7): I quite like some of the characters' expressions. The art is decent and there are no visible production quality drops.Sound (8): I rate this on the basis of OST, OP, ED, and voice acting. All decent and fits the theme of the anime well.Character (6): No characters feel out of place, and has okay character background.Overall, I enjoyed watching this weekly.

There isn’t one original thought in it. If I told You to imagine a fantasy world You would probably think of 99% of things that You find here. Demi-humans? Check. Green plains? Check. Medieval style architecture? Check. Magic? Check. Seriously the world is so bland it makes Baldur’s Gate feel fresh.In this bland cutout of a world we follow a cardboard cutout of an OP main heroine on her… quest (?) to experience the...world, awaken towers (why? I have no idea it never is addressed) and once in a while be a nuisance for her kids.Our MC is Cayna - a blue eyed, blond haired (Adolf would be proud), overpowered to oblivion, dead girl turned high elf. Yes. It’s as dumb as You think. While being hospitalised, and plugged into life support in our world, she’s a full time player in a VRMMORPG (Yes… basically Yuuki Konno from Sword Art Online), she dies during a power outage and wakes up in the world of the game she played (but 200 years in the future from what she knew). Talk about a ghost in the machine. She’s kind, helpful, overpowered and has anger issues. To be fair, the anger issues make her interesting. Repetitive but interesting and it can be funny. She has 3 children who she cares about and has a thing to instigate fear in them. Pretty funny thing.The rest of the cast doesn’t really matter. Despite being her children, they are treated 90% of the time like background NPC. She talks to them about non essential stuff, gets angry, leaves and rarely speaks of them. Mother of the year. The only interesting (and I use this term loosely) aspect of the supporting cast is that some of them are isekaied players like her. Unlike her, there doesn’t seem to be anyone else who died to get here.The plot itself is just terrible. It seems like the writers didn’t know what kind of show they wanted to make. It’s not an action show, the action sequences are short, badly written and choreographed and are mostly boring. I guess You could call it a fantasy, slice of life comedy but towards the end You get slapped in the face with a heavy handed childcare theme that’s so bad that even the later parts of “Usagi drop” manga seems better… somehow.In the beginning Cayna seems to have a goal - Reawaken the towers. Yes, it’s dumb, not explained properly and the towers themselves don’t have much screen time so we don’t even know what their purpose is. It is hinted that they are challenges for adventurers to overcome to get new skills but it’s never stated properly.The most enjoyable thing in the show are the interactions between Cayna and her family. This alone could carry the whole show. But instead of showing how their children grew up during the changing of the world, without a mother for 200 years and how Cayna deals with them and the world, we just get some glorified NPC dialogue that mostly does nothing. It’s such a wasted potential it actually irritates me. There was a chance to show a different side of the isekai genre and have a strong family oriented theme but instead we got a cheap SAO knockoff.Usually I try to find good things in any show I watch. This time it’s hard. Really hard. The jumping from the themes, the lazy comedy, the lazy MC and plot so bland You won’t even remember it at the end kills my good will.

This anime was ok, it was a chill watch which I like. I felt it should have had a Slice of Life tag because that's the type of anime it felt like. It's fantasy orientated and has very little action with some decent comedic moments. Review Time!Story: 6.5/10 - as I stated, this is an Isekai Fantasy anime with Comedy and Slice of Life undertones. The MC was an unnamed girl that had lived in the hospital unable to leave her bed her whole life because she was attached to life support machines. She used...VR games to escape her hospital bed and her favorite game was Leadale. One night, a mass power outage hits the hospital and the MC died while sleeping hooked up to her VR machine. When she woke up she had been reincarnated as her character named Cayna who was a High Elf. After she gets used to her new surroundings she sets off to find the NPCs she created as her children and becomes an adventurer in the process. I thought the story was not bad and it was very easy to follow. It has elements of a few genres so I'm sure a lot of people can find something they enjoy about it. My favorite thing was how chill the story was and it could be watched to wind down, and there were some pretty funny moments.Art: 7.5/10 - the animation was actually very good. I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The backgrounds and towns were well drawn and didn't look blurry or rushed which I like. For me, if a background is blurry or doesn't look as good as the characters it throws me off and takes away from the experience. Maybe that's just something I prefer lol.Sound: 7/10 - the sound in anime was done well, the SFX were decent and were placed in the proper place. The SFX also helped in some of the funnier moments and didn't sound out of place for the moment. The OP and ED soundtracks weren't really my favorite to be honest. If an OP or ED doesn't bother me to watch or make me just want to skip it, then I think it was good. This OP and ED I just listened to for the review and skipped it every other episode.Characters: 7.5/10 - the characters were well done and the voice acting was pretty good for both sub and dub versions. The funniest character was Skargo in my opinion lol. He was just so over the top and ridiculous that it was funny pretty much everytime he's on screen. All the characters were well designed and we'll drawn too and we got to see the MC change clothes which doesn't happen very often lol. The voice acting was really good too and I thought they helped make the characters likable.Enjoyment: 7/10 - I found this anime enjoyable and I liked the fact that it seemed almost like a Slice of Life anime, which I like. I really liked the comedic moments and that it wasn't a serious story. I'm not sure if it will get a 2nd season but if it did, I would definitely watch it.Overall: 7/10 - it was a good 12 episode anime that wasn't serious and didn't really need a lot of brain power to watch it and more importantly, actually enjoy it. I don't think every anime needs to have to have a crazy fight scene or a complicated storyline to be enjoyed considering this anime has very little action sequences plus a fairly uncomplicated storyline and in my opinion, it's still enjoyable. I'm sure that most anime fans would enjoy something about this anime and if you know your own taste then I'm sure you know whether or not this anime is something you would enjoy.

I don't mind it, just kind of want more of this anime other than just a slice of life. It got interesting in the middle but just became wholesome in the end. Again I don't mind it but it kinda made me bored. I kinda of wanted drama or something a bit more climatic or that just me.. This show is built on its wholesomeness and heart warming charm. It makes you smile from the sweet character interactions and light humor.

Canya herself is very upbeat and charming and the rest of the cast can range from adorable to wacky. Admittedly, there are some characters who did get a bit on my nerves like Skargo, Canya’s “son”, but these characters are few so it’s not a deal breaker.I really like that there’s no demon lord threat to the land that needs addressing or any other doomsday situation that needs to be taken care off. Canya has to make her own journey to find meaning in the world which takes her to some interesting places and it’s fun to just watch her.If you’re looking for intense, fantasy combat and action then you’re watching the wrong anime. Canya is so overpowered that she can literally blow up a city with a snap of her fingers so fights don’t last long when she is involved. Its not that kind of anime anyway.I do have some problems with the show. Although the anime is very cute and it did make say “Aww” a couple of times, the animation is… not so cute. Especially the CG which looks like it was ripped from Arifureta season 2. Also, as much as I like Canya I do think her morals are a little odd. Without spoiling too much, she somewhat forcible adopts a small orphan girl towards the end of the season for reasons. She summons cat servants to look after her, but expects the girl to just accept her as her mother without any real time for the girl to adjust. This maybe because the final couple episodes pacing moves too quickly to try and cram in a light novels worth of content, but is makes Canya come off as a bit of a psychopath without the anyone around her to challenge her “parenting” methods.In the Land of Leadale has some rough edges that need ironing out and it might not be an anime for everyone.

As a lighthearted, feel good series, it performs this excellently and is probably one of the best in class for that. The characters, like most SOL, are the real highlight here. All of them are very fun and full of personality and life. Also one of the very few anime that (to me) performs the over expressive/over exaggerated tone masterfully.

A mix of generic isekai but with just a bunch more goodness.perfect to binge if you have an exam the following day but don\'t care for sleep.sounds, anime. very nice. a bit of cgi which can be unpleasant but not in a dose that impedes enjoyment. You have a whole lot of positivity and a quest which is not hard to follow. The only downside...would be a small clank in the pacing. it isn\'t bad but it can be a bit jumpy. Not in a displeasing way.My first impressions of this series were or an mc that is a mix between kirito and Ruphas Mafahl but without the hacking and she only has a quarter of the psychological problems Ruphas has. Meaning that there is a bit of domestic violence; all in all very funny though. It makes it seem that the mc isnt actually flat like many others can be. This anger adds a nice slapstick atmosphere that is almost endearing. Refreshing!while the overall start may be a bit generic, the matter of premises is sort of like Yasei no Last Boss ga Arawareta!: Kokuyoku no Haou but instead of searching people, it\'s towers... strange but not in an annoying way.Overall, i\'d qualify this anime as the relaxing type. it makes you want to binge it, its not annyoing but it isn\'t so gripping that you are eating at your nails while at your edge of your seat.In conclusion, if you\'re looking for a nice time this is the show for you.Lust - strong 6.9/10 would be a small clank in the pacing. it isn\'t bad but it can be a bit jumpy.

Spoiler alert for the ending, but really it\'s not much of a spoiler since the plot doesn\'t really mean anything.While the show description promises some level of tragedy, that is not the case whatsoever with this series, it is a 100% comedy slow life isekai.  It\'s a comfy, familiar and gentle slice of life series with almost no drama.  Most of the time, it\'s an easy watch and episodes are a breeze.  The characters are all...very likeable and it\'s fun to just watch them do things.Unfortunately, that is also the weak point of the series: it\'s just the characters doing things.  It is completely aimless and lacks any sort of connective tissue or purpose to any of the events.  Main protagonist Cayna is dropped into the world of Leadale with no goal or enemy to defeat, and she starts off by venturing out to the towers of the other Skill Masters, other high level players of the Leadale video game. And then... she just finds them empty and goes off to do other things instead of attempting to unravel the mystery of Leadale and why she\'s there or why it\'s 200 years in the future.  She meets some people, and clears out a bandit camp, and then eventually adopts a young orphan girl and settles down in a small village, and that\'s the whole story.  It\'s hard to describe unless you see it, but there is just no *point* to any of this, even for a slice of life series.My only other complaint is that Cayna is a bit of a psycho and her characterization is inconsistent to say the least.  She just goes off on people and uses her overwhelming power mostly to bully people that annoy her (including, or really especially, her children), but then she will be portrayed as saintly and kind in the very next scene.  Her personality is all over the map from scene to scene and she can really come across as an asshole sometimes.Overall, if the lack of direction or story doesn\'t bother you that much, you will definitely enjoy it, because aside from that, it was mostly just a fun little comedy that I enjoyed watching every week.

While the animation may be choppy, the characters are fun and endearing, and I like them alot. Be prepared for a ton of comedy, and a good portion of it is actually funny.The only complaint I have so far has to do with the premise. In a world where most isekai protagonists die to Truck-kun, having one die from an illness is a novel concept used too...little, and could have opened the door to numerous possibilities and lots of character development.

After the initial ""why can I move my body?"" line this is never brought up again. Ever. You\'d think a paraplegic would have trouble moving smoothly, or marvel at the touch of everything, but no.

We follow a main character that was one of the biggest neets, meet her absurd NPC children, and watch her nonchalantly break the world\'s ""common sense"". Theres no continuous plot except for one use jokes, only a few plot devices return only...to be the ""nuisance of the week"".The art leaves nothing to be desired, nothing really stands out or sticks to the memory, their outfits and equipment are standard RPG clothes based on their jobs/classes, and the background is also standard grassy plains and capital city vibe. While background is not badly drawn, the animation of the characters feel below average standard of today\'s animes.The characters feel bland and uninspired, just over inflated to make certain jokes land, but they get tiring after some time and it is clearly shown. A large majority of the show is done monologuing with action and adventure scenes few and far between. I dont feel like I can connect or relate to any of the characters as well, maybe except the lizardman player.While I dont know the source material, I can say that this anime is not something I enjoy. There are other isekais that achieve better standards by telling and presenting a better packaged series. This adventure did not feel adventurous, the comedy feels very shallow, there is no development that I can feel, and the designs didnt stick in my memory. While I am not a fan of isekais as a genre, there are much better isekai animes out there, such as the couple isekai (Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan to) that came together this season. to be the ""nuisance of the week"".The art leaves nothing to be desired, nothing really stands out or sticks to the memory, their outfits and equipment are standard RPG clothes based on their jobs/classes, and the background is also standard grassy plains and capital city vibe. While background is not badly drawn, the animation of the characters feel below average standard of today\'s animes.The characters feel bland and uninspired, just over inflated to make certain jokes land, but they get tiring after some time and it is clearly shown. A large majority of the show is done monologuing with action and adventure scenes few and far between. I dont feel like I can connect or relate to any of the characters as well, maybe except the lizardman player.While I dont know the source material, I can say that this anime is not something I enjoy.

After her death, she is reborn as her character from the game in the world of Leadale, but not everything is as she remembers. Anime is one of many, and it didn't seem to be anything special.However, isekai is worth watching. Isekai has a quiet and enjoyable story, where we follow the fate of the heroine who travels around the world aimlessly at first. During her journey, many shorter and longer threads are intertwined, waiting to be resolved. The whole thing is presented in a relaxing way, but it arouses...interest.My favourite part of the anime was the interaction between the main character's family. There was an option to create an NPC in the game and Cayna accompanied three children who had grown up now and had their own lives. Conversations between the family were mostly comedy scenes, but sometimes serious. The little fairy, developing her personality by imitating the heroine, warmed the heart. And getting on the grandchildren stage was a beautiful way for your daughter to play back against her mother - even though it was not meant to be.Secondary characters are also not omitted. In Leadale, the action is not only focused on the main character but also on other heroes who show that they are strong and worthy of attention.In my opinion, Leadale was a good anime where you could relax and follow the actions of the characters with pleasure. Anime does not have the force of accelerated attention, only heart-warming stories presented at their own pace. interest.My favourite part of the anime was the interaction between the main character's family.

Anything else is hard to justify. But even that it fails to do. It was never funny. I can't believe that whoever wrote this finds humor in having parents abuse their kids who adore them.

Mitsume ga Tooru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5249/Mitsume_ga_Tooru,"['Story:The story is blatantly boring in the beginning.  At first it is slow. It constantly gives you side stories, but somewhere along the middle, the story takes a much more rapid pace and starts packing more action into every episode.  The finale for this show is really a spectacle and a fitting end to the series.  While I would ask for more from this series, Tezuka Osamu is no longer with us and I do not believe there could be a better ending to this show.EDIT 2019: I found this portion I wrote years ago lacking so I\'m here to add more...to it.The show starts off episodically featuring the many separate incidents involving Sharaku.  After 20 episodes or so the show begins to add backstory to Sharaku\'s mysterious background as well as reveal a darker side to the story.  As I had mentioned before, the ending is quite fitting.  Like Tezuka Osamu\'s Pheonix, it presents a potential questions and problems we may come across in a distant future.Art:Like many of Tezuka Osamu\'s creations, it has a unique art style compared to other animes.  It leans towards a Disney art style compared to your standard anime art style.  The background art is fine. Nothing stands out much, which is good or else it wouldn\'t be called a background.  The ancient statues and temples are based on actual ruins.Sound:The OST is unique. I mean you don\'t here ""sha-la-la"" and ""rune-rune-rune"" in any other anime OSTs.Unlike the unique opening, the music can be rather peaceful and sometimes ominous.Characters:The main character Sharaku. Is first shown to be super childish and mentally slow.  His character design really shows off his dopiness and his stupidity.  His other personalty is the exact opposite of him. He is shown to be super clever and a genius.  Just imagine hot pink next to dark purple.Wato is a decent foil to Sharaku.  She constantly protects slow Sharaku, but is always toyed by genius Sharaku.Enjoyment:This show is truly underrated.  It\'s current mediocre score here on this site does not reflect just how endearing this show can be.  Yes the animation is somewhat crude and it might look look slightly weird at first, but I really did enjoy the show the more I invested my time into it.

While I\'m not one for mech anime, Ninja Senshi Tobikage or Ninja Robots as it was called when broadcasted in India grabbed the attention of my 13 yr old self simply with the word ""Ninja"" in it.At a time when the Mech anime genre was recognized by the likes of Gundam and Voltron (in India), Ninja Robots provided action/adventure enthusiasts like me to enjoy the best of both Ninja as well as Mech elements.The story is...rather simple as is the character development. You have your typical love triangle going, along with the jealous admirer turned villain and the younger brother who is mostly an idiot but is much wiser than what his older brother gives him credit for. Add in a maniac with his own evil mech army out to conquer the known universe and you\'ve got the story down pat.As with most anime viewers that age, we aren\'t really concerned with the story, all we want is the action and this show has plenty of it. The animation and art are very good and are complimented well by the background score. The Robots in question and their transformations are done well, but some robots got more air time than others which was a bit of a downer.The highlight of the show is the rivalry between Joe Maya and Commander Icelander and their respective mechs Cybertron and Mantis. The battles between these two are well executed and you really get a feel for the Ninja battle.

"", ""I love both the manga and the anime for Paripi Koumei, but this was... not good imo.I understand that cuts and changes have to be made to fit a 12-episode show into a 2-hour runtime, but some of the cuts are nonsensical. I mean both that they left things that are just filler for the scene, but then either condense entire episodes into a 10-sec montage (and then STILL leave out scenes! the entierty of Kongming+Owner talking to Jet Jacket from episode 3 is just... gone. not even really touched upon in the short montage), or cut it entirely. Not only that, I also mean...it literally. Ther were several places where they edited the shot in ways that don't make sense, like cutting from Koumei making one expressions, doing a very badly cut to what's clearly a different scene, and then show him making another expression.They removed a lot of things that add depth to all the characters, or gloss over them in a way that it just feels rushed.So yeah... I can't recommend it.

Porphy no Nagai Tabi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3424/Porphy_no_Nagai_Tabi,"['I feel bad for the people who watched Porfy no Nagai Tabi while it was airing. Because so few people were watching it to begin with, there was no one interested in subbing it; in fact, the entire show (52 episodes) had already aired before a fansub group finally began to work on it. This led to the show being largely ignored during its runtime, which is unfortunate because it\'s a good series despite its unpopularity.Released in 2008, Porfy no Nagai Tabi is one of the most recent World Masterpiece Theater releases. It\'s directed by Tomomi Mochizuki, who has recently garnered infamy for having directed...the anime adaptation of Pupa. Don\'t let this discourage you though; most directors have a blunder or two, some worse than others. Mochizuki deserves to be better known for series such as Saraiya Goyou, Zettai Shounen, and, of course, Porfy no Nagai Tabi.This show has an interesting arc-based structure. The first 10 or so episodes detail the simple life of Porfy, Mina, and their parents in a small village in Greece. It\'s all very mundane, but there\'s this charm to the main characters that makes you want to keep watching. Porfy is a good-natured but sometimes rash 14 year-old boy with an almost obsessive interest in automobiles. Mina, his younger sister, balances this out with her sweetness and innocence. Together, they go to school and play with friends while the family works toward building a service station at their home. It\'s a happy time for them, but not for long.After a certain event occurs, the series is then divided into several distinct arcs. A few episodes are devoted to the aftermath of the event; then, when Mina eventually goes missing, the main storyline of the show begins. The bulk of the story involves Porfy traveling to different locations across Europe to search for his sister, experiencing new things and meeting people with good intentions as well as those with more questionable motives. This traveling arc comprises two halves: the first half is a series of mini-arcs that are each about three to four episodes in length. Each mini-arc is about Porfy\'s interactions with the people he meets and how he lends a helping hand to solve their problems.The second half changes this up a bit; it\'s composed of episodic stories that are more ""standalone"" in nature. For example, one episode is about Porfy staying in a town with very strange customs. Another episode simply shows Porfy walking through the countryside with nothing significant occurring aside from a couple of brief interactions with passersby. I guess that\'s realism for you!The show isn\'t all about Porfy though. We also get glimpses of Mina\'s new life after she\'s taken in by a traveling gypsy woman and her family. In fact, the last ten or so episodes are primarily focused on Mina as she experiences an unexpected but fortunate turn of events in Paris. The purpose of this last arc is to build everything up to a finale — a satisfying one for sure, but unfortunately the show ends right at the climactic scene (it even plays in slow motion through the credits), which leaves the viewer craving for an epilogue of sorts to tie up all the loose ends.A series about traveling isn\'t complete without pretty scenery, and Porfy no Nagai Tabi doesn\'t disappoint. The background art in this show is gorgeous; both landscapes and cities are drawn with stunning detail, and what\'s more impressive is that the show maintains the quality of the art through all 52 episodes. On the other hand, the character designs are somewhat simple with no shading, so the contrast between the two may be a little jarring at first.The soundtrack is appropriately mood-enhancing; that\'s all I really have to say about it. Something interesting I noticed was that the overall sound of the music changed to suit each new city or location that Porfy visited. For example, the tracks that play during the slice of life arc in Greece consist mainly of soft piano and violin; however, in Paris, the accordion and synthesizers are introduced, which I thought was a nice touch.In short, Porfy no Nagai Tabi is a story about friendship, new experiences, loneliness, loss, and, most of all, growing up. Many viewers will probably dismiss it as boring, especially since it\'s 52 episodes long, but if you like these types of stories then you\'ll definitely want to experience this journey with Porfy and Mina. the anime adaptation of Pupa.

The anime continuously hints at darker things going on behind the scenes yet these are only subtle hints that have no importance in the story whatsoever and as we watch Porphy and Mina start to shift and change as they grow, we see a little more of these come to light. More complex emotions...are shown (although they\'re still not that complex) as Porphy begins to mature and come into contact with more people who are reluctant to take pity on him.Story 6/10 - The story is very slow paced and is definitely not for everyone. I found the story intriguing and it definitely keeps you watching since there is no way predicting what\'s going to happen next but if you\'re watching for the story alone, you\'ll quickly grow impatient. It\'s the characters, their journeys and appreciating the art and sound that will make you love this anime.Art 7/10 - If you only look at the landscapes and pretend you can\'t see the characters (LOL) you\'ll be left thinking the anime was pretty beautiful but then you see the characters and they look like they\'ve been drawn on classic paint. No, all jokes aside, I really did enjoy the art, the landscapes were beautiful and the contrast between the characters and the background (such a big contrast) was actually quite refreshing.Sound 7/10 - The sound really, really grew on me. Again, it\'s really not for everyone. Super slow (I found it calming) with piano. The music is actually hard to describe but it\'s well picked and really does suit the feel of the anime.Character 8/10 - If you don\'t get emotionally attached to characters easily then you probably won\'t care much for the characters in Porphy no Nagai Tabi. I enjoyed watching them slowly grow. Going through their journey with them and coming across different people who all treated them differently was really, really enjoyable. There was much more to each character than was actually shown and this was done pretty well since the more Porphy matured, the more insight he had and thus the more you were able to see about each character.(skipping enjoyment because i cba)Overall 7/10 -  Even though, I got pretty impatient towards the end, I still thoroughly enjoyed it.

Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30307/Monster_Musume_no_Iru_Nichijou,"['Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a highly perverted ecchi harem anime. If you don\'t like that kind of thing, you might as well stop reading right now because this show is not for you.That being said, Monster Musume is *not* a generic anime however. Rather it has a quite fresh take on the genre with a very unorthodox character cast which indirectly makes the ecchi elements very unique. It\'s very creative for a fanservice anime, and thus manages to stand out from the crowd quite a lot. As a result, Monster Musume is one of the more noteworthy series in the ecchi harem genre.First...of all though, I\'d like to make a general statement here. Given how many complaints you see about how many bad ecchi harems there are nowadays, have you ever stopped to ask yourself what exactly it is that makes a fanservice-oriented ecchi harem *good* then? Of course this is an entirely subjective question, but personally I can think of a number of things as signs of one. I\'m going to go through them one by one and then compare Monster Musume\'s performance to those standards, and in that way analyze the contents of the anime.1. A good ecchi harem should not have any sort of cheap excuse story. Such a plotline is only going to suck anyway so don\'t even try.Monster Musume\'s premise is rather simple. Due to a new law, various kinds of monster girls have been allowed to move to human countries as long as they are taken care of by a human host. This is in order to see if different species are capable of living alongside one another in the future or not. And thus the story is about an ordinary guy who gets tasked with taking care of a bunch of sexy monster girls of various species by cohabitating with them. Unfortunately for him, it\'s still highly illegal for humans and monster girls to mate with each other, and thus he has to muster up all the mental strength he has in order to resist the girls\' rather forceful attempts at seducing him.And that\'s about all there is to it. No complicated overarching story, no ""dark past"", no stupid out-of-place action scenes or anything along those lines. Just plain and simple lewdness in a comedic setting. That\'s all it is, and that\'s all it needs to be. If you watch an anime for the sake of ecchi... well then you don\'t need much more than ecchi as long as it is executed properly.2. A good ecchi harem requires some sort of originality. There needs to be something to make the anime stand out, otherwise it will only come across as generic and repetitive.Monster Musume\'s heroines are very unique, for obvious reasons. We have a lamia, a harpy, a centaur, and tons of other species making up the female cast of this show. While this is unusual in and of itself, it also provides an almost infinite possibility for creative fanservice. Since different characters have completely different body parts, physical abilities, reproductive functions, and views on common sense, we end up with a show which has sexual content that I can guarantee that you\'ve never seen before in an ecchi anime.3. A good ecchi harem should have a respectable male lead. We don\'t want an annoying pervert, a spineless coward or a rapist feeling up the girls exactly.The protagonist of Monster Musume is called Kurusu Kimihito, and while there\'s nothing remarkable about him, I still consider him to be a pretty good harem protagonist. To start with, he is reasonably mature, and manages to keep up with all the girls advances fairly well... as long as he\'s physically capable of resisting them that is. He\'s also got a rather admirable personality and simply feels like a good guy all-round.4. A good ecchi harem benefits greatly from having well-written and likeable heroines. You\'re going to be way more interested in seeing a girl you really like strip for you than a girl you couldn\'t care less about do the same.Here I think a distinction needs to be made: I already clarified that the heroines of this anime are very creative and unorthodox. However that is solely because of their physical appearances and the high potential for fanservice which comes along with that fact. But that is also the only thing which makes them special. As far as personality, character development and simple likability goes... they really don\'t have that much despite everything. Of course you might argue that an ecchi anime doesn\'t need those elements, but I\'d like to disagree. Would you feel exactly the same if your girlfriend did lewd things to you as you would if your girlfriend\'s identical twin sister did the same? I\'m going to say no. I think that if you like someone on an emotional level then whatever erotic things that person does would come off as way sexier. And for the same reason, despite their interesting physique, the girls of Monster Musume fail to establish any deeper connection with the viewers, and thus are unable to live up to their full potential in terms of eroticism.5. A good ecchi harem must absolutely have good art and character designs: When your goal is to make the heroines appear sexy, they should obviously look good as well.Monster Musume\'s art looks fantastic however, so there is no need to worry about that. While it looked good in the manga, I think it looks even better in the anime due to the crisp and vibrant colors. Everything looks incredibly clean and detailed, and consequently all the girls also look amazing.6. A good ecchi harem should have intense enough ecchi elements to actually be hot, at least if it\'s a fanservice-oriented one such as this. Just some minor teasing every here and there just doesn\'t cut it, it\'s too softcore.This category is rather hard to properly analyze as of yet in Monster Musume\'s case, because unsurprisingly the TV-airing of this anime is censored. As usual, you\'ll have to wait for the BDs to see this anime in all its naked glory. Though I have to say that the censorship in Monster Musume is very tastefully done compared to what I\'m used to seeing. There are almost no light rays, steam/smoke or weird graphics blocking up the screen in this anime. Instead they resort to having nipples just barely blocked from the camera by having objects in the way, or zooming in the camera in order to leave the NSFW elements just barely outside the edge of the screen. These actions can then simply be reverted on the BDs. As a result, the censorship doesn\'t really distract you when watching the show, which is something I appreciate very much.Censorship aside, Monster Musume has a lot of quite high quality lewdness. Although I doubt I\'d use it as fap material exactly, I\'ve definitely gotten some hard-ons while watching this show, and I think that speaks for itself pretty well.7.  A good ecchi harem should also have sexual content with appropriate timing. Don\'t throw in random panty shots when it doesn\'t make sense or the mood just isn\'t there; the story should support the fanservice, not the other way around.Given that the girls\' relentless sexual assaults on the protagonist is one of the core elements of the entire story, the ecchi segments are most certainly justified and believable for what they are. Of course some scenes might be a bit more far-fetched than others, but they never feel poorly timed or distracting from any other aspect of the show.So if you put all that together, I think Monster Musume passes every single category except for #4 (#6 can\'t really be judged properly yet though). And that is the only reason I\'m not giving this a higher overall rating than I am. I think what Monster Musume really needed to have in it is a girl like let\'s say Momo from To LOVE-Ru Darkness whom in addition to being sexy also has an enormous impact on the entire story as a whole and makes every moment more interesting. But it doesn\'t, and as a result Monster Musume eventually starts feeling somewhat repetitive. It basically runs on a ""girl of the week"" type formula where new monster girls keep being introduced to the cast and their unique ecchi potential is investigated. But once that is done... well then the characters don\'t really feel very interesting anymore because again, they don\'t really have anything going for them beyond their physical characteristics, and thus many of them are just tossed aside afterwards. And because of that I feel like the show lacks longevity.However that being said, this is only a 12-episode anime, and it still certainly manages to keep you interested for that long at least. If it had been like 50 episodes long then it would probably have been a lot less impressive as a whole, but for what we\'ve gotten thus far I don\'t have very much to complain about overall. Monster Musume is one of sadly few ecchi harem series which actually tries to think outside the box and deliver a fresh viewpoint on the genre as a whole. It\'s both fun and exciting to watch, and almost never fails to make you smile when watching it. And really... I don\'t think you can ask for a whole lot more than that from an ecchi harem anime. of all though, I\'d like to make a general statement here.

But wow how positively surprised I was, as this was actually unbelievably funny and i hadn't had such a good laugh for ages.The story is quite simple, there is a new program implemented  that allows fantasy beings to come to our world as some sort of exchange students. Our main character agrees to take in Mia, a lamia, that means she is half human half snake. She immediately falls in...love with him but the problem is that sexual relationships between humans and monsters are forbidden. Then slowly he gets to care for many more beautiful monsters that fight over him. Anyway the story is nighter original nor particularly interesting, but the comedy is done so well that it is easy to ignore the lack of a good story. The ending episode was in my opinion a bit weak as there was no meaningful conclusion, but at the same time that hints towards a second season, which I am looking forward to.The character are great, our main character is this average Joe, a bit dense but he has a very good heart. He wants to help his guests in any way he can and is also one of the only people in the show that sees them as normal people and not as monsters. His guests are all great, everyone is not only a great deal of fun, but they all have distinct personalities that make for some great interactions. There is only one other important character in the anime and that is agent Smith. She is the cultural exchange coordinator that is responsible for our main character getting all these girls and also for keeping an eye on him. She is shown as very manipulative and is always in control of the situation, whatever it may be.The visuals are great, the girl, look distinctive and very cute, even if some of their body proportions are a bit exaggerated and some of the fan service does cross the line of good taste a few times. The backdrops are detailed and the animation is silky smooth. As the show contains nudity I have to say the censored version I saw was censored so well I would not have noticed it, had I not read about it somewhere. There are a few fabulously funny effects that fit in perfectly. I especially liked our main characters eyes that appear completely white or most of the time and that gives him a distinct clueless look the fits in perfectly with the anime, but when serious moments arise he gets his normal look back. The soundtrack is decent if not especially good and the opening and ending are both very listenable if a bit boring after a few listens.My final score for Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a low 8, which might be a bit high but it is such a great deal of fun. I have to say that out of all of the anime I was watching as they were airing, this has to be the one I was looking forward to watching it the most. Would I recommend it to everyone? Of course not, but if you are looking for a good laugh and are not going to mind a bunch of fan-service. love with him but the problem is that sexual relationships between humans and monsters are forbidden.

This is an echhi harem anime that decided to change 1 basic element of the formula and make all of the girls ""monster girls"". This is a series where ecchi lovers get to try masturbate to a snake girl, Quelaag from Dark Souls, a centaur, and MANY others. Since one of the MAIN points of a harem series is audience wish fulfillment and wank material, the girls are always highly attractive and appealing. This series completely torpedoes that goal unless it...was made for about 25 people on deviantart. So it must be a clever subversion of the harem genre and a biting satire right?...right?Plot and characters:The government decides to randomly reveal that mystical creatures have always existed, but had been kept a secret since the middle ages and people simply forgot that they were real. Many monster girls travel to Japan allegedly to study Japanese culture, but actually many are looking for a human to mate with. The Japanese government heavily frowns on these ""interracial relations"" and even founded a government department to prevent them from happening. Our male lead is an average guy named Kuruso that received a monster exchange girl (snake body with human torso) as a mistake. He is very kind to the snake girl Miia and even defends her honor from some random xenophobes by beating the living shit out of them! Then the series quickly goes further downhill because more and more monster girls join and the series becomes extremely predictable and generic. During the first few episodes, you have lines like, “Japanese citizens don’t seem to actually like us foreigners, but they are usually polite because it is expected”. This is one of the things that leads me to believe that initially the writer actually wanted to use comedic satire to address xenophobia in Japan. However, there was either executive interference or his train of thought simply got derailed. Monster Musume almost immediately surrenders on any attempt to make a product with any value or purpose whatsoever. It just trudges along the tired and worn out path of harem clichés until it reaches an arbitrary point and just stops.Art:The art is fairly decent, but unsurprisingly it is nothing amazing. This is yet another giant tits anime that tries to milk money out of the Japanese buyers by releasing an “uncut” DVD, which is the EXACT same footage with a couple nipple shots added in! This has become a horrible new trend in anime similar to excessive DLC in videogames. If the entire purpose is to show tits, then just show tits! Don’t expect buyers to fork over extra money just to see your poorly drawn boobs!!!Sound:Monster Musume has a sickeningly sweet and rather obnoxious soundtrack that I couldn’t recommend.Overall:Maybe I am just being overly optimistic, but I feel like somewhere in this pile of shit, there was an idea for a decent satire or perhaps a parody/deconstruction that could have at least been halfway decent. However, those seeds were planted in toxic waste and obviously had ZERO chance to bloom into anything worth looking at. At least I almost laughed a couple times, so I have seen FAR worse! was made for about 25 people on deviantart.

At least I almost laughed a couple times, so I have seen FAR worse!', 'Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, otherwise known as, ""Everyday Life with Monster Girls"" is probably as generic as it gets when it comes to ecchi harems. It has the typical nice guy, the girls that fawn over him and everything that make comedic harems a genre. None of that discredits Monster Musume for what it is though and for it to take those simple generic ideas and hit all the \'right\' buttons truly makes it its own.Whether it be changing the girls to \'monster girls\', twisting the personalities to an extreme, adding sexy but hilarious interactions with the MC and girls or trying to build...a world where society is slowly accepting these new sub-species all come into play; The anime hits all the right notes to make it something more than a typical harem and does it in a phenomenal way.Story (7/10):The story isn\'t as engaging as it could be, but it sets itself up to be interesting enough with plenty of laughs to follow it. One thing that does get somewhat lost as the show goes is the idea that there\'s sub-species mixing in the show. We only follow one character whom is dealing with it, but it gives viewers a glimpse to all of the pros and cons that come with this \'mixing\'. Just as cultures and other nationalities mix there can be prejudice, mockery, but at the same time fascination and acceptance. Monster Musume only touches lightly on the subject, but as the MC himself soon learns things aren\'t just as simple when you\'re living with a person of different species every day. As Monster Musume touches on their daily lives and sometimes trials, but still manages to flaunt some boob shots in there while still keeping focused on the story at hand. It\'s a complicated idea & story made simple; For what the author intended to make it works out very well. More importantly to some, it stays very true to the manga save for perhaps one part of the anime.Art (9/10):One of the more enjoyable aspects of Monster Musume was its attention to detail when it came to art. The art is very colorful and vibrant while keeping some top-notch quality animation going at all times. What makes it especially great is the \'range\' of quality they utilize throughout the show. One scene can be completely breath-taking, but once we\'re kicking it in to comedy they lighten up the \'tone\' of the characters\' looks (Mainly the MC) to match with the scene. It works and fits very well while sometimes even purposely making things look strange for the sake of a great joke (Looking at you cabbage).Sound (9/10):Whether it came to the music, quality of the voices or simply just noise they saved no expense to deliver great sound. The voice actors were top-notch, every VA had spot-on fit their characters\' personalities and whether it was imitating sounds from games, anime and so-forth (lots of references to other work) the sound was spot on.Character (8/10):This is where I think Monster Musume shines the most. Again, going back to what I had said at the beginning of my review, Monster Musume takes the cliche personalities that many harems have and makes them their own. The classic tsundere, the clutz, the \'pure girl\', dominatrix, and company are all twisted and shaped by the author to justly fit our new monster girls. What they\'ve essentially done is take a generic personality and \'did it right\'. After all, the reason why these personalities are so prevalent in the anime and manga industry is because of how well they were received and created; Unfortunately, many anime and manga recycle these personalities without doing anything extra to them. They essentially copy/paste from one anime to another, but what\'s great with Monster Musume is that it takes that classic \'pure girl\' and makes her into as pure and dutiful as some knights. That doesn\'t catch your interest? Well, let\'s take our kind and thoughtful rich girl, but make her a huge addict for tragedy and so-forth. While they\'re not original, each girl has their \'own\' personality, which holds the show quite nicely. Even the main protagonist, whom is the biggest cliche of all is a breath of fresh air. The MC is nice and kind to all of the girls as one would expect, but is bold and doesn\'t back down when actions need to be taken. It\'s a trait, that oddly we don\'t see enough exhibited enough as many harems have taken to the \'thick-headed\' nice guy whom can never take a hint. Each character compliments one-another and will have you rather enjoying every one of them.Enjoyment (9/10):While Monster Musume may not have the greatest of stories or strongest of characters it delivers itself well just as it wanted to be. A silly ecchi harem & it does so well. There was laughs, moments of intensity and tons of fan-service which oddly felt like just the right amount for what it was aiming for. They were able to recreate the manga very well and there was always something interesting happening whether it would be a hilarious game reference, fan-service (Which you get plenty of), intimacy, conflicts or even just day to day activities.Overall (8/10):Monster Musume does what it intended to do from the start, which is to entertain. It never took itself too seriously and that really carried it to be something more. Whether it was ecchi, comedy, forwarding the \'plot\' or anything else it did it was always enough to just keep you amused, but it never tried anything to betray your expectations. It\'s because of how Monster Musume carries itself that I feel it deserves to be scored as such. We\'re not looking at the next evolution of ecchi harem or anything that can shake the foundry of the genre; We\'re just looking at some great entertainment, just remember to enjoy yourself. Who knows though? After all, we were just spectators taking a peak at what it\'s like to live everyday with Monster Girls. a world where society is slowly accepting these new sub-species all come into play; The anime hits all the right notes to make it something more than a typical harem and does it in a phenomenal way.Story (7/10):The story isn\'t as engaging as it could be, but it sets itself up to be interesting enough with plenty of laughs to follow it.

The voice actors were top-notch, every VA had spot-on fit their characters\' personalities and whether it was imitating sounds from games, anime and so-forth (lots of references to other work) the sound was spot on.Character (8/10):This is where I think Monster Musume shines the most. Again, going back to what I had said at the beginning of my review, Monster Musume takes the cliche personalities that many harems have and makes them their own. The classic tsundere, the clutz, the \'pure girl\', dominatrix, and company are all twisted and shaped by the author to justly fit our new monster girls. What they\'ve essentially done is take a generic personality and \'did it right\'. After all, the reason why these personalities are so prevalent in the anime and manga industry is because of how well they were received and created; Unfortunately, many anime and manga recycle these personalities without doing anything extra to them. They essentially copy/paste from one anime to another, but what\'s great with Monster Musume is that it takes that classic \'pure girl\' and makes her into as pure and dutiful as some knights. That doesn\'t catch your interest? Well, let\'s take our kind and thoughtful rich girl, but make her a huge addict for tragedy and so-forth. While they\'re not original, each girl has their \'own\' personality, which holds the show quite nicely. Even the main protagonist, whom is the biggest cliche of all is a breath of fresh air. The MC is nice and kind to all of the girls as one would expect, but is bold and doesn\'t back down when actions need to be taken. It\'s a trait, that oddly we don\'t see enough exhibited enough as many harems have taken to the \'thick-headed\' nice guy whom can never take a hint. Each character compliments one-another and will have you rather enjoying every one of them.Enjoyment (9/10):While Monster Musume may not have the greatest of stories or strongest of characters it delivers itself well just as it wanted to be. A silly ecchi harem & it does so well. There was laughs, moments of intensity and tons of fan-service which oddly felt like just the right amount for what it was aiming for. They were able to recreate the manga very well and there was always something interesting happening whether it would be a hilarious game reference, fan-service (Which you get plenty of), intimacy, conflicts or even just day to day activities.Overall (8/10):Monster Musume does what it intended to do from the start, which is to entertain. It never took itself too seriously and that really carried it to be something more. Whether it was ecchi, comedy, forwarding the \'plot\' or anything else it did it was always enough to just keep you amused, but it never tried anything to betray your expectations. It\'s because of how Monster Musume carries itself that I feel it deserves to be scored as such. We\'re not looking at the next evolution of ecchi harem or anything that can shake the foundry of the genre; We\'re just looking at some great entertainment, just remember to enjoy yourself. Who knows though? After all, we were just spectators taking a peak at what it\'s like to live everyday with Monster Girls.', ""I've recently been hit in a car accident and have suffered from terminal mobility loss, but ever since watching this show, I've slowly been  getting better a lot quickly as this show gives me a boost of motivation to go after the women on the streets. I really enjoy the show, and maybe it can cure someone else's disability as it has given me a huge boost of help.Really recommend watching if u like to chase women you will never get, but it's always worth a shot since they are roaming around the block.Keep on watching! With the metal rod floppin around, you can...do anything! do anything!"", ""Monster Musume is exactly what you think it is.  Our friends in Japan have crossed over into new levels of perversion and fetish anime.  Well kind of.  Its not like the whole monster girl + human boy has not been done before, but its never been done quite as creepily as this one.The premise of Monster Musume has been done, and done, and done again.  And done again,   in anime dozens of not hundreds of times before.  Guy lives alone and within the span of a few episodes finds himself living with 4 or 5 girls of various...personality types.  Shenanigans, boobs, and crotch face plants ensue.  The difference here is that all our girls are not human.  And I mean really not human at all, with the exception of their enormous cow udder tits.This brings me to what I found to be the most disturbing aspect of this show.  Sure we have seen plenty of non human characters in anime before, history is full of adorable cat girls, fox spirits, and intergalactic space princesses.  But they always felt more human than animal.  This is not the case with Monster Musume.  We have half snake, horse, spiders, and mermaid girls.  With the whole premise being these girls are seeking marriage with our indecisive hero, one can only shudder at the reproductive implications of a man mating with a horse...Everything else about this show is decidedly average, at best.  While there are a few amusing moments the experience suffers from a familiar problem of harem type shows.  An enormously bloated cast of girls.  Nearly every episode introduces a new monster girl making any character development pretty much impossible beyond basic tropes and stereotypes.  The characters are likable but I failed to form any sort of emotional investment in any of them and could care less if anything happened to them.  Kurusu sort of stands out when compared to other harem leads in that he isn't a complete pussy despite the fact he vigorously protects his chastity as would the most pious monk.  Though perhaps we can feel relieved that he does considering the disturbing implications of it.Artistically the show is pretty average.  The girls themselves are well drawn and look (a bit too much) like their animal counterparts.  Though most of the girls have ridiculously enormous breasts that frankly aren't even all that attractive.  The overall quality of the BluRays was alot better than the TV release, as one would expect, but nobody is winning any awards here for animation or backgrounds either.  The voice acting and OP/ED songs were good and definitely the best part of this anime.I can't recommend this anime to anyone.  Even the most ardent fans of harem shows will find little to love here.  Only those with the most hardcore monster girl fetishes need apply.  Instead just go check out something better like Rosario+Vampire for your monster girl fix, sans the creepy bestiality. personality types.  Shenanigans, boobs, and crotch face plants ensue.

Now I don\'t know what I was expecting when i started but what i got was... not even bad. That\'s a insult to bad anime. This is on par if not worse than ""School Days"". Yeah I said that. The main Character has about as much personality as a Cardboard Standee of a Brick. The show is oversexualized to the point where even hardcore fans of the ecchi genera are turned off. The plot is non-existent. And there are scenes that can be considered borderline rape. Have I finished this? No. Do...I plan to? Hell no. I have seen some bad stuff. None of it as bad as this. I plan to? Hell no. I have seen some bad stuff. None of it as bad as this.', 'Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, an unexpectedly amazing & very unique title that has lots of men buying tissues and lotion, than merchandise for the series.Story 6.5/10The story and plot was more of a prologue. The lack of major backstory about the monster girls homes & origins coupled with the quick introductions were another reason why I felt like this was just a prologue. In addition to that, the characters being introduced one by one and the story, by the last episode, feels like the start of the real story. It\'s overall presentation was pretty strange. There is no real character development nor is there...any ""set plot"" for episodes in Monster Musume. What I loved most about the story is that it manages to be a good amount of sexually arousing along with being both fun & exciting! I like that the story, although a bit choppy, focuses more about having fun and really getting into understanding the bizarre lifestyle that Kimihito has to endure now that he\'s been forced into the whole human and monster living together program, thingy... In my opinion it sort of makes an interesting story, although not great, still interesting enough to watch. Considering how much this show is being talked about among-st mostly males in forums, I don\'t think Monster Musume is going out of style anytime soon.Sound 6.5/10Interesting, nothing too special though. I did enjoy the opening & outro songs because they were catchy.. Hey SMITH-SU.. the background music unfortunately, none of the songs stood out too much, audio fell flat for the most part and the erotic scenes, the music, sounded like generic stock music. I didn\'t think the composer did a great job making the soundtrack.  Now the voice actors, if it wasn\'t for them then I would\'ve given the soundtrack a 6.0/10 however I\'m kind of glad that\'s not the case. The seiyuu\'s involved with this series did a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life. If Monster Musume has its well deserved season two then I would hope that no changes to the voice actors are made. The actors are able to synchronize their voices perfectly in order to fit the characters unique personalities. I give the most credit and  respect to Junji or Kimihito\'s voice actor because he has had experience with titles similar to this. Roles were he has to go over the top with his voice, for example making crazy noises, yelling, moans etc. I was more impressed with the voice actors than anything else in the sound department.Characters 8.3/10Perhaps one of the best cast of harem characters I\'ve seen lately! In my opinion Monster Musume\'s strongest appeal factor is the characters. If you like harems, and love monster girls, then Monster Musume is the show for you. I didn\'t dislike any of the girls on the show.  The MC however was so one-sided in personality that he sort of dragged the other characters back. Personally I don\'t even have a favorite character because deciding who is best is just too much to bare! (Yes, boob puns intended.)  Overall I enjoyed the characters. I would assume by reading this you\'ve already established that though.Art & Animation 8.7/10Perhaps the biggest reason to watch the show (if you\'re into Ecchi) is how well the character designs are. While the proportions of the female characters were a bit over exaggerated, it doesn\'t negatively affect the qualities of the characters. They are monster girls so of course their bodies are different. Nonetheless, Okayado character designs for Miia, Rachnera, and the bunch of adorable monster girls were perfection. The animators who brought his designs to life did an excellent job making them appealing for all viewers.The animation would be the second best thing. Special effects used in many episodes improved the feel, the mood rather depending on what characters were being shown. From the first episode we see Kim\' and Miia waking up, together in bed. The sunlight in the room, the lighting, it really makes the settings have a realistic feeling in an already fantasy world. My personally favorite effect would be the episode where Miia decides to go all metal gear solid\'s Snake.Enjoyment & Overall feeling 8.6/10Enjoyment was a main goal in the entirety of the monster musume anime. Keeping the viewers entertained by wild and erotic means is perhaps the best thing about the show. Having fun, letting loose, and making the best of a bad situation is a few things that the series offers with pure adult entertainment being it\'s key ingredient for it\'s success among-st fans.

Give it a watch, it\'s pretty damn enjoyable!', 'I believe that a ""Masterpiece"" is something nigh unobtainable. Something more than an entertaining diversion. And above all, something that exemplifies its genre.Monster Musume is a Masterpiece of soft core monster porn.And it is porn, don\'t delude yourself into thinking that this is something else. But personally I like porn so I can\'t hold that against Monster Musume.The story isn\'t really anything special, its your standard ecchi harem fare. Guy meets multiple girls and gives them a place to stay. Once some of the characters are introduced there\'s a minor mystery plot introduced and that does a decent job of keeping things varied. This...kind of show is character driven anyway so having a so-so plot didn\'t really effect it too much.The Art was excellent, and not in a sarcastic way. It was pretty tame, but all the girls looked sexy/cute/lovable which is a major feat considering they are literal monsters. And the animators got creative at times when the scene called for it. The last episode in particular was very fluid, and better than 95% of Monster Musume\'s ecchi cohortsThe sound was ok. Nothing really stood out in a good or bad way. The girls all sound cute, but no seiyuu really stood out. The OP is great though, definitely my favorite of the season.The characters are where this show really shined. For such a large cast, it was great how varied each of the girls were. You could go a few sentences of description of their characterization before getting to ""oh and she is half spider"". I liked the MC as well, most Harem MCs get action just for being nice like thats some sort of accomplishment. But in ""Darling-kun\'s"" case being nice to the women IS actually admirable as most of them could kill him at a drop of a hat. The MC\'s ability to look past that really brought the show together.Enjoyment. Are you kidding? Look at Papi, JUST LOOK AT HER. More jokes landed than missed their target, and there were plenty of scenes that had me laughing out loud. The writing was good at making comedy and very human drama mix in entertaining ways. This show gave hundreds of nerds a new fetish and how many shows can you say touched that many people\'s heartsOverall I really loved this show.

Lerche knew exactly what they wanted to do and accomplished it as well as it could have been done. 10/10 Papi best Harpy', ""What is there to say about Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou? It’s like walking down a dark corridor and seeing a cute girl but then realize that she isn’t so cute. The emphasis in the title is ‘monster’. The word itself implies that the show is anything but normal. And you would be right. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou (Everyday Life with Monster Girls) is what I would describe a rather bizarre harem with lamia, centaurs, spider, mermaid, slime, and everything else you won’t ever see except in fantasy. Forget the myths. In this show, everything is damn real.It’s easy to say that is the...show for everyone. To start off, we have the main male protagonist named Kimihito Kurusu. In his world, the government has made society realize that monsters exist. Their goal is to hopefully allow humans and monsters to co-exist. And in order to do that, they created a program where some humans will live with monsters. It’s like a cultural exchange program and apparently, Kimihito ends up with a lamia named Miia by accidental fate. This doesn’t seem to be a nuisance for Miia though. The first few episodes easily establishes the fact that she is in love with him. It’s not hard realize why considering Kimihito’s kind personality and willingness to accept her as who she is. For someone like Kimihito, it’s also easy to see why other girls would fall for him easily. Perhaps because of this reason, Ms Smith modifies his house as more and more girls keeps coming to his house like pouring rice.By diversity, the show is actually quite colorful. The first half of the show introduces the majority of the main cast (as shown on the poster). We have monsters like harpie, centaur, slime, mermaid, and even a sadistic spider. Each episode makes time for these girls to get acquainted with their newfound life and exploring relationship with a human; in this case Kimihito. However, the show itself easily adapts with the lustful intentions of the girls. Miia is especially prone to get jealous as more girls enter Kimihito’s house. She’s also an opportunist who tries to take every chance to seduce Kimihito. I think by end of the first episode, the show easily accomplishes the generic tropes of a harem. What it does do unconventionally is the fact that the girls aren’t human. This is where I mention that the show is really a hit or miss for the audience, as a non-human tries to get into a physical relationship with a human. That sounds a bit creepy to be quite honest but the show does make light comedy out of this despite the heavy fan service. This is because of Kimihito’s comical reactions and the fact that like most harems, usually something goes wary. Kimihito’s personality often sees him “reject” the girls’ advances out of both his nature and because of the government’s established laws. (monsters gets sent back to their country for consummating in a relationship with human)So what should you expect out of Monster Musume? It’s almost like it’s poking fun at harems because of its unorthodox ideas. The concept of monsters being part of human society and then having them experience a new lifestyle feels awkward. The show also seems to isolate the setting to Kimihito’s house as the exchange program implies that most people are not well suited to live with a non-human. In more dramatic angles, there’s also heavy implication that society holds prejudice against monsters or at least a sense of fear and disgust. Certain humans treats monsters like they are outcasts and literally what they are, monsters. In extreme circumstances, the monsters retaliate through violence such as a robbery. Although played comically in nature, the show still makes its point that monsters and humans co-existing is a near impossible idea.Thankfully though, the show is much more influenced by comedy and humor rather than some cringe worthy drama. Thanks to Ms Smith, who introduced Miia to Kimihito, he experiences new wonders in his life. Ms Smith herself is more of a comic relief as she is lazy although responsible when the time calls for it. She is also part of a team known as “MON” that gets their own spotlight in some episodes. So in general, do expect a little bit of action besides the sexual innuendos on a daily basis. However, the show itself is never shy to turn that on. Every episode will have the monster girls behave in a rather lascivious way, with their own personal reasons. The most obvious is because they are in love with Kimihito but some others are more innocent such as Cerea and Harpie. Maybe it’s because they don’t have an understanding of what being in a relationship is about. Unfortunately, the show plays around with itself too much and nothing concrete is established in the end. And being a harem, the show has a tendency to often create the ‘will they or won’t’ situation. Most times though, you will see the cockblock moment that’s nothing short of being generic. The plus side is that the show does this more amusingly than most harems. This is performed by the monster girls’ characteristics such as Miia’s tail, Harpie’s claws, Cerea’s centaur body structure, Suu’s slimes, or Rachnea’s spider webs. The show also makes Kimihito seems like he is invulnerable. Why? The guy takes injuries that normally would kill a human yet usually ends up fine by the next day. I guess in a show like this, Kimihito gets a free past to stay immortal. There’s also the fun part at how the girls reacts to him when he is caught in perverted situation. This is considered ironic considering that they often wants to get into his pants. So in a nutshell, this is a harem but strikes peculiarly with the non-human supernatural twist.Treat this show as a fan service gift. Anyone who is familiar with harems or likes the type of anime that’s saturated with fan service will definitely notice the immense amount of it. The emphasis put into the show is that the girls wants Kimihito. And to show that to the audience, each episode will have many moments where the girls intentionally or unintentionally showing more of their body than they should. The fan service art is of course peculiar considering that their body structure aren’t human. Thankfully, censorship is rather light (except in some shower and bath scenes). In other words, expect heavy amount of actual fan service to service the fans. The animation quality of the show is also surprisingly fluid including the backgrounds and colors. Finally, the show retains the manga’s reactionary faces. The iconic “O_O’ face of the main protagonist is shown many times while the girls often over exaggerates in ways of their own.The soundtrack is less noticeable. OST is mostly fine but nothing outstanding in particular. Given the nature of the series, voice mannerism is more often the highlight. In particular, it’s reactive to each of the girls’ personalities such as Harpie’s childish nature or Rachnea’s sadism. Kimihito’s voice is rather dull because he is the most normal person in the entire series. But if there’s something abnormal, it would be both the OP and ED theme song. Highlights of it include the monster girls in decorative wedding dresses or the MON making their entrances stylishly. In retrospect, the overall execution is so-so.I’ll say it before and I’ll say it again. Monster Musume is not a show for everyone. It’s comically enough for entertainment and sometimes can be even sweet with the peculiarity of the series. However, the story is more of a mess. It fails to adequately develop the characters and has a hard time elaborating on how the story will end involving the monster girls’ relationships with the protagonist. The overemphasis on the girls trying to seduce Kimihito is a recycled concept that occurs almost every few minutes in each episode. So be prepared for that. Despite this, the series’ humor is downright fun. It has this sharp comedic timing and lets us get to know each of its characters well enough to miss them when they're gone. show for everyone.

So in a nutshell, this is a harem but strikes peculiarly with the non-human supernatural twist.Treat this show as a fan service gift. Anyone who is familiar with harems or likes the type of anime that’s saturated with fan service will definitely notice the immense amount of it. The emphasis put into the show is that the girls wants Kimihito. And to show that to the audience, each episode will have many moments where the girls intentionally or unintentionally showing more of their body than they should. The fan service art is of course peculiar considering that their body structure aren’t human. Thankfully, censorship is rather light (except in some shower and bath scenes). In other words, expect heavy amount of actual fan service to service the fans. The animation quality of the show is also surprisingly fluid including the backgrounds and colors. Finally, the show retains the manga’s reactionary faces. The iconic “O_O’ face of the main protagonist is shown many times while the girls often over exaggerates in ways of their own.The soundtrack is less noticeable. OST is mostly fine but nothing outstanding in particular. Given the nature of the series, voice mannerism is more often the highlight. In particular, it’s reactive to each of the girls’ personalities such as Harpie’s childish nature or Rachnea’s sadism. Kimihito’s voice is rather dull because he is the most normal person in the entire series. But if there’s something abnormal, it would be both the OP and ED theme song. Highlights of it include the monster girls in decorative wedding dresses or the MON making their entrances stylishly. In retrospect, the overall execution is so-so.I’ll say it before and I’ll say it again. Monster Musume is not a show for everyone. It’s comically enough for entertainment and sometimes can be even sweet with the peculiarity of the series. However, the story is more of a mess. It fails to adequately develop the characters and has a hard time elaborating on how the story will end involving the monster girls’ relationships with the protagonist. The overemphasis on the girls trying to seduce Kimihito is a recycled concept that occurs almost every few minutes in each episode. So be prepared for that. Despite this, the series’ humor is downright fun. It has this sharp comedic timing and lets us get to know each of its characters well enough to miss them when they're gone."", ""When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.Monster Musume is, honestly, total trash. In reality it deserves, even on...my scale, a 4/10. However, for some reason, I was compelled to give it a pretty decent score. Why? Because this is some of the most fun I ave had with an anime in several months. I can't quite explain it, but this show has a lot of charm, and it was just incredibly entertaining.Story(4/10)This rating should come as no surprise to anyone.  mean, it is a harem comedy anime. Though, unlike other harems, this one doesn't do that thing where it all adds up to something serious in the end. It almost does, but not quite. o it loses a point or two for that. I really can't rate the story any lower, because that would be suggesting I expected more from it, and like I said, it is a harem.Art(8/10)The art here is just above the usual for me. I think it had just a bit more color and just a bit more style than many of the anime that have come out in the past two years, and most of those get a 7 in my book.Sound(6/10)This is my typical score for anime that have a soundtrack that wasn't noticeably poor, but wasn't really special. I can't really remember any of the songs from the anime, but the music never ruined any moments or put me out of the mood. The into is pretty great, though, so cheery.Character(8/10)Now I know what you're thinking 'Reeze, harems have awful character development and have little to no focus on creating a fleshed out character other than fleshed out chests!' You are totally correct. However, coming into this knowing it was a harem, I wasn't looking for good development, but just characters that I enjoyed on screen. Monster Musume did a really good job of making a full cast of characters I enjoyed. To me, that's all I want from a harem, and they executed that really well.Enjoyment(9/10)As I stated before, this is the jewel of the show. I believe I finished it in just two days, which is a lot faster than my usual 4-episodes-per-day pace. All I can really say here is that the anime was really funny, with all the same stupid jokes that every other harem ever has that I still laugh at like a complete moron. So the show has its charms, and that's all I have to say about that.I really don't think this was a great or even good anime. However, I found it to be very entertaining, and that is success in my eyes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh, is entertained my harems no matter how repetitive they are, or someone who likes so much ecchi their pants can hardly contain it. I don't recommend this to, obviously, people who don't like ecchi, harems, or stupid comedy. I will also add this is not a show you watch for action sequences. my scale, a 4/10.

Imagine if they could be a part of a harem series with one lucky guy forced to take care of them by law. What\'s that? The word harem immediately makes you instantly gag just from trying to enunciate that term? I don\'t blame you. Great harem shows have been a dime a dozen, besides those that were and are already in continuation. When new ones crop up, they do not add anything new or exciting, just more and more formulaic as time goes on. So what is to be done to amend this curse? Put in cute and sexy monster...girls in it, of course!It is possible to add a new element to an anime from a specific genre and succeed in giving a modern edge to the anime. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a prime example of something like this succeeding at a level that I did not think would be possible. If Monster Musume, hypothetically speaking, did not have monster girls as the harem and it was just ordinary girls, I don\'t think it would\'ve had as much of an impact. Unlike human girls, monster girls have abilities from their bodies and state of mind that can create all kinds of unique jokes and sexy situations that you wouldn\'t find in a typical harem show. This uniqueness is where Monster Musume has more going for it in its humor and story. New scenarios involving monstrous entities with tentacles, wings, and other strange things add something interesting that we aren\'t used to.There is not much to say about the story other than that it involves a slightly exciting world of monsters being integrated into the human world. The only issue with it is that it does not explain it very intuitively to the point where I just nodded off halfway through. But from the way the show portrays itself as a silly harem/ecchi anime, it knows how ridiculous it is and runs with it. Even the title itself is translated as ""Daily Life with a Monster Girl."" This is what most ecchi/harem anime should strive for when developing a story of this nature.I will briefly go through one by one of each character since this is, after all, a character-driven anime based on how good the girls and male protagonists are. There are a lot, so bear with me for a moment. Miia-chan, the lamia snake-like monster, is the best one out of the rest. Thanks to the sweet voice of Sora Amamiya, her caring and cute personality is infectious. Not to mention her ""darling"" catchphrase is one that I can\'t preface about how heart-inducing it is. Papi, the bird-like harpy monster, is the bootylicious loli of the group who has some pretty hilarious moments due to her childlike curiosity. Cerea, the centaur monster, is probably my least favorite, but she is still quite enjoyable with her humorous attempts at being noble and knightly to her master.Suu, the humanoid-like water goo-ish monster, has a peculiar essence about her from how she interacts with the characters. Because she can\'t speak well to people at first, we see her grow up with everyone and start learning how to become an adult later in the show. Her morphing technique and almost drowning the protagonist with her own body are amusing. Meroune, the mermaid monster, does get a bad rep as being the worst girl, but I would have to disagree with that assessment. I\'ve always enjoyed seeing her wanting to get married to the protagonist and her attempts at seducing quite alluring in more cases than one. Finally, Rachnera, the giant spider monster, is easily the 2nd best out of the bunch. This is primarily because of her entertaining sadism towards the characters, making her unique among the harem. One scene involving a dullahan and her is especially noteworthy, which I won\'t spoil for those who are not aware.Our protagonist, Kimihito Kurusu, is surprisingly one of the show\'s highlights. His reckless and commanding attitude is a breath of fresh air compared to other harem protagonists who do not have the same level of bravery as females. His actions that involve helping the girls from being downtrodden in human society, particularly one scene involving him punching monster bigots so hard that they fly through the door, make him quite likable in this regard. He does have his dumb moments here and there, but in context to the situation, they fit well in a comedy scenario where he does not have much control over a bunch of monster girls that are entirely different from human girls. He is not an overly perverted protagonist who we would all root for, like Tomoki from Heaven\'s Lost Property or Youto in Hentai Ouji. Still, he manages to have a subtle sexual interest at the right time.My only big issue with the cast is that we do not get to explore the supporting cast as much as we\'d like. Sure, Sumisu has great moments involving the supervision of Kimihito\'s care for the girls, but I do not get the same feeling with the other characters. The MON (Monster of a Neuro) squad, in particular, has this problem. There might be one episode where Kimihito goes on a date with all of them, but other than that, it was hard for me actually to give them any thought compared to the main girls. They will explore them more in the 2nd season, and I hope that that is the case. One exception to the supporting cast is Lala, the dullahan monster, who has one of the most memorable moments involving her head and an independent body in the entire show. Again, no spoilers, but it\'s worth seeing Monster Musume for that alone.From a technical standpoint, Monster Musume\'s art assets are pretty good from how shiny and colorful the character designs are.

It is quite plain and average to see on-screen most of the time. There is the issue of the OP/ED music. The OP is okay; I liked the chorus of the girls chanting ""Monster!

Spoilers ahead!)I am attracted to beautiful women. A bit of an avant-garde statement, I know, but it is true. I love the curves in their figure, the lushness of their hair, and the succulent, full lips that rest on their faces. It is genetics; it is in my nature to look at a woman I find stunning and have my instinctual desires start to churn.Recently, though, it has been a bit…weird. Lately I find myself saying, “I like a woman with a long, scaly, and red tail.” Sometimes I tell others, “A girl who can decapitate herself...is the one for me.” And other times it is, “If I can sit on her back and she can still gallop through town, count me in.” My friends are bewildered and my browser history is ashamed. Of course, my newfound fetishes emerged thanks to Monster Musume, an anime about lamias, Dullahans, and many other women of the fantastical and mythical variety. It sounds odd – crazy even – but if loving monsters is wrong, then I do not want to be right.STORYAt its core, Monster Musume is nothing more than an “ecchi”, comedic anime. It does not have deeply philosophical themes that challenge the mind nor does it have a complex plot filled with intricate patterns. But because it does not focus on the latter details it can strictly focus on the former, allowing it to constantly exist in its own element.One such element is the branching out that occurs. It is understood that there are specific women who obtain the majority of the attention. These “haramettes” are (in order of appearance): Miia, Papi, Centorea, Suu, Lorelei, Rachnera, and Lala. For the most part, the girls are given fair distribution; the amount of scenes they receive is proportionate to their point of inclusion within the show. Arguably, Miia gets too much and Lorelei does not get enough, however since Miia is the “main” girl and Lorelei is a mermaid with a niche interest, these differences make sense contextually. Monster Musume does not stop there, though, choosing to showcase a variety of other monsters. Cyclops, giants, and doppelgangers are prominent, and to a lesser extent dragons, dryads, and dogs. Obviously the anime centers on the main cast instead of the side cast, but having more monster girls outside of the staple offerings makes the situation more reasonable rather than a set of special circumstances that just so happen to revolve around Darling. In fact, due to the interspecies mandate, having a range of different monsters coincides with the literal societal shift.Granted, “monster” is not entirely correct. The women are a combination of a female human and some known creature. Indeed, if each girl was completely genetically monstrous, the anime would tread into shady territory. The anime understands this distinction, flip-flopping between normal and unique “ecchi” content. Clichés like the girls falling into erotic positions or wearing skimpy bikinis are present; tried and true but not necessarily welcome. It is when Monster Musume focuses on its unique element – monsters – that the door is held wide open. One scene has Miia, a lamia, getting help with shedding her skin, arousing her and the audience in the process. Another scene has Papi eating ice cream like it was fellatio because her wings cannot hold the dessert. Another still has Zombina the zombie lop off her breast, forcing Darling to stitch and to play with her body. It is undeniably ridiculous but that is the edge Monster Musume has: the ability to tap into unknown and unheard-of fantasies.But the show, like the women, is two halves: one part perversion and one part hilarity. Similar to its “ecchi” brethren, the comedy finds strength when it incorporates it with the monster qualities of the women. Meaning, while overreactions and misunderstandings are standard fair, when Suu becomes Godzilla after consuming chemical waste or Centorea eats carrots that cause her to go into a longwinded speech about taste bud sensitivity, the latter moments are inherently funnier since they stick with the show’s shtick. Furthermore, the “ecchi” and the comedy are not mutually exclusive. Darling ogling at Rachnera’s long legs and Lorelei disguising herself as a bodacious maid to fit her dreams are designed to make the viewer smile in more ways than one.The rest of Monster Musume’s features are also a dream in that they are there but not really. A subplot of marriage is mentioned to string events together but is never at the forefront. The “world building,” or cultural information pertaining to the monsters, is provided as single sentences during speaking or as separate snippets at the end of each episode instead of explained throughout the season. Ideas like be kind to others, do not be ashamed of who you are, and so on, have their heart in the right place but are not explored outright. In other words, what surrounds the anime’s “ecchi”-centric, comedy-dominant, monster-filled center is fluff, stuff that means little to the show and therefore the audience. But this fluff acts as a cushion for the anime, allowing the lewdness and the laughs to rest in a figurative comfort zone. Scenarios can get heavy – Miia getting kidnapped, Centorea getting cornered, etc. – but the show makes sure to spin the situation back towards its roots – the man who kidnapped Miia is found to be a woman after she is stripped (“ecchi”) and Rachnera appears to terrify the evildoers attacking Centorea (comedy). In this way, no matter where the anime veers, the path it takes inevitably leads back home.So, does Monster Musume question the self or invest in time travel? No, it does not. However, it having some solid “ecchi” and comedy, mired in a monster motif, is definitely difficult to deny.ANIMATIONMonster Musume, perhaps surprisingly, is quite strong when it comes to its art and its animation.Art within the anime is top-notch. Lighting and camera angles in particular are given a lot of attention. The latter is especially noteworthy, considering the size of the monster girls; their bodies are often concealed to refrain from showing them (production resource management) but also as a means to maintain emphasis on the women and their human selves. It is a strange notion, considering that the main appeal of the anime is the monster aspect, but the decision is twofold: attraction (since looking at Papi’s chicken legs constantly is not provocative enough) and reconfirmation (reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, these are still females). Smaller details such as changing the time of day, moving between Darling’s comical and sincere face, and first-person perspectives make the anime dynamic in its presentation and therefore higher in its execution.Monster Musume also includes a large quantity of styles. Minimalist portraits, overly detailed paintings, and creepy depictions intermittently pop up throughout the season, spicing up the package once more. The styles are mostly used for comedic purposes, but the constant switching keeps the show on its toes (or contextually, its tails, talons, and hooves).Luckily, the anime refrains from switching to overt censoring. Many shows opt for steam or magical light beams to mask the nudity on screen, but Monster Musume cleverly constructs its scenes in ways to maximize assets and minimize hiding. Nipples are often missing, hands cover genitalia, and objects living in just the right spots conceal anything that is slightly too forward. Some scenes do use the noticeable black cloud that is common in the medium, but it is rare and reserved for those over-the-top shots. More often than not the anime leans on the camera once more, showing the scene but cutting off part of it, leaving the rest up to the imagination of the audience (and the BDs).The character designs are likewise imaginative, unique to say the least. Miia the lamia, Lala the Dullahan, Centorea the centaur, Rachnera the spider, Suu the slime, Papi the harpy, and Lorelei the mermaid. When looked at closely, each character’s design corresponds with their monster origin and personality: Miia is clingy, Lala is delusional, Centorea is honorable, Rachnera is dominant, Suu is childish, Papi is dumb, and Lorelei is tragic. That is to say, their respective designs already inform the viewer what type of person each girl is.Individually, they look the part. Miia’s extremely long and scaly tail, Rachnera’s spider body complete with skull and six red eyes, and Papi’s blue wings make it easy to distinguish what monster they happen to be, but it is the small details that add up. Centorea’s wears a ponytail, Lala has a scythe-like hair-do, and Lorelei’s fingers are webbed, indicating how intricate the designs truly are. And perhaps most important of all, each woman is attractive, with faces and bodies that simultaneously please the audience and question their sanity.Actual animation remains above average for nearly the entirety of the show. Breasts jiggle, characters fly, and hair moves, breathing life into the cast onscreen. But as it was with the character designs, it is the smaller details that give the anime strength. Tails wag, eyes shine, and waters lap, putting the show, like the events, in a constant frenzy.CHARACTERSIt seems unfathomable that anyone outside the women of the main cast would be more interesting. After all, they are half-female-human and half-monster. Arguably, though, it is Kimihito Kurusu who stands out the most. Technically he does not stand out at all – most people do not even know that Kimihito, otherwise known as Darling, Master, or Honey, is his actual name – but that is precisely what makes him so special. Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters. Besides his name, he is: incredibly strong, impossibly kind, and inviolably resilient. He is a virgin, he accepts everyone for who they are, and he has a past that is not exactly the peak of popularity. Plus, he can cook. Everything about him is meant to make him this dull, generic mass that anyone can relate to. The main purpose is to allow the viewers to take part in the stereotype Kimihito’s character is named after, specifically self-inserting themselves into his position so that they can feel as if they are the ones receiving the affection of the women. But Kimihito is extremely bland; he has no outstanding qualities whatsoever. Most self-insert characters, despite what they are intended to evoke, have something unique about them to differentiate their existence from within and without their show. Yet Kimihito does not follow this trend. In a certain sense, his unbelievable amount of plainness makes him a nonfactor, which in turn makes his character surprisingly clever. His palpable blandness accentuates the women, highlighting their bizarreness beyond what it already is. This keeps the spotlight on Miia, Lala, and the rest, his presence a shadow in the night. The result is more of what makes Monster Musume itself: more “ecchi,” more comedy, and definitely more monsters.Monster-wise, the women are obviously attractive, their personalities and mannerisms designed to get the audience wanting. In fairness, that is not their entire directive. Indeed, a peculiarity about them exists. Dichotomies can be drawn between their monster origin and their personalities, much like their character designs. Miia is the sweetest person when dealing with her Darling but vehemently venomous when anyone gets in-between her and him. Lala the “death god” is only so due to her “chuunibyou,” thereby making her the least dangerous of the troupe. Centorea’s dignified self makes her the most prone to shyness. Rachnera’s teasing reveals how much she understands other people. Suu and her childishness is merely a ruse for her aggressive outbursts. Papi may be dumb but nobody can beat her motherly instincts. As for Lorelei, she might exude an air of royalty but her extramarital fantasies are unladylike to say the least. These dichotomies demonstrate that the women consist of more than singular traits, their individual dualities playing off one another to bolster both their persons and the grander motifs.However the women represent more than dichotomies; the peculiarity is a bit more complex. It is easy to surmise that each woman represents some sort of sexual fetish. Miia has embracing, Lala has mastery of head (so to speak), Centorea has massive breasts, Rachnera has BDSM, Suu has licking and sucking, Papi has youth, and Lorelei has a handicap. Together, they are a diverse collection, offering “something for everyone”…which almost does not make sense. Asking a random heterosexual male if he would prefer sleeping with a voluptuous woman or a snake, nine times out of ten that man will choose the former. Monsters, by their very definition, are not meant to be mates or even lovers. They are scary, creatures that possess otherworldly, nonhuman aspects. So these women having something for everyone when they would seemingly having nothing for anyone is a stark contrast.And like any strong contrast, it reveals something important. In this instance, the peculiarity: “it is what is on the inside that matters most.” While cliché, this sentiment rings true here in Monster Musume more so than normal. The women are a lamia, Dullahan, centaur, spider, slime, harpy, and mermaid, mythical beings whose outer appearances can be difficult to stomach. But it is their courage, their passion, and their heartfelt feelings in everything they do, from trying to cure Kimihito’s sickness to protecting him from imminent doom, that make them beautiful. Looks are likewise important – their female human halves are part of the allure – however the monster girls emphasize that a relationship based on love is not one that is wholly concerned with the superficial but instead based on what lies beneath the skin and the scales, windpipe, fur, carapace, goo, feathers, and gills.SOUNDThe opening theme for Monster Musume is delightful. It is extremely catchy, upbeat, and downright fun. The beginning is serene and slow, then immediately gives way, with up-and-down techno sounds that invite happiness just as the anime does. The various vocalists work in unison and individually, creating that harem yet singular feel. The intermittent “Woo!” that can be heard, the change in tone in the middle, and the back-and-forth lyrics add together to make a dynamic track that perfectly fits the show, a killer piece that wonderfully captures what the anime is all about.The ending theme goes metal, bringing the rock and the roll. The contrast with the OP works well, giving the piece a tougher vibe that the show does not normally exude. The hard guitar, drums, and screaming start the piece in a scary place, appropriate given the monster motif. Here as well, the vocalists switch on and off to mirror the group in question, but when the choir backs up the singular vocalist (Smith), it reaches a triumphant tone that matches the triumph that M.O.N. strives for. Ending the piece with a chant and a cool disc jockey is icing on the cake.The remainder of the soundtrack is not as sweet but it gets the job done, containing simple tracks that encompass everyday life. Considering the official title of the anime in English is Everyday Life with Monster Girls, such a musical direction only makes sense. Flutes fill the air during leisurely time to make the scenes more homely. Funky sound effects for the funny moments to increase the laughs. And slow, sensual tones for those equally sexy escapades to get the audience in the mood. Altogether the tracks fit their respective occasions, increasing the effectiveness of the scenes they are heard in even if they are not memorable as standalone pieces.As a side note, the sound effects are also effective, with a myriad of noises incorporated into the show. Spring lengthening, scythe wielding, and hoof clomping can be heard, as well as thread stretching, goo glopping, feather rustling, and wheel turning. These sounds correspond with a specific monster girl, subtly adding depth to their character.Voice acting is not-so-subtle and instead superb. While moaning is a common denominator, each woman provides an excellent performance for the character given. Specifically, Sora Amamiya as Miia has a precious way of speaking but she can roll the “R” when needed, with her going through a wide range of emotions and inflections throughout the season. Also, Ari Ozawa as Papi gives a killer rendition, with nobody’s cute way of speaking being able to match her cadence and therefore making Papi cuter in the process. And Yurika Kubo as Tionishia deserves a special shout-out, her squeaky voice accentuated further due to the size of the character she plays, making her less fearsome and more adorable. But to reiterate, everyone involved gave it their all, clearly elevating the strength of the anime.ENJOYMENTSuffice it to say that I liked this one. A lot. Obviously part of it is how sexy it all ends up being. Miia wearing a nurse’s outfit, Lala using her tongue while getting groped, and Centorea’s huge bust are instances that I look back on (frequently) as successfully arousing me. But despite how provocative the anime was, it also had some amazingly endearing moments. Using the same women: Miia dreaming about her future with Darling and their child, Lala getting scared and hiding, and Centorea blushing to the max when her hand was held put the stupidest grin on my face. It is unbelievably cute to watch these and similar scenes, but I think it has more to do with these women, who society sees as weird, finding happiness that made me happy as well.I laughed so much watching this one, too, with every episode having some scenario that induced an audible chuckle. Papi is more or less a birdbrain, but her accidental sexual innuendos and her constant carefree attitude was always hilarious. Suu likewise, since she refused to stop smiling no matter what happened to be going on around her. Smith also had her moments, usually when she acted nonchalant with her job and her duties, which, coincidentally enough, was all of the time. The only segment that is a blemish on the anime is Papi’s egg laying bit. Not that the topic was gross but that it placed too much attention on the director dude, changing the focus from the “ecchi,” comedy, and monster girls and onto this perverted guy. Despite being a lead-in to Rachnera, it felt too out of place considering how much it diverted from the show’s normal happenings.Thankfully it is a small segment and is quickly forgotten amidst the anime’s other events. Miia pressing her face up against a window and growling angrily, Lala quaking in her boots and the chair following suit, Centorea nearly feinting while pretending to check Darling’s temperature, Rachnera tying up a lesser devil, Suu trying to rehydrate herself, Papi dropping her phone down her shirt, and Lorelei getting fired up for immoral love were all moments where I could not help but laugh or smile. Alongside the countless times I exclaimed “Hot damn!” or shook my head saying “This show…,” it was easily a fun ride from start to finish.Monster Musume is undoubtedly a strange show. Its combination of monsters and sex seems like a huge turnoff when given a precursory glance, but the high amount of execution in its “ecchi” and comedic elements is rather impressive. Furthermore, the characters are meaningful, the artistic direction is intelligent, and the voice acting is divine. Overall, the anime champions the notion that while women are certainly beautiful, monsters are, too.SUMMARYStory: Good, “ecchi” and comedy are its forte, using the monster motif to its advantage with it never deviating from its established norm in order to strengthen said “ecchi” and comedyAnimation: Great, lighting and camera work are well done, the minimal censorship is a boon, the character designs are very nice, and the actual animation is always above averageCharacters: Good, Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters, highlighting the monster girls well, which in turn demonstrates their dichotomies and fetishes, as well as the simple message of “it is what is on the inside that matters most”Sound: Good, great OP, good ED, fitting OST, nice sound effects, and above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, sexy, hilarious, and endearing for nearly the entirety of the seasonFinal Score: 8/10 is the one for me.” And other times it is, “If I can sit on her back and she can still gallop through town, count me in.” My friends are bewildered and my browser history is ashamed. Of course, my newfound fetishes emerged thanks to Monster Musume, an anime about lamias, Dullahans, and many other women of the fantastical and mythical variety. It sounds odd – crazy even – but if loving monsters is wrong, then I do not want to be right.STORYAt its core, Monster Musume is nothing more than an “ecchi”, comedic anime. It does not have deeply philosophical themes that challenge the mind nor does it have a complex plot filled with intricate patterns. But because it does not focus on the latter details it can strictly focus on the former, allowing it to constantly exist in its own element.One such element is the branching out that occurs. It is understood that there are specific women who obtain the majority of the attention. These “haramettes” are (in order of appearance): Miia, Papi, Centorea, Suu, Lorelei, Rachnera, and Lala. For the most part, the girls are given fair distribution; the amount of scenes they receive is proportionate to their point of inclusion within the show. Arguably, Miia gets too much and Lorelei does not get enough, however since Miia is the “main” girl and Lorelei is a mermaid with a niche interest, these differences make sense contextually. Monster Musume does not stop there, though, choosing to showcase a variety of other monsters. Cyclops, giants, and doppelgangers are prominent, and to a lesser extent dragons, dryads, and dogs. Obviously the anime centers on the main cast instead of the side cast, but having more monster girls outside of the staple offerings makes the situation more reasonable rather than a set of special circumstances that just so happen to revolve around Darling. In fact, due to the interspecies mandate, having a range of different monsters coincides with the literal societal shift.Granted, “monster” is not entirely correct. The women are a combination of a female human and some known creature. Indeed, if each girl was completely genetically monstrous, the anime would tread into shady territory. The anime understands this distinction, flip-flopping between normal and unique “ecchi” content. Clichés like the girls falling into erotic positions or wearing skimpy bikinis are present; tried and true but not necessarily welcome. It is when Monster Musume focuses on its unique element – monsters – that the door is held wide open. One scene has Miia, a lamia, getting help with shedding her skin, arousing her and the audience in the process. Another scene has Papi eating ice cream like it was fellatio because her wings cannot hold the dessert. Another still has Zombina the zombie lop off her breast, forcing Darling to stitch and to play with her body. It is undeniably ridiculous but that is the edge Monster Musume has: the ability to tap into unknown and unheard-of fantasies.But the show, like the women, is two halves: one part perversion and one part hilarity. Similar to its “ecchi” brethren, the comedy finds strength when it incorporates it with the monster qualities of the women. Meaning, while overreactions and misunderstandings are standard fair, when Suu becomes Godzilla after consuming chemical waste or Centorea eats carrots that cause her to go into a longwinded speech about taste bud sensitivity, the latter moments are inherently funnier since they stick with the show’s shtick. Furthermore, the “ecchi” and the comedy are not mutually exclusive. Darling ogling at Rachnera’s long legs and Lorelei disguising herself as a bodacious maid to fit her dreams are designed to make the viewer smile in more ways than one.The rest of Monster Musume’s features are also a dream in that they are there but not really. A subplot of marriage is mentioned to string events together but is never at the forefront. The “world building,” or cultural information pertaining to the monsters, is provided as single sentences during speaking or as separate snippets at the end of each episode instead of explained throughout the season. Ideas like be kind to others, do not be ashamed of who you are, and so on, have their heart in the right place but are not explored outright. In other words, what surrounds the anime’s “ecchi”-centric, comedy-dominant, monster-filled center is fluff, stuff that means little to the show and therefore the audience. But this fluff acts as a cushion for the anime, allowing the lewdness and the laughs to rest in a figurative comfort zone. Scenarios can get heavy – Miia getting kidnapped, Centorea getting cornered, etc. – but the show makes sure to spin the situation back towards its roots – the man who kidnapped Miia is found to be a woman after she is stripped (“ecchi”) and Rachnera appears to terrify the evildoers attacking Centorea (comedy). In this way, no matter where the anime veers, the path it takes inevitably leads back home.So, does Monster Musume question the self or invest in time travel? No, it does not. However, it having some solid “ecchi” and comedy, mired in a monster motif, is definitely difficult to deny.ANIMATIONMonster Musume, perhaps surprisingly, is quite strong when it comes to its art and its animation.Art within the anime is top-notch. Lighting and camera angles in particular are given a lot of attention. The latter is especially noteworthy, considering the size of the monster girls; their bodies are often concealed to refrain from showing them (production resource management) but also as a means to maintain emphasis on the women and their human selves. It is a strange notion, considering that the main appeal of the anime is the monster aspect, but the decision is twofold: attraction (since looking at Papi’s chicken legs constantly is not provocative enough) and reconfirmation (reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, these are still females). Smaller details such as changing the time of day, moving between Darling’s comical and sincere face, and first-person perspectives make the anime dynamic in its presentation and therefore higher in its execution.Monster Musume also includes a large quantity of styles. Minimalist portraits, overly detailed paintings, and creepy depictions intermittently pop up throughout the season, spicing up the package once more. The styles are mostly used for comedic purposes, but the constant switching keeps the show on its toes (or contextually, its tails, talons, and hooves).Luckily, the anime refrains from switching to overt censoring. Many shows opt for steam or magical light beams to mask the nudity on screen, but Monster Musume cleverly constructs its scenes in ways to maximize assets and minimize hiding. Nipples are often missing, hands cover genitalia, and objects living in just the right spots conceal anything that is slightly too forward. Some scenes do use the noticeable black cloud that is common in the medium, but it is rare and reserved for those over-the-top shots. More often than not the anime leans on the camera once more, showing the scene but cutting off part of it, leaving the rest up to the imagination of the audience (and the BDs).The character designs are likewise imaginative, unique to say the least. Miia the lamia, Lala the Dullahan, Centorea the centaur, Rachnera the spider, Suu the slime, Papi the harpy, and Lorelei the mermaid. When looked at closely, each character’s design corresponds with their monster origin and personality: Miia is clingy, Lala is delusional, Centorea is honorable, Rachnera is dominant, Suu is childish, Papi is dumb, and Lorelei is tragic. That is to say, their respective designs already inform the viewer what type of person each girl is.Individually, they look the part. Miia’s extremely long and scaly tail, Rachnera’s spider body complete with skull and six red eyes, and Papi’s blue wings make it easy to distinguish what monster they happen to be, but it is the small details that add up. Centorea’s wears a ponytail, Lala has a scythe-like hair-do, and Lorelei’s fingers are webbed, indicating how intricate the designs truly are. And perhaps most important of all, each woman is attractive, with faces and bodies that simultaneously please the audience and question their sanity.Actual animation remains above average for nearly the entirety of the show. Breasts jiggle, characters fly, and hair moves, breathing life into the cast onscreen. But as it was with the character designs, it is the smaller details that give the anime strength. Tails wag, eyes shine, and waters lap, putting the show, like the events, in a constant frenzy.CHARACTERSIt seems unfathomable that anyone outside the women of the main cast would be more interesting. After all, they are half-female-human and half-monster. Arguably, though, it is Kimihito Kurusu who stands out the most. Technically he does not stand out at all – most people do not even know that Kimihito, otherwise known as Darling, Master, or Honey, is his actual name – but that is precisely what makes him so special. Kimihito is the epitome of self-insert characters. Besides his name, he is: incredibly strong, impossibly kind, and inviolably resilient. He is a virgin, he accepts everyone for who they are, and he has a past that is not exactly the peak of popularity. Plus, he can cook. Everything about him is meant to make him this dull, generic mass that anyone can relate to. The main purpose is to allow the viewers to take part in the stereotype Kimihito’s character is named after, specifically self-inserting themselves into his position so that they can feel as if they are the ones receiving the affection of the women. But Kimihito is extremely bland; he has no outstanding qualities whatsoever. Most self-insert characters, despite what they are intended to evoke, have something unique about them to differentiate their existence from within and without their show. Yet Kimihito does not follow this trend. In a certain sense, his unbelievable amount of plainness makes him a nonfactor, which in turn makes his character surprisingly clever. His palpable blandness accentuates the women, highlighting their bizarreness beyond what it already is. This keeps the spotlight on Miia, Lala, and the rest, his presence a shadow in the night. The result is more of what makes Monster Musume itself: more “ecchi,” more comedy, and definitely more monsters.Monster-wise, the women are obviously attractive, their personalities and mannerisms designed to get the audience wanting. In fairness, that is not their entire directive. Indeed, a peculiarity about them exists. Dichotomies can be drawn between their monster origin and their personalities, much like their character designs. Miia is the sweetest person when dealing with her Darling but vehemently venomous when anyone gets in-between her and him. Lala the “death god” is only so due to her “chuunibyou,” thereby making her the least dangerous of the troupe. Centorea’s dignified self makes her the most prone to shyness. Rachnera’s teasing reveals how much she understands other people. Suu and her childishness is merely a ruse for her aggressive outbursts. Papi may be dumb but nobody can beat her motherly instincts. As for Lorelei, she might exude an air of royalty but her extramarital fantasies are unladylike to say the least. These dichotomies demonstrate that the women consist of more than singular traits, their individual dualities playing off one another to bolster both their persons and the grander motifs.However the women represent more than dichotomies; the peculiarity is a bit more complex. It is easy to surmise that each woman represents some sort of sexual fetish. Miia has embracing, Lala has mastery of head (so to speak), Centorea has massive breasts, Rachnera has BDSM, Suu has licking and sucking, Papi has youth, and Lorelei has a handicap. Together, they are a diverse collection, offering “something for everyone”…which almost does not make sense. Asking a random heterosexual male if he would prefer sleeping with a voluptuous woman or a snake, nine times out of ten that man will choose the former.

In the case of the girls - they\'re just there to fawn over the protagonist and serve as allusions for sexual fetishes. That\'s literally it.As such, the characters are unsurprisingly one-dimensional and offer...no more than your usual anime stereotypes (e.g. tsundere, yandere, loli, etc.). The perverted moments serve neither to excite  nor to entertain and their attempts to make this anime work always fall flat.As if that wasn\'t enough, the plot is practically nonexistent (even for a harem), for every episode essentially consists of a new character being introduced (you guessed it, it\'s a ""monster"" girl!) and said character immediately joining the harem in order to add new quirks and fetishes to it (also, to fawn over the MC. Have I mentioned that before?)Besides being unfulfilling in the ecchi department, it\'s also rather unfulfilling in the anime department as a whole given the fact that a plot never appears and what little story there is never goes anywhere. As with any harem, don\'t expect any one girl to be picked (and, in this case, don\'t expect any questions to be answered either).Overall, I found this anime to be a waste of time and would only recommend it to someone who\'s really run out of ideas for productive things to do. no more than your usual anime stereotypes (e.g. tsundere, yandere, loli, etc.).

every week because of this show (and Overlord too ).Monster Musume is a show about an almost immortal human male that lives with monster girls,and they just keep coming(pun intended).The show was heavily discussed each week on reddit threads and lots of waifu wars have been held at that time.I cant continue the review until i tell you my top 3 girls.They are1.Rachnera2.Papi3.SmithNow let's review this show finally.We can start with the story first.Story:5/10In the first season there is kinda almost no story,basically new monster...girls keep showing up at the mc's house and start living there.It's kind of a Big Brother show but with just one male and bunch of hot monster girls.We get to see what they do in their free time,since the mc is the only one working but we  never get to see where.Without much spoilers,the mc gets to date each of the monster girls and each date is hilarious in a way and we get to know more of the mc and the monster girl herself.That prety much sums up the concept of the show.Art:8/10The art and animation is pretty solid through the show.Especially the last episode had some great animation,props to the studio for the great job.A lot of people on reddit disliked the heavy censoring but to be honest,it didn't bother me at all.I could really see it being good without all the lewd scenes since those things weren't the factor that made this show likable.Without any fan service this show was really funny and the censoring is totally okay with me.Sound: 8/10Voice actors were awesome and did really well the portraying of the characters.I liked Miia's and Centorea's voices most.The bgm wasn't noticeable much but the opening was really good,probably one of the better ones from the season.Also each character has their soundtrack on the bluray release IIRC and I listened to them and they are really really good.Check out Centoreas soundtrack if you're into power metal,it's really good.Character: 6/10Some fair character development through the show but the development doesn't really matter much,it's the humor those characters provide each episode.I gotta say all of them are really funny and that's what matters most.If you're into waifu debates check monster musume threads on reddit.Enjoyment:10/10As I said before,this show made my Tuesdays enjoyable.Twenty minutes of laughter,funny scenes and discovering new fetishes every week.What more can I ask from a show ?Don't we all need a monster girl in our lives?Monster Musume is a must watch if you like ecchi/harem shows with lots of comedy.And remember Rachera Arachnera  is the best girl!Overall 8/10Thanks for reading. ^_^v girls keep showing up at the mc's house and start living there.It's kind of a Big Brother show but with just one male and bunch of hot monster girls.We get to

made my Tuesdays enjoyable.Twenty minutes of laughter,funny scenes and discovering new fetishes every week.What more can I ask from a show ?Don't we all need a monster girl in our lives?Monster Musume is a must watch if you like ecchi/harem shows with lots of comedy.And remember Rachera Arachnera  is the best girl!Overall 8/10Thanks for reading. ^_^v"", 'Somehow I expected Monster Musume to be some average comedy where the guy tries to live his usual life but instead is caught up in some monster girl\'s shenanigans every day. What I actually ended up watching, however, was offensive to even the unpromising premise of this show.The reason I didn\'t rate this show with 1 is the core theme it touches very lightly: The acceptance of things we perceive as different. It\'s already teased in episode 1 (but turned to laughs immediately after). In a world where monster-girl hybrids are an everyday occurence, people react with contempt and try to avoid them. What has...caused a negative experience for some girls like Rachnera (and influenced their way of living) is the main message this show tries to get across (and ultimately fails, but I give points for trying): Not to judge people by their looks. The main character does exactly this and behaves indifferently to humans as well as the monster girls, showing that looks and heritage don\'t matter.But, in a show called ""Daily Life with Monster Girl"" you would expect the main character Kurusu to have some kind of ""life"". As it turns out he doesn\'t. He is at best shown buying groceries or cooking. Apparently he doesn\'t have a job or hobbies or friends either. And he doesn\'t have any personality traits besides being nice - which is, of course, the biggest asset any harem protagonist can have as it makes tons of girls fall in love with you.Things aren\'t much different for the girls. They don\'t have anything going for them besides obviously wanting to fuck Kurusu. Their sole purpose is reminding us how nice Kurusu is and how much they depend on him and love him. I could describe every girl with a single word: Miia is jealous, Centorea is uptight, Papi is retarded, Mero is caring ... The one girl that actually has some background and personality would be Rachnera, however that amount is kept to a minimum as to not distract the viewer from the main point of this show.The main selling point of this show would be ecchi. However, the fanservice in this show is highly unsatisfying. The biggest problem is the girl\'s over-the-top character designs: Their human female body parts are way too exaggerated. Every girl except Papi has huge or gigantic breasts to the point that they mostly look unhealthy and entirely unaesthetic. This is not how I would want my girlfriend to look like. Fanservice is also way too straightforward: If breasts or asses are shown then they are immediately stripped naked. There is no teasing - breasts and asses are directly zoomed on by camera the moment they are there. And it\'s like that in every episode multiple times. After about 3 episodes it became painful to watch this show as I didn\'t see any merit in watching Kurusu get smothered by some monster girl\'s overly large breasts again and again.The comedy in this show is extremely repetitive and mostly focuses on ecchi. Either Kurusu trips and lands or some girl\'s breasts or Miia gets jealous and presses his head against her breasts. It\'s like that every time: Some monster girl gets close to Kurusu -> the others get jealous and then we get to see some breasts or asses. What the fuck?I\'m not sure what the purpose of Monster Musume is. It\'s just some wish fulfillment for anyone who has a fetish for monster girls. But as far as the sexual content in this show goes, I would advise anyone to just go watch some monster hentai instead (there are tons out there - that genre is quite popular). caused a negative experience for some girls like Rachnera (and influenced their way of living) is the main message this show tries to get across (and ultimately fails, but I give points for trying): Not to judge people by their looks.

A good harem can be considered as one where the characters are complex and have more to offer like themes or storylines than just a bunch of girls liking the same guy.  A bad harem on the other hand can be considered as platonic and rehashed, focusing just on the way the girls are and not adding anything more than just tropes for personalities.  And then we have Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, or Daily Life with Monster Girls,...a show that tells you the entire gist of what it\'s going to be in the first 5 minutes of its runtime.Story: So, what if you lived in a world where creatures in mythology actually existed?  What if you found out that the noble centaurs of Greek Mythology or the ice-cold Yuki-onna\'s of Japanese Mythology actually existed in your world?  Well, that\'s the kind of world that our main protagonist Kurusu Kimihito (or his nickname, Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss.  I\'ll get to this later) lives in.  In accordance to the Extraspecies Law, non-humans are allowed to live in normal human society as long as they are with a family that allows one in their home as a ""host family.""  As a host family for an ""extra-species"" as these characters of mythos are called, we peer into the life of the poor unfortunate soul as he lives his Daily Life with Monster Girls.  (Hey, that\'s the title of the show.)MonMusu, as the shorthanded name for this show is, is a very basic show.  As expected given the show\'s title, MonMusu is a show that features our main protagonist with his Daily life with Monster Girls.  It has a very slice of life feel because every episode doesn\'t necessarily progress with any sort of story, following more of a day to day style of story.  There isn\'t any major developments or any sort of world-ending situation (that is irony, in a sense.) to make the show more interesting.  It\'s a very basic show that relies solely on the way the characters interact with each other and the comedy that it produces in order to create the entertainment that this show provides.  There isn\'t any thought-provoking moments, there aren\'t any dramatic scenes that break the relationships apart, it\'s just a normal, average, daily life show, with monster girls, ecchi, and near-death situations.That brings me to the comedy of the show.  MonMusu branches its comedy from three different sources.  The ecchi, the characters\' personalities and the way they are, and the near-death situations that Mr. Darling gets into.MonMusu utilizes what I would consider as a relatively good mesh between those three kinds of comedy.  For the most part, every comedic scene involves some aspect of ecchi, character traits, and near-dying situations that make MonMusu unique to a lot of other harem.  Yes there are a lot of boobs and clothes flying everywhere but they are also moments of characters showcasing their personal traits and difference from just being a normal tsundere or dandere.  They also accidentally threaten one man\'s life while trying to seduce him half the time, so keep that in mind.  They have boobs and a potential death happening all at once.  (There\'re also quite a few references in MonMusu to other things too.)In the end, MonMusu isn\'t a very complicated show.  It\'s a daily life show that fully supports itself through the use of its unique blend of comedy (which is really up to what you think is funny) and relies on its characters in order to pull itself through.  The base story isn\'t all that unique, and the comedy does sometimes just go into straight up ecchi, but it does live up to what it wants to do as an anime.Overview:+/-  Unique blend of ecchi comedy  (This is the main draw of the show aside from the characters.  Positive or negative highly depends on your views on ecchi and what is funny.)-  Overused base story ideaCharacters: As I have stated before, MonMusu\'s entire runtime is based around the characters of the series.  With most of them being both female and not exactly human, let\'s start with the main reason people watch/read this series, the girls.As expected, there are many girls in MonMusu because it is a harem show.  Since we have six girls and I\'m too lazy to analyze each one of them, let\'s just give you a quick overview of what they are and their major trait.  (Those with a ""*"" are my favorites.)Miia:  The first girl of the series who is a Lamia.  Very possessive of Mr. Darling like a lovesick city girl and is terrible at cooking.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Darling.)Papi:  The second girl of the series who is a Harpy.  A literal birdbrain who has the mind of a child; loses her memory after walking three steps.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Goshujin.)Centorea: The third girl of the series who is a centaur.  Very noble and wishes to protect Mr. Darling while also very shy on the inside; has the second biggest boobs in the series.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Anjiro-dono.)*Suu: A slime who is the fourth girl of the series.  A very versatile and seemingly innocent character who has a pension for molesting everyone.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Master.)*Mero: A mermaid who is the fifth girl of the series.  A mermaid with a very royal aura who is obsessed with tragedy and is slightly masochistic.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Danna-sama.)Rachnee: An Arachnee (spider-woman) who is the sixth girl of the series.   Acts like an older sister to the other characters and loves tying people up with her strings.  (Calls Mr. Darling, Honey.)Every main girl in the series possesses quite a number traits which set them apart from just your average tsundere or what have you.  Aside from MonMusu\'s brand of comedy, the girls are the major draw for the show and as such, are more pronounced than what you would normally expect from a generic harem, which is honestly, really nice.And then, we have the main protagonist of the series.  Mr. Darling/Honey/Master/Husband/Sir/Boss, or as his actual name in the series is, Kurusu Kimihito.  To be honest, out of all MC\'s in harem anime history, Mr. Darling is the one guy who is purely plot device.  Hell, I haven\'t even been referring to his actual name much in the review, and they don\'t even do that in the anime.  (Only the manga even mentions his name, and it\'s only like two times.)  As for personality, Mr. Darling adopts the general trait of being nice to all of the girls, accepting every single one of them even though they aren\'t technically human, saying they are a girl first before anything else and puts their needs above his own.  And...that\'s really about it for him.  As a character, he\'s not as pronounced as any other of his co-stars, with his only role in the series to be not only the target of everyone\'s affections, but also to be a human ragdoll.  As I have mentioned before, a lot of the comedy in this show comes from putting this guy on death row.  Because each of the girls have various assets that make them particularly dangerous (Talons, snake constriction, literal horsepower, ability to breathe water, etc...), Mr. Darling often get put on the hot seat amidst their spites and as such, is thrown around, crashed through doors, flown through the air, drowned, suffocated, what have you, to the point that this man is unfazed with the possibility of getting hurt.  (Poor guy)  Even so, as his only real purpose in the series, he is treated as a plot device rather than a character in the series.  (And if anyone is wondering why he doesn\'t bang anyone, it\'s because the law prohibits mating with extraspecies.)As for side characters, MonMusu mostly just has a small group of characters that show up every now and then rather than a huge, expansive cast of people that dip in and out of the story.  Mostly this consists of the government agent ""Smith"" who keeps in touch with Mr. Darling every so often (and steals coffee), as well as her cohorts who are also monster girls.  Aside from them we have other one off monster girls who contribute to the story slightly, but really only serve as plot devices for a specific part of the story.  (Oh yeah, and there\'s Lala.  She\'s not really all that important, lol.)Overview:+ Actually unique harem girls  (I mean...no other series has a snake or a slime as part of the harem.)+ Small side cast that are almost as detailed as the main cast-  MC is a literal plot deviceArt:  Produced by Lerche, a studio well versed in the ways of comedy, MonMusu has a very bright style of animation using a bright color scheme to give off its sense of lightheartedness for the series.  The art itself is rather well detailed and doesn\'t change much or waver in quality whenever the show decides to stay in its standard animation.Though, since this is ecchi...let\'s talk about that, why don\'t we?  As for ecchi, MonMusu is produced with many a breast falling out or exposed somewhere, as well as a lot of, well, movement for them.  As MonMusu is very pronounced in ecchi, there is quite a lot of censorship for the series and for the most part, is actually rather well hidden since it doesn\'t JUST use steam or random bright lights, although they do use them very often.  Just be prepared to witness a lot of pleasured faces, boobs, and stripping because that is just a normal day for Mr. Darling over here.One thing that I have to mention for the art is also its comedy.  Using quite a few exaggerated expressions for characters, mostly having the eyes (mostly Mr. Darling\'s) be nothing more than white circles with a sketch outline, the show delves into this style of animation a lot in conjunction with its standard animation to highlight what comedy and what is not.  (Mr. Darling\'s actual eyes showed up way too often though.  Should\'ve just been white circles for all but 12 times.)Overview:+ Consistent, high quality animation+ Good integration of comedic art style+/- Lots and lots of ecchi.  (This varies with your view on Ecchi as a whole.)Sound: As for its soundtrack, MonMusu has actually quite a bit of musical score that make it a very, very memorable soundtrack.  Let\'s start with its opening ""Let\'s Fall in Love"", where the six main girls in the series singing various parts of the entire thing.  The OP is a very catchy song with the six girls singing about their love in conjunction with its very upbeat tones.  It represents the show perfectly as the entire song is about the girls and also the danger that Mr. Darling is in.As for its ED, MonMusu employs a very different style of ED with rather than a catchy song like its OP, has a rock-style song sung by agent Smith and her extra-species subordinates which gives a very different style of music for the series.  Personally, I would put the OP first, but it is still a pretty good ED.And for special mention, MonMusu also has a pretty memorable background song to the series.  Played during certain sexy or risque moments in the series, there is a certain track that gives you a sense of what you\'re going to expect by using the violin and playing chords to let you know something very sensual is going to happen.  (Thought it was a nice touch.)Overview:+ Memorable soundtrack-  Not exactly a soundtrack that is filled with masterpieces  (Memorable =/= masterpiece)Personal Enjoyment:  MonMusu as a series has become one of my more favorite series in recent years.  As someone who actually enjoys harem, to me, seeing this adaptation come to life has been one of the bigger highlights for this season.  Plus, I actually find this show to be both funny and enjoyable.  (And Mero and Suu are best girls.  Fight me.  :p)Did I enjoy this anime?You know, this question shouldn\'t even be here.  Yes, I loved this anime.  (10/10 enjoyment factor from me.)  Lerche did amazingly by basically following the manga to the letter for the chapters that it did translate, and even did little character bios at the end of every episode to explain the extraspecies that are featured on the show.  (Nice touch.)  It was fantastic seeing some of my favorite scenes in the manga come to life and overall, seeing the characters that I adored come into anime form.What didn\'t I like about this series?It ended.  Next question.Would I recommend this anime?If you\'re as gung-ho about harem, ecchi, and comedy like I am, go for it.  If not, I would tread carefully about watching this show.  It\'s a show that purely serves as perverted  entertainment and nothing else on account of its brand of comedy and its overall setting and genre that it\'s placed in.  As much as I may gush over this show, this show is not for everyone, and unless you are ok with an excessive amount of ecchi, then maybe you shouldn\'t consider watching this. a show that tells you the entire gist of what it\'s going to be in the first 5 minutes of its runtime.Story: So, what if you lived in a world where creatures in mythology actually existed?

Art(up) so what did original creator OKAYADO and illustrator Takaya Sunagawa did was a menagerie of half human, half freaks, with some all freaks added, where even though they do have the boobs and the body, but, their freakish design dampens my lust and even makes me wanna puke, frankly I can\'t imagine how  Darling-kun could bang those freaks even if he could....and if he could, that\'ll would make for a very disgusting hentai , so much so that I\'ll put a bounty on anybody who could murder the original creator (I\'m only kidding), the only way that keeps me from giving this category a 1 is Smith whom I wish would be the one whom Darling-kun would bang (who am I kidding), in fact I like one part where she sports a black crop tank top and white panty.. too bad her fanservice ends there. Sound (up), well , the score is for the opening theme where it matches well with the anime and the voices of the harem member where their tone truly matches their personality, character (up) well, since I did mentioned that this anime is the usual harembased thingy, there is basically no need for me to specify each of the harem member except that there is the lack of the quintessential tsundere , now I can\'t say if Lala would qualify as one, since I haven\'t reach the part of the manga where she is in it.Enjoyment (up), despite of the character design that makes me wanna puke, and the usual harem comedy, on the brighter note I still enjoy watching this thing, but only barely, since this is one anime where I\'d be glad that it ends in a harem ending since I can\'t bare seeing Darling-kun getting on with any of them freaks....well except for Smith, overall (up) ok not because I barely enjoy watching this anime I\'m gonna give it the same score, well putas, I\'m not and lo siento to everyone, I\'m giving this a flat one, since I really find it hard to accept such anime where the character has a menagerie of freaks in his house that makes me wanna puke just imagining how Darling-kun is gonna bang each of his harem member if he can, also it just another harem anime and that\'s that.PEACE ESSESBTW: Season 2.....well there are no news coming from ANN about a possible season 2 and it better be that way.

Most of those are way too unrealistic and are just extended edging until in the final episode, the protagonist who has the personality of a log of wood finally chooses the girl that he was very obviously going to choose from the very start. But this anime isn't like that, so allow me to explain how exactly.Firstly, the premise. Monster Musume takes place in a unique universe with all the monster girl species living with normal humans. The setup perfectly explains the reasoning why all the girls live with the main...character. They don't all fall in love with him immediately for seemingly no reason, they are essentially forced to crash at his house due to circumstances and Kimihito's genuine kindness, caring nature and selflessness eventually wins them over.Speaking of Kimihito, he's a breath of fresh air too. His design is basic, yes, but his personality is not. He's a regular guy who struggles against the circumstances he's put into and tries his best. He genuinely cares about the girls that have become his responsibility and eventually builds genuine bonds with them. Every sensible man knows that it is him that is the best waifu in this series.A good harem anime is of course doomed without the girls and this is yet another strength of Monster Musume, maybe even the biggest one. Each monster girl has a unique personality that makes sense and all of them are lovable and endearing. They have great chemistry with the main character and with each other, which is where all the fun bits of this series derive from. And that's all without mentioning the most unique thing about them - their monster species! Each species has unique biology, quirks, needs, strengths, weaknesses and lore. All of this adds another big and powerful layer that makes not just the girls even more unique and engaging, but helps to actually establish a universe that is surprisingly well constructed and thought out.Of course, Monster Musume is an ecchi series, so there is plenty of fanservice and sexy scenes. I'm not gonna scoot around it, these are great! They're played off really well and integrated in such a way that they don't disrupt the actual flow of the story. Lewd moments in a lot of such anime tend to appear all the time and derail any momentum the story gathers, but I never felt this here. That's not to mention that this is also a comedy anime and a good one at that. Monster Musume is very sexy, very endearing but also incredibly funny, getting plenty of genuine laughs out of me. It manages to achieve all of these different things and balances all of them really well, keeping the whole experience very coherent and easy to follow. Most anime tend to fail at just one of those things, so this is no easy feat.In short, it doesn't matter what you're looking for - some nice eyecandy to look at, some funny jokes to lift up your spirits or a really cute harem anime with a satisfying conclusion. Monster Musume delivers on all fronts and is pure joy from beginning to end.P.S. Suu best girl. Imagine the possibilities! character.

Borderline a hentai without any penetration with a bunch of half human half animal and a dude who is threatened jail time if he pops any cherries.

Clothing rips like their paper, and everything is sexuallized for a laugh.  Don't watch in public even if watching the censored version.No one has any real character besides their initial layer.  Everyone is dumb, horny, and sexy period.  There...is no real story besides meeting new members to add to the harem.  You have to be a real degenerate to watch this show.

(To Love Ru comes in second for me lol). So this anime is just more like a perverted harem anime that makes so many ""sexual jokes""..If you don\'t like ecchi stuff then don\'t read this post cause you may not like it. This anime, I know, its a harem anime, but more ecchi kind.What makes me to give high ratings for this anime is because of the comedy and the romance in it. Because I love watching comedy romance animes. The comedy in it really made me freeze and I laughed out...loud.. Sometimes I disturbed other people lol.The characters.. So kawaii (except for Rachnera the spider-woman).. The characters look amazing, the face, the body, and other stuff are awesome.The art, or I consider it animations, they do look amazing too.. The animations don\'t suck like how I saw on other ""anime"" made by non-japanese people. The movements of the body, especially Miia the snake, the snake body, I mean, it really does look like a real snake, and the spider and the other animals look perfect too. But one thing is, Papi\'s(the harpy) wings will sometimes fold together so suddenly, at first she\'d spread her wings wide open, then when she touched the ground, I felt like the staff didn\'t animate that part..The enjoyment, I gave it a high rating is because, yeah, the comedy, and a bit of ecchiness. I really enjoyed watching this anime because of the jokes they made, some of the jokes I seen before on other ecchi romance animes like this did appear in this anime.Now, last of all, the overall points, I\'d give it a 8 points is because it\'s really enjoyable, if you like ecchi or the comedy in the anime itself.So the pros and cons:Pros:- Kawaii characters that I can\'t even draw them so well- Funny jokes, some times sexual jokes- Great story- Art is amazingCons:- Sometimes I don\'t really understand the story in an episodeNow, there\'s one more thing I wanna say, why does every episode starts with ""Everyday Life With"" and then an certain character. That\'s the weird part about the anime lol..Anyways, guys I hope you liked this review, and PLEASE....

However, with how much this has been hyped lately, I thought I might find something different. Not really.Story: 5Like any harem anime, the story is basically just this.1) Guy meets girl2) Guy meets more girls3) Fanservicey hijinks ensue4) ??????5) ProfitI\'ll admit that one think I enjoyed about the ""story"" here is that it played up a comedy of errors fairly well in many places, at least more so than most other harems I\'ve watched. Sadly, every genuinely funny moment or genuinely heartwarming moment is immediately followed (and ruined) by scenes...that can best be described as sexually awkward. (Full-on bestiality jokes, anyone?)All-in-all, it does better than most harems that I\'m used to in this department, but that\'s not saying a whole lot. At least it didn\'t ruin an awesome premise. *cough* Highschool DxD *cough* Rosario+Vampire *cough*Art: 6The art has a couple of standout moments, and some of the faces designed for the characters are outstanding. Other than that, though, it\'s fairly bland most of the time. Not bad, but certainly nothing to write home about.Sound: 6It\'s a\'ight. I\'ve heard better acting, but it\'s not awful. The soundtrack is kind of limited as well. Not ear-bleedingly bad, but not in any way memorable. However, special note to both the opening and ending, both of which are both catchy and done by the va\'s of the show. (It\'s not important, I know, but I love it when shows do that)Character: 6I\'ve seen WORSE characters. Honestly, while the archetypes themselves were a bit stale, they felt fresh being in this environment. Sort of? It\'s... hard to describe, honestly. Certainly not amazingly brilliant characters, but at times they could be charming. Followed shortly by times of being awkward. See story section above.I will however give special note to the primary character. Darling-kun (his real name is Kimihito Kurusu, but no one seems to fricking care in this universe) is one-note, but he does something truly unique for this genre: he\'s a nice guy.*sigh of disapproval from the audience*Hang on. I mean this in a genuine sense. He\'s got no ulterior motives. He\'s not trying to get in bed with the girls (quite the opposite, as a matter of fact). He\'s not trying to woo anyone, or get anything. He\'s just a decent human being who treats the girls forced to live with him, and pretty much the rest of the world, with kindness because, you know, that\'s what good people do.Too bad he\'s boring as sin other than the design they gave his eyes for most of the show.Five characters (collectively known as MON) are actually kind of fun, and I kind of wish they\'d gotten their own, more comedy-action oriented show. Sadly, overabundance of fanservice apparently took precedent.Enjoyment: 4As stated before, there are some moments that are genuinely funny. (Yay!) There are also some moments that are genuinely sweet. (Awww) Unfortunately, they get ruined about every two minutes, because heaven forbid we have a joke without masturbation references or a loving moment without boobs being shoved in someone\'s face. It\'s a real buzzkill, and unless you\'re here to make your box of Kleenex weigh a little less, you won\'t be enjoying this show that much. If you are here for that reason, seek help. They are part animal, for heaven\'s sake.Overall: 5I can\'t highly recommend this. Is it better than most harems? Eh, sort of. Not by much though. If you aren\'t into the harem genre, this certainly won\'t change your mind. All-in-all, I\'ll just wait for Ouran the Gender-Swapped version.

I am, as such properly labeled a fanboy in this case, but I'll keep it short, sweet and on the up and up. Monster Musume on the whole should not be as insanely popular as it is right now. The anime tore up the charts and the latest American release of the manga is on the NYT Manga Best Seller's list right now. A spot it's predecessors have all enjoyed as well. It also does quite well at home in Japan. What grip Darling and his bevy of monstrous beauties has...on the planet (and me) is beyond me, but all the same, it's quite enjoyable. This isn't going to shake the world, it's a harem rom-com with fantasy elements (okay that's mostly fantasy elements) and you know, it's great at that. Not everything needs to be Citizen Kane.I will note in particular that this is a very faithful adaption of the manga. Frame for panel in some spots!Here's hoping for season two. on the planet (and me) is beyond me, but all the same, it's quite enjoyable.

The show also features plenty of nudity (but, hey, it is an ecchi harem). Overall, my impression of the show was fairly positive, although there are weak aspects in this anime.This anime has surprisingly good music. Opening and Ending songs are catchy, and ending song is something I would listen to.Characters have nice design, and were obviously created with care. The surprising part was ""monster info card"" which appeared at the end of every episode and detailed several different monster girl types.... except that many of those monster girls never even appear in the...anime. This gave me impression of the world having some sort of a well thought out lore behind it.The weakest part of the show is its story - it is nothing speical. While male lead is thankfully not spineless and the story doesn\'t happen in a school (that was fairly surprising), there are many cliched interactions, and characters occasionally act in somewhat less-believable fashion. The story gets better when it starts nearing the last episode.Characters do not really develop much over time, but since the point of story is comedy and because there are a LOT of distinct characters, that is not a very big issue.

Although the story is fairly weak, due its interesting character designs, and nice music, the anime is still enjoyable.With all this in mind, if you\'re interesting in ecchi/harem comedies, the title is definitely worth watching.

No, seriously, it's a HAREM to the bone anime, there's no such thing as a STORY. As the title states, it's just an everyday life... with monsters. Though truth is - for me it was enough. Seeking some depth in that kinda show is like touching a twelve year old in search of a breasts - NO. POINT.Art - well, that's always...the worst part, because it's fully subjective, even as for reviews subjectiveness... That aside - the gfx is nice and pleasing to the eyes. That's all I have to say, since I'm no expert...Sound - hm, truth is, I can't remember any music that will anchor in my mind. But as we know, music isn't the only sfx... Character voices are nice and neatly made, random jingles are also without complaints.Character - yeah, this is where you're gonna hate or love Monster Musume. There are lots of main characters, also a great s***load of supporting ones, which some may find irritating. In my case, it was surprisingly nice and it didn't bother me. Also, every character is different - ain't talking about looks, but personalities of everyone. We got one with nobility and dignity off the charts, another with chuuninbyou complex, yet another is some freaky bondage hothead, while other loves tragic romances, and so forth, and so on... Some of the supports are not developed enough (simply because some just lack screen time), though it wasn't an issue in my case.Enjoyment - I don't particularly like ecchi scenes and something that borders on being hentai, though this one was actually fun to watch. It's coarse. It's stupid. It's simple. It's loud. It's ecchi. But it was also nice and warm, almost like a high-class SoL. I enjoyed every episode and laughed so hard, I got my throat sore and neighbours probably hate me now... It was a time nice spent.Overall - if you're seeking for something more ambitous, dark, with interesting plot and so forth - beat it, go away, shoo. But if you're into something SO stupid, that it's funny (and you don't mind ecchi scenes, or even crave for them), this one's for you. I gave it overall eight, because it fits into my rating scale. Well, I hope you enjoyed this little review, and - as I said in the beggining - be gentle, onii(-nee)-chan... the worst part, because it's fully subjective, even as for reviews subjectiveness...

After about 3 episodes I was hooked though. The character development, and overall story progression took a while for me to get into, but Suu saved my life tbh. Suu is love Suu is life.I absolutely Loved this character, she gave me reason to come back every time. Her dialog and backstory was second only to Jean from AoT. She honestly really does give me hope for the future of these writers.

However, this anime reminded me of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun which I would have never expected, an anime with almost no ecchi vs an anime that's basically a monster girl fetishist haven are incredibly similar in how the comedy is done. I will say it's a downgrade from Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, however, it is still incredibly enjoyable and funny. As for best girl, I want to say Arachnera minus BDSM. "", ""Harem is like romance comedies and slice of life anime to me. It's something I never could really get into and I never liked anything involving harems that much. Either hat or I didn't care. Then I stumbled upon Monster Musume and to this day, I sh*t you not it is probably the only harem anime I like to this day.For those who don't know, I am Josh and today I review the anime known as Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. Or if you don't want to say all those damn words, Monster Musume. Here we goStory- It the generic harem anime. But it gets...a bonus from me being a harem anime with monster girls. Hot monster girls. But it is your average harem anime with ecchi and all that. Doesn't go to the full extreme with its fan service every time cough *Eiken* cough. I will admit some of the jokes are hit and miss for me, but it can be good with its comedy. Overall I give the story a 7/10. Would be a five for being generic harem  but it gets two points for changing it to hot monster girlsArts- Arts pretty good. Nothing particularly bad to say about it really. One of my high points with this anime. Overall it gets a 8/10Characters- I surprisingly like the characters. Granted there are a few I find weird or don't care about, they are all alright. Plus this show does have one of my favorite characters in anime Papi who I love the most in this anime. It's just so sing about her that makes her a favorite of mine. The rest of the harem are alright. Plus I got to give them some credit for not making the MC a complete dumbass. I'll give him credit since he does seem able to voice his displeasure which a lot of harem MCs never seem to do.

My typical response to harem anime is to roll my eyes while running full speed in the opposite direction.  However, when I saw some art for the show on Tumblr, I thought to myself, “Well, I’m an open-minded guy, I can watch at least one episode of this show.”  (This decision may or may not have been influenced by the, shall we say, “voluptuousness” of the girls.)  After tracking the show down on Crunchyroll, I watched the first episode.  And then I watched the next one....And the next one.  And the… (you get the idea).Monster Musume is nothing short of miraculous.  I might even go so far as to proclaim it a harem masterpiece (take that as you will).  Over the course of its twelve episodes, it started out as an “Oh my god, this is literally porn, why am I watching this?” show, then transformed into a guilty pleasure, and eventually became a genuine pleasure.  I liked this show so much that, after it ended, I went out and bought the manga (which I also recommend, though be warned: it’s even more NSFW than the anime).  It also completely changed my perspective on harem anime, motivating me to voluntarily check out other entries in the genre such as Trinity Seven (pretty bad) and High School DxD (surprisingly entertaining).My main complaint with most harems is how contrived the premise is: the main character somehow finds himself surrounded by beautiful women who all want to sleep with him, yet he’s unable to “seal the deal” with any of them and nobody ends up satisfied, most of all the viewer.  Here, however, the show takes this premise and makes it somewhat believable.  Kimihito, the show's male protagonist, becomes the hapless host of a menagerie of buxom beast-women thanks to a convenient clerical error.  However, despite their numerous and rather aggressive advances, he can’t sleep with any of his houseguests because (1) it would be illegal, as the law forbids human-interspecies copulation, and (2) he might die in the process (though I suppose there are worse ways to go).  There’s also the implication that, because the Monster Girls are all part animal (mermaid, centaur, etc.), their mutual desire to bang Kimihito stems from a heightened instinct to procreate, particularly in the case of Monster Girls from female-only species.  (There’s also the fact that Kimihito is a “nice guy,” which I suppose still counts for something, at least in anime.)The underlying concept of the show is quite clever, with the integration of Monster Girls into Japanese society mirroring current real-life civil rights issues like gay marriage.  Additionally, the characters are fantastic, both in their designs and their personalities (yes, even Kimihito, whose blank, dead-eyed expression just screams “What has my life become?”).  I’m particularly a fan of Miia—the hot-tempered Lamia/snake-girl—and Rachnera—the cunning Arachne/spider-girl; indeed, they both stirred within me certain fetishes I had heretofore been unaware I possessed.  My favorite parts of the show are the interactions of the Monster Girls with both Kimihito and each other, which often lead to naughty situations and comedy gold (and, occasionally, character development).What else?  I’m a sucker for mythology, and this show has some great world-building, particularly in the Monster Girl Collection Cards at the end of each episode.  While the animation overall is only okay, the animation in episodes 1 and 12 is phenominal, demonstrating once again that, when they make the effort, Studio Lerche can do stellar work (for another example, check out their Fate/Prototype OVA from 2011).  It makes me wish the animation quality was at that level for the entire series, but I'll take what I can get.  The music is good (especially Rachnera’s base-line leitmotif), the OP is addictive, and the ED is surprisingly solid.  Finally, the show is eminently rewatchable, with the comedy and storytelling holding up for me even after repeated viewings.Am I going to hell for giving this show a 10/10?  Maybe, but it's still the show I derived the most entertainment from during the Summer 2015 anime season.  That being said, the show definitely isn’t for everyone, since it’s pretty much nothing but fanservice (which is what pornography is, after all).  Personally, I found the gratuitous lewdness so over-the-top that it became hilarious, almost serving as a parody of Japan’s hentai industry.  In the end, I’m really glad I took a chance on this show, and I hope you do to. And the next one.  And the… (you get the idea).Monster Musume is nothing short of miraculous.

Which in the case of this anime could have been its redeeming quality but it is ignored and the ecchi harem formula is followed to a T.', 'I\'m keep it straight here. I\'m simple man, with simple pleasures. I\'ve giving this a 9 rating because I\'ma bias and have a monstergirl fetish, BUT I\'m do this review as non-bias as I can and Im going tell a lot of people to skip this even though I gave it a 9. I\'m also going to divide this review for everyone here so you don\'t have to read an entire book just to get an idea of the show. You can also just skip to summary at end if you want the in a nutshell version.If your new to anime and curious about this...show, there are much better shows you could be watching. Put this onto your ""To watch later list"" and maybe down the line consider looking at it, depending on how you feel about ecchi.If your coming from the manga and you enjoy it, then your going to have a fun time. If your didn\'t like the manga then don\'t expect much and move on to the next anime.If your like my friend, who despises with a furious passion any show with any hint of ecchi within a show, steer clear.If you don\'t mind the ecchi as long as isn\'t mindless and shoved down your throat every 10 second, you should be good... but then you will probably have mixed feelings. The show isn\'t completely always ecchi, but when this show does its fair amount of ecchi, it doesn\'t slack in anyway. At times it can seem excessive especially in the uncensored version since they definitely go out of their way for it at times. I may even recommend watching it censored at this point and have you deal with the white streaks in the earlier episodes, then switching to uncensored along the halfway mark when the show\'s ecchi is toned down. This is because, in the uncensored version, they don\'t just remove the white streaks but they add more ecchi things here and there that were not there originally in the censored version which may seem unnecessary and feel like it\'s being shoved down your throat. If you can\'t handle the white streaks then just go uncensored but you have been warned. That being said, the monstergirl twist may be unique and refreshing enough to allow to push forward and blow it off as not that bad, but that just depends on the person.The show is based on a lot of rom-com/ecchi humor, so if not into that kind of stuff your probably going to be disappointed and you should skip this one. There is plenty non ecchi/rom-com humor here and there, but your better of watching something else if is the only thing your looking for. If your looking do give rom-com and ecchi humor another shot, you can watch this show, but you should probably look elsewhere for a show that focus\'s more on the humor rather than a combination of ecchi and humor.If you can enjoy some ecchi and rom-com/ecchi humor, your going to have a good time here. The show\'s source material is original and the cast of characters personalities are fresh and unique so don\'t worry about your cookie cutter personalities that you find in most harems. MC is quite likable, unlike your common harem MC\'s, where you want to punch your monitor at times. The show also doesn\'t focus on the romance so you\'re not going to be force to watch pointless drama with back to back teasers scenes with each girl; the classic phone call that interrupts a kiss scene. The monstergirl twist to the rom-com/ecchi humor is very refreshing even to veterans and its very well done. The plot is a bit lighthearted, so don\'t be expecting anything deep and intellectual, but not garbage like most harems. If you haven\'t gotten the message at this point, the show doesn\'t share the usual harem anime problems. The show can even feel like a slice of life at times, but it generally has a forward momentum so it doesn\'t feel stagnate.Now if here your here for some ""plot"" don\'t you worry. Enjoy the uncensored oppai to the fullest and be amazed on how every girl seems to never wear a bra when they get wet. No but seriously... The ""plot"" isn\'t over the top though, but certainly not lacking. Suu and Rachnera are going to be your best friends. Hopefully you can enjoy the monstegirl twist to the ecchi as well and turn to the dark side like me, though I was on the dark side before this show. If you pm me, I may provide links/pics to allow you to find a new side to you ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).. eehh but enough of that for now.If your looking for male ""plot"" look elsewhere. There isn\'t even a trap for even the hint of yaoi.Now if you have monstergirl fetish such as I, You\'ll probably understand why I rated it a 9.  You also should just soak in this show\'s ecchi in as much as you can because we ain\'t going to get anything better than this for a long time. . Our long wait for animated hentai of monstergirls is still going to continue, but this show may draw enough attention for one to be made. You can be hopeful, but don\'t be surprised if they make one that its low quality or just based off this anime. For now we will just have to continue to indulge in the normal stuff. If you have no idea wtf I\'ma saying, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) pm me, and let me show you.SUMMARY: Don\'t like ecchi any rom-com/ecchi humor, look elsewhere. If your on the fence about it then i would point you elsewhere but watching this wouldn\'t be bad... But definitely far from the worst, hands down. Otherwise try it out and get past at least the first 4 episodes before you decide to drop or not. The show is slow at introducing all its main characters so it hard to say where exactly to stop, but you should get the general flow at that point, though be ready for the heavy ecchi when Suu arrives. The show overall is definitely one of the better harem ecchi\'s out there, so if you holding back because of the harem tag, don\'t, because the show doesn\'t share the usual harem anime problems. Thus is my verdict show, there are much better shows you could be watching.

Thus is my verdict', 'Monster Musume is a rather interesting show to watch. I generally am not a fan of the whole harem and ecchi combination, but Monster Musume is a different cup of tea.tl;dr version: Monster Musume is a well executed series that makes up for its lack of a storyline by utilizing and succeeding with comedy and satire.The Long Version:(This next paragraph talks about my experiences with the manga, however, it brings up a point I want to mention)When I first began reading the manga (of which I\'m still reading at Chapter 35), I didn\'t have a good feeling about it since I had heard it would...have similar tags as this. Around the 20th chapter, I realized something about this series that is the very reason it has kept my interest this long.MONSTER MUSUME IS NOT A SERIES THAT FOCUSES ON STORY. (Will mention more about this in the story segment)Rating Breakdown:Story:(5 out of 10):As mentioned earlier, this series isn\'t one that particularily has a story. One could argue that its story is how our main MC goes through his everyday life with several monster girls living with him, but that\'s not what I\'m getting at here. Despite lacking the story that many series are known for, Monster Musume makes up in its comedic almost even satirical ""What if..."" scenario. The reason I have given it a 5? Because despite its weak storyline, it still has a decent enough writing to keep those that watch the series interested. (I\'ll touch more on that in enjoyment).Art (9 out of 10):What? I rarely give out tens for anything unless specifically mentioned.Seriously though, I\'m still having a hard time seeing any issues with the art or animation. It is well done. This will more than likely change a little upon completion of this series (in which I\'ll rewrite this review due to MAL policy)Sound (9 out of 10):I\'m sure there are more people like me who read manga and when an anime adaptation comes out, we\'re like ""I hope [character] sounds like this..."" or something like that. Hey, don\'t judge me...Anyway, all of the voices were well done as they all fit their personalities. To pick examples; Manako the Monoeye , Papi the Harpy, and Suu the Slime were the three voices that I believe were nailed directly on the head.Meanwhile, on another note, I personally love the MON ending.Character(8 out of 10):Normally, my character rating is based on initial personality, character development and character personality persistence (does the character maintain their personality and any slight changes all the way through or does it seem to disappear?). Since it was mentioned that this series doesn\'t really have a story, this rating would generally reflect that missing element. Being aware of this special case, I focused more on the first and last elements. Most of the characters have well thought out personalities from the start. Between a overly obsessed romanticist, loyal and chivalry-type, birdbrain, airhead, tragic lover, and a sadist that are combined with their traits for being of a certain species, makes the interactions between each of them and the male MC (who doesn\'t have much to him outside of being a nice guy) rather comical.Enjoyment (10 out of 10):Yes, there is a 10...oh boy...As I\'ve said countless times, this show focuses more on comedy. Just like in the manga, I\'ve laughed countless times at the various jabs of humor and satire. Whether it\'s a simple question as to how a snake uses a toilet to our lovely harpy forgetting her own name because she\'s a birdbrain, the show utilizes its creativity for (to be blunt) making fun of what it would be like if these other species were living lives similar to our own. Monster Musume\'s use of comedy with irony also adds to its enjoyment factor. I\'d give some more examples, but I don\'t like to spoil and I think I\'ve spoiled a little bit. (If you\'re that interested, watch it).Original Story: 8/10Final Score: 9/10 - Excellent execution of the series that remained closely tied to the original manga.Summary:For those that came here looking for an anime with a fantastic story and really good characters, I\'m sorry these aren\'t the monster girls you are looking for (Bad reference is bad). If you want a good laugh with an anime that takes a ride on the more comedic side of entertainment, this is a show for you.[Not related]: Since I\'m still new to reviewing, feel free to PM me or post to my profile any feedback that would help make my reviews better. See you all around! have similar tags as this. Around the 20th chapter, I realized something about this series that is the very reason it has kept my interest this long.MONSTER MUSUME IS NOT A SERIES THAT FOCUSES ON STORY. (Will mention more about this in the story segment)Rating Breakdown:Story:(5 out of 10):As mentioned earlier, this series isn\'t one that particularily has a story. One could argue that its story is how our main MC goes through his everyday life with several monster girls living with him, but that\'s not what I\'m getting at here. Despite lacking the story that many series are known for, Monster Musume makes up in its comedic almost even satirical ""What if..."" scenario. The reason I have given it a 5? Because despite its weak storyline, it still has a decent enough writing to keep those that watch the series interested. (I\'ll touch more on that in enjoyment).Art (9 out of 10):What? I rarely give out tens for anything unless specifically mentioned.Seriously though, I\'m still having a hard time seeing any issues with the art or animation. It is well done. This will more than likely change a little upon completion of this series (in which I\'ll rewrite this review due to MAL policy)Sound (9 out of 10):I\'m sure there are more people like me who read manga and when an anime adaptation comes out, we\'re like ""I hope [character] sounds like this..."" or something like that. Hey, don\'t judge me...Anyway, all of the voices were well done as they all fit their personalities. To pick examples; Manako the Monoeye , Papi the Harpy, and Suu the Slime were the three voices that I believe were nailed directly on the head.Meanwhile, on another note, I personally love the MON ending.Character(8 out of 10):Normally, my character rating is based on initial personality, character development and character personality persistence (does the character maintain their personality and any slight changes all the way through or does it seem to disappear?). Since it was mentioned that this series doesn\'t really have a story, this rating would generally reflect that missing element.

See you all around!', 'Here is our review on the anime counterpart to the manga, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou/Everyday Life with Monster Girls.The anime is great. The characters are very fun to watch, and lots of action, adventure, suspense, and much more. Although it’s completely based off of the manga, most of the scenes are hit or miss, but mostly miss. Only a few scenes are actually accurate while the rest are either a bit accurate, or they’re not even there and are completely missing. But this is most likely backed by extra made-up scenes seen in multiple episodes. English translation is a complete miss, absolutely none of...the words match the manga. Not even Centorea’s speaking which is unique. As for being ecchi, the anime sexual activity and nudity is extremely often but it also keeps it’s limit to it, which is still very high. The animation is smooth and pleasing to watch with deep, vivid colors, lots of depth, and loads of detail. The audio quality is a downfall. it sounds fine already, but it’s extremely soft and completely lacks depth and at some points, amplification. This is mainly observed with the opening and closing of the anime. The opening for the anime is nice, very catchy, but also annoying. But is both, annoying in a good way, and annoying period. Also, Suu’s singing is extremely faint compared to the rest of the girls singing. This is heavily noticed when you compare it to Centorea and Rachnera’s singing, which are very bold. The animation is quite nice as well. The closing for the anime is between heavy rock and light metal. The song is amazing but has it’s drawbacks. Mainly, it lacks depth badly. So badly, it actually sounds kinda mono at some points. The animation for doesn’t really have any animation whatsoever except for the near ending. It feels much more like a slideshow, but it also shows chibi versions of Droppel, Manako, Zombina, and Tionishia. So basically it’s half-and-half for both, intro and outro.This anime is good, very good. But it does have it’s many draw backs. It has great audio, decent music, great color, art, and detail, engaging characters, and plenty of potential to grow in the future. But the way it currently is, it simply is not, and may never be as good as it’s manga counterpart without it’s much needed improvements. the words match the manga.

It is a normal boy who inadvertently becomes involved in the monster care program inhuman and ends up living with 6 different. It has no quality especially when the time comes but can turn into a hero, and that\'s why his great kindness and all the girls he lives is just falling for him.-Miia: A woman-snake (Lamia). It is the first inhuman to live with Kurusu, and falls in love with Kurusu. she has a very sweet personality but sometimes too protective towards Kurusu, while rival comes to regard love the other girls who come to live with them.Papi: It\'s a bird-woman. Despite being an adult woman has a body and a personality of a teenager. Often skips the rules and is quite clumsy and always wants to play with everyone.-Centorea: Is a woman-horse (centaur). Besides its imposing front, she has a great sense of honor and obedience to her master (Kurusu) for whom would not hesitate to draw his sword (even a replica) to defend him from harm.-Lorelei: It\'s a mermaid. It has an extremely sweet and friendly personality that makes Kurusu interested in it from the beginning. It has a peculiar taste for romances ending in drama or accidents that sometimes gives a touch ""sadist"".Sue: It\'s a woman-slime. she has a body that can take any form and feeds water.  initially has the personality of a child to be taught but can become very friendly to Kurusu who has accepted it yet.-Rachnera: A spider woman. It has a fairly large body relative to the others. It is characterized by a rather sadomasochistic personality and likes to demonstrate binding and doing ""things"" to others.ART: This is certainly one of the strengths of the anime for more than obvious reasons: THE GIRLS.All of this inhuman anime have a really good design and based on the difficulty of monsters have done are perfectUndoubtedly, the OPPAIS perfect sizes that are sure to delight lovers ecchi if we talk uncensoredI can say that is an anime with a normal animation in what fits, but I admit that I have not paid much since my eyes have focused directly on the OPPAI of the girls.SOUND: It has a music room as is common in comedy animes.On the other hand we have the opening, which I liked a lot because it makes you a presentation of all the characters with a melody quite livelyENJOYMENT: I think they have wasted a good base argument with the whole issue of the inhuman.

Therefore this will be a longer review. If you are looking for something that quickly summarises the scores someone has given then you are better looking elsewhere. This is designed to be a detailed breakdown of the show.Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\'s a flying pair of boobs in your face because for today\'s review we\'re heading into the world of ecchi anime. Monster Musume tells the story of some guy who jerks off a snake girl so that she orgasms in order...for him to be released from her tight grip. Yeah, this is the sort of stuff ecchi was born for.I\'m not joking when I say that description I\'ve just given is genuinely the first scene you see within this show and my reaction was the same as everyone else\'s, ""What did I just see?"" So, what\'s the show about? Well, basically, it\'s a massive harem of monster girls coming to live with a human dude. You see the events that occur for them to end up in his ever-growing household and then the every day life events that occur after they\'re there. It\'s far from a classy show but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing. After all, for every plot driven phenomenon like Death Note it\'s good to have a more trashy show that tries to achieve appeal in the most basic form, breasts and comedy. There\'s not really much more to say about the plot because there just isn\'t one. This is your regular comedy ecchi show with some monster girls in. Nothing more, nothing less.Viewing exactly how it goes about being what I\'ve just said I have to say it does a very good job. At first I was a bit off put on the show as I just didn\'t get what it was trying to be but then it hit me, it didn\'t know either. It didn\'t care to know because this show is pretty much the anime definition of brainless fun to its very core. I can\'t say at all that it\'s a clever show but at the end of the day it did make me laugh a lot and I mean a lot indeed. It\'s hilarious and honestly the weakest parts of the show came when it tried to be something more than just a harem, ecchi comedy show. There were parts where it tried to be touching (not in that way, well... actually) or emotional but it didn\'t come off right at all. It was occasionally trying to be something it never was going to be. Stick to the ecchi jokes from now on guys and you have the thumbs up from me.Being a harem show it\'s crucially important that the characters were on point for this show and I\'m happy to say the were mostly. There are a couple of characters I personally didn\'t care for such as the entire Monster Ops: Neutralization squad which couldn\'t have been less interesting had they tried. I can\'t believe they got an entire episode to themselves and the ending features them. Truthfully though that\'s a rather subjective view. They aren\'t horrifically written, just not my thing. As for the main girls though they all score very well as they are all genuinely very different. To quickly skim through them we\'ve got the yandere snake girl (Miia), the bondage spider girl (Rachnera), the fairy tale addict mermaid (Meroune), the lolicon bird (Papi), the miss proportioned centaur (Cerea), the ""Ha, I\'m inside you"" joke catalyst slime girl (Suu) and the one no one really remembers (Lala... I think). We\'ve also got the protagonist who actually has slightly more of a personality then you might think for a harem although that\'s a bit like saying the headache you\'ve got is a slightly less annoying then you\'d expect. The point stands still though, it\'s annoying. Similarly he really still doesn\'t have much going for him and so I\'m not going to waste my time talking about Mr. Kimihito. Going back to the girls it\'s a bit difficult to go through all of them individually so instead I\'ll just briefly highlight the notable characters to you. Miia is best girl and if you disagree you\'re wrong. Who doesn\'t love a lamia-like snake girl who goes bat shit crazy every time some even tries to get near her ""DAARRRLLINNG!"" She says that a lot by the way. I also really like Mero as her two faced attitude can make for some really funny moments. The way she manipulates Miia into thinking she\'s helping her get close to Kurusu but in reality she\'s getting herself closer is funny too. It\'s even funnier when Miia realises what\'s going on. Outside of these two though no one really appealed to me. To its credit though I liked all the girls at least enough to support them which is very rare in a harem. Kudos for that I guess.One thing I have to give this show huge credit for is its artistic merit. A lot of harems that I\'ve seen are very lazy and ecchis even more so but there\'s no evidence of this here. It\'s a very good looking show which will keep you engaged visually for the entirety of its season. There are a lot of vivid colours to take in and overall it\'s just a very appealing aesthetic they\'ve chosen. Much can be said for the animation too. Whilst I\'ve seen better animated shows in my time that certainly doesn\'t mean you\'ll be missing out if you choose to dive into this show. All the scenes flow smoothly, there\'s very little lazy animating (which is sadly becoming more and more common today) and overall it runs just how you would want it to. Very little to complain about on this front.The opening of this show has very quickly attached itself to iPod music library and it\'s very obvious as of to why this is. The song is very catchy and fast paced, extremely suitable for the kind of show Monster Musume is. The visuals come and go at an equally quick pace but there\'s lots to look at and the opening is sure to get you into every episode as one should. It\'s also a really nice touch to have the voice actresses sing the opening. I know it\'s not the first show to do so (K-ON! also did this for example) but regardless it\'s a nice touch which raises the overall quality in my opinion at least. The ending is somewhat of an acquired taste as far as I\'m concerned. I really didn\'t enjoy it too much and after 3/4 episodes I found myself just skipping it but I\'ve seen a lot of other people really enjoy it so give a try at the least.So then is Monster Musume worth your time? Well it\'s somewhat niche and I can\'t see this being one of those shows that everybody loves but it definitely has its place in the world of anime. I would think anyone into ecchi shows is bound to enjoy it but even the wider fan base of just comedies might get something out of this too. It\'s very funny and it achieves its primary purpose (to entertain) with flying colours. Truthfully the show does lack any description of a plot but I don\'t really think it would even benefit from one. The shows appeal is its characters and its humour which I feel is the right way to go for the kind of show it is. Monster Musume does the job it sets out to do well and for that reason I can recommend this anime even if it is with a hint of precaution.Story: 6/10Art: 9/10Sound: 8/10Character: 7/10Enjoyment: 8/10OVERALL: 8/10 for him to be released from her tight grip.

People describe the different species as ""fetishes met"", but I see it as ""accepting someone for who they are, rather than what they look like"". It\'s all a matter of perspective I suppose. I do think the story would\'ve been better if they put some more focus on the actual learning between different worlds, maybe throw him into their world for an episode or 2, which would probably make the anime a bit longer in the process.I do know that I would love it if they made a second season for...this, possibly sending him to their world for a few episodes, actually telling us who he\'s choosing or a few other species as side characters (some male ""monsters"" would be nice as well, since the only ones in the anime are the group of orcs).Overall, my opinion: The characters are likable, the art and animation are good, the story is decent, the opening is cute-ish, the ending is awesome and the anime is just entertaining. this, possibly sending him to their world for a few episodes, actually telling us who he\'s choosing or a few other species as side characters (some male ""monsters"" would be nice as well, since the only ones in the anime are the group of orcs).Overall, my opinion: The characters are likable, the art and animation are good, the story is decent, the opening is cute-ish, the ending is awesome and the anime is just entertaining.', ""For a show about cute monster girls, this takes on a much lighter tone than you might imagine. The animation is top notch and the characters are very good. The story and setting are better than most might expect. The lines and dialogue are almost always fun or funny. If I had to mention something I didn't like, it would be that the main character is not all that entertaining. If I had to mention something I liked, it would be the rather well thought out approach of each individual character. Rather than simply slapping on a generic personality to each character, each character has...a personality based on their species of monster. And of course, the ecchi! Favorite character: Suu. I give it a 8.5/10TLDR Version: Looks good, ecchi, characters are funny and cute. Not much else. a personality based on their species of monster. And of course, the ecchi! Favorite character: Suu.

Not much else."", 'Usually harems aren\'t something I generally go for, what with them usually being generic and bland with a boring copy-paste main-protagonist-slice-of-plain-pizza that everyone wants for some reason, tedious jealous fits from the girls which waste the potential of ever having an actual plot because of the pointless fighting and bickering, and not to mention the sexism and the same old tropes and all that good stuff that comes with the genre. ButMonster Musume, however, was a very different experience for me, at least.Firstly, from the first episode, I found this series to actually be pretty /relatable/, of all things... x\'D I am transgender, and...I am all too familiar with feeling discriminated, alienated, disrespected, and receiving the always common dirty looks from passers-by simply because of who I am, what parts I may or may not have, and how I look like, and all that society has to go one in regards to knowing anything about me are harmful stereotypes that might make me out to be scary or dangerous. Monster Musume tells a story of finally finding acceptance and trust in someone after constantly being rejected and feeling insecure and the like, finding someone where all these things that might set them apart from the rest of society really doesn\'t matter, and are treated simply as normal girls with a chance at love.It\'s also explained in the premise of the series that monster girls have always been around, but have only recently been accepted into society and are protected under law, albeit with many holes, which striked me as all too familiar with the recent recognition that trans people are finally starting to get in many parts of the world. Certain scenes seemed to highlight how despite their acceptance in society, there was still a long way to go as far real acceptance from the general populace.But relatability aside, the sexual innuendos were pretty heavy throughout the series, and at first it caught me a little off guard; I was expecting some suggestive themes for sure (it is a harem, after all), but I didn\'t expect it to go as far as it did at times... x\'D Again, usually not my thing, I have to be in a certain mood to enjoy such things, admittedly, but nonetheless, it was still quite welcome, I guess... x\'D The art style and animation was pretty good too, especially in the finale, they really wanted to put a bow on it when wrapping it all up.My only real tiff with the series was how bland our main protagonist Darling-kun was (he was so bland, I couldn\'t bother to remember his name...); alas, I suppose that\'s what comes with being the star of a harem series. But nonetheless, they did include something of a potential dark past to him in the finale, which was probably a joke but could have actually led to something and spice up his character a little? x\'D The girls themselves definitely weren\'t generic, and they actually had stories to go along with them that actually managed to get me to grow an attachment to each of them, but even so, they still sometimes filled in the usual roles/tropes in the harem, what with there being a loli (plot-twist, there was actually more than one x\'D But one could change her form between loli and big-breasted beauty, so I\'m still not sure if that counts, but in any case...), and et cetera.All in all, this series was simply at its core fun and light-hearted, and it definitely got a few laughs out of me.

This anime is as close to hentai as it gets. The fun factor, in my opinion, is more than High School DxD. The story is fun, each character has their own persona which stands out throughout the series. Though the concept of 'monster girls' seems like a turn off at first, it kind of grows onto you. In fact, it makes the anime even better and a standout from your everyday Ecchi. Though...the characters are in their teens, the concept of school-life is not shown, making it much more different than most Ecchi anime these days. It is a must watch if you are even slightly interested in Ecchi anime and want a change from your standard high school-harem, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a choice with which you simply cant go wrong. the characters are in their teens, the concept of school-life is not shown, making it much more different than most Ecchi anime these days.

Anyone who does not enjoy this anime is uncultured."", 'With the Summer 2015 anime season coming to a close, Mon Musume is one ecchi, harem anime that made summer enjoyable.The animation is smooth enough for the show to be watchable and the voice acting really matches the characters and brings out the life, beauty and cuteness within each monster girl. The art style was not super amazing with the artwork looking a bit rushed, but I was impressed at how well the animators have depicted the hybrid monster people and their movements. If the studio had more time, they could have polished the animation match the manga\'s illustrations. But, I understand that making...an anime adaptation is difficult and takes a lot of hard work.Nonetheless, the idea of a harem with a variety of monster girls is a good one, at least for this anime. Even though the main plot is a bit unclear at first, I found the fan service and ecchi elements to be as equally satisfying as an anime with a serious plot. The anime was clear in the introduction of new characters, but the ecchi element overpowered storytelling, making any story irrelevant which is essential to most slice of life anime. I have not fully read the manga yet so I may be mistaken about the actual story. Regardless, it was hilarious to watch Darling-kun\'s interactions with the monster girls. It really shed light on the slice of life part of this anime in which I felt like a person who is just hanging out with Mon Musume\'s characters--almost felt like I was going on a date every week until the 12th episode. This anime does not really need any serious plot at all. It is fine with just comedy and harem elements as ""every day life with monster girls"" lets life in this anime flow naturally.Mon Musume is one those anime that has the characters accept that they\'re in a harem and the MC is not that dense. So, be rest assured that this harem will be enjoyable despite the great possibility that the MC will never choose a girl in the future.Overall, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou was a good summer anime of 2015 though not the best of the best one out there, acknowledging that there are other similar series that may be better than this one. But I enjoyed MonMusu quite a bit to the point where I am finding snake and spider girls to be attractive, leading me to question my corrupted life. As a person spectating the shipping competitions, I am looking forward to a second season of this hilarious anime.Though others will disagree with my rating due to my naivety of anime analysis, I am a ""kohai"" in the anime realm, hoping that my future reviews will be better than this one.

It is always girls trying battle each other to see who is more kawaii. Monster Musume fits that category. So why the heck did I like it IOAOAEOAEOAWEOAWO ? ????????????Story: 8/10Monster Musume is about monster girls' everyday life with our lucky protagonist. Due to the new law reinforcement, where monster girls come to the human society as an home stay exchange student, to gain a better understanding of each other's culture....Not much real plotline, but hey incorporate interesting facts about animals(like snake shedding) and fit the characters into simple plain character traits we all see today. The protagonist got a bunch of very radical looking monster girls(not those that only have a flurry tail at the back) into his house, due to various reasons. I do not think that there is much comedy involved as many people implied(There are so much more funnier comedy Animes out there), I think this is more of a slice of life Anime.Art: 10/10What can say, the art style fits my um, taste very well, >.> I watched the entire anime standing up! Great exercise Anime! HAHAHAHAHAHA...no. ALSO WATCH DA UNCENSORED VERSION, THRUST ME, I MEAN TRUST ME :D.Sound: 10/10Just the regular happy OST you find at every comedic and slice of life anime. Nothing much to say. But why 10/10 you ask. I mean, the voice acting :3Character: 8/10Many flat characters, without much development. Trust me it does not matter too much in this type of anime, the author did wisely use the different animal traits of the female casts, some are not really that interesting and some does not even make sense, but hey, it is monster girls :3Enjoyment: 10/10Fuck yeah!(Literally)Overall: 10/10Monster Musume is gotta be one my all time favorite Anime, not sure why, I've been reading the manga, I'd have to say some shit just do not make sense, but the Anime itself gets a full marks from me, perhaps it is due to the plucky attempt by the author to draw something so radical from the usually harem anime that we often see and neglect. I've always liked demi-human characters, like Holo ze wize wolf, she is so cute and demanding, but dude, her fluffy tail is amazing =w=. I would say that I've discovered a fetish that I never have known I have had, makes me think about life. Last time I thought I just like the idea, now I know it makes me rock solid. I honest do not know how to feel about this anime.

A bad series that I watched from start to finish. I actually have a tremendous amount of guilt laying over me for doing so, but I just couldn\'t stop clinging desperately to the hope that it MIGHT have a redeeming quality strong enough to justify its existence.The best way to describe this show, that I\'ve found, is to label it as a parody of a well-established genre. A spin-off, poking fun at the tropes and cliches of a well-loved and solid-standing category of...anime for fans to have a cheap laugh at. The problem? There is no well-established genre. This is it. Monster Musume is the the foremost flagship of the Monster Girl anime genre. A fruit ripe for picking, full of potential for adventure, deep story telling, and compelling characters, reduced to cheap sex jokes and one dimensional personalities. Even after all twelve episodes of this travesty, I\'m still unable to remember the protagonist\'s name, so unmemorable was he.In short, Monster Musume is a show (for lack of a better word) about a modern day Japan that has seen a supernatural influx of Demi-human ""monsters"" (the origin of which remains either a complete mystery, or briefly glossed over. I can\'t remember if it\'s mentioned even once). After determining that the ""monsters"" are sentient and not trying to invade the country, the Japanese government implements a program to help these individuals ease into human society and deal with cultural differences. They are paired with human host families to help open relations between human and monster societies. Overall, not a terrible concept for a show. The execution on the other hand... that\'s a different story.I wish I could take credit for this summary of the plot, but alas, it was written by a friend on a challenge to summarize an anime while making it sound as awful as possible. It\'s sadly accurate:""A straight, Japanese man suddenly finds himself the very unwilling sponsor for a bunch of foreign women who keep sexually harassing him. Several of them are special needs. He would like to wonder how exactly this is even legal but he\'s too busy trying not to be killed by being slapped around by a bunch of bigger, stronger women. Eventually he\'s told that he is now not only allowed to marry one of them, he is now legally obligated to do so even though he is blatantly not interested in any of them.""So let\'s analyze this show a little more closely and see what they did right and wrong. Yes! Not every single line in show is a travesty, believe it or not.The first monster girl that our ""hero"" hosts is a lamia, a half-snake half-human. Being a harem anime, she immediately has an attraction to our nondescript protagonist, fawning possessively over him at every turn. Her defining characteristic is being a bad cook and... Well, that\'s about it, really. She\'s about as interesting as a wooden block, so I\'m going to have to take a point off right there.Our second monster girl is a harpy, and already we see a problem with this. Traditionally, harpy and lamia mythos is very similar, almost identical even, so the writer has backed himself in to a corner early on. How are we going to differentiate these characters in a way that makes sense? Well, in order to make sure the characters weren\'t too similar, he makes the harpy a complete moron. Because, you know, a ""bird brain!"" Yup. We\'re basing our character\'s personality on a pun. My biggest problem with this? Birds are actually very smart. One of the smartest species on our planet. So... great call there. I\'m just going to tell you flat out that there\'s a scene in which the main character is feeding ice cream to the harpy in a park, the ""joke"" of the scene being that it looks like she\'s performing fellatio on him in front of a group of people. It\'s made even ""funnier"" by the fact that our harpy character looks very young. Because, you know... pedophilia is hysterical! HAHAHA! IT\'S SO FUNNY, RIGHT?! No... It\'s an awkward and horrendous scene designed for shock value. Heaven forbid you be watching with another individual. You might not be able to look each other in the eye for the rest of the day.Harem girl number three is a centaur. She has some genuinely alright moments, and a lot of potential (that, naturally, goes unused) to be an interesting character. She hails from a land of knights and monarchy, but all that gets thrown out the window when you learn, in the first encounter with her, that she came to Japan so she could find her true love via contrived anime plot or some such crap. I don\'t know... I wasn\'t paying that much attention. Anyway, our heroic, not-quite-as-interesting-as-a-moldy-piece-of-cheese protagonist and our centaur lady chase a thief in the first scene we see them together. He jumps on her back and chases the thief down on his scooter. We later learn that riding a centaur without her permission is actually the equivalent of rape in their society. When he apologizes for his mistake, she immediately forgives and falls in love with him. That\'s right kids. I guess the lesson here is if you rape someone and tell them you\'re sorry, everything will be just peachy keen and they\'ll swear their undying loyalty to you. Except, guess what? That\'s NOT how it works, and this scene is implying some pretty horrendously flawed ideals.Next we have a mermaid and a goo-girl. They\'re exactly what they sound like. There are some interesting moments regarding the mermaid and how she can get around on land, and how they have to modify the housing for her to live in, but for the most part it\'s all just a bunch of squandered potential. The mermaid\'s thing is she wants to be involved in a romantic relationship that ends in tragedy. What that means is pretty ambiguous, however, there is a scene later where she intentionally attempts to drown the protagonist while having sex with him (both of which she fails at. Too bad, as it would have put this god forsaken show out of its misery a little earlier). The goo-girl doesn\'t have a whole lot going on for her. She barely speaks. I guess she\'s supposed to have the reading level of a kindergartner or something, but her personality and intelligence is supposed to change based on what nutrients she absorbs or some such. I\'m pretty sure we\'re supposed to think of her as some sort of comic relief character instead of an actual pivotal plot character... It\'s hard to tell though, because the plot doesn\'t pivot around a whole lot, and the other characters generally seem about as intelligent as her.The sixth character finally introduces something interesting. Genuinely. The sixth girl is a drider, half-spider half-human. When she\'s introduced, she is living illegally in Japan, holed up with a man exploiting her for the silk she\'s able to weave in exchange for the secretive housing. I was blown away that this far in to the show they would actually choose to explore an interesting subject of social conflict. Not all these monster girls can be happy legal immigrants and what essentially boils down to being foreign exchange students, so how do you deal with the ones that are dangerous, or have run away from their host families, or were abused, or exploited? The drider character actually explores some of the deeper questions of the conflicts societies like this would face if they were ever brought together, and it doesn\'t do it poorly. Unfortunately, as soon as the issue at hand has been resolved, they throw the interesting topic to the way-side and reduce the character to a bunch of bondage jokes.If there\'s one thing Monster Musume got right, it\'s the character DESIGN. To say nothing for their nonexistent personalities, the actual look of the characters is very distinctive and detailed. The artwork meshes together well and looks pretty amazing in most scenes. Even the environments around the city look terrific (though the house where generally all the action takes place probably couldn\'t be more barren looking). But wait... Before we offer too much praise for the character design, writer and illustrator Okayado (aka Takemaru Inui) actually recycled these designs from his erotic dojinshi ""Living with Monster Girl"" and ""Monster Girl Report"" series. Does knowing that he reused these characters detract from their design in this show? No, probably not. But it does seem weird that we\'re watching the same characters from a straight up pornographic comic in a sort of almost but not really pornographic cartoon... Well, okay, maybe not that weird.In conclusion, Monster Musume seems to spend more time making dick jokes and berating women than it does on character development, which, when you think about it, is a horrible shame, because the genre and the characters both have huge potential to be something phenomenal. You wouldn\'t think it to look at this show, mind you, but it\'s there, believe me. But hey, I\'m not the one who\'s sold more than 1 million copies of the manga, so what the hell do I know, right? anime for fans to have a cheap laugh at. The problem? There is no well-established genre. This is it. Monster Musume is the the foremost flagship of the Monster Girl anime genre. A fruit ripe for picking, full of potential for adventure, deep story telling, and compelling characters, reduced to cheap sex jokes and one dimensional personalities. Even after all twelve episodes of this travesty, I\'m still unable to remember the protagonist\'s name, so unmemorable was he.In short, Monster Musume is a show (for lack of a better word) about a modern day Japan that has seen a supernatural influx of Demi-human ""monsters"" (the origin of which remains either a complete mystery, or briefly glossed over. I can\'t remember if it\'s mentioned even once). After determining that the ""monsters"" are sentient and not trying to invade the country, the Japanese government implements a program to help these individuals ease into human society and deal with cultural differences. They are paired with human host families to help open relations between human and monster societies. Overall, not a terrible concept for a show. The execution on the other hand... that\'s a different story.I wish I could take credit for this summary of the plot, but alas, it was written by a friend on a challenge to summarize an anime while making it sound as awful as possible. It\'s sadly accurate:""A straight, Japanese man suddenly finds himself the very unwilling sponsor for a bunch of foreign women who keep sexually harassing him. Several of them are special needs. He would like to wonder how exactly this is even legal but he\'s too busy trying not to be killed by being slapped around by a bunch of bigger, stronger women. Eventually he\'s told that he is now not only allowed to marry one of them, he is now legally obligated to do so even though he is blatantly not interested in any of them.""So let\'s analyze this show a little more closely and see what they did right and wrong. Yes! Not every single line in show is a travesty, believe it or not.The first monster girl that our ""hero"" hosts is a lamia, a half-snake half-human. Being a harem anime, she immediately has an attraction to our nondescript protagonist, fawning possessively over him at every turn. Her defining characteristic is being a bad cook and... Well, that\'s about it, really. She\'s about as interesting as a wooden block, so I\'m going to have to take a point off right there.Our second monster girl is a harpy, and already we see a problem with this. Traditionally, harpy and lamia mythos is very similar, almost identical even, so the writer has backed himself in to a corner early on. How are we going to differentiate these characters in a way that makes sense? Well, in order to make sure the characters weren\'t too similar, he makes the harpy a complete moron. Because, you know, a ""bird brain!"" Yup. We\'re basing our character\'s personality on a pun. My biggest problem with this? Birds are actually very smart. One of the smartest species on our planet. So... great call there. I\'m just going to tell you flat out that there\'s a scene in which the main character is feeding ice cream to the harpy in a park, the ""joke"" of the scene being that it looks like she\'s performing fellatio on him in front of a group of people. It\'s made even ""funnier"" by the fact that our harpy character looks very young. Because, you know... pedophilia is hysterical! HAHAHA! IT\'S SO FUNNY, RIGHT?! No... It\'s an awkward and horrendous scene designed for shock value. Heaven forbid you be watching with another individual. You might not be able to look each other in the eye for the rest of the day.Harem girl number three is a centaur. She has some genuinely alright moments, and a lot of potential (that, naturally, goes unused) to be an interesting character. She hails from a land of knights and monarchy, but all that gets thrown out the window when you learn, in the first encounter with her, that she came to Japan so she could find her true love via contrived anime plot or some such crap. I don\'t know... I wasn\'t paying that much attention. Anyway, our heroic, not-quite-as-interesting-as-a-moldy-piece-of-cheese protagonist and our centaur lady chase a thief in the first scene we see them together. He jumps on her back and chases the thief down on his scooter. We later learn that riding a centaur without her permission is actually the equivalent of rape in their society. When he apologizes for his mistake, she immediately forgives and falls in love with him. That\'s right kids. I guess the lesson here is if you rape someone and tell them you\'re sorry, everything will be just peachy keen and they\'ll swear their undying loyalty to you. Except, guess what? That\'s NOT how it works, and this scene is implying some pretty horrendously flawed ideals.Next we have a mermaid and a goo-girl. They\'re exactly what they sound like. There are some interesting moments regarding the mermaid and how she can get around on land, and how they have to modify the housing for her to live in, but for the most part it\'s all just a bunch of squandered potential. The mermaid\'s thing is she wants to be involved in a romantic relationship that ends in tragedy. What that means is pretty ambiguous, however, there is a scene later where she intentionally attempts to drown the protagonist while having sex with him (both of which she fails at. Too bad, as it would have put this god forsaken show out of its misery a little earlier). The goo-girl doesn\'t have a whole lot going on for her. She barely speaks. I guess she\'s supposed to have the reading level of a kindergartner or something, but her personality and intelligence is supposed to change based on what nutrients she absorbs or some such. I\'m pretty sure we\'re supposed to think of her as some sort of comic relief character instead of an actual pivotal plot character... It\'s hard to tell though, because the plot doesn\'t pivot around a whole lot, and the other characters generally seem about as intelligent as her.The sixth character finally introduces something interesting. Genuinely. The sixth girl is a drider, half-spider half-human. When she\'s introduced, she is living illegally in Japan, holed up with a man exploiting her for the silk she\'s able to weave in exchange for the secretive housing. I was blown away that this far in to the show they would actually choose to explore an interesting subject of social conflict. Not all these monster girls can be happy legal immigrants and what essentially boils down to being foreign exchange students, so how do you deal with the ones that are dangerous, or have run away from their host families, or were abused, or exploited? The drider character actually explores some of the deeper questions of the conflicts societies like this would face if they were ever brought together, and it doesn\'t do it poorly. Unfortunately, as soon as the issue at hand has been resolved, they throw the interesting topic to the way-side and reduce the character to a bunch of bondage jokes.If there\'s one thing Monster Musume got right, it\'s the character DESIGN. To say nothing for their nonexistent personalities, the actual look of the characters is very distinctive and detailed. The artwork meshes together well and looks pretty amazing in most scenes. Even the environments around the city look terrific (though the house where generally all the action takes place probably couldn\'t be more barren looking). But wait... Before we offer too much praise for the character design, writer and illustrator Okayado (aka Takemaru Inui) actually recycled these designs from his erotic dojinshi ""Living with Monster Girl"" and ""Monster Girl Report"" series. Does knowing that he reused these characters detract from their design in this show? No, probably not. But it does seem weird that we\'re watching the same characters from a straight up pornographic comic in a sort of almost but not really pornographic cartoon... Well, okay, maybe not that weird.In conclusion, Monster Musume seems to spend more time making dick jokes and berating women than it does on character development, which, when you think about it, is a horrible shame, because the genre and the characters both have huge potential to be something phenomenal. You wouldn\'t think it to look at this show, mind you, but it\'s there, believe me. But hey, I\'m not the one who\'s sold more than 1 million copies of the manga, so what the hell do I know, right?', 'There might have been 1,000,000 ways to take an anime with this premise and make an absolute disaster out of it. Thankfully Monster Musume wasn’t one of the million. Monster Girls is an anime that will almost instantly ward off a lot of potential viewers, and that is understandable. The 12 episode harem-comedy has more than enough ecchi for 3 separate anime(although, not as ecchi as its source material) and the girls are, well….monsters? But I think that’s the magic here. The author presented us with a harem cast that is nothing like we were expecting. We were given a collection of diverse monster girls...and by the end of the 12 episodes I really didn’t even think of them as monsters. Just girls. In that respect the main character does what any harem MC should do and that’s be relatable because he welcomes a house full of these girls and never even bats an eye at their monstrous forms.The animation is only okay and the settings get rather stagnant. The voice acting however is some of the best I’ve heard in a long time. All of these ladies sounded exactly as they did in my head when I was reading the manga. I struggled to justify the score of a 7 over a 6 but the voice acting was what tipped the balance for me.Monster Musume is, at it’s core, underneath all of the ecchi and characterizations, a warm hearted story of acceptance and understanding and I think that is the true magic behind the monster. and by the end of the 12 episodes I really didn’t even think of them as monsters.

Monster Musume decides to go about this by specifically pinpointing a particular fetish, monster girls. It sounds pretty weird, right? That is because it is.Weird does not mean bad though. When dealing with harem shows there are restrictions that need to be taken in order for the show to actually continue. Namely, the main character needs a reason to not pick one of the girls, each girl needs time in the spotlight, and any progress...that is achieved in an episode is largely pushed under the rug at the end of the same episode. Monster Musume does nothing to deviate from these usual tropes. This is where the show’s inherent weirdness keeps things interesting.This show does not deal with normal girls, only monster girls and because of this the author’s imagination is really the only limiting factor holding things back. I can think of no other show where things like shady dealers trying to make a quick million by filming a harpy laying an egg or where a lamia needs help shedding her skin because she burned her hands cooking can happen. It is truly utter chaos but it is a disaster that you cannot help but laugh at as it occurs not unlike a Three Stooges film.I have been sidestepping the romance aspect of this show for a while now because it has just as much progress as Nisekoi meaning pretty much none at all. However, unlike Nisekoi I actually like Kimihito Kurusu as a main character because he has a legitimate to not want to date one of the girls. Like Miia, the lamia, demonstrates they are all very capable of accidentally maiming or even killing him at any moment. Kurusu is also not the wishy washy, perverted kind of protagonist we come to expect in harem shows. Accidental groping and panty shots still happen but Kurusu does have a badass side to him as demonstrated by the way he decks a guy in the face after he throws a bunch of insults at Miia and he is never really on the butt end of a joke.Monster Musume is a show you should watch if you enjoy crazy, over the top scenarios. The girls are cut and paste tropes plastered onto the frames of monster girls and there is pretty much no development in any of the characters or their relationships but it entices you to keep watching because you want to see what insanity happens next. Unless you detest ecchi/harems or are cynical to the point of just not liking fun this show is worth a try. that is achieved in an episode is largely pushed under the rug at the end of the same episode.

We’re introduced into a society where monsters have appeared OUTTA NOWHERE and now they’ve come to live with humans through the ""Cultural Exchange Between Species Act”. Our main protagonist, Kimihito Kurusu, or ‘Darling’, volunteers to become a host and eventually garners an entire harem, enjoying, not enjoying, the countless times the monster girls may or may not annoy him, or even you, the viewer.Geting art...and sound out the way, I didn’t really expect such animation quality and art for a show merely made for fan service compared to some recent failures. I was pleasantly surprised and pleased to see that effort was put forth. Voice acting is nothing special. It’s mostly just annoying moaning sounds, screams and typical conversations. It does it job to immerse the ecchi scenes.This show is obviously not for kids nor the politically correct. However enough of that, my gripe with this show is how much of a gimmick the monster girls is used to hide the fact that the characters, which are the most prominent key elements in story, are all very derivative.“B-but it’s a harem, why are you watching it for the characters! You shouldn’t expect much from the story or characters, just the sexual pleasure!!!!!” - Every apologist and fanboy everThese things are apparent and important in a story. Being a harem/ecchi doesn’t remove itself from criticism. In the story we’re introduced to how shallow and inept the CEBSA law. Now you might be thinking I’m just nitpicking, but clearly this a huge part of the series to create the drama when it’s not focusing on comedy or ecchi. But it’s done so poorly because the story doesn’t even understand how basic law functions. First off, how is monsters committing acts of terror, ie the Pig guys, not violating any laws at all. It’s clearly terrorism whilst holding HUMANS hostages. The CEBsA law itself is flawed, and I mean even in real life this BS wouldn’t be acceptable to pass even if there were some loopholes. But I guess it’s just to show how stupid politicians are in real life as well, right? No, it’s shit writing. I’m not one to push my agenda onto any show, but this particular aspect ruined my experience for the episode and got me thinking how poorly the act reflects the setting. And also, the whole death threat letter is ultimately hindered and demeaned by the whole reveal, even though it had enjoyable moments it’s a huge flaw as the last few episodes focused on trying to capture the person who sent it.Characters are as I’ve said are nothing too special. The monster girl concept is a gimmick to hide the illusion that it’s all just characters with no real backbone to them. Don’t bullshit me on that. 90% of the audience just came to see cute characters doing sexual things. Kimihito Kurusu seemed quite interesting in the quick look at his past when he was a delinquent of some sort during the final episode. There I thought “Wow, he seemed pretty cool and had style” but what we got here was a guy who is just nonchalant, and too damn optimistic to the point where it is just ‘he’s nice’ aspect. Yea sure he accepts the girls unlike other humans we’ve seen, but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s terrible character design. At least show that he is annoyed or angry so that we can see Mia, Papi, Suu and the rest to develop themselves knowing they’ve clearly hurt the man they love; he’s always put into danger but he acts as if he’s fucking stripped of emotions at times of his near death experiences. But no, they are just reassured by darling because he says it’s fine. It’s not to say the characters are all bad, the monsters girls are hit and miss throughout the show. Times when they prove to be acting properly and appropriate to certain scenes in manners not annoying, and then it’s just annoying. One of the most enjoyable and funny enough, characters are the two annoying couples that are scene throughout the show. Always driving their car and laughing, making jokes of the monster girls, and threatening our cast. I’m sure I’m of the minority here but they proved to be much better in moments than most of the cast when they have their screen time.If you’re reading my review thus far here and is feeling annoyed and angry for some reason, please don’t, I don’t hate this show. However I dislike many aspects of the show because it ruins it’s potential. And you know what? I’ll say it, I love this show more than you do or any other anime, because of what I say, I’m not just going to kiss the studio’s ass for making poor decisions or if the manga’s writing was only what we saw in it’s animation debut. I enjoy many moments, not just the ecchi, there are plenty of intimate moments between the cast that prove just how subtle and lovely the show can be at times. Every screen time of those moments I just love to sink into my heart. But the writing of the characters and overall story/standalone episodes. That is why Everyday Life with Monster Girls earns a 6/10 and misses my badass seal of approval. I can’t recommend this as a show, but if you’re looking for a good time with ecchi then I’d say, “JUST DO IT! DO IT!,” if that’s all you’re after. and sound out the way, I didn’t really expect such animation quality and art for a show merely made for fan service compared to some recent failures.

I can’t recommend this as a show, but if you’re looking for a good time with ecchi then I’d say, “JUST DO IT! DO IT!,” if that’s all you’re after.', ""One word: Beastiality... Is what I would say, but this series is actually a comedy in my opinion. Let me explain why:The characters are over the top. Heck, the main character should've been dead from the first minute of the first episode! He's OP, but in a humorous way. Also, he's simple. He hardly even uses any expression other than the blank stare. For some reason, however, I can remember him quite well.Of course, let's not forget the heroines. Again, they're your typical heroines, except they're FRIGGIN' MONSTER CHICKS!!! It actually makes you confused. Should you be aroused, feel pity or laugh out loud?...I don't friggin' know, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.All in all, it was a funny anime. If you're into monsters and hot girls, then be my guest. But it's not easy living everyday with monster girls! I don't friggin' know, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.All in all, it was a funny anime. If you're into monsters and hot girls, then be my guest. But it's not easy living everyday with monster girls!"", 'Sometimes we ask ourselves : Why am I watching this anime?I found my answer while I was discovering this rare artefact.The answer is : There are boobs, a lot of them. Also the MC gets the chance do grab them all.. The dream actually.This anime really does well at being an ecchi series. It\'s an example that anime every should follow. Randomness situations where the MC gets the chance to get in touch with the boobs.I mean, half of each episode we watch our MC doing stuff with the girls\' boobs .. no wait it\'s the other way around, the girls...are the ones who make things with the MC involving their boobs (no they didn´t clean anything with it .. yet .. )Seriously why this is not an hentai series? It would be so much better being an hentai series. If someone tells me that they watch this anime not because of the boobs, but because of the characters / plot I wouldn´t believe.About the plot, there isn´t any. Basically we watch our MC picking up this monster girls and gather them in his house. Conveniently each one of this girls falls in love with their ""guardian"", which in this case is our MC. So basically each episode he colects girls that will fall in love for him and they have to prove that they deserve him so that they can marry him.Well yeah .. the girls have to show somehow that they deserve our MC as their partner.SO, let\'s understand this :-We have a MC that lives by himself.-We have 6 hot girls that love our MC-They all live together..Result: Hentai. Yet this anime is not an hentai so .. yeah basically this series sucks. I mean the only good thing is that if you are a guy, you will get turned on each episode. I\'m not lying since literally he is there haging around with his girls, grabbing her boobs, being in ""situations that normally would lead to sex"" too often, of course a guy can´t hold it.And if you think i\'m over reacting .. go watch yourselves.Well about the art, I actually like it. The design of each character is cute. The background is not the best but nothing horrible. The sound is weak. The opening is nothing special so as the tracks. But I do love voice acting, 10 points for that.The character are boobs. Literally. Except for that harpy .. but well she is a loli so.. the characters are not that different from each other. But I do admit, they are funny to watch. Especially Miia, our snake girl. I do like her ^^Another huge problem with this series is the lack of an ending .. literally. There is no end. So, we have no story, no characters, no ending, what the hell do we have? Boobs. A lot of them. Our main character will do everything that he could possibly do with boobs except a boobjob, if you know what that is, because this series is rated as a ecchi series instead of a hentai series. It\'s really disappointing you know, I was expecting at least a decent ending but not even that, it seems that they fucked on the public that actually wanted a story and only kept adding boobs to the screen.Well guess what, there are better sites for that purpose.. Where we can see uncensured boobs and other stuff ..In the end .. is it worth watching? Well .. well ... well ......... kinda of. The series are entertaining at least. Even though the story is bullshit so as the characters, the anime is still funny mainly because there are a lot of boobs but also because of the comedy being not so bad. You can watch it if you feel you have nothing to do..Let\'s say that you should at least try it. One thing for sure, if you are a guy you will enjoy some of the scenes .. unfortunately if you are a girl you won´t see a damn thing. Better try your luck with ""Free"" or something.. are the ones who make things with the MC involving their boobs (no they didn´t clean anything with it .. yet .. )Seriously why this is not an hentai series?

Since it\'s ecchi/harem, it\'s worth it for the boys who seeks enjoyment rather than plot. And I\'ve read the manga before they\'ve released its anime announcement.  And the manga is quite good, for its enjoyment purposes.[Anime Output] [10/10]In terms of Story pacing or episodes, it\'s 2 stories in 1 ep. In manga terms it\'s 2 chapters in 1 episode, so you can start reading the manga at chapter 26. And I highly praised this anime in terms of ""LOYALTY""...unlike some series which is not loyal to the original source. And the only thing episode which have leaved a cliffhanger is 11, basically, an anime for enjoyment.The Art is the best you can find, the difference is Manga:6/10 vs Anime 11/10, they were able to execute the thing that I can\'t imagine were created beautifully, it seems Lerche is really one of the best in terms of Key Animation. And there\'s more, it\'s the Execution of the characters, or the movement of it, Making animals in anime is really hard, it needs ""PRO"" in the making, in short, This is an anime which were created by ""PROS"" in terms of ART. The ART is just Wonderful, that\'s why it\'s 11/10.Sound, damn, this is really one of the best you can find, if you\'re looking for the ""Or\'Gasm"", the voice actress were able to portray it wonderfully, which is enjoyable. But the Bgm is not their selling point, it\'s just average. [5/10]The Characters were able to portray what is it on the manga, And their designated setting are present, or your typical girl attracted to the mc. So far, it\'s an enjoyable type of an anime than plot series with character development.[plot] [2/10]The Story is good, it\'s a comedy slice of life fantasy, especially the story about ""MON"" but the rest, it\'s only for enjoyment. So if you\'re looking for a ""Decent Anime with PLOT"" then you\'re in the wrong place. Now It seems you\'ve got the clue on what\'s this anime all about. So far I\'ll say it straight, It\'s just ""Decent"" 4/10 for its Story, this is better in many ecchi/harem, but not as good as any other in its character development. The development is 2/10, only Rachnera and Suu are  decent characters which improved the most, and there are 6 girls+4 mon squad and only 1 human=11 girls in total, and only 2/11 have developed. Which is an anime entirely for ""Enjoyment""[enjoyment] [8/10]This is really an enjoyable anime, so I don\'t have to talk about how good it was in its ""Fanservice"" it seems it was based in ""To-Love-Ru"" where the girls are aliens with over 15+ girls as its harem. And at the same time, it\'s girls who takes the lead in seduction, which is ""Dream"" for boys like me(lol) So far, the best in this anime is the ""Foreplay"", which is not direct, nor too soft, it\'s just ""OK"", but the Expression and the sound is really ""Lewd"" so you\'re really gonna enjoy this if you\'re looking for ""Ecchi"" but the irony is, it\'s not extreme, nor can be called ""Soft Porn"" it was able to combine ""Safe Play"" and ""Hentai Play"", which is nice. So if you\'re looking for Decent Ecchi, watch this anime.[Worth] [4/10]It\'s your typical anime, just added with few elements of ""Half Human and Half Monsters"" or your fantasy monsters based on ""Greek Mythology"". It\'s really good in terms of Enjoyment, it will meet up your desire called Lust, but there\'s nothing more than that. I\'ve appreciated the works of the Key Animators in making this anime, because it\'s harder than you think. And I really enjoyed this show.

But the anime disappointed me, which was totally unexpected.I dropped the anime midway. Plus, I read the manga first. So this review might be a bit biased.First of all, new harem characters are introduced way too fast. There's not a solid background story or reasoning that supports anything or any claim in this anime. If you like excessive fanservices and pointless perverted drama, I would surely recommend it. But you still could be disappointed.The story lacks...a structure. There's no point in anything at all. There are a lot of social and geographical blunders that I can't even target without making this review a couple thousand words long so let's skip that.This anime, thus, is below true harem.

Pretty much everything is here just as you might expect it, deredere, tsundere, kuudere and dandere heroines with an assortment of loli or oppai body types. The only thing that we haven\'t seen yet is the ""child hood friend"" and ""secret promise"" tropes, but I\'m sure that if this series goes on long enough those will be added as well!That being said, even if you do enjoy harem animes there are a couple of problems with Monster Musume and they primarily relate to the pacing of the...anime. Essentially, there are a lot of heroines and it\'s obviously that this is because of the way the manga was written to be serialized - more heroines means more character arcs, which means a longer manga series. This doesn\'t really translate well to the screen, particularly in a short 12 episode anime. There is literally just enough time here to introduce the main house guests from the manga, give them each a feature episode, and then run one story arc which of course concludes with no progress or character development (as typical of harem animes).Ultimately if you enjoy harem animes you\'ll probably enjoy this one as it\'s executed in the typical fashion of a modern harem anime. There\'s ecchi jokes and fan service (nothing extreme in my opinion) and there\'s good character designs, a decent protagonist who isn\'t a complete donkan stereotype and a serviceable voice cast with Natsuki Aikawa (Centorea Shianus) probably giving the stand-out performance - her character songs for Centorea, particularly ""Nobility"", are well done - she can really sing. anime.

Recognizing that a gap exists and fulfilling the desires of the potential customers is how many major businesses start. Monster Musume is a perfect example of a studio recognizing that a demand existed and exploiting the ever-living fuck out of it. If you are the type of person who wants nothing more than to see monster girls doing incredibly erotic things, have you come to the right place. I hold no judgement and am glad this series exists for your enjoyment. However, for the rest of us this is...less of a fun series and more of the biggest exercise in sadomasochism since lucky starThe story itself is fairly simple. The government has suddenly decided to reveal the existence of monster people, and in an attempt to bridge a gap has decided to employ numerous laws and allow for the homestay of these so called monsters in the home of residents. Our protagonist happens to be hosting one of these girls, starting of the very long adventure of monster harem collecting. Although the majority of the show is comedy and near hentai level of eroticism, there are a few pieces that actually deal with the legislation and discrimination some of these monsters face, which helps immensely in keeping the story from falling into the harem hole.The art was actually incredibly good for a 12 episode harem series. You can tell that a great amount of money and care was put into the show, although it would have been nice if the MC\'s eyes had been drawn more than 5 percent of the time.Openings and Endings were meh at best, but the soundtrack did it\'s job in keeping tone with the emotional moments and livening up the...not so emotional ones.The characters are where any harem starts to fall apart, and this one isn\'t any different. Although each of the characters are uniquish and quirky in ways, the show suffers from the ""Keep stacking more and more characters so we don\'t have to actually write a plot"" that plagues so many slice of life stories. The sheer volume of cast size prevented any of them from being truly developed instead falling to a more 2 dimensional ""Call when needed"" basis.Overall the series was not half bad all things combined. It had it\'s funny moments and certainly provoked a bit of thought as to what an actually monster and human world would look like. However, if breasts the size of a small moon and very very uncomfortable scenes that prevent you from going 3 miles near a school zone don\'t appeal to you, then you might want to try your luck somewhere else. less of a fun series and more of the biggest exercise in sadomasochism since lucky starThe story itself is fairly simple.

Or as I like to call it, ""Living With Incompetent, Horny Girls That Just Happens To Be Monsters"". But hey, lets be real here. Just like the main character in this show, you would probably shove your p*nis inside anything as long as it has a pulse and somewhat classifies as a female.I really have no idea what to say about this show. It left me quite frankly speechless, and I can`t tell if that is in a good way....So lets get this review started.STORY: 5Now the story in this anime isn`t going to win any prizes. The main character, Kimihito Kurusu, is tasked with taking care of multiple monster-girls who, for some reason, all want to f*ck his brains out (hey its an anime okay? About horny monster girls. What were you expecting?). That`s basically the long and short of it. I`m not going to say a lot about the story, since it is, in my opinion, just mediocre, and not worth talking about. But hey, at least you now have a rough idea of what`s going on in this anime.ART: 6I really didn`t have a problem with the art-style in this show. The characters and backgrounds are pretty well drawn, and the animations are, for the most part, fluid. There were some scenes that weren`t as good as others, but I didn`t really expect much from this anime, and lets just say that I was pleasantly surprised by how... okay?... it looked. But if you are looking for an anime that pushes the boundaries of what`s currently possible within animation, you sure as hell ain`t gonna find it here.SOUND: 5To be 100% honest with you guys, I didn`t really pay a lot of attention to the different sounds and soundtracks that this anime had. I was too busy looking at all the boobs and the fanservice. But the sounds are all just... mediocre. There is nothing remarkable here, and you probably won`t remember the OP song more than a week after watching this. So, for me at least, it wasn`t worthy of anything more than a 5 at best.CHARACTER: 6The characters are really the bread and butter of this show. They are basically the only reason I`m giving this anime a 6 instead of a 5. Even though all of the characters are hopelessly in love with the main protagonist (for anime reasons), I still found them somewhat funny and enjoyable. They all have different personalities, which you can clearly see by the way they act around Kurusu, or as I like to call him, ""Harem King"". My personal favorite has to be the Lamia, Miia. Her quite frankly extreme love for Kurusu made for some pretty funny scenes, and I gotta admit, she made me laugh on more than one occasion. I also like her boobs.ENJOYMENT: 7I`m gonna be completely honest with you guys: even though the anime is mediocre at best, I still found it pretty enjoyable. Even if you absolutely hate this anime with every fiber of your being, I`m pretty sure that somewhere, deep inside of you, you enjoyed it a little bit. Some of the scenes made me laugh out loud, and it`s kind of hard to find an anime these days that can make me do that. You just gotta take this anime for what it is. Mindless fun.OVERALL: 6Even though the anime itself is nothing more than mediocre, I still think it`s worth a shot. The humor and character that this show has really makes it something quite... special (totally not related to the fact that the first episode literally starts with an orgasm). If you don`t like it then hey, just turn it off. Nobody is forcing you to watch through the entire thing. But I would recommend that you give it a shot. If nothing more, I can promise you that you will at least have what can only be described as the weirdest boner of your life. Now if you will excuse me, I`m gonna go ""release"" some pent-up sexual energy. So lets get this review started.STORY: 5Now the story in this anime isn`t going to win any prizes.

Plus it avoids my least favorite things in harem anime: the ""why doesn\'t he just pick one?"" question and the ""What do they even see in him?"" question. It\'s bright and colorful and even sexy. Too sexy at times. That\'s why it\'s only...a four out of five. The overt sexiness of this show may wear out its welcome after a few episodes. The concept of sexy monster girls and being attracted to them, even ones as nice and sweet as these girls, is strange to me.

Honestly, I don't know if I could ever get tired of these kinds of shows!This was certainly a cute show where the main character is more or less forced to live with these new monster girls, but he secretly loves it and likes taking care of them because then he feels needed.Music:The theme song was catchy enough, the mood music was always appropriate, the voice acting was good and I don't feel like there was anything that stood out negatively about sounds. The moaning of the girls' were cute and sounded a...bit genuine, so that was good.Characters:I feel like the characters in this were pretty solid, however I didn't like how in one episode it introduced 4 new monster girl types all at once. Like, that was okay I guess, but just kinda fast. Also, I wonder what happened to the little demon girl who was causing trouble in some of the episodes. Did she go back to living with her host family? Was she sent back to hell? Why couldn't Kurusu and the others adopt her into their family and kinda raise her to be better?Story:The story started by jumping right into the ecchi scene with Kurusu and the snake girl. I thought it was hilarious that like, he got introduced to almost every creature at first by basically making them orgasm. I thought the story was progressing well enough until episode 7 where you were suddenly introduced to 4 new girls and it went suddenly from just animal girls to a zombie, one-eyed girl and like a giant with a horn. Like, I don't mind them introducing girls like that, but could you at least give a hint that those exist in the world as well? I don't know, it wasn't bad. Also, I didn't like how in the intro they show Kurusu marrying all the girls, but it doesn't happen in the show. I'm sure that it might happen in the manga, but that would have to come in another season of the anime, and then it would be going into the hentai area because they would all want to mate with him.

As someone who actually likes monster girls, that suffering took me off guard. I played MGQ like any upstanding pervert should. Now, I'll admit, Ecchi is a genre I have never understood. A good 80% or more of the genre just seems to be an exercise in cucking yourself when you could just watch hentai instead, with a few genuinely hilarious standouts like Izushoku Reviewers that know how to blur the lines. I guess some guys just really like to edge, or are too young to google 'henti' or...something, idk.Monster Musume is a largely plotless adventure in which protagonist-kun gets molested by a slowly growing crowd of deeply irritating monster girls. Fanservice ensues. If you've seen Love Hina, or anything similar to it, you know the drill. Unlike Love Hina, which eventually meandered its way into a canon pairing by way of a torturously dragged out romance arc, Monster Musume seems unlikely to ever reach that point, as new girls join the ever growing harem every week. It's not like any of them have anything approaching a romance arc, anyway, as that would require them to be something other than a loosely connected series of breasts and asses. Look, I appreciate breasts and asses as much as the next person, but could we have a little more conversation here? Or, failing that, a little more action please?In all seriousness, the lack of either just makes this series a big, fat nothingburger in regards to both story and characterization. Characters are basically archetype + fetish combinations, and the main members of the harem are mostly just there for their boobs, so this even manages to somehow fail as a fetish anime. Forget Ishuzoku Reviewers, even the pervs who made Miru Tights would be laughing at this series for its absurd inability to commit to a niche. Is it a comedy? Not really, since it's all incredibly lame sex 'jokes' for people who think boobs are funny. Is it erotic? Not really, since the protagonist isn't interested in their incessant, clumsy flirting, so the sexual side of things goes absolutely nowhere. Are the characters interesting? No, they have boobs instead of personality. Does it at least have good worldbuilding? No, we learn the absolute bare basics of monsters, and other shows manage more worldbuilding in their sex scenes alone (which this show does not have btw), and the monsters still strain credibility for how they would fit in to a modern society. Also, I swear none of them have anything approaching an interesting culture that fits with their biology. They're basically sex-obsessed humans. As an unabashed xenophile, I shed a tear for the monster girl culture clash that could have been.The art is decent enough for when it came out, and the music is... technically sound, but irritatingly saccharine, as befitting a certain type of Japanese comedy that I find intensely annoying.Basically, if you're not watching this with someone else to laugh at its ineptitude, this series is an absolute waste of your time. Even then, it'll still waste your time, but at least you can see someone else grimacing next to you. If you're twelve and have yet to experience the wonder of free internet pornography, this series may help you pop your first boner, and that's fine, but please also try to recognize that that doesn't make this series a 10/10 for doing so.

Well, (this might be embarrassing to talk about) while browsing through nhentai, I came across the official manga of Monster Musume. The official manga of Monster Musume is on a doujinshi site. Yeah, we are talking about that kind of lewdness. Well, question your sexual preferences and try not to die, this is my review of Monster Musume.Story: 7/10In a alternate reality a bill is passed to let non-human species integrate with humans. Kimihito accidentally...gets a non-human (a half human, half snake woman) in his house and becomes the caretaker of her. As the episodes fly by, more non-humans join in his house, all of them coincidentally female, which results in his personal harem growing. Although, the girls get frustrated that they cant have sex with him, because of the lacking bill that was passed. But there is a loophole: Kimihito can have sex with one girl if he marries her, which results in a whole lot of flirting… and… more…. *cough*. Simple story, I like it.Art: 8/10The art is colorful and the action scenes can be beautiful at times. It's good.Music: 6/10Not really any memorable music, except for the OP and ED. While not my favorite, these are still pretty good songs.Characters: 8/10The highlight of this anime. Kimihito is the punching bag but still nice, Miia is the most obsessed with Kimihito and calls him darling more then zero two, Papi is a child who is actually just as old as the other girls, Centorea is not darkness from Konosuba but as a horse, Suu is spongebob if he was cute and a slime, Meroune is obsessed with fairy tales and Rachnera is a pervert. There are also some supporting characters who are also very enjoyable, especially Manako (seeing pictures of her I thought she was going to be the oh-so mysterious character, but when she finally appeared she was so sweet!).Enjoyment: 8/10I got a boner out of this. A questionable boner, but still a boner. But for real, I enjoyed it quite a lot. The humor was funny and there was always something interesting going on. They could have executed the character interaction better, but this is still pretty good.Overall: 7/10If you think you will like this, you probably will like this. If you think you will not like this, you will absolutely hate it.

The off lewd humor, the weird way people talk.

MonMusu is a harem-comedy show stuffed to the brim with fanservice, so it doesn\'t really have the ability to be a great show, because it isn\'t trying to be. It\'s just trying to be softcore porn with some humor here and there, and I\'d say it accomplishes that -- maybe even a bit more. Just don\'t watch it if you don\'t want to watch softcore porn with some humor here and there. Oh, and if you\'re strictly into 100%...human girls, this probably isn\'t for you, either.For anyone who\'s into this kind of show, though, MonMusu would probably be one of my first recommendations. The characters are all lovable and surprisingly complex, given the type of show this is. They\'re still too flat (ha, flat) to be considered masterpieces or anything, but they\'re a blast to watch, and pretty much any one of them is strong waifu material. (Do people still say ""waifu"" anymore? Probably not, but I can\'t think of an alternative, so whatever.)The comedy is also stellar, at least in most places. There are a few moments that basically boil down to ""the main character accidentally sees boobs and the girl isn\'t happy about that hahaha are you laughing yet??"", which is one of my most abhorred harem tropes, but, fortunately, it\'s not very common in this series, and MonMusu\'s sense of comedic timing rivals a lot of the funniest comedy anime I\'ve watched.With that said, some of the fanservice scenes did go a little too far. The way I see it, when it comes to fanservice shows like this, you can either go halfway or all the way, and MonMusu occasionally seemed like it was trying too hard to go, like, 3/4 of the way or something. These scenes were more uncomfortable and juvenile than anything, because the show wasn\'t quite willing to go all the way, but it hinted at it pretty strongly, which just made it baffling that they refused to take the final step.However, other than that, MonMusu is an ecchi harem comedy to end all ecchi harem comedies.

He has plenty of nicknames and pretty much no one uses his name, he looks super generic. But there is one thing about him that made me actually like him; he's nice. Not on a surface level or just when it's easy. No, genuinely nice and caring.And Mero is my favorite girl from this. to get so much.There are some scenes that are focused a bit more on the logistics of monster girls in a modern setting, and that does include racism.

Miia is good and Mermaid chick and slime are all right. Death girl and Zombie girl are cool too.A genuinely unique and interesting spin of the simple harem formula. Monster Demi- Humans are integrated into human society and hot monster chicks gather around our likeable main character because of ""convinient"" plot contrivences.Some light comedy and slice of life elements.The last episode had some good animation and the spider chick episode was actually really well done as it presented a thought provoking idea of discrimination against non humans.Miia and Spider chick have some good chemistry with main guy.Overall a fun ride...and definitely worth watchingI would give it a 7.5 but due to nature of the scoring system i have to settle for a 7. and definitely worth watchingI would give it a 7.5 but due to nature of the scoring system i have to settle for a 7.', 'Yeah, it is an ecchi/harem anime with an expected amount of fanservice in it. Yes, it\'s quite weird but also funny and as long as you don\'t take it too serious you could give it try. To be honest, i was very sceptical at first but it was not so bad as i did expected.It was the first harem anime i\'ve ever watched AND finished and i am not that familiar with this genre but i will try to write a fair review. It will just show my opinion and i\'m fine with it when not everybody agrees with it. ;)Story:What could i say about...the story? Hmm, the plot setting is quite fast told and easy to understand. It\'s main topic is an student exchange thing wiith monster girls instead of human ones who have all a love interest in the male main character. So far, so good. It\'s packed with comedy, some weird situations and of course fanservice. Much of it - be warned. XD The story itself  has not really a deep or philosophical meaning, but in this case i was fine with it.It\'s just all about everyday life with Monster Girls.Art:The general art design was clear and nicely done, nothing special but even not bad at all. The series lives from the design of the monster girls, which is obvious because they are the stars of the show ;) The way the animal parts where mixed-up with human attributes was unexpected well-done. Despite being referred as ""Monster Girls"" the girls didn\'t look monstrous at all - i would call them pretty or even cute.Sound:The background music is average but not very memorable. The opening song was cute, catchy and annoying (in a good way). But hey, i liked it. The ending song was okay even it was not my favourite. The voice cast, especially for the japanese dub was well selected and suited the different characters.Character:What to say about the characters? It\'s maybe the hardest part of this review. Everyone has their own preference when it goes to character setting/development so, i think it\'s better you decide by yourself if you like the characters or not.I couldn\'t say much about the male protagonist, he\'s seemed to be just a average, normal, nice guy - not the smartest but completely dump. Every girl of the series had their own personality, but i\'m not sure if they are stereotypical or not. And if they were that, i\'m still okay with it.  Yeah, they were all cute and pretty in their own way and i really liked them. But Rachnera was my favorite girl from the cast - maybe because she was the most mature character of the monster girls.Enjoyment:Even harem/ecchi anime are still not my favourite stuff, i did really enjoy this show. It was kind of strange at the first moment yes, but it was also kind of cute and funny. I could watch the show without feel like a pervert, it was entertaining and not a waste of time at all.Overall:I\'m not an expert for anime from this genre, so i can\'t tell if it was the best or the worst from its kind. But it was quite an interesting and i had a good time with it. And that is it what entertaiment should do - giving you a good time. For me, the concept worked and i regret nothing. the story?

Every character (even the plot-loving orcs!) has a distinct personality and reason for being ashamed or embarrassed about how they look or how the world perceives them, before the protagonist (whose name I honestly never heard, but probably because I was concentrating on the massive...bouncing plots everywhere) shows them kindness. His decency is legitimately heart-warming.And that\'s exactly what Monster Musume is: a cute, light-hearted, and oftentimes-riotous story of a collection of monstergirls finding that not everyone is after them for their plots, or because of their monster-ness. The animation is absolutely brilliant, with a particular attentiveness to facial expressions (the source of most of the laughs), and cheery music accompanies it all the way.

I personally would pick the basket of overall average apples, Monster Musume is not this basket.A good example of where this is most present is episode 6. Minor spoilers, but the first part features our protagonist helping one of the girls go through a stressful and embarrassing experience. It's funny, adorable, lewd, and heartwarming all in one....If the whole show had been like this, it would be a solid 10. However, immediately after he has to help another girl go through a different stressful and embarrassing experience, only this time a perverted man films the whole thing and it obviously only exists for lolicons to get a good fap. The good apples almost always have slime and flies from the bad apples seeping into and ruining them. One great example is the character Suu, which is one of my least favorite characters from all of anime. She has her cute moments and is arguably the most useful of the cast and she gets a ton of development compared to some of the others, but I always got extremely frightened when she would appear on screen because I knew that at any moment there could be a random rape scene because she can become a bunch of tentacles. I could never get attached to her because literally ten seconds after she gets some development she goes and publicly humiliates our main cast and molests the first monster girl on screen.Overall, some scenes and episodes of this show were fantastic, like any scene where Darling becomes a bada** or MON gets some spotlight. The best of this show is some fantastic stuff, but when it gets bad, it really gets bad.

Said friend of mine knew that I have a disdain for a large amount of harem comedy shows because of the lackluster characters. One of my favorite aspects of this show is the inclusion of a wide variety of bombastic, interesting cast of characters. Each of the girls has a distinct personality type that is consistent throughout the entire show. None of the interactions felt out of character for any of the girls.

It feels like the fanservice filler episodes of an actual show that exists somewhere. We see tantalizing glimpses of plot from time to time.Where do the monster girls come from?

While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!---------Positives---------- Creative CharactersWhat attracts people to Monster Musume? What started this whole trend, and why is it so popular? Is it all a massive fetish party? Okay, well YES. BUT. I\'ve got to give...the creator of this series some serious credit when it comes to character design. It would have been so, so easy to just put some cat ears on girls and do the exact same things everyone else has for years now, but I\'ll be damned if they didn\'t go full out with the characters themselves. They\'re all so varied, fresh, exciting, and DIFFERENT. And for a genre as deep as a glass of split milk, that was incredibly surprising and refreshing.- Longing for LoreThis extends off the first point somewhat, but I found myself enraptured by the sheer interest in the surrounding world, its inhabitants, and its customs. There are so many interesting creatures, and a very interesting infrastructure for how they interact with the world around them. The show focuses heavily on introducing as many new characters as physically possible each episode, and it\'s incredibly surprising how often it stretched its world-building wings, despite my constant: ""Okay, they must be done with new species NOW"".- Oh MyAlright look. Monster Musume is the closest thing you can get to porn without penetration. That should be it\'s subtitle. Monster Musume: Porn Minus Penetration. It\'s shameless, it\'s in your face, it\'s over the top, it\'s everywhere. Hop in the trash can with the rest of us, or hit the road. That being said, I must say that there were a pleasant amount of detours from standard gratuitous sexual tropes. The episodes dedicated to things such as egg-laying, or skin shedding, were highlights due to their sheer novelty and creativity.---------Negatives---------- OH MYAlright look. I like porn. I watch porn. I have an incredibly high tolerance for egregious sexual displays, I have no shame admitting that, and no one really should. Even saying that, Monster Musume was... oh boy. I\'ve watched/read many, many mature things that are less sexual than Monmusu. It\'s actually quite impressive. I have such a hard time with the series, simply because it\'s got such a limited potential audience. Additionally, many of the sexual gags or hooks in the show stray from the aforementioned creativity of the whole story. Why force yourself to do regular boob jokes over and over again when you have such a wealth of other opportunities handed to you by your characters/world on a silver platter?!- Mo Mo More!The things that Monmusu did well, I want to see more of. I want to see more of the world that they built. I want to see more interesting characters in more background roles. I want lore, and interesting different experiences I can\'t get anywhere else. Monmusu does a good job of keeping things fresh, but it gets exponentially weaker when it strays from its creative roots.- Better BalanceMonmusu recognized that its characters were a huge strong point, so it decided to introduce like, 20 of them, and attempt to all fit them in as important characters. While this certainly is a positive from a breadth, world-building perspective... it became increasingly hard to both keep track of and care about all the characters being introduced. I\'m not saying cut out a bunch of characters, but re-balance the importance of each character so that you have clear main and side characters, instead of 6+ people in a house and 4+ characters with arguably the same screen time that just so happen to NOT live in the house.----------Conclusion----------Monster Musume gives off a certain... first impression. It comes off as an incredibly shallow, weird, fetish-y porn fest for all the weirdos out there who like ""alternative"" women. And that assessment isn\'t necessarily WRONG, per se, but it entirely misses the huge amount of potential the show also has. When Monmusu is focusing on what makes it unique, I see a show that could possibly be one of the best, most interesting series I\'ve ever watched. When it strays from that, it becomes what people think it is: shallow, weird porn.So I\'m stuck in a middle ground. What I loved from Monster Musume, I absolutely adored. I will be remembering the characters, the world, and all related aspects for a long time to come. And it makes me want to go and find other related material, whether it be manga, anime, etc. But at the same time, it\'s got these layers of filth to have to deal with to enjoy the best stuff. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m filth myself and I enjoy many of those layers. But I have a hard time seeing a wide variety of other people who are willing to polish this hard, phallus-shaped rock into the hard, phallus-shaped diamond that it can be.------------Final Rating------------While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: ""Would you recommend I watch this show?"". So,If you have any issue with overt sexuality bordering on 18+ material, avert your eyes and keep walking.If you\'ve seen the related images and went ""hey those characters seem neat and different"", give it a shot.Finally, if you\'re into weird, kinky stuff, watch this. At the very least you can up your meme game. At the most you\'ll find something to cherish and never show anyone else.

EVER.', ""Warning possible SpoilersHarem anime's are always a mixed bag for me, they could be either bad and boring or good and surprising luckily Monster Musume is actually one of the more surprising aspects of the harem genre.Our story begins with Kimihito Kurusu who ends up having to take care of a Lamia (Half human, half snake) called Miia and help her integrate with human society however despite her affection for him Kimihito also encounters more monster girls and as his harem grows his life just get's crazier.For something that doesn't really have a story this was actually very fun to watch as it mainly relies...on the personalities and comedic everyday life of the characters plus I think this probably the most destructive harem yet because these girls are part monster they have something that pretty much most harems don't have which is animal powers so because of these extra body parts they can cause a lot of damage for the MC even if they are not trying to hurt him.The show despite being full of sexy monster girls and fanservice it actually brings in a sort of ethnicity because it would be interesting how the world would react to something like this happening and probably wouldn't be as peaceful however this anime does give us some insight into what could happen although considering how the girls react I doubt it'd be like this, plus there's also how people would think of people like this and you get that with some of the characters like Miia or Rachnera who have the monster half of an animal that humans aren't particularly fond of so the show does show off it's racial views pretty well in this.There is actually quite a large cast of characters most of them being monster girls, but it was interesting how each was a different type and all had different personalities, though there were a few that didn't do much for me.Kimihito the male MC is our lucky or unlucky protagonist depending on how you see it that has to put up with the many girls that live with him, compared to other Harem MC's he's actually pretty good despite doing the usual embarrassed look if he see's slightly nude he does from time to time get's his hands dirty like whenever a human picks on one of the girls he will actually give them a piece of his mind and kick their ass plus he does care about each and every one of the girls and isn't really put off by their appearances whatsoever.Miia is the first female MC of the group and she is a Lamia, despite being half snake Miia is actually a very sweet, naive and carefree person however being the first does make her the most jealous of the group as the more girls joined the less time she was able to spend with Kimihito though over time she does start to get on with the girls despite always getting into arguments with them and one more thing just make sure you don't eat anything she makes unless you really want to upset your stomach.Papi is the second girl and is a Harpy so she is half bird and because she is half bird her body to age ratio is a lot different to the others as to them she looks like a child while she is actually an adult however her personality is very child like as she is always wanting to play though she has been given the term birdbrain because of her short term memory which always makes conversations with her difficult.Centorea the third girl is a Centaur making her half horse and she is a very noble person often trying to shield Kimihito from dangerous situations and is always on constant alert this can however make her very strict with the other girls who always rebel against her words thought she can be a sweet and vulnerable person if you are able to get onto her good side.Suu is the fourth girl and she is actually a humanoid slime making her the oddest member of the group, she doesn't communicate well with the others and mainly copies what they do, but she doesn't hesitate to cling onto them especially when their sweating so she can collect it for herself and she even has mind reading and transformation abilities yet despite all of this she is definitely one thing and that's adorable.Meroune is the fifth girl and is a Mermaid, her tone of voice is much like Centorea's, but to the point where it sounds like she is of nobility and as a little girl she enjoyed stories that involved tragedies so she wants to be with Kimihito so she can experience it for herself which can make her a little loony sometime's.Rachnera is the sixth girl and is an Arachne, despite having the body of a spider Rachnera is a sexually devious masochist as she likes to use the other girls as play things for her webs and other things, although because of her body she is looked at as a monster and finds it difficult to socialise until Kimihito came along and thought her legs looked sexy which then changed her perspective.There are also other characters like Miss Smith and her MON group who do help Kimihito from time to time to help out with his monster girl situation although most of the time they use him as way to get a free meal although the monster girls in the MON group did actually get to spent some time with him at some point and see why the other girls like him.The artstyle was actually pretty good especially when it came to the design of the monster girls, there was a nice variety of them and they nicely detailed plus there was some interesting choices of the body types that the girls had and I have to give some kind of applause for making a monster girls sexy because if something like this happened in real life i don't think the reaction would be the same.The fanservice in this anime was definitely high as the first scene started with bare breasts and you definitely see a lot of bare breasts throughout this show although you would think with this amount of fan service it would take you out of the show, but it surprisingly didn't and actually made a lot of the moments very funny.Which brings me onto the comedy which was hilarious each of the girls would cause some kind of mayhem for the MC and it was always funny how he either got out of it or how he suffered it because this MC went through so much crap and is still alive by the end, considering these are monster girls that is definitely an achievement.For Romance I'm surprised the MC was able to make each of the girls happy even though he has like six of them in his harem and will probably keep on growing so I'm surprised none of the girls have tried to kill him yet, but that's mainly because unlike most people in this anime he doesn't care about their monster half in fact he thinks it makes them unique and special because they can do things that normal humans can't do which is what makes the girls envious of him.Overall for a Harem anime this was actually pretty fun and somewhat different since instead of normal human girls we have monster girls and thanks to anime even something that isn't fully human can be sexy. on the personalities and comedic everyday life of the characters plus I think this probably the most destructive harem yet because these girls are part monster they have something that pretty much most harems don't have which

is a Lamia, despite being half snake Miia is actually a very sweet, naive and carefree person however being the first does make her the most jealous of the group as the more girls joined the less time she was able to spend with Kimihito though over time she does start to get on with the girls despite always getting into arguments with them and one more thing just make sure you don't eat anything she makes unless you really want to upset your stomach.Papi is the second girl and is a Harpy so she is half bird and because she is half bird her body to age ratio is a lot different to the others as to them she looks like a child while she is actually an adult however her personality is very child like as she is always wanting to play though she has been given the term birdbrain because of her short term memory which always makes conversations with her difficult.Centorea the third girl is a Centaur making her half horse and she is a very noble person often trying to shield Kimihito from dangerous situations and is always on constant alert this can however make her very strict with the other girls who always rebel against her words thought she can be a sweet and vulnerable person if you are able to get onto her good side.Suu is the fourth girl and she is actually a humanoid slime making her the oddest member of the group, she doesn't communicate well with the others and mainly copies what they do, but she doesn't hesitate to cling onto them especially when their sweating so she can collect it for herself and she even has mind reading and transformation abilities yet despite all of this she is definitely one thing and that's adorable.Meroune is the fifth girl and is a Mermaid, her tone of voice is much like Centorea's, but to the point where it sounds like she is of nobility and as a little girl she enjoyed stories that involved tragedies so she wants to be with Kimihito so she can experience it for herself which can make her a little loony sometime's.Rachnera is the sixth girl and is an Arachne, despite having the body of a spider Rachnera is a sexually devious masochist as she likes to use the other girls as play things for her webs and other things, although because of her body she is looked at as a monster and finds it difficult to socialise until Kimihito came along and thought her legs looked sexy which then changed her perspective.There are also other characters like Miss Smith and her MON group who do help Kimihito from time to time to help out with his monster girl situation although most of the time they use him as way to get a free meal although the monster girls in the MON group did actually get to spent some time with him at some point and see why the other girls like him.The artstyle was actually pretty good especially when it came to the design of the monster girls, there was a nice variety of them and they nicely detailed plus there was some interesting choices of the body types that the girls had and I have to give some kind of applause for making a monster girls sexy because if something like this happened in real life i don't think the reaction would be the same.The fanservice in this anime was definitely high as the first scene started with bare breasts and you definitely see a lot of bare breasts throughout this show although you would think with this amount of fan service it would take you out of the show, but it surprisingly didn't and actually made a lot of the moments very funny.Which brings me onto the comedy which was hilarious each of the girls would cause some kind of mayhem for the MC and it was always funny how he either got out of it or how he suffered it because this MC went through so much crap and is still alive by the end, considering these are monster girls that is definitely an achievement.For Romance I'm surprised the MC was able to make each of the girls happy even though he has like six of them in his harem and will probably keep on growing so I'm surprised none of the girls have tried to kill him yet, but that's mainly because unlike most people in this anime he doesn't care about their monster half in fact he thinks it makes them unique and special because they can do things that normal humans can't do which is what makes the girls envious of him.Overall for a Harem anime this was actually pretty fun and somewhat different since instead of normal human girls we have monster girls and thanks to anime even something that isn't fully human can be sexy."", ""tl;dr: An incredibly amusing and incredibly well made show about a group of monster girls.This anime was incredibly amusing. There isn't much in the way of plot, with the show being entirely character driven. The main character Kimihito is also a pretty flat character mostly, however he's not the type that gets annoying. Rather, he does what he has to do and is essentially able to deal with everything in a pretty solid manner, so he's still easily likable. Now that doesn't really allow much room for growth for him and so he he doesn't really experience any, at least in this series, but it...allows everything regarding the girls to move along really well. Each of the monster girls are introduced in a pretty solid manner that introduces their personalities and some of their quirks, at which point they become part of the family so to speak. At this point, it becomes all about their relationships among each other, which is really interesting. They all have pretty unique personalities that mesh really well, and the writing for how they interact with each other is incredibly well done. It's both heartwarming and really amusing at times, certainly enough to just beam happiness at you. That combined with the pacing being really solid and never dragging on at all for the whole series, the comedy being incredibly solid, and the girls just being a pleasure to watch makes this series immensely enjoyable. A testament to that is the short specials, which are a set of 60 30-second or so clips that pretty much completely lack any narrative whatsoever but were also quite amusing.The designs were great, art well done, and animation solid which overall made the show feel really polished. The OP was perfect for the show both visually and in terms of the song. The ED kind of feel like it doesn't fit, as it focused on a secondary set of characters that are kind of important but don't feel focused on enough to have the ED entirely based on them, but I guess it works to a degree. The soundtrack was fine. allows everything regarding the girls to move along really well.

Everything I ever want in a Harem anime Overloded BooBs at their peak, indecisive MC, nip slips and sudden cloths coming off very close to being a masterpiece in the a harem and ecchi genre.First of all Rachnera rules exactly what I want in a character so sexy yet so calm in so absurd situations. Miia as a lamia also stole the show at first 2-3 episodes. Papi for me was annoying, Cerea had HUGE MONSTER BOOBS loved that. Loved Mero however she had less screen time due to lack of materials in the manga at first few chapters.The art...work for the anime is precisely what I want in a harem. Graphics were absolutely astonishing and breathtaking.I enjoyed every second of it rewatched it 5-6 times atleast never got bored for even once.The only compliant I have for this anime is that it had far too little episodes. It needed atleast 25 episodes to satisfy a viewers thirst.The sound was okay.Overall must watch if you are a harem fan. Things like this come once in a blue moon. You can binge watch the entire season in one go. Even the OVA's are top notch. work for the anime is precisely what I want in a harem.

There were definitely some times that it was so absurd that I couldn't help but laugh. The show never took itself too seriously, which considering the overall story and ideas behind the show, is a good thing. There is just no way this could be turned into something serious. There are great character development moments, but they are far and few between in the 12...episodes offered.The biggest thing I was confused about was the amount of fan service that didn't really show anything. I understand that not all fan service is visual, but with how ecchi/harem this was, I was confused at how odd it played out in that fashion.Definitely worth a watch if you are into the genre, or have an odd/morbid sense of curiosity like I do.

Especially as a point of comparison for other series with monster girls such as Monster Musume no Oishasan. And my conclusion is that Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is indeed the superior series of the two.The story and plot are straightforward and simple. Because the government wants to keep the peace between humans and monster races, cultural exchange programs have begun. Our main character is the (un)fortunate host for several monster girls. Of course, all of these girls adore him in one way or another.Aside from the monster...girl aspect, it’s very much a typical romantic comedy harem series. The ecchi isn’t all that intrusive or shocking when compared to other series in the genre, and I feel that this is a good thing. Yes, there is a lot of fanservice, but the crucial point here is that MonMusu doesn’t rely on this fanservice to keep the series going.The individual girls’ personalities interact in such a way that they keep the viewer engaged. I suppose that the humor becomes a bit predictable after a while, but I thought it was entertaining nonetheless. While I won’t say the monster girls have a lot of depth, there are plenty of them. Which means there are all kinds of troubles they get themselves (and the main character) into. MonMusu actually feels like it got lost somewhere in between an ecchi, romantic comedy, and slice-of-life series, but in the best possible way.The art and animation is decent, as are the sound effects. The OP and ED are catchy a well.All in all, I enjoyed my time with MonMusu. It’s easy on the eyes and the brain. I didn’t feel like I was watching a derivative work despite the fact that all of the individual elements involved were far from new or fresh. It’s somehow creative enough to keep your attention for its short runtime of 12 episodes. girl aspect, it’s very much a typical romantic comedy harem series.

The shameless ecchi gets annoying after a while, though sometimes the shamelessness itself was amusing. There were a couple funny moments that made me laugh. It  also seems to be aware enough to know that it's a stupid show; that doesn't *not* make it stupid, but at least that's something. Voice acting in the English dub is respectable. The animation and character design aren't bad. It's very goofy yet not that funny. And if you're not laughing or in it for the ecchi then you've got nothing left here.I think this would've been a way more interesting anime...if the monster part of the girls was their heads instead of their legs.

You may wonder well if I despise them well why do I enjoy this one? Well this harem I have a love and hate opinion on it. And I'll tell you why.Monster Musume is a harem anime that has no story but enjoyable at the same time. The story is about a guy with no eyeballs and also a name that I don't remember who lives with a lamia named Miia.But wait there's more he lives with her because he is...her host so she can learn the cultures of Japan.But as the first episode progresses you get to know that Miia loves Darling and wants his D. But the problem is that he can't have any intercourse with her or else he would get arrested and she will go back to where she came from...and that's the story nothing else after that.Currently there are 6 main females who live with this guy. And all want the D. Each of there personalities making the show fun and enjoyable to watch. There where some moments that I laughed at the characters interactions and reactions of certain situations. But the jokes get repetitive for a while and it gets old making my smile go just meh. Just because I enjoyed the characters doesn't mean I liked some of there personalities. For example Miia and Mero I think Miia is somewhat annoying always being Jealous of girls which leads to the MC getting hurt mostly by her. Then there is Mero I like her but I think she is just even more useless than Miia. Come on she doesn't even pop up as much in the series like the others.But since that rant is over let me say my finale thoughts. Monster Musume is a ecchi harem that was made for laughs and giggles. If you expect more that that you will be disappointed. But I am surprised since I'm a girl who hated harem and ecchi literally sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for the next episode to come on.

Slime, Mermaid and dullahan were my favorites.I found them playing their role and their special monster quirks for lewds done very well. Whilst giving some drama and character development between the MC and the girls.Speaking of MC, even though he is rather typical harem protagonist. I found him very enjoyable a somewhat different than usual. Probably his odd numbness to certain things made him rather enjoyable.

I waited since Toho Animation first announced it. I loved it to bits and I enjoyed every single episode of it, the voice actors did a wonderful job and the animation is pretty well done. Monster Musume is basically a comedy, you shouldn\'t care about the plot that much couse It\'s not even a series to be taken seriously, It\'s just pure (well executed) ecchi comedy. Why didn\'t I give it a higher rate if I praise it so much? I know that the phrase...""the manga is better"" is pretty common nowdays, but Monster Musume is a clear example of that. they cut lot\'s of awesome chapters like ""the mothers day"". they should\'ve done at least 24 episodes to get everything perfectly done. Anyways, if you wanna have a really good time, you should DEFINETLY watch Monster Musume ""the manga is better"" is pretty common nowdays, but Monster Musume is a clear example of that. they cut lot\'s of awesome chapters like ""the mothers day"". they should\'ve done at least 24 episodes to get everything perfectly done. Anyways, if you wanna have a really good time, you should DEFINETLY watch Monster Musume', ""This anime was not very good; however, it was so stupid that I did find myself enjoying it sometimes. The characters and the plot were pretty 1 dimensional and nothing of consequence really happens except sex but it's not actually sex for reasons. The girls range from slightly annoying to maybe giving a single shit. I also do not think I heard the main character’s name being said once and instead he gets called the usually kink-satisfying names. There isn’t much to say about this anime, to be honest, it's just a shitty anime that's entertaining because it's bad.Score: 3.8/10*date: Sept 18, 2022 "", 'So...Gonna stray from my usual review style for this one.I don\'t know what to say other than it was a really late night at a friends house and then this ended up on the TV.Alright now that my excuse is out of the way lets uh... lets get started... (why am I doing this?)[Story] 2/10 - *flips through notes* Hmm... *flips through more notes* HMM... *throws notebook onto the floor* WHAT PLOT?! Either I was way to tired and braindead to understand it or this show has no plot. OK it can\'t have no plot it\'s impossible. Let\'s just take a good look at a...few of the episodes. *10 minutes into Episode 1* Alright... I\'m back and I think I get it. Some guy with no eyes gets a harem of monster girls just cause and he can\'t smash cause that\'d break the law.... Makes sense. But on a more serious note there is little to no plot development other than what I just said. Each episode kinda has it\'s own story, but it rarely follows the story over several episodes. So we get a lot of presumed time jumps and random events that happen to work out.[Art] 8/10 - I know what you are thinking... and no it\'s not why I\'m giving this such a high rating. It\'s cause the animation and design choices for the characters are actually pretty good. The creator of the manga Okayado did seem to spend time creating fairly unique and interesting looking characters. It really shows if you are brave enough to even touch a copy of this in the general public or wait until the end credits and ED are over for a small screen which shows different variants of each ""monster girl"" I-I really don\'t know what to call them so I\'m going with that.[Sound] 6/10 - The music was fairly good through the whole series, but you must be asking ""Why is your score a 6 out of 10?"". That\'s simple. The OP and ED make me want to bash my skull in. Everytime I hear the song I get flashbacks and then remember that we as humans have really reached their evolutionary pinnacle.[Character] 4/10 - I guess the only reason this is a 4 is because it seems that they give most of the characters a good amount of screen time. Not too much not too little. That and these hollow characters only take about 5 minutes to fully flesh out. Other than that you can sum up the characters like so. *points to snake* ""Clingy"" *points to birb* ""Loli"" *points to derpy horse* ""uuuhhhh..... horse"". *points to slime* ""slime"" *points to fishy* ""Wheelchair"" *points to spider* ""this is a pg review right?""[Enjoyment] 2/10 - Literally all of my joy came from one or two actually funny jokes. The rest of it came from watching and reacting to me and my friends reactions to what the hell is going on.

Neither of them align with my personal tastes, and I find the tropes associated with them among the worst anime has to offer. But that doesn’t mean I’m just going to write off the entire genre. I mean, Ouran was essentially a reverse harem show, and it\'s one of my favorite high school comedies ever. I’m certain there are good shows out there that fall into these categories, and one day, I might come across one that sways me to the potential of what these genres have to offer.But I know this for...sure: if any ecchi harem is going to earn my affection, it’s going to have to a lot fucking harder than Monster fucking Musume.As the name suggests, the one gimmick Musume is working with to distinguish itself from the rest of its genre is the fact that all the members of Generic Self-Insert MC #72638\'s harem are, in fact, monster girls. In the show\'s universe, monster races have just made their existence known and have started to integrate into human society. The MC, best known by his pet name ""Darling"", has been roped by a government agent for Reasons(tm) into being a host family for ""liasons"" of the various races who have come to visit human society. As is to be expected, these all end up being hot girls who inevitably fall in love with Darling\'s lack of personality right off the bat. But wait! It\'s illegal for human hosts to hurt their visiting wards in any way, INCLUDING having sex with them. Which means the entire show is basically one massive cocktease where the various girls try to bone Darling but are stopped at every turn by alternatively the other monster girls, who all want that sweet, sweet viewer self-insert dick for themselves, and Smith, the slacker government agent who watches over them to make sure no ""funny business"" goes down.Musume is a perfect example of every reason this genre gives me pause. The girls only exist to fawn over the sell-insert main character and show off their bodies for the presumed male audience to jack off over. None of the characters have any sense of inner life. And aside from the monster gimmick, which isn’t really utilized beyond a few moments, there’s no creativity to the situations or tittilation. There\'s actually a glimmer of a good idea in there, what with the monster girls being treated almost like foreign transfer students in an overwhelmingly prejudiced system, and the too-infrequent moments where the show taps into this concept are the few moments where it almost comes alive. But for 90% of the show\'s runtime, it’s all just bland sacks of rice with tits attached humping to unmemorable music, coupled with a disjointed, amateurish production that regularly had me sinking into a daze watching this show.That might actually be it’s biggest crime: it’s just straight-up boring. There is literally nothing of interest to serve as a focal point for your attention through the dull characters and janky editing. There’s no effort here, no passion, just the laziest possible fanservice loosely cobbled together into the approximation of a show pandering to the lowest common denominator and hoping it sells enough doujins and body pillows to make this waste of time and effort worth it. And considering that this show was actually BASED on a doujin initially, part of me wonders if it wouldn\'t have been better off just being straight-up hentai. Because the one unqualified positive it has is its ability to legitimately erotic at points, and if it didn’t have to censor itself into a passably “family friendly” condition for general broadcast, it could really let loose. It almost doesn’t feel right to criticize Musume, because this so clearly isn’t it’s true form. It was never supposed to be judged as a normal anime, even though it’s been abysmally contorted to fit that shape.And if there’s one thing that’s stopping me from letting my opinion on this mealy pasteboard slip down to a 1/10, to the same fetid recesses where Guilty Crown lies in wait, howling in loneliness, it’s that this show so clearly doesn’t matter enough to hate that much. You have to try to suck as hard as Guilty Crown sucked. But this show is so clearly not in its element that it’s impossible to get worked up into a frothing rage over its many faults; a great pianist might perform miserably on guitar, but why would you ascribe their worth to the instrument that doesn’t represent them at their best? Monster Musume is just too much nothing to care about, a boring, vapid slog through familiar territory that doesn’t even pretend to be anything more than that. sure: if any ecchi harem is going to earn my affection, it’s going to have to a lot fucking harder than Monster fucking Musume.As the name suggests, the one gimmick Musume is working with to distinguish itself from the rest of its genre is the fact that all the members of Generic Self-Insert MC #72638\'s harem are, in fact, monster girls. In the show\'s universe, monster races have just made their existence known and have started to integrate into human society. The MC, best known by his pet name ""Darling"", has been roped by a government agent for Reasons(tm) into being a host family for ""liasons"" of the various races who have come to visit human society. As is to be expected, these all end up being hot girls who inevitably fall in love with Darling\'s lack of personality right off the bat. But wait! It\'s illegal for human hosts to hurt their visiting wards in any way, INCLUDING having sex with them. Which means the entire show is basically one massive cocktease where the various girls try to bone Darling but are stopped at every turn by alternatively the other monster girls, who all want that sweet, sweet viewer self-insert dick for themselves, and Smith, the slacker government agent who watches over them to make sure no ""funny business"" goes down.Musume is a perfect example of every reason this genre gives me pause. The girls only exist to fawn over the sell-insert main character and show off their bodies for the presumed male audience to jack off over. None of the characters have any sense of inner life. And aside from the monster gimmick, which isn’t really utilized beyond a few moments, there’s no creativity to the situations or tittilation. There\'s actually a glimmer of a good idea in there, what with the monster girls being treated almost like foreign transfer students in an overwhelmingly prejudiced system, and the too-infrequent moments where the show taps into this concept are the few moments where it almost comes alive. But for 90% of the show\'s runtime, it’s all just bland sacks of rice with tits attached humping to unmemorable music, coupled with a disjointed, amateurish production that regularly had me sinking into a daze watching this show.That might actually be it’s biggest crime: it’s just straight-up boring. There is literally nothing of interest to serve as a focal point for your attention through the dull characters and janky editing. There’s no effort here, no passion, just the laziest possible fanservice loosely cobbled together into the approximation of a show pandering to the lowest common denominator and hoping it sells enough doujins and body pillows to make this waste of time and effort worth it. And considering that this show was actually BASED on a doujin initially, part of me wonders if it wouldn\'t have been better off just being straight-up hentai. Because the one unqualified positive it has is its ability to legitimately erotic at points, and if it didn’t have to censor itself into a passably “family friendly” condition for general broadcast, it could really let loose. It almost doesn’t feel right to criticize Musume, because this so clearly isn’t it’s true form. It was never supposed to be judged as a normal anime, even though it’s been abysmally contorted to fit that shape.And if there’s one thing that’s stopping me from letting my opinion on this mealy pasteboard slip down to a 1/10, to the same fetid recesses where Guilty Crown lies in wait, howling in loneliness, it’s that this show so clearly doesn’t matter enough to hate that much. You have to try to suck as hard as Guilty Crown sucked. But this show is so clearly not in its element that it’s impossible to get worked up into a frothing rage over its many faults; a great pianist might perform miserably on guitar, but why would you ascribe their worth to the instrument that doesn’t represent them at their best?

It\'s that they usually try and include some complex backstory or plot to drive the show. Trying to balance both serious plot and ""plot"" scenes generally is hard to do in this genre.Monster Musume doesn\'t do that, it\'s really simple, and doesn\'t go into some story about some diabolical villain trying to take over the world and the MC plus harem are the only ones to stop them. Or MC is the only male who can use mechs and some villain comes to fight him, also his harem try to seduce him every chance they get...while people are dying all around them.It is really simple just some guy and a bunch of monsters in this new world live under the same house. He\'s a host and by law he can\'t bang them because it\'s illegal or he will end up in jail along with some diplomatic/political things.This is what made the show great because it was then able to focus on being extremely funny and ecchi. While it also surprising touched on some ideas of society that can be related to real life and how different people are treated. while people are dying all around them.It is really simple just some guy and a bunch of monsters in this new world live under the same house.

Who is best – best what? Not best girl, certainly.It truly is a funny series, digging into classics such as the scooting around while under a box, seen in the first episode of “Nichijou.” And it does make the most of the unique situation it has given itself. The phone dropped into the slime in the same episode is comedy gold. The protagonist is the usual clueless NEET, but the other characters do develop – there are some who might say they, except for the loli (who we’re informed is a grownup), were over-developed to begin with. And we’ve seen inter-species romance try to take itself too seriously – in my estimation, this way is better.One glaring plot hole has to do with – how to put this delicately? – the lack of character holes. There are mechanical issues: Even were the protagonist to settle down with one of the girl monsters, there wouldn’t be much for them to do, unless the chosen one is the bird-girl chick (heh heh) who has a cloaca, or the centaur, who has what’s found at the south end of a mare facing north. But the snake-girl, mermaid (who says she isn’t interested, and final episode notwithstanding) and the spider-girl are out of luck – good thing for the protagonist with the last of these, in that spiders tend to devour their mates – and it’s difficult to imagine the slime generating enough friction to get the deed done.A little-known biological theory is revealed in Monster Musume: All female monsters have remarkably similar breasts, except for loli monsters (the one here has refreshingly proportionate tiddies) and slimes, who for some reason have inverted nipples.(While the centaur-girl was not my favorite, I think she did make the most of her situation, appearing soon after as “Darkness” in “Kono Suba.” And it’s good to see that Turanga Leela found work after “Futurama” got canceled.)There are even a few lessons wedged in, not the least being spider-girl’s soliloquy on how it’s okay to dislike someone. And the send-up of old-time Japanese monster movies, complete with dirt and scratches in the “film,” is brilliant, as is its happy ending: “Well, I guess the way he sucked on my boobs was nice and gentle.” The zombie-girl-cop has stitches on her face that make her head look like a baseball, so that’s a plus. And in the final episode, there’s even a cabbage that’s just a green ball, in violation of the carefully rendered cabbage rule. There’s more here than just fan service.The question, of course, is who is best girl? It’s obviously “Smith,” who also wins the award for only girl. (At least we think so – hers are the only boobies we don’t see. She might be a guy. This is anime.) UPDATE: In the second, otherwise unremarkable, episode of the two-part OVA, we see that ""Smith"" apparently does have tiddies, though in keeping with tradition, we see everyone else\'s but not hers.Pretty good show, actually.Oh, and – why not? -- a bonus haiku:“Monster Musume”?“Interspecies Reviewers”?I’ll take the former.

""Why am I doing this?""Now, this isn\'t the first show I\'ve watched despite my good sense telling me that I really should avoid it.  And a lot of the time, going in on strong recommendations, I\'ve come out surprisingly happy with the result.  This one was a more... mixed bag.Let\'s start with the warnings -- the show can get pretty raunchy.  It\'s absolutely not something you should watch in the presence of others, or really without headphones in a lot of cases.  The fanservice really does go beyond,...so be prepared.  That said, in the course of the show, there were only a few times I honestly felt uncomfortable (despite typically having a low shame threshold) -- I can speculate some reasons for that later.As to weaknesses, the big one is the Story.  Or, rather, lack of a story.  While it does follow a fairly steady chronological order with a reasonable chain of cause and effect, it\'s more a series of Vignettes.  Despite two attempts to give the show a plot with a running time beyond a single episode (or, in many cases, half an episode) that the typical event in the show takes up, there\'s really no accomplishment in the overall scheme.  True, the status quo has changed, with our poor protagonist now living with seven monstergirls rather than just one, but you can\'t really say that much has been learned or any forward motion been made.  The first plot the show drops (Trying to push MC to pick a girl and marry her) is practically forgotten, while the second (A mysterious, threatening letter) serves as the impetus for several vignettes but never really feels like it figures and pays off only with a pretty lame joke.That\'s not to say the vignettes are bad, but there\'s nothing else there.  Also on weaknesses, the art and sound are only OK at best.  I actually found myself skipping the opening song, which is a rarity for me, because the animation attached was nothing special compared to the show itself and the song I personally found to be just a little annoying.So, how about the good?  My god, the characters.  It\'s typical in shows with a large female cast to have a lot of the characters fill a romantic archetype, and nothing more, but the girls of Monster Musume all have a lot more personality than you might expect, with their own quirks and intricacies that open up a lot of comedic possibilities.  There\'s not one of the (main) girls who doesn\'t have at least a few notes to play or isn\'t at least a little likable.  Given the size of the cast by the end, that\'s fairly impressive.The timing and quality of the slapstick is also dead on.  You can say what you will about the content, and the ""lewd as punchline"" could get old, but this is a show that has the basics of physical comedy fairly perfect -- it\'s not touching the wrong place or getting smothered, bludgeoned, drowned, or otherwise victimized (in a racy way or not) that\'s funny, it\'s how the characters act and react to the situation.  And today\'s slapstick victim (usually MC Darling-kun) is always abused in the right way to the right reaction to get at least a smile if not an actual laugh.It\'s these strengths that, I feel, make the show less awkward than it by all rights should be.  In other shows, where fanservice technically less intense than that in Monster Musume is done by cheap camera angles and improbable costumes -- essentially, forced into an arena where it doesn\'t belong -- attention is drawn to the awkward nature of the scenario.  In Monster Musume, everything throws together not (just) to titillate, but also to deliver some humor, and the humor is a good mixture of likable but insane characters in scenarios that should be (but aren\'t quite) painful or embarassing, so in the end that\'s what you notice.  The audience isn\'t the (sole) target here, it\'s all to the point of messing with Darling-kun.In a similar way, having such good characters helps make up for the weak story: the average vignette uses its plot as an excuse to introduce or explore a character (usually one of the main girls, but they aren\'t totally alone), and the characters are good so you don\'t particularly care that they aren\'t doing much of import.  I guess this should have been expected, given that one of the titles for the show is ""Everyday Life with Monstergirls"", that it would deliver essentially everyday life.In the end, I can\'t quite recommend it, because it wasn\'t exactly my cup of tea and I could even see how someone could come away with a vastly lower opinion than my own, but I will say that if you\'re interested in a slapstick romantic comedy with some decently written and at least somewhat creatively designed characters, there\'s nothing wrong with giving Monster Musume a look.  It\'s sort of fluff and sometimes very lewd, but it\'s fine for what it is.Story: 3Art: 6Sound: 5Character: 8Enjoyment: 7Overall: 5 so be prepared.  That said, in the course of the show, there were only a few times I honestly felt uncomfortable (despite typically having a low shame threshold) -- I can speculate some reasons for that later.As to weaknesses, the big one is the Story.  Or, rather, lack of a story.  While it does follow a fairly steady chronological order with a reasonable chain of cause and effect, it\'s more a series of Vignettes.  Despite two attempts to give the show a plot with a running time beyond a single episode (or, in many cases, half an episode) that the typical event in the show takes up, there\'s really no accomplishment in the overall scheme.

So more new this time are but at the end of the day it's still a con that all of it isn't new art style and animation because it today it looks really good and has aged well.2) Second major issue is obviously what every movie retelling of an anime suffers from and this is story content (that i felt was important enough to be mentioned) missing from this part. The first part did it and so did this one, I'm only going to name one example since when it comes to these reviews they don't want us spoiling the story it's basically the part in the original anime that explains how the Zeta Gundam is created and who creates the blue prints for it originally, none of this was explained in this part which I felt it should have because if you haven't watched the anime you'll never know.So basically in my opinion this part is definitely better than the first I felt even though it was missing certain scenes I felt where important it still cover a lot of content for what it was and I do commend that and if there are any pros about this movie it would definitely be that.Lastly just like I said in for the first part I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen the original 80s 50 episode version. I my opinion that is still the definitive version for Zeta Gundam and once again I can only recommend this to people who has seen Zeta Gundam a long time ago and barely remember anything about the characters or plot these movie parts. one feels like it has 45% old art style and animation and 55% which in comparison to the old one it felt more like 35% New and 65% old.

Sakura Trick,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20047/Sakura_Trick,"[""This right here is a cult classic, a chef d'oeuvrea buried under erroneous preconceptions and unfounded criticism. This gem is obscured because it does not shine; it is buried because its tone is that of abyssal black. Sakura Trick pries into to the darkest corners of our subconscious, the most visceral of our cognition, the most carnal of our urges, and the most primal of our instincts. Its sublimity will ever be debated yet always remain objectively irrefutable; the fundamental insight it provides into human and perhaps animalistic nature may shape the basis of sexual psychoanalysis for millennia to come.Superficially, Sakura Trick appears to...be an anime which caters to the most lowly and deprived among men; conceited critics dismiss it as such often without a second thought. As self-important as these self-proclaimed critics are, they fail to realize that Sakura Trick is indeed a trick, and they are the ones being tricked. Sakura petals, or cherry blossoms, are commonly associated with a sense of beauty and innocence in Japanese culture. As discussed by Ango Sakaguchi in Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita, sakura petals are often a means to enhance and stylize the atmosphere of a scene, be it melancholic, resplendent or sensual. Used famously in 5 Centimeters per Second, the sakura petals constructs an immense yet artificial atmosphere which proved successful in fooling the average fool incapable of critical analysis. What most critics fail to realize, however, is that Sakura Trick is playing them beyond this level. The entire visible layer of Sakura Trick is a euphemistic veil obfuscating the dark and uncanny human psyche which it explores; any tangible material is a metaphor for its meticulous meta-analysis of the metaphysical mentality’s pubertal metamorphosis.As brilliantly put by Charles Baudelaire, “La sexualité est le lyrisme des masses.” In Ulysses, James Joyce subverts gender conceptions by deconstructing sexual stereotypes; in Lolita, Vladimir Nobakov delves into the abnormal perversion of hebephilia; in Doctor Glas, Hjalmar Soderberg studies sexual catharsis through murder; in Aquarion EVOL, Shoji Kawamori studies the manifestation of repressed sexuality as love. Time and again, great thinkers have demonstrated the immense potential of sexual psychoanalysis in narrative form.Sakura Trick fulfills this potential.The exterior plotline of Sakura Trick is straight forward - two damsels unknowingly in love with each other: Sonoda Yuu and Takayama Haruka, start high school in the same class with four other apparent lesbians. This premise alone poses innumerable questions of pertinence - most of which are problematized further and explored as the series progresses. Why are two girls romantically interested in each other? Why are there four more girls of questionable sexual orientation in their class? Were they perhaps influenced by Haruka’s and Yuu’s display of intimacy, implying a nurture over nature determination of sexuality? Do their behaviors suggest abnormalities in their amygdala activity, or is such behavior governed by the wider cerebral hemispheres?  Hailed as the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud once said, “The sexual life of adult women is a dark continent for psychology.” The stringency and inadaptability of the traditional approach practiced by psychologists is to blame for this. Sakura Trick is unshackled from such rigidities - by investigating high school girls in late puberty, a time and setting in which sexuality is at its most volatile, and doing so through homosexuality rather than the vapid norm, it sheds light on the enigma which has eluded psychologists for centuries.Perhaps most imperative and counter-intuitive of all, Sakura Trick investigates male sexuality through the scope of lesbianism. Je veux te baiser, baisez-moi! What is the sexual appeal in a couple which can only engage in abortive reproduction? When exposed to intercourse in explicit yuri, it is plausible that lust for the opposite gender can override the notion of evolutionary feasibility. Despite the lack of explicit intercourse in Sakura Trick, male viewers nonetheless experience a craving for the girls’ well-being instead of jealousy and contempt for one of them as would be rational. This paradox challenges not only the Darwinian theories of evolution, but also Freud’s theories of sexuality. He wrote, “A man's heterosexuality will not put up with any homosexuality, and vice versa.” Sakura Trick proves the exact contrary: heterosexual men more than put up with the homosexuality in the series. According to psychologist Henry Havelock Ellis, “Reproduction… is highly complex and not yet clearly understood. It is not necessarily connected with sex, nor is sex necessarily connected with reproduction.” Havelockian philosophy noticeably makes its mark in Sakura Trick; by taking hold of this anomaly in human behaviour and untangling its implications, it explores the darkest depths of our consciousness which borders between flesh and mind.In his essay The Sexual Abberations, Freud discusses human disposition to perversions, including hebephilia, as an original and universal disposition of the human sexual instinct which is not limited to the psychologically ill. Sakura Trick takes this theory beyond mere discourse and puts it into practice. The characters in Sakura Trick are impeccably crafted, not only in their characterization and likability but primarily in their support of the series’ psychological study. Rather than each being equipped with sexually inviting traits, some characters are simply “cute”, for lack of a less vulgar word. A certain je ne sais quoi of the girls are successful in generating not just physical, but more importantly emotional cravings from the audience.The brilliant technique of Sakura Trick’s probing into the atavistic lust is most aptly demonstrated through the analysis of the two main characters: Haruka and Yuu. On the one hand, Haruka is characterized by her lascivious and manipulative personality, pneumatic figure, seductive voice, and red hair indicative of her prurience. In contrast, Yuu has an innocent demeanor, underemphasized curves, a sweet voice characterized by childlike tenderness, and bright amber hair adorned with flowers – all of which are suggestive of a girl in the early stages of puberty. By contrasting these dichotomous traits, Sakura Trick follows in the wake of Vladimir Nobakov and his analysis of the abominable erotic attraction to the so called “nymphets”. A range of recent research by neurologists suggest paedophilia’s origin as a deep-rooted predisposition that does not change, rather than the previous theory of causation by psychological influences. Perhaps influenced by this paradigm shift, Sakura Trick attempts what has never been done before – bringing out, in men, pseudo-paedophilic reactions to girls older than the previously stipulated plateau age of thirteen. This is achieved through the stark contrast between Haruka’s maturity and Yuu’s infantility which tampers with the viewers’ preset dispositions. The additional fact that it succeeds in bringing out such abnormal responses not only in the susceptible older population, but chiefly among the young, truly underscores the groundbreaking impact of Sakura Trick.La peinture parle d'elle-même, il n'y a rien à dire; to describe the artistic qualia of Sakura Trick would be to describe colour to the blind, wisdom to the young, or life to the unliving. The artistic eminence of this series is utterly unparalleled. The visuals are primarily based on a minimalistic design reminiscent of Frank Stella’s later paintings, yet some of the most visceral moments of the series display a paradoxical resemblance to abstract expressionism. This visual style is augmented by subtly and tactfully altering its background or occasionally foreground objects into abstract patterns or drawings depending on the situation and atmosphere. Certain patterns such as polka dots reoccur frequently throughout the series, showing inspirations from early pop-art but crafting a style most avant la lettre. In a masterful display of expertise in art-direction, these aesthetic shifts are extremely frequent yet uncontrived and never interfere with the viewers’ immersion. This enigmatic and radical style vividly complements the metaphysical nature of the series, reinforcing its character as an original pastiche of the post-modernist movement. It is an embodiment and perfection of the ideals that SHAFT had in mind for but failed to accomplish in their shows such as the Monogatari Series and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.Another of Sakura Trick’s aesthetic perks is its use of letterboxing: further cinematic flare is added to the already immersive series through the occasional framing of the video in bars. However, in an bold act of defiance and subversion, Sakura Trick makes use of white bars rather than the traditional black. In addition exuding an ephemerally fey charm, the white letterboxing holds several implications that one may only speculate on. Does it symbolize the series’ immense depth as it creates a dual-layered letterboxing on monitors which do not match its aspect ratio? Does its brightness reflect the series’ enlightening exploration of the previously unknown? Does it indicate the series’ nature as an antithesis to conventional psychology? Incidentally, Sakura Trick shows an abnormal and seemingly perverse focus on the characters thighs. In any other context, this would be plain pandering to the lowest common denominator. Nevertheless, when contextualized in sexual analysis one will realize the use of thighs as a study of fetishistic reactions to sexually inert objects. Sakura trick is sublime not only in the depth of its investigation, but also in its breadth.Enjoyment may be a pivotal factor of anime-viewing for the ordinary viewer. For experienced critics such as I, however, examining a show of such depth and complexity brings only misery and agony (which true intellectuals welcome, mind you). Attempts at analyzing Sakura Trick’s implications and unraveling its messages necessitate great concentration and effort, which is further exacerbated when so much of my blood flows elsewhere than my brain when viewing this show. As studied in neuromagnetic stimulations, encumbering the brain to a great extent can be a cause for physical pain. We critics are martyrs – through our self-sacrifice we free plebeians of their ignorance and ablute them of their sins.There have been numerous undisputable masterpieces among anime, such as the Ishihaya Tatsuya’s strikingly realistic classic Clannad or the tactique extraordinaire Code Geass by Taniguchi Goro. Sakura Trick will not join their ranks; its surface is too generic, its themes too provocative, and its messages too obscure. It will remain underground – treasured by the most avant-garde among intellectuals for its edifying if horrifying insight into the fundaments of sexuality. Philistines and self-proclaimed critics alike will shun Sakura Trick, but you can’t fault them for that. It takes boundless wisdom to appreciate its subtleties, and courage to side with the unpopular opinion. Sed domi maneas paresque nobis novem continuas fututiones. The time of Sigmund Freud’s sovereignty over psychoanalysis has passed; Sakura Trick is the herald of a new era that is to come. be an anime which caters to the most lowly and deprived among men; conceited critics dismiss it as such often without a second thought.

The additional fact that it succeeds in bringing out such abnormal responses not only in the susceptible older population, but chiefly among the young, truly underscores the groundbreaking impact of Sakura Trick.La peinture parle d'elle-même, il n'y a rien à dire; to describe the artistic qualia of Sakura Trick would be to describe colour to the blind, wisdom to the young, or life to the unliving. The artistic eminence of this series is utterly unparalleled. The visuals are primarily based on a minimalistic design reminiscent of Frank Stella’s later paintings, yet some of the most visceral moments of the series display a paradoxical resemblance to abstract expressionism. This visual style is augmented by subtly and tactfully altering its background or occasionally foreground objects into abstract patterns or drawings depending on the situation and atmosphere. Certain patterns such as polka dots reoccur frequently throughout the series, showing inspirations from early pop-art but crafting a style most avant la lettre. In a masterful display of expertise in art-direction, these aesthetic shifts are extremely frequent yet uncontrived and never interfere with the viewers’ immersion. This enigmatic and radical style vividly complements the metaphysical nature of the series, reinforcing its character as an original pastiche of the post-modernist movement. It is an embodiment and perfection of the ideals that SHAFT had in mind for but failed to accomplish in their shows such as the Monogatari Series and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.Another of Sakura Trick’s aesthetic perks is its use of letterboxing: further cinematic flare is added to the already immersive series through the occasional framing of the video in bars. However, in an bold act of defiance and subversion, Sakura Trick makes use of white bars rather than the traditional black. In addition exuding an ephemerally fey charm, the white letterboxing holds several implications that one may only speculate on. Does it symbolize the series’ immense depth as it creates a dual-layered letterboxing on monitors which do not match its aspect ratio? Does its brightness reflect the series’ enlightening exploration of the previously unknown? Does it indicate the series’ nature as an antithesis to conventional psychology? Incidentally, Sakura Trick shows an abnormal and seemingly perverse focus on the characters thighs. In any other context, this would be plain pandering to the lowest common denominator. Nevertheless, when contextualized in sexual analysis one will realize the use of thighs as a study of fetishistic reactions to sexually inert objects. Sakura trick is sublime not only in the depth of its investigation, but also in its breadth.Enjoyment may be a pivotal factor of anime-viewing for the ordinary viewer. For experienced critics such as I, however, examining a show of such depth and complexity brings only misery and agony (which true intellectuals welcome, mind you). Attempts at analyzing Sakura Trick’s implications and unraveling its messages necessitate great concentration and effort, which is further exacerbated when so much of my blood flows elsewhere than my brain when viewing this show. As studied in neuromagnetic stimulations, encumbering the brain to a great extent can be a cause for physical pain. We critics are martyrs – through our self-sacrifice we free plebeians of their ignorance and ablute them of their sins.There have been numerous undisputable masterpieces among anime, such as the Ishihaya Tatsuya’s strikingly realistic classic Clannad or the tactique extraordinaire Code Geass by Taniguchi Goro. Sakura Trick will not join their ranks; its surface is too generic, its themes too provocative, and its messages too obscure. It will remain underground – treasured by the most avant-garde among intellectuals for its edifying if horrifying insight into the fundaments of sexuality. Philistines and self-proclaimed critics alike will shun Sakura Trick, but you can’t fault them for that. It takes boundless wisdom to appreciate its subtleties, and courage to side with the unpopular opinion. Sed domi maneas paresque nobis novem continuas fututiones. The time of Sigmund Freud’s sovereignty over psychoanalysis has passed; Sakura Trick is the herald of a new era that is to come."", 'At the start of the season, Sakura Trick came in strong. While there has been tons of yuri undertones in anime, characters with physically intimate relationships are still pretty rare, so seeing two high school girls locking fingers and making out was what one would consider ""the bees knees"", and animation segues in vain of Hidamari Sketch, and even the same DIRECTOR? Hell yeah. Sign me up. This could never get tiring, right?Turns out, it takes a mere half a season for it to go from a novelty to a daily routine. After a dozen and half make out sessions, they stop meaning anything and...begin to seem like a time filler. Beyond LESBIANS~, you are stuck with a cast of characters who are, quite frankly, dull as dishwater. Too much time is squandered away on Haruka, Yuu, and Mitsuki, and the rest of the supporting cast don\'t get enough individual screen time for themselves or to even get a chance to develop their own side-stories that aren\'t resolved instantaneously.While the OP and ED are high energy, the actual OST is rather serene, giving scenes that require a higher tempo BG no punch, and at times, comes off as dissonant with the activities and dialogs being exchanged. Even if backed by a proper OST, it still wouldn\'t help because gags are too seldom and too few warrant a chuckle.The visuals are fine, but mostly because it\'s similar to Hidamari Sketch, except heavily indentured. Part of Hidamark Sketch\'s charm was the odd animation segues, cutaways, and minimalism. The SHAFTisms separated it from its other SoL peers. Unfortunately, Studio Deen isn\'t SHAFT. They\'re a poor company who make low budget garbage like Hetalia, Higurashi, and Pupa, so we\'re left with the most basic fragments of Hidamari-esque cutaways. Instead of attempting to reinvent Hidamari\'s SHAFTisms, it\'s more than content to copycat them very, very poorly. Aside from those little touches, the coloring, while a nice change from many shows that use bright hues, can contribute to the malaise I was feeling as I powered through each episode week after week. The animation is what you would expect from a low-tier studio: most average, but spotty. In terms of quality, it\'s pretty high end for Studio Deen, so I guess congrats on not making something that looks like complete pigshit for once?By the end of the season, watching Sakura Trick went from how I kicked off waking up at God-knows-what-hour on Friday mornings to go to college into a chore that I would hold off for several days, finished only out of obligation for coming so far. I really did want the novelty to never die. I really did want to like the characters and find them interesting, but as episode 12 was coming to a close, I had my epiphany: This show is boring as shit. begin to seem like a time filler.

Sakura Trick avoids the use of heavy dialogue and inner monologue as a means...of developing it's characters. Instead, the characters change subtly with the happenings of each episode, leaving space for interpretation on the part of the viewer as well as giving it a natural feel.For example, as Mitsuki says, Yuu is often not honest with her true feelings, this is something we see through her actions rather than words. I'll give a minor spoiler to illustrate this point.This trait can been seen from the very start when Yuu makes a phone call to Haruka. She 'checks on' Haruka and quickly hangs up as if just doing a routine check, but the fact that she was awake past midnight and that she called Haruka with nothing substantial to say gives away the excitement she's hiding, she's starting her life as a High School Student after all.The way the show dealt with dramatic scenes was another thing I liked. There is no reliance on contrived situations nor do they blow mundane problems out of proportion in Sakura Trick. Tense situations are resolved quickly and the characters avoid escalating the issue. Presenting drama this way feels much more natural.Some might see this as weak storytelling but I would argue in the opposite direction. Because of the show's episodic nature, there is a tendency to dismiss that each scene has significance beyond their respective episodes, but as I previously pointed out, the characters change subtly with each event, the feelings they experience at each point weighs on them and affects the way that they behave.It's easy to overgeneralize and dismiss the series as purely fan service. Fanservice is present, in terms of selective shots, but this does not distort the characters. Some dumb down the kissing to being a service for the viewers, completely overlooking the relationship between Yuu and Haruka and the emotions which drive each kiss.If you do plan to pick up this series, try to look at it from your own perspective. Look at the characters as real people rather than try to stereotype them. of developing it's characters.

There is a story with romance, BUT, the way it is executed is poorly most of the times. So again dont like yuri?! SKIP THIS!Now, I said it was a yuri fanservice, so what can you expect, if you do enjoy yuri like myself??Every episode is divided by 2 mini episodes, most of the times, each has a different kind of mini arc story going on.And for the most part, in each of...these mini episodes, you can expect some hot yuri scene, there is no mature content here. but the anime doesnt really need it to show its yuri colours, and if you enjoy those, you gonna love when those happen, be flustered even. Honestly some may think of it, like a hentai anime or something to satisfy your ""needs"", whatever yours are.But with time, I came to realize it was actually heartwarming for the most part.The animation is simply, yet enjoyable, and great on the yuri scenes and the sound fits the atmosphere, parts of the OP and ED were very catchy, thought most of the times I only heard the intros for each, then skipped the rest...Art 9 & Sound 8.So where did this yuri anime, which seems to have potential by what I wrote failed??Lets start with the characters, there is not much complexity to each, not really cliche, but still, while the MCs became more decent with time, everything just feels like, ""oh, it is another all school girls Slice of Life"". Most of the stuff are pretty silly, so the characters had potential to more, but failed to reach it, they stand to support the ""story"" and the yuri romantic scenes, and for the most part, while the cast is decent for a yuri anime... that is it.And where comes the big downer for the anime. The story!I m sure the anime follows faithfully the nature of the origin source, the manga. But by doing so, due to its nature of storytelling, there is almost no sense off progression overall! I dont hate episodic anime, but for a romantic story, it feels kinda lackluster, each episode has its story happening, that for most part seem not to be connected, with some exceptions like the last 2 episodes.I kinda enjoyed the first episode, and was expecting to get that feeling of progression, that makes you want to see the next episode, to continue the story!Generally what happened to me was, ""gotta progress on Sakura Trick, meh, there is no plot, besides Yuri that I dont feel in the mood for now, what is compelling me to go at it?? Then seeing it, cute yuri!! YESS!... It is over, lets see what is next on my list."" That kinda of thing, not memorable at all, a good story makes you want to keep reading it, keeps you wishing to see what will the plot next infold into.And so... it kills alot of the potential the anime could have, has a proper story, it really does. Okay, most yuri suck, but I have seen some with better stories than this one! And when well explored, the romantic yuri scenes, with proper drama, character and story development, those can became very addicting, a compelling and enjoyable experience, that will make all its yuri fanbase, experiencing lots and lots of doki doki moments!So, while the story had its moments, it was for the most part mediocre, which if viewed mostly for people that dont enjoy yuri, as trash.Story 5!With that left behind, I m a yuri lover after all, so while the story sucked, and probably one of the worst story developments I have seen in an anime yet in these recent years (lucky me, there are worst...), the yuri yuri doki doki scenes, the lighthearted aspect and Yuu and Haruka relationship that while nonsensical at parts, was enjoyable and cute to watch.... all in all, it shined for me at certain moments, and I kinda got surprise that there is lots of yuri every since the beggining, while at most yuri content, you gotta get over alot of progression to start seeing the good stuff. This one, says ""Like yuri yuri?? Here take it! Make sure you get your hunger for cute yuri filled, we will not mercilessly make you beat around the bush for longer, enjoy!"". Despite the faults, I did enjoyed the anime.Enjoyment 8Overall, it will came to be a very polarised experience, it firstly depends of the basis of you enjoying yuri romance, or not.And then even if you do enjoy, being honest, it could had been so much more.If only the main aspect, what supports the overall progression you will have with Sakura Trick, the story, didnt fell flat on its face, and the overall cast together had more complexity... I could only imagine, but it would be a really great interesting yuri for sure!I know it, probably is just the format of the manga, but has I have not yet read it, I dont know if it works there.If it did, that doesnt means it would surely work with the anime adaptation. So maybe they could had changed, and added more stuff to the adaptation?!An adaptation doesnt need to be 100% original to its story, IF what is changed/added is for an overall better experience with the adaptation versus the original work...I m glad yuri seems to be taking more prominience nowadays, but I hope others learn from Sakura\'s mistakes, and its virtues, and someday make story that fully fleshs out and explores the genre\'s potential. these mini episodes, you can expect some hot yuri scene, there is no mature content here. but the anime doesnt really need it to show its yuri colours, and if you enjoy those, you gonna love when those happen, be flustered even.

What comes to mind when ""Sakura Trick"" is uttered? Sakura, which is a flower with a lovely shade of bright pink, and trick, a fake-out of sorts, which may contain mischievous undertones. What was the inspiration for the name of this title? Every time I see this title, I can\'t help but feel like I\'m about to stumble upon a beautiful disaster, or a ""sakura-colored trick,"" if you will. Of course, the term ""trick"" can also be defined in other ways, but for the purpose of stating an argument, the previously stated...definition will be used.The ""trick"" in this case, would be the underlying messages that accompany Sakura Trick. On the surface, this title is about two girls who attend a school that is slated to be closed (though, this holds no importance), and decide one day, by complete chance, to kiss each other, in order to strengthen their relationship. Once this happens, their relationship becomes more than that of ordinary friends, as they cannot seem to get through an episode without kissing seven times.While the kissing between two teenage girls itself is the main factor of the show, it is also by far the worst problem this show has. Not in the kissing itself, but the way it is presented. Contrary to popular media, love is not a drug, and the act of kissing shouldn\'t be compared to that of taking cocaine. What Sakura Trick does so well is displaying a strange, relieving sense of tranquility while the kiss is going on. Feelings of anticipation, slight awkwardness, and a genuine amount of affection can be felt during (roughly) all of the kissing scenes, and not always necessarily between the two main characters. Despite this, it\'s both predictable and out of nowhere. When an opportunity arises where the two main characters can be alone, the audience knows they will take it, and the audience know they will kiss, regardless of whether or not the mood suits it. It starts to become the only reason this show has any airtime. This is where the ""trick"" comes into play.The two characters that kiss most often are Haruka and Yuu, and are assigned as the show\'s main protagonists. When these two characters are with each other, they act as though they\'re a couple, except they aren\'t. Though, when surrounded by friends, they show discretion, almost as if their kissing is a secret from everyone. Oh wait, it is. Something to note about the characters in this series is that they try to be funny. They try to make the audience laugh and feel good about any situation. Though this might cause the audience to not take anything seriously, there\'s a larger problem: the characters are dull. Try as they may, most of the jokes aren\'t that funny. When Sakura Trick decides to spend more time ""developing"" the relationship between Haruka and Yuu, they brush off other characters to do so, lest the secondary characters have a romantic relationship of their own (all characters are female, by the way). This leaves any screentime not dedicated to girls kissing much to be desired.The ""sakura"" within this trick comes through with the animation style. Upon watching this, I would\'ve bet my house that the animation studio responsible for Sakura Trick was Shaft. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out Studio Deen was responsible, as they seemed to dabble in Shaft\'s mannerisms within Sakura Trick. The art style and design of the entire show will at least keep an audience attentive. There are multiple examples of quick, transitional frames that showcase a character\'s personality well. Yuu\'s signature flower clip is shown prevalently throughout, and I could tell that the animators had fun stylizing the characters\' features to their whim. It helps an already dull cast of characters seem full of life and charm.While the animation is fun and the kissing scenes are nothing but passionate, Sakura Trick is conveniently named as a trick. The entire concept of the show and its emphasis on two girls kissing feels shallow altogether, and a lot like bait. Any redeeming factors this show has is muddled down by tryhard dialogue and bland characters. Only the final two episodes of Sakura Trick try to deal with the relationship of Haruka and Yuu in a mature manner, but by then, the damage has already been done.

This is a rare occasion that I\'ve watched a ""yuri"" genre series. But this series is a lot more than just that. Friendship, caring for one another, and being there for one another is what I got most out of this series. Sure it\'s nice to see cute girls kissing but this series does a great job of not focusing on that. The kisses are well placed so that the story itself is not interrupted. It\'s a great story! The art and music are fantastic, and the character development is superb. It\'s very cute, and also leaves you...wanting more! Overall, this series is quite unique, and is different. It was a nice change up. : D  I do wish there were more episodes for sure. wanting more! Overall, this series is quite unique, and is different.

Those animes are so unrealistic to the extent and it makes me grin in amusement. They exclude straight people right off the bat and fully focus only in the yuri part. Sakura Trick has a realistic touch that might happen to some of the people around their ages, or even older.The storyline is fairly good; the slice of life comes in and realistic in some ways. We see high school student’s daily lives and ups and downs can be seen in this anime,...then how they struggle to their upcoming exams. Not only hets can engage into relationships, but also two of the same sex. Why I said it was realistic? Out 10 people at least 2 or 3 are into homosexuals. Sakura Trick did that seeing Haruka and Yuu and Kotone and Shizuku are in the same sex relationship while the others were normal. We also know how Yuu's sister, Mitsuki, is against them dating.  They present that dating two women isn't as seen as normal unlike the other yuri animes out there. That is crossing out the realism in the anime that makes it uninteresting for me, as if the only obstacles in that anime is that a rival between two women and setting aside realism.Art I love how unique the animation of this anime. Similar to Shaft's but Shaft has a greater animation and far greater than Studio Deen. Well it did catch my attention at least. Seeing Studio Deen is mimicking Shaft methods when they animate their animes =='.Sound is fine I guess? Just average or below average for the opening and ending.Character is focused to Yuu and Haruka and a little of the other characters. We would love to see Kotone and Shizuku too, but neglected them for some reason; how disappointing. Haruka is assertive and Yuu is being so stubborn and not honest to her feelings. I love how Haruka's wild imagination kicks in and how Yuu's expectation exceeds.Enjoyment! Sure, the bouncing boobies and two little girls kissing haha. The moaning part damn why? That kills me! The jokes that really get through at least they try, better not having one.Overall 10/10! This anime is a gem! It's so hard to find a real pure yuri anime anywhere. Only Hentais have I think? I don't go for hentai that's just too much. This is not just implied, but it is certainly in action. That's why it's 10/10! then how they struggle to their upcoming exams. Not only hets can engage into relationships, but also two of the same sex. Why I said it was realistic? Out 10 people at least 2 or 3 are into homosexuals. Sakura Trick did that seeing Haruka and Yuu and Kotone and Shizuku are in the same sex relationship while the others were normal. We also know how Yuu's sister, Mitsuki, is against them dating.  They present that dating two women isn't as seen as normal unlike the other yuri animes out there. That is crossing out the realism in the anime that makes it uninteresting for me, as if the only obstacles in that anime is that a rival between two women and setting aside realism.Art I love how unique the animation of this anime. Similar to Shaft's but Shaft has a greater animation and far greater than Studio Deen. Well it did catch my attention at least. Seeing Studio Deen is mimicking Shaft methods when they animate their animes =='.Sound is fine I guess?

The manga it's based on was written and drawn by Tachi and the anime version was handled by Studio Deen. Studio Deen has done several yuri series/ series with heavy yuri content before. Including Maria sama ga Miteru, Yamibo and Simoun. So far, none of these series have been bad, although some have come closer than others. That being said, Studio Deen has done some pretty egregious anime in other genres. Such as Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Still, they do have a pretty good record so I'm cautiously optimistic...about this one.Story:Our story begins with a group of students entering their first year of High School. Haruka and Yuu, two girls who attended Middle School together, end up in the same class, but on opposite ends of the room. Haruka sees Yuu link arms with other girls and runs to an empty classroom, feeling dejected. Yuu follows to apologise, having known in advance that her actions would make Haruka jealous. The two have a conversation during which Haruka reveals that she thought they were special to each other. Yuu argues that they are and she will prove it by doing something with Haruka that she wouldn't do with anyone else. This leads to the two of them kissing rather passionately.This has, quite possibly, the fastest hook up I've ever seen in a romance series, with the two leads getting together right away. Most of the series involves them and their friends getting into shenanigans with the two of them trying to hide their relationship while sneaking kisses. In fact, I don't think there's a single episode without Haruka and Yuu kissing at some point. Sakura Trick is something of a rarity since the tension doesn't come from how the two leads will get together. Rather, it comes from two sources. The first being whether or not they'll get found out. The second being that Mitsuki, Yuu's older sister, also develops romantic feelings for Haruka. That's going to make family gatherings awkward. Honestly, I prefer this type of narrative to the more traditional one. If you're watching a romance, you know that the leads are almost certainly going to hook up eventually and it can just get annoying watching or reading a bunch of material that teases about it. At least this format dispenses with all that crap and just lets you enjoy the cute elements of their relationship while also providing some story threads for tension that basic pattern recognition doesn't instantly give you the conclusions for. So, the tension does work pretty effectively, even if most of the series is more dedicated to cutesy or comedic slice of life moments.There are a lot of comedic elements in this series and, as a whole, they're really well done. Just about every joke hits the mark and there aren't any that don't at the very least elicit a smile. The relationship between Haruka and Yuu is positively adorable. The series also manages to have a narrative that flows pretty smoothly in spite of the episodes being largely unconnected. There's a very clear chronology for the series.There's really only one problem with the narrative. Unfortunately, it's a pretty major one. There's a secondary romantic couple with two of Haruka and Yuu's friends, Kotone and Shizuku. The problem is that Kotone and Shizuku are cousins. In all fairness, they don't get a huge amount of screen time, but it's still really disturbing every time they get a scene. The worst part is that there doesn't seem to be any awareness that this is a bad idea. It's treated as “cute” within the series. Because when I think of cousins snogging, I think “oh, cute.” Oh, wait, I don't because it's not cute. It's just messed up. There's not even a good reason for them to be cousins. They could've been childhood friends and it would've made no difference to their story arc.Characters:The characters in this are really good, overall. Haruka and Yuu are adorable and have great interactions. The major side characters like Mitsuki, Kaede and Yuzu are a lot of fun. Even Kotone and Shizuku have some good character moments if you can ignore their disturbing relationship. Now, the side characters tend to be pretty much non-entities, the teacher, Rina, Sumi and several others. They don't exactly feel like one-dimensional stereotypes, but they come pretty close. Although, to be fair, they do have a purpose within the story even if it is a very small one and it would be highly unreasonable to expect every minor character in a twelve episode series to get developed. Furthermore, they do serve their functions just fine.Art:The art in this is kind of lazy. The character designs themselves are nice and there are some good sequences, particularly the way they animate the ending. However, the backgrounds are pretty bare and people who show up in the background are frequently drawn without any features. They're just kind of blank. The artists also dispense with any kind of detail for the backgrounds on several occasions, replacing them with colourful heart patterns or some such thing.The worst factor in the artwork is the fan-service. There are a few scenes where they use it for the sake of a joke, but more often they just have random fan-service scenes or oddly angled shots for the sake of fan-service. Did they really think they needed to play up to the heterosexual male gaze in a series where girls frequently kiss each other? All the fan-service ultimately does is detract from the cutesy elements.Sound:There are some really good actresses in this. Our leads are played by Iguchi Yuka, who was also Mako in Girls und Panzer, and Tomatsu Haruka, who played Anjou in AnoHana. They both do a really superb job and really convey the chemistry between Yuu and Haruka perfectly. They also got Fujita Saki, Ymir in Shingeki no Kyojin, and Fuchigami Mai, who was Miho in Girls und Panzer as well as Alice in Doki Doki Precure. All the actresses do really well in their roles. The music is really good too, helping accentuate the mood.Ho-Yay:The ho-yay factor is going to be a 10/10. I know, the fact that this is a yuri romance probably clued you in. Haruka and Yuu have a really good relationship and it does develop and strengthen throughout the series.  We also get the kissing cousins, who I really don't want to discuss in any detail. Mitsuki's feelings for Haruka are also really well handled and lead to some good moments, both dramatic and comedic. Rina is also heavily implied to have feelings for Mitsuki, one of the only traits she has. Yuzu and Kaede have a really close relationship that could have pretty easily moved into romantic territory, but never does.Why no, I don't find anything odd about there being no straight characters in the main cast. And no, I'm not just saying that because straight characters are rare in my own writing. Hurriedly changing the topic, Sakura Trick has a lot of affectionate scenes. As previously stated, pretty much every episode has a kiss at some point and there's also some hand holding, cuddling up and the like, but the series never moves into explicit sexual territory. It prefers to keep things cutesy. Which is  a good thing given that the characters are pretty young and cutesy material is far better suited for the atmosphere as a whole.Final Thoughts:Sakura Trick is a pretty good romance. Yuu and Haruka make for an adorable couple, the comedy is effective and the sources of tension are really good. Still, the series is hurt by the secondary relationship between Kotone and Shizuku and the use of pandering fan-service. If you can forgive those problems, you will probably enjoy the series for its cute and funny moments as well as the romance between the two leads.  My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week I'll take a look at Kill La Kill. about this one.Story:Our story begins with a group of students entering their first year of High School.

Next week I'll take a look at Kill La Kill."", '~A personal journey into the world of forbidden love, buried under a pink veil~On the surface, Sakura Trick doesn\'t seem like the kind of anime to have many unique or redeeming elements. Its vibrant, predominately pink colour scheme and slice of life presentation will impress nobody from a glance. With the further belittlement of the Shoujo and Yuri tag associations, its no wonder that few come to appreciate Sakura\'s delicacy.A lot of Sakura\'s strength is in its simplicity. It is an uplifting representation of Shoujo, that ironically plays no tricks. Its straightforward almost to a protesting, influential extent, and it exposes the genre from a...multitude of viewpoints...From the predictable Yuri-like intimacies, to the more heartfelt emotional friction between the characters - it may take a few episodes, but one can quite easily begin to appreciate the show\'s vivid, heart-warming, and surprisingly innocent nature.Sakura goes on to quite vividly document through everyday life, the highs, lows, struggles and battles no matter how small-scale, from the perspectives of many; as the prominent relationship between the main characters evolves. Due to the (from a critical perspective) self-limiting simplicity of the show, it has to pay close attention to its detail - and this is exactly what it does to counter its endlessly rehashed premise.The show is inescapably charming, cute, upbeat, very personal, very intimate, dramatic at times, but primarily... delicate (despite first impressions). Throughout, Sakura continuously flicks between casual slice of life-like presentation, with its fair share of comedy;  and romantic, more cinematic, serious, and emotionally-driven presentation. This variety adds to its realism and therefore immersion. It allows for the development of a distance between these stances, establishing more contrast, and giving the viewer a ""behind the scenes"" type feeling, an appreciation of the show\'s personal and intimate nature.In terms of presentation, the Art and Sound are flawless, and so despite the often associated one-dimensional nature of Shoujo shows, Sakura appears to know exactly what it is, and plays this mixture of controversy and deeper meaning into the content itself. I definitely was able to engage with the show, as i particularly liked the representation of the intimate awkwardness, and the forbidden, two-vs-society perspective.That being said though, i won\'t deny that Sakura has minimal ""must keep watching"" factors, as the individual character development, alongside the story, is very simplistic. It only has power if you permit it to, and so a show where you are in control of your own engagement, is likely to bore those looking for a more dramatic romance. It\'s genuinely difficult to rate the show, as a lot can be read into it. If you\'re an interested SoL and/or Shoujo and/or Yuri fan, it\'s subjective, but give credit where its due, and you\'ll realize the beauty of this deceivingly cloudy-looking gem. multitude of viewpoints...From the predictable Yuri-like intimacies, to the more heartfelt emotional friction between the characters - it may take a few episodes, but one can quite easily begin to appreciate the show\'s vivid, heart-warming, and surprisingly innocent nature.Sakura goes on to quite vividly document through everyday life, the highs, lows, struggles and battles no matter how small-scale, from the perspectives of many; as the prominent relationship between the main characters evolves.

I wanted to give it a watch but I gave up on this show very easily. It just isn\'t for me.Story 4/10Since I only watched 2 episodes, this might not be an accurate score for the story. You have 2 girls (best friends?) entering high school and this high school is closing down in 3 years. In order to remember their high school experience, these 2 girls shared a kiss (a long kiss). That\'s all i\'ve seen so far and I\'m not watching anymore episodes.Art 5/10The Animation is decent but not great......Sound 3/10I haven\'t heard any soundtrack in this show that gave me goosebumps or even a thought of ""man, this soundtrack is great"".

Since I don\'t know these characters very well, I\'m not going to review them.Enjoyment 2/10I don\'t know how I made it past Episode 1 but I did not enjoy this show at all.

I am not a guy who is good at writing reviews or generally writes a lot. Maybe no one will ever see my review about Sakura Trick, but my intention is not to compare my review with the one\'s from other users. I have already seen some very good reviews about Sakura Trick and...they have written a lot about it.So why will my frist review on MAL about Sakura Trick?First of all I usually only watch animes with MOE, CGDCT. My favorite genres are comedy and slice of life. I don\'t really like those classic action animes which everybody have watched. It\'s not like they are bad or something, instead the have a good reason to have 9+ score and everybody likes them. It\'s just my personal perference to watch animes with cute girls in it and everybody enjoying there and having fun.So how does Sakura Trick is different from the other Shoujo Ai animes? From all MOE animes Sakura Trick is definitely my most favorite one. First of all, I enjoy yuri a lot and in my opinion kissing is an important part of it (also in real life). Right in the OP there is directly a kissing scene and you just want to watch more yuri romance. You want to learn more about the characters and their development.Every character here is very cute and adorable, I really love them and they just enjoy their life with another girl. Even if they have problems, they try to solve it together.The sytle of thies anime is also great. I mean it was from 2014 and it still could be one from nowadays if you compare the styles of it.As you can see I am not really good at putting my minds into words but I feel like I have to write a review here because I really love Sakura Trick. It\'s sad that there won\'t be a second season because the sales were not that great. If you want to know what happens after the anime, you should definitely read the manga, it\'s also very enjoyable!(Haruka x Yuu 4ever!) they have written a lot about it.So why will my frist review on MAL about Sakura Trick?First of all I usually only watch animes with MOE, CGDCT.

The school becomes the story regularly takes place. It\'s a lively show, the main heroines are Haruka Takayama and Sonoda Yuu who\'s currently a classmate and be a damn-too-good friend since Junior HS. Basically we can\'t ignore the present of other heroines that look really like main characters too, Shizuku Minami, Kotone Noda, Kaede Ikeno, and Yuzu Iizuka. While Yuu and Haruka (main heroines) are so lovey-dovey with each other, almost neglecting other presents, the others are steamed-up and funny. The fusion of slice-of-life, school life, yuri, and comedy...genres in Sakura Trick (  •ಲ•)If you expect that majority of slice-of-life and school life anime stays between the line of average for graphics, well I do so. But it\'s different with Sakura Trick, from my sight, Sakura Trick stands in the minority of the thoughts, where the visuals really please your eyes. I appreciate the details, colours, and movements here. The colours are soft but placed appropriately, like the rise of shadows, dark colours to bring cloudy aura. For the details and movements are not superb but it is above average for daily life anime genre.

But it\'s different with Sakura Trick, from my sight, Sakura Trick stands in the minority of the thoughts, where the visuals really please your eyes. I appreciate the details, colours, and movements here. The colours are soft but placed appropriately, like the rise of shadows, dark colours to bring cloudy aura. For the details and movements are not superb but it is above average for daily life anime genre.

The characters were all quirky and unique, and I enjoyed each of them in their own ways. (except maybe Kotone and Shizuku)  The jokes were nearly always funny, and the show did not overdo the yuri fanservice, and instead gave us genuine character interactions which made us love each of them more.  This is easily my favorite Studio Deen work, and at this point, my favorite show of the winter season. ', ""To be perfectly honest i don't understand the mediocre reviews on this. At the time of writing this has a 7.17 when i feel this should have around an 8-9.This is honestly a good and funny show to watch. The group of friends we see are all fun and interesting in there own way and they all have someone that they fit really well with. But this right here could be seen as a problem. There are duo's that should be couples together but some aren't while the others are. I guess what i'm trying to say is that some are never in an official...relationship while 1 or 2 feel like they should.HarukaxYuuKaedexYuzuKotonexShizukuYuukaXRinaThese are the group of people that best go together but duo's such as Kaede and Yuzu are kind of teased as being a couple while Yuuka and Rina seem to be perfect for each other ( I think Rina has a Crush on Yuuka) But we are subject to Yuuka having a crush on someone else and it just doesn't really fit. This is the really own big issue i can think that is worth mentioning.The comedy is good especially how Haruka can be so oblivious to certain things.The art itself is really good and better than i would have expected from such a story.All in all i feel this is i nice little gem that i never hear talked about. Nothing really bad with it. Just a nice and funny comedic love show to sit back and watch whenever. relationship while 1 or 2 feel like they should.HarukaxYuuKaedexYuzuKotonexShizukuYuukaXRinaThese are the group of people that best go together but duo's such as Kaede and Yuzu are kind of teased as being a couple while Yuuka and Rina seem to be perfect for each other ( I think Rina has a Crush on Yuuka) But we are subject to Yuuka having a crush on someone else and it just doesn't really fit.

Is a must watch and is in every yuri bible book. This is the holy grail of yuri. A show that has the first episode with two girls kissing. Yep, that's right, no final episode for that final kiss is there from the get go. This is Sakura TrickSo story wise, it can be sum up by the op, two girls kissing. Yeah at first glance there not much to this. It just follows two friends who start kissing each other and are perfect for each other. Their biggest problem is...that they are both air heads who are embarrassed by their love to each other. Is honestly quite cute and adorable and just fill my heart with way too much sugar that I can't believe my heart did not explode from watching this show twice. That being said there much more subverting going on here. For one the two girls kissing each other in the first episode instead of having it build up. Second is the fact that they are both airheads, which is something new and makes for a lot of good comedy.  The third is that the show seems to have lots of couple in this story in different phases. With one starting to date, the other already dating, one character discovering her sexuality and an other two friend potentially blooming. In many ways, the girl discovering her sexuality is your typical yuri main character being somewhat the side character which was neat. That being said only the two main lead and her sister get the main focus which is a disappointment as it would have been great to see more from the other characters stories. While I do like the main couple Haruka and Yuu (my favorite couple in fiction), they could have had one less episode dedicated to them. That being said episode 8 was truly heartwarming.Also to note the romance and the comedy is done great, but yeah there could have been more done with the message. The fact that the main focus is two person being embarrassed by their feeling might put off people who don't want just fluff. Which while I don't blame those people, the chemistry is just so strong and the drama with the sister is very interesting.Art and sound: The animation is great, is Sentai who usually do a competent job. Nothing amazing, but good enough to accommodate the jokes and help the heartwarming moment.Characters: Yuu and Haruka are amazing. My favorite couple ever. Never seen two airheads dating each other that much and this just work wonderful with Yuu being the childish brat idiot, while Haruka is the overjealous idiot. Is surprisingly work. Granted if you don't like their character you are somewhat out of luck as aside from Yuu sister, the other character have way less screen time. That not to say the other characters don't get screen time, but they could have definitely had more screen time. They are still a bunch of fun and add to the comedy and serve somewhat a reflection on Yuu and Haruka relationship, but I wish they could have been focus more. I mean Kotone and Shizuka relationship is your typical rich girl and best friend scenario with all the cliche minus the tsundere surprisingly enough. That being said they definitely had more substance and drama in their relationship that could have been worth looking into more. That being said they are still great when they are on screen just like the rest. When my biggest complaint with characters is I get to see less from other characters while still loving the main lead that get too much screen time, you must be doing something right.So overall this messy reviewer will said that Sakura Trick is definitely a must watch Yuri (shoujo ai whatever) anime. that they are both air heads who are embarrassed by their love to each other.

I was greeted with something that I believe could almost be a kid show in my opinion. Homosexuality is a very touchy subject and not everyone agree's with it in one way or another. But Sakura Trick did something with it...that made it seem like it could be watched by basically anyone (Without Homophobia,of course). Yes, the show has two girls just starting High school kissing each other... a lot and not with reason you might expect from a yuri anime. The anime itself when watching it seemed to not take it self very seriously and it had a certain ease to it without going overboard. The art style is different, in a good way it goes out of it's way to make sure you know who the main character's are and who's important. The music could be better and not very remember-able in my opinion. Character design is nothing short of typical student character's that are represented with human flaw's and quirks. Overall I truly believe if your looking for something a bit different from the average normal slice of life/school related anime give this one a try because it has a great story with a bit of twist all being around one particular thing. that made it seem like it could be watched by basically anyone (Without Homophobia,of course).

It was the first Shoujo-Ai anime i have watched since i finished Aoi Hana, and no, it\'s not implied Shoujo-Ai nor did it just give Shoujo-Ai undertones, it was 100% Shoujo-Ai all the way.Art - 8: I gave it an 8 because i rarely care about the art, as long as it was watchable i\'m fine with it. Visual were okay, though the anime\'s...fluidity wasn\'t that good, not mediocre, mind you.Sound - 7: To be honest, the OP was cute, it had me singing along some times, but the BGM was very forgettable.Character- 8Haruka - ""The Air-head Main Character"" - she starts off as your typical airhead, big-boobed high school girl, she\'s pretty possessive. I like how she always keeps Yuu all to herself.Yuu- ""The Main Character\'s Love Interest"" - the ""moe"" character, and a tsundere, i hate tsunderes but, i was okay with Yuu, there were lots of times that i felt sorry Haruka for putting up with Yuu.Shizuku - ""The Other Moe Character"" - just like Yuu she\'s in a secret relationship with Kotone and they both dislike it... sometimes.Kotone- ""The Ojou-sama Character"" - she had this Ojou-sama aura the first time i saw her, and i was right. Like Haruka, she\'s pretty and has a nice body and is in a secret relationship with Shizuku.Yuzu - ""The Energetic Boke"" - energetic, at first i thought she\'d hit it up with Kaede, but they\'re both straight, so no.Kaede - ""The Sadistic Tsukkomi"" - ahhh, i was surprised by Kaede\'s character development, she was a normal girl at the start, but she changed throughout the series. She\'s probably the only one who had character development.Others:Mitsuki - ""Ms. Perfect Seitokaichou"" - i was actually surprised at this character, who\'d knew she\'d have a ""competition"" with her little sister, Yuu.Sumisumi - to be honest, i don\'t have a classification for her, she came out pretty late in the series but, she\'s like Yuzu; ""An energetic boke.""Rina - ""The Secretary"" - hmmm... how should i describe her? Rina\'s pretty much your ordinary girl, she doesn\'t have any unique characteristics.Enjoyment - 8: Whenever they Kiss, i squeal, that\'s how much i enjoyed it.But some jokes, fall of the mark, but hey, not all jokes hit, and sometimes the missed jokes are the most funny ones.Overall- 8: This anime shares the generic Boke-Tsukkomi-Air-head-Ojou-sama/Ms.Perfect-Moe that every Slice of Life/all-girl anime, but what makes it different? It\'s straight up Shoujo-Ai, no one needs to wear Yuri Goggles to make Yuri couples here. fluidity wasn\'t that good, not mediocre, mind you.Sound - 7: To be honest, the OP was cute, it had me singing along some times, but the BGM was very forgettable.Character- 8Haruka - ""The Air-head Main Character"" - she starts off as your typical airhead, big-boobed high school girl, she\'s pretty possessive.

It succeeds spectacularly.That this is a genuine love story, not porn, the writing makes clear; no character is obviously written to be the object of voyeuristic sexual desire. Instead this show demands the viewer to empathize directly with the girls and take an active role in their relationship. Despite its almost lecherous depiction of physical intimacy (which is far and away the highlight and major appeal of the show), Sakura Trick...is tender purely. High-stakes, adult soap drama should be sought elsewhere.With that said: who on the production team thought the constant, pointless fanservice was a good idea? It seems like they didn't realize what they were working with. Though it wanes in later episodes, the camera often seems to lock between the tropics of boob and crotch, and when it strays it's usually to pan across the character's body from the feet up. Nobody asked for this. A show that desperately wants to break free from the ecchi trappings of its forebears is given no such privilege. Oh well.Sakura Trick also suffers occasionally from poor production quality; characters go off-model, faces turn out weird and subtly wall-eyed, the animation and style is forgettable. And so on. But generally, with a show like this, one would get burned too often if they expected any better.Ultimately Sakura Trick is, by way of poor direction, dangling between a rock and a hard place and another more desirable thing to be stuck between: is it ecchi? Is it mindless slice comedy? Or is it a touching, subversive story about forbidden love shared between two flawed but compelling characters? When it is this third thing, Sakura Trick soars. That just doesn't happen enough. is tender purely.

I personally enjoy yuri to a very great extent which was one of the saving graces of this anime. I truly believe this anime was just all about how many kiss scenes and how many yuri love doki doki moments they could have. And honestly, I'm fine with that, it's just that you can never take an anime seriously like that and that's also fine. But just don't expect some amazing story and plot development, just expect a LOT, of beautiful yuri moments. And trust me, you will be so happy ;) "", ""*Sub Anime Review*--Story--Sakura Trick is a very light hearted yuri anime about two teen girls-Yu and Haruka- who want to stay friends throughout school, so they decide to kiss, something other girls wouldn't do. And they kiss again, and again.. I really enjoyed the plot, it was pretty different from other Yuri I've seen. One thing that made this anime stand out was that it tackled some actual relationship issues that happen with gay couples, such as not being able to show too much affection in public and people disapproving. Although it represented real-world issues, it was very light hearted and sweet. Definitely recommend for...a weekend watch.--Art--The art was amazing, it perfectly fit the light hearted tone of Sakura Trick. It was beautiful.--Sound--The voice actors fit their characters very well. I especially loved Yu's voice, it fit her pouty self. The opening song and ending songs were pretty good, but they did contain a lot of fanservice, which isn't really my thing (..at least not in this anime).--Character (Protagonist)--~Takayama Haruka~Haruka was adorable. Although she gets frustrated easily and is a bit insecure, she tries to treat Yu and her friends well.~Sonoda Yu~Yu is bossy, childish, stubborn and pouty, which matched her appearance. Although she is childish, she holds more common sense than Haruka.--Character (Antagonist)--==Does not apply to this series==I really enjoyed this anime, and I'm considering reading the manga.

This is my slop!!! Yuri couples are GOATED!!! IDC!!!! Plus, there is some quality to this series, and no, I don't mean the endless kissing!!!The romantic relationships between these characters were passable for an Ecchi show, and a lot of anime tend to beat around the bush or have it heavily implied when it comes to said relationships. That can be charming, but it can also get old!!! Sakura Trick gets right to the point and lets the main characters actually love each other!!! I can't say the same for others, like Death Note's Light and L. Such...a tease!!! a tease!!!"", 'This is a really good yuri anime.The story i will give 10 because it is kind of predictable still yet kind of cute and interesting in its own way. The art and sound i will give 10 for it. There is no annoying voice actor making super weird sounds or very cringy sound imo. However , enjoyment i will give only 8. This is because the last episode is just so weird and cringy that i cringe so badly that i minus 1 mark from 10 and another point is that they end it without giving me what i want to see , ( a...yuri pair haven\'t develop). For character development , there is no much development in it just that the couple gets closer and we were able to witness more kissing scenes which is really great fan service. So i will give 9 for it. There isn\'t much yuri animes out there that really seems to be interesting and cute as sakura trick.

Lets go. Straight up, no bull. I'm going to be completely honest. I probably rated this stuff higher than it deserves, but so will you.If you're into this stuff, it's the pinnacle. The number one.

Dogs boll*cks.It's cute girls doing gay stuff, in adorable ways, with funny subplot in-between.The animation is well done where it matters (eg; only where you'd care for it to be. Background characters are rarely, if ever, drawn in any more than silhouettes with very basic features, and rarely even colourized.) And you know what, that's perfectly fine.

A passionate kiss. That's something you usually get as a payoff of a romance story, right? Some kind of lovey-dovey epilogue might follow, but the story is about the road to love and all those intense, romantic scenes are its proper conclusion. That's standard.Sakura Trick is not that, as clearly shown even by its opening. This series is pretty much all about teenage girls kissing and being awkwardly-romantic with each other. And even more kissing. Lots and lots of kissing. In various, not always justifiable situations. It features three couples, with one being pretty openly at it from the very beginning and...the other two blooming along the way, but without any deeper drama or doubt on what they are about. It's all very straightforward and fairly silly, just in the way you would expect this kind of purely-comedic show to be.How about the execution? Well, the show is fairly pretty, often taking some minor shortcuts with animation and environment, but always solid with its main characters and when portraying more significant scenes (ex. kissing is always very detailed and colourful - the team behind Sakura Trick knew its priorities). The voices and op/end music are also fine. My main gripe is actually with the writing, which is serviceable, but never really great. Even this kind of fanservice'y show can be genuinely funny and witty, or even include some bits of believable romance. Here the jokes only ever got me smiling a bit, story didn't really go anywhere and the characters never even came close to Yuru Yuri levels of being memorable. While genuinely fun to watch, the whole experience felt pretty hollow.So, is it worth your time? Your enjoyment will depend mostly on whether you like yuri and the kind of mild fanservice this show offers - while it has the main couple making out pretty much every episode, it actually rarely goes overboard with nudity or creepy shots you would know from other ecchi anime. I honestly thought that the kissing scenes will grow old pretty fast... But for me, they didn't. There's just this kind of cuteness and gentle sexiness in this brand of yuri fiction that always gets me, no matter how much of it I happen to see. Still, there's really very little substance to this show, even in comparison to many other episodic comedy anime I've seen.If you're like me, starved for all kinds of yuri content, you should definitely watch it. If not... You won't lose that much by skipping it. the other two blooming along the way, but without any deeper drama or doubt on what they are about.

Onward then to my review.Who would think to actually encounter a 1/10 show? Think about, how bad does something have to be, to have it rated the lowest you can? After watching this show I can tell without a doubt; this is the bottom of the pit.You look around in the threatening darkness of this unknown chasm you fell into. Weak sunlight pierces this abyss, you see the frames of motionless bodies laying around you. These rotting corpses you knew from before. You tried forget, sure, but they etched themselves...in the back of your mind. Unending recycling of tropes, merciless sexualization, deprived of all story and meaning. You know the list of such shows.To be fair, at one point the majority of the popular anime shows reach into this same old trick hat too. But there\'s a difference between what you can consider \'borrowing ideas\' and between not having a single unique, defining element in your show. If I had to summarise my problem with this show I think I would say:""The problem with Sakura Trick is that it believes without second guessing that it came up with lesbians""It is legitimately a \'trick\'. It\'s a trick on you. To make you believe it will attempt to turn this around. It will become a good show eventually. Keep watching. It will change. You want to believe it. It\'s the family alcoholic in this unending downward spiral. But you already know how that ends. Not the way you wanted it to.This show is a combination of these tropes that are like caffeine and nicotine. Refreshing in small doses, lethal in large ones.

It\'s like you order a coke and they bring you the syrup it was made of instead. You want romance?

This is how far you can take sexual innuendo in anime without becoming hentai. But interestingly enough, it\'s not at the ecchi level either. It\'s this thing, that\'s just awkward sufficiently enough so that you keep looking behind your shoulder when you are watching it, even though it\'s not particularly explicit visually. It\'s that feeling of guilt that you get watching it. Do I like this? What\'s wrong with me? Why am I watching this? It leaves you in an existential crisis after an episode.Sakura Trick is like locking yourself in a cage with two male, underfed Bengal tigers, who had been exposed to female tiger hormones for weeks and then throwing away the keys.

I write this review only having watched 3 episodes, because I don\'t intent watching any more of it. I wouldn\'t called the show bad, but I just don\'t like it.When I read the synopsis, I expected a (romantic) story. Oh boy was I deceived.""The story revolves around Haruka and Yuu, two girls who go to a high school that is slated to be shut down in three years. To share something special between them, they share a kiss, and their relationship deepens from that moment onward.""(spoilers...from episode one are present)The first sentence is correct, but that\'s not the part that caught my attention/interest. It\'s the second sentence that\'s deceiving. The sentence doesn\'t connect to the previous except for having the same people in it. But the main offender is that there\'s no context. It doesn\'t tell you they share something special because Haruka is possessive and jealous of other girls hanging around her friend. It was to declare their FRIENDSHIP.Then it says they share a kiss. This isn\'t wrong, it\'s actually quite correct. However it doesn\'t tell you why they kiss. They could have shared a diary, a cat, a bag, a secret (well it turns out this is a secret, but whatever), or any other kind of experience. But they didn\'t, because a kiss apperently was the best option. And that\'s quite fine, you know, if you\'re attracted to your friend and you want to deepen your friendship, I could imagine you would kiss her (I\'m not against shoujo-ai so why not?). However this kiss didn\'t have any romantic significance. It was just a kiss because the FRIENDS couldn\'t find anything better.The last part of the second sentence states that their relationship deepens from that moment on. Strange as it may be, it made me assume they were going to bond more due to the kiss. I mean it\'s in the same sentence right? Well since I only got to episode 3, I can\'t tell you their relationship didn\'t deepen. It also doesn\'t say how much/fast it deepens so they got me there!Now as for the story after 3 episodes there\'s pretty much no progress. Which isn\'t a problem if it\'s something Like Yuru Yuri, because Yuru Yuri doesn\'t advertise a story and is supposed to be FUNNY and delivers. In Sakura Trick however their relationship deepens from friends who kissed once, to friends who kiss more frequent. I mean it\'s probably only been a month or 2 so why move faster right?Art: OK, huge boobs, why? I don\'t know. Girls are animated really girly sometimes, I don\'t know if any girls would actually ""run"" like that. And atleast Haruka has knock-knee. But I can live with that.Sound? Can\'t remember. It wasn\'t memorable in either a good or bad way.Characters.... Ok so the characters are unique and there\'s 6 of them. And that\'s pretty much how far the good part of this section goes. Since I can\'t really say too much about the 4 supporting characters except that they weren\'t horrible that leaves me to the rest. Yuu\'s sister was also not horrible. By the way they\'re NOT in an all girls school, there are boys walking around. They just don\'t actively take a part in this anime in the first 3 episodes. And apperently 4 out of the 6 girls rather kiss females than even talk about boys. Actually the amount of focus a boy gets in Non Non Biyori is even higher (he doesn\'t get lines, but atleast he get\'s acknowledgement of being there.So Yuu and Haruka... Yuu at first reminded me of Hotaru from Non Non Biyori, whom I like. But the thing is Hotaru is 10-11 and has genuine feelings for her ""crush"". Haruka just wants to kiss. Hotaru is acting more like something her age than Haruka is. Which leaves us a childish or underdeveloped Haruka. Yuu to me feels like the standard male harem MC. Little to no redeeming qualities, bad at studying good at sports.Then I want to disect this anime a bit. It has:1 Lesbianism2 Kissing3 Hiding the kissing as a secret4 Comedy5 Drama (I know I haven\'t mentioned it thus far, but it\'s there.)If you would take 1 away, the series would fall apart. If you take 2 away or reduce the frequency, the series would fall apart. If you would take 4 away the series would still stand (I never really liked the comedy all that much). ""We got to jump! Drag me along with you as you jump!"" *shorter girl grabs taller girl\'s breasts instead of her waist*.The drama I\'ve seen wasn\'t bad, but it would be nicer if kissing wasn\'t the answer to everything.So did I enjoy it? Not really. Is it bad? Well actually I would say yes. Does it mean you\'ll think it\'s bad? Not necessarily. If you like to see girls kissing no matter how frequent this is the show for you!Oh final note: some people say it\'s a hidden gem.

I agree, there\'s room for more shoujo-ai, more and better especially better.', 'Sakura Trick: The reason we need more Yuri.Sakura trick is a fan-service Yuri-light anime that focuses on the developing relationship between two girls, Haruka and Yu. Over the course of the series, the girls make the decision to make their relationship special and apart from that of their new friends by sealing it with a kiss.This of course, leads to petting, lots of kissing, and some suspicion from Yu\'s older sister as to the nature of their relationship.Story.The good and bad thing about this show is that there is only very light story over-reach. This means each episode has the girls dealing with...an outside factor in a lesbian relationship without any lesbian role-models. The downside is that some episodes feel really flat, and very one-shot in theme and design.While the Yuri feels only slightly exist, and the story makes you feel generally happy for the two girls, there are parts of the anime that fall short, because no other relationships are really explored very thoroughly.The story basically sums up as: ""Girls who are lesbians kiss a lot. Also have Lesbian pals.""Art.The art is a mixed bag. The character designs are pretty basic. A couple supports break away from the mold, as does Haruka, being taller and less glamorous than is typical, but I\'ve seen about 20 Yu carbon copies in my limited anime experience.Worse, there are times when the animation gets still frame, and all you do is slide up the sketch of the girls knee -> thigh -> skirt -> boobs, as if this were an anime dating game.The fan service is non-stop, and was overall a detraction.Sound.The sound was fine, the songs okay, the VA was decent, the main problem is too much dialogue devolved into high pitched ""anime girl whines"", that sounded more like a horde of cats singing than a girl being embarrassed.Characters.This is where I was disappointed. Haruka was a good character. She had insecurities, jealousy, and a number of okay points, but the rest of the crew  were just flat. You knew about 20 seconds of exposition dialogue about each, and that was it.Enjoyment.Okay. So like I said earlier, this is why we need more Yuri. Whether it\'s a dedicated series, yuri characters, or whatever, the fact that there is so little of it is why Sakura Trick gets gobbled up and seen by Yurifans.It\'s a weak offering, but without many competitors, it\'s used as a ""Yuri Classic"" example. If ST had stronger characters, real conflict, and a more engaging story that tried to talk about the struggles of young lesbians without models to base their relationships on, it would have been amazing. Instead, we get a fan-service fest that goes out of it\'s way to lock two young girls in rooms alone as possible so they can suck face and be bashful it.It\'s things like ST that keep the genre from being taken seriously. Anyone who decides to dip into the Yuri world and sees this is going to assume all yuri-ai is nothing but moe-fests with whimpering teenagers who are drawn as pedo-bait protagonists with mush for brains.**semi spoiler**The worst part was at the end, when it\'s all said and done, and a scene happens where the characters who have talked about how they are special to each other all series long suddenly come to the epiphany that they have no idea what love is and they\'d rather not talk about it, because they are special friends, not girlfriends.Really?Overall.I grudgingly give a 6. There were enough moments to make me smile, but end the end, all I could think was ""This.. this could have been so much more.""Pros and Cons+ Real Yuri.

This is a show about cute girls being hilariously and adorably gay.  Boobs will bounce.  Tongues will wrestle.  Fingers will intertwine.  And if you’re the kind of person who likes cute, fluffy Yuri shows, you won’t be disappointed.There’s a nice balance of romance and comedy that keeps the show from getting too sappy or too wacky and obnoxious.  One of my favorite scenes comes in the first episode, where the main characters, Haruka and Yuu kiss for the first...time.  The lighting gets appropriately pastel and sparkly, and both characters start giving sweet internal monologues.  They keep kissing, and the monologues keep rolling, both getting more and more aroused until they hold the kiss so long, that they forget to stop and take a breath, and they both pass out.  It’s over-the-top and wacky, but in a very sweet, goofy and endearing way that makes it clear that the two really care about each other, and that they’re also very inexperienced.  It’s a gag that not only takes the edge off the cheesy sentimentality of the scene, but also neatly captures the nature of Haruka and Yuu’s relationship.  Neither of them actually knows what a romantic relationship is supposed to be like, and they hit plenty of stumbling blocks along the way, but the show ends every episode on a nice make-out session that reaffirms their feelings for each other.While the characters certainly aren’t the deepest I’ve ever encountered, Haruka and Yuu have a nice dynamic.  Yuu’s childish whimsy and frequent pettiness have a way playing off Haruka’s possessiveness and overly sentimental nature, frequently driving Haruka to feel jealous or otherwise distraught.  At the same time, Yuu has moments of vulnerability and caring that keep the relationship from becoming too one-sided.A lot of screen-time is devoted to Haruka, Yuu and their friends screwing around and being cute, but there are much appreciated moments of tension.  In addition to the general relationship turmoil between Haruka and Yuu, there is also Yuu’s older sister Mitsuki, who frequently serves as the series’ antagonist, insisting on protecting Yuu from Haruka’s advances.  While the Hyper-Protective Family Member trope has been done to death in romance, Sakura Trick plays with the cliché by having Mitsuki develop—and furiously deny—feelings for Haruka.  Mitsuki gradually morphs from being an authority figure attempting to stand between Haruka and Yuu to a love rival to her own sister, but she remains a source of tension whether she is lurking around spying on Haruka and Yuu, or preparing her confession.While there’s plenty of fan-service, it never really gets in the way of emotional development, and feels like the natural result of the characters feelings for each other rather than something forced in.  Haruka and Yuu make-out a lot, and Yuu comments on Haruka’s big boobs more than once, but that’s what girlfriends do.  It only makes sense.I particularly loved a bit of fan-service delivered in an after-episode bonus.  A secondary character is taking a bath, and the camera is making the expected zoom-ins on her body, when abruptly, she looks over her shoulder into the camera, smirks, and says, “Fan-service Scene”.  At first this seems like she’s just randomly breaking the forth wall for giggles, but there’s a deeper meaning to her awareness.  This isn’t the typical voyeuristic camera-angles that Harem series so often employ.  There’s an aspect of consent here that a lot of fan-service misses; the girl knows  full well that the audience is checking her out, and she’s perfectly fine with that!  So many Ecchi series rely on accidental groping, walking in on distraught girls naked and ogling camera-work, it’s refreshing to see an affirmation of consent accompanying an erotic moment.  I wish more shows had this kind of awareness.The Negative Side: There’s a part of me that’s tempted to give this series a 10 out of 10 purely by virtue of being the first romantic comedy I’ve reviewed that doesn’t have any rape or vengeance fantasies in it. Speaking seriously though, I’m not about to pretend that Sakura Trick is some kind of mind-shattering literary master-piece.The relationship between Haruka and Yuu is sweet, but it isn’t incredibly deep or complex, a fact the show acknowledges in the final episode.  While Mitsuki does wrestle a bit with her feelings for Haruka, this isn’t the kind of Yuri that’s going to show us a lengthy, emotionally-tortured journey from self-loathing to acceptance and happiness… and that’s perfectly okay.  Not every Yuri needs to deal with bigotry and homophobia, and not every show ever produced needs to deliver a thoughtful commentary on some massive, societal issue.  Sometimes, you just want to watch a show about cute girls making out, and Sakura Trick is that show. time.

Mitsuki gradually morphs from being an authority figure attempting to stand between Haruka and Yuu to a love rival to her own sister, but she remains a source of tension whether she is lurking around spying on Haruka and Yuu, or preparing her confession.While there’s plenty of fan-service, it never really gets in the way of emotional development, and feels like the natural result of the characters feelings for each other rather than something forced in.  Haruka and Yuu make-out a lot, and Yuu comments on Haruka’s big boobs more than once, but that’s what girlfriends do.  It only makes sense.I particularly loved a bit of fan-service delivered in an after-episode bonus.  A secondary character is taking a bath, and the camera is making the expected zoom-ins on her body, when abruptly, she looks over her shoulder into the camera, smirks, and says, “Fan-service Scene”.  At first this seems like she’s just randomly breaking the forth wall for giggles, but there’s a deeper meaning to her awareness.  This isn’t the typical voyeuristic camera-angles that Harem series so often employ.  There’s an aspect of consent here that a lot of fan-service misses; the girl knows  full well that the audience is checking her out, and she’s perfectly fine with that!  So many Ecchi series rely on accidental groping, walking in on distraught girls naked and ogling camera-work, it’s refreshing to see an affirmation of consent accompanying an erotic moment.  I wish more shows had this kind of awareness.The Negative Side: There’s a part of me that’s tempted to give this series a 10 out of 10 purely by virtue of being the first romantic comedy I’ve reviewed that doesn’t have any rape or vengeance fantasies in it. Speaking seriously though, I’m not about to pretend that Sakura Trick is some kind of mind-shattering literary master-piece.The relationship between Haruka and Yuu is sweet, but it isn’t incredibly deep or complex, a fact the show acknowledges in the final episode.  While Mitsuki does wrestle a bit with her feelings for Haruka, this isn’t the kind of Yuri that’s going to show us a lengthy, emotionally-tortured journey from self-loathing to acceptance and happiness… and that’s perfectly okay.  Not every Yuri needs to deal with bigotry and homophobia, and not every show ever produced needs to deliver a thoughtful commentary on some massive, societal issue.  Sometimes, you just want to watch a show about cute girls making out, and Sakura Trick is that show.', '----------Disclaimer----------The following review is completely spoiler-free, and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!---------Positives---------- Non-Implicit RomanceBy far the largest reason I looked up this anime in the first place was because I was tired of romance sub-plots in many of the anime shows I loved. What I...wanted was a true romance; One that actually showed the trials and tribulations of a legitimate, blossoming coupling. Sakura Trick is exactly that. There\'s still some difficulties with admitting/telling others about the relationship, but overall it scratches the ""please I just want to see cute people get together and be in love"" itch that many of us get watching half-complete romance subplots in literally every show we ever watch. Incidentally, I would\'ve written ""Explicit"" instead of ""Non-Implicit"", but I don\'t mean it like thaaaaat c\'moon.- Overt SexualityThis could also be classified as a negative by some who are uncomfortable with the more intimate displays, but it was refreshing to see actual human signs of affection in the form of kissing (quite intense kissing at times). Anime has this weird double standard when it comes to displaying sexuality in its characters: It\'s okay to grope people and put their bodies on display, but heaven forbid you show them holding hands or kissing you absolute madman. Sakura Trick goes light on the boob grope and heavy on the petting, which I found to convey a more satisfying connection between the two main characters when viewing the relationship. Additionally, the show barely ever touches on the ""we\'re two girls, therefore it\'s wrong"" trope that squeezes any sense of fun out of any plot line.- Diversity in RelationshipsWhen you get down to it, Sakura Trick is about young girls falling in love. But dig a bit deeper, and you get to see three separate types of relationships blossoming. It was very nice to see a variety of different relationship standards being shown, instead of one simple relationship focus.- Bright, Happy ArtA show that centred around young blossoming love should have stylistic choices that match that setting. Sakura Trick absolutely knocks that out of the park with bright pastel colours, fun visuals representing characters, bubbly background cutouts, and many beautiful lighting choices.---------Negatives---------- Cast Screen TimeThe main characters of the show are Haruka and Yuu, for good reason. I have no complaints about their screentime, especially in regards to their relationship. Where a small qualm lies is with how the show distributed the screen time of all the other characters. Yuu\'s sister got far too much time in the spotlight compared to her friends, and this is especially true with regards to Kotone and Hiromi. The latter\'s episodes/segments often felt rushed, while the former\'s dragged on over multiple episodes. Additionally, a number of side characters are introduced quickly at the beginning and forgotten until they are needed later, at which point they\'re suddenly thrust upon the viewer with short time to get to know them. I would have liked to see a more even distribution of character development, focusing less on Mitsuki and more on other supporting cast members- Episode PacingI am very aware of the reality that much of Sakura Trick\'s manga was in a 4koma style, and as such leads the anime to have to adapt many small scenes into one episode. I still often got a bit of whiplash from the context switches, and I wish those were handled a bit better. This anime did such a good job reading between the lines and filling in the gaps for the manga. If only they could have gone a little bit farther to better adapt it to the medium they were using.- EndingI was left somewhat disappointed with the ending of the show. I cannot say much because I do not wish to spoil much, but there were a few key moments I wish had been a little less... awkward than they ended up being. Ultimately, I was left satisfied, but only partially. I would\'ve like a more definitive, flashy kind of ending.----------Conclusion----------Sakura Trick is the type of show that fills a void that anyone who enjoys romance is too familiar with. It allows us to finally let our hearts be free and enjoy watching a relationship actually bloom, with satisfying payoffs and many cute lesbian kisses. The characters feel somewhat realistic, but still fun in an anime kind of way. The relationships portrayed feel more authentic, and have more weight to them because they show actual affectionate displays.It pushes past many romantic tropes, eschewing the all-too-familiar sexuality double standard and delivers genuine, caring affection like I haven\'t seen in any other anime so far.  At the same time, it sidesteps many pitfalls that other romance or lesbian focused shows fall into. And do not make any mistake, it is also quite a funny show too!If affectionate displays like kissing (and I mean real kissing, not cute pecks) make you uncomfortable, then this isn\'t the show for you. But if you\'re open to the idea of real sexuality on display (without dipping into anything too risque, of course) then this show will do everything it can to fill that void in your heart that so many other anime have left. It will reward your patience, and make sure you leave each episode feeling happier than when you left.------------Final Rating------------While it makes for nice averages and wonderful sorting, when it comes to reviews I personally do not like direct numbering systems. Instead, I am to answer the question: ""Would you recommend I watch this show?"". So,If you are a fan of romance, I would definitely recommend giving this anime a try. The first episode should give you a good idea of how the rest of it will progress.If you are new to/interested in the above genre(s), it might not be the very best series to start with, but I would still recommend you give it a shot. Best results will come if you walk into this anime looking to satisfy an entertainment craving in your heart! wanted was a true romance; One that actually showed the trials and tribulations of a legitimate, blossoming coupling.

However, if those cute things are interesting or fun is another story, in short: THIS SHOW IS BORING. I haven't read the manga, and I doubt I ever will.Yuri fans have it rough when it comes to anime (thank god there are some good mangas out there), that being said, I can see why some people might like this anime so much. If its your first exposure to this kind of genera, it might work as a gateway drug (like cigarettes).If you have some time to...kill while drunk on a Saturday its harmless and mildly entertaining at best, and forgettable at worst; but it's not something I would recommend if you are looking for something more substantial in your cravings for shoujo-ai.Without further to do, lets check the bulletpoints (spoiler free, as I always do):-Story: What story? Pretty much nothing happens. The show takes an episodic approach with short stories and sketches that conclude in some cute thing for some cute reason and without consequences. There's nothing wrong with that, if done right, but here its just boring, there are some good ideas here and there but they are few and far between. There is some plot; but its minimal. It doesn't work as a comedy and it doesn't work as a drama, it's toothless and forgettable for the most part.-Art: Its fair, decent production value for what it is, nothing insulting yet nothing to be amazed at. The production team sure saved a lot of money representing the character interactions with flower symbols bumping into each other rather than with ACTUAL ANIMATION, but well... can't say that I expected more, and it kinda gives the show some personality. In short, cheap, but well optimized for what it is. As far as the character designs and settings, I cant remember anything truly standing out besides the eventual use of manga styled shaders here and there.-Sound: The voice acting was descent, and the music kinda slipped away at me, absolutely forgettable. Nothing special, nothing insulting. I think you can start seeing the pattern here...-Character: What characters? I cant remember any of them! You have, emm... lemme think... loli-esk blonde chan witch is kinda childish... her sister; emmmm... protagonist chan, witch is in love with blonde loli chan (for some reason); emmm... their lesbo friends that live together (for some reason)... and those two other girls that just hang there and one of them is named like the main character of Citrus. They are likable enough, but none of them are worth remembering, they are way too safe to deviate from their formulas.-Enjoyment: Did I just watch this show? Did I enjoy it? I CANT REMEMBER! :DSo...

This show centers around Haruka and Yu, who are close friends that become ""special friends"" (they make out with each other). That\'s the majority of the appeal of the show. If you like watching cute girls make out, this is a perfect anime for you.Beyond the surface level yuri, a lot of the scenes between the characters can actually be touching and sweet. The way the two main characters explore how they really feel about each other is very similar to what someone would experience in highschool, same...sex relationship or not. The characters themselves are nothing too special, but their interactions seem mostly genuine and realistic.The general story just follows the two main characters and their relationship together, but there are many scenes that seem forced for pointless. Visually, the show is nothing special. They attempt boob physics but it comes off more as comical than sensual.Overall, this show is very enjoyable if you like drama and cute girls kissing.

But it is kept to what I consider an absolute minimum and is often handled in cliche-funny or clever ways. As someone who absolutely despises mindless fan service, I really appreciated this approach.I liked a lot about it but it isn\'t flawless.Story: 7So in an effort to keep this as spoiler-free as possible; I\'m not going to give away any plot details and I\'m going to talk very generally about the story. It\'s a cute anime, two best friends decide to kiss and this kiss leads to a spark that causes them to kiss and experiment more all while trying to keep their secret from their friends and family.This leads to a discussion about love and the different facets of it.It\'s incredibly cute and the writing makes the most out of the settings, creating a lot of unique, romantic, and touching moments. Sometimes it can feel a little generic and the dialogue can almost seem too idealized.Art: 9This anime is beautiful. There\'s a fun use of character-based backgrounds, creating reaction images using character features, and chibi visual skits. Nothing feels jarring and the animation has a very natural flow to it. At some points, background characters are just white cutouts.Sound: 9The VAs in this series were fine and I don\'t have any qualms about them. The music choices fit nicely with the scenes they were in and served an important role in setting the mood. There were a lot of moments where the soundtrack really shined.Character: 6This is where I feel Sakura Trick suffers from the most. The female leads are very cute and their relationship dynamic works. But one of the leads is very airheaded and the other is more down to earth but easily swayed. This makes for a duo that can at times be annoying with childish antics and arguments. They aren\'t developed enough individually so most of the supporting characters and their relationships with each other are more fleshed out and more realistic than that of the protagonists. I think this is deliberately done and I\'ll get to why that is in the Overall portion.Enjoyment: 9I had a good time with this series and watching it all the way through was a breeze because of the pacing and how the plot develops. It\'s very memorable and even though I had minor complaints about some of the character\'s attitudes in certain situations I believe I\'ll be rewatching this again in the near future.Overall: 8Final Opinion:Love is a complicated emotion to describe. If you were to ask 100 people what they define as love you\'d get a lot of different answers despite the feeling being the same. You can discover love in many ways, whether that\'s through art, music, work, or another person.Sometimes love is like a Sakura tree. It grows slowly and sheds its petals in a short amount of time. But it still grows.Sometimes love is like a semi hitting you at 70mph and you can\'t describe how it felt, but you damn well know you felt it.I don\'t know if I would call Sakura Trick a love story.The feelings the protagonists feel are compared and contrasted with the relationships others share in the series, and you can see how one couple\'s relationship has far more meaning and a deeper connection to them than our protagonists\' relationship has to them.It seems very open to interpretation.I think this story is about two girls that find affection in one another through an unfamiliar act they had never explored before. These girls seek comfort in one another because they\'re thrust into a new situation without familiarity, so being together means they can find something to anchor them in this new place. This leads to experimentation and feelings that weren\'t discovered before.I don\'t believe that these protagonists are in love and it\'s clear at the end that they don\'t have a true understanding of what love is or means to them.The phrase ""I love you"" may elicit a positive response but without a proper understanding of what is meant by that, the words hold less weight than they otherwise would.Overall I find this to be a cute, lighthearted story about teenagers on the path to self-discovery and I enjoyed it. anime, there is fan service present.

It's quite well known that giving a praise and high rating to this kind of anime is such a taboo, and here I am, doubting myself, asking myself the question : am I being biased? After some time of thinking, then I concluded, no! Judging an anime by its genre is as bad as judging a book by its cover. As a medium of art, anime allows for creators to express themselves the way they...want, and Sakura Trick, happens to be one unique and sweet experience that I enjoy so much.Now, what makes Sakura Trick stands as a great show? This really baffled me because I’m unable to have a clear answer. Usually for anime that I enjoyed, I could readily pin point the good things about them, but this one is vague because at glance, all that can be seen from this anime is sweet and comedy.After some thought given, I think the one that appeal me the most is the light-hearted atmosphere that Sakura Trick has created. It’s funny, hilarious, and non – logical, but at the same time, I felt it indirectly trying to show us how wonderful the world would be if we can just love each other. This realization makes me appreciate this anime even more, because I think it’s a kind of critics for our society, who love the others only if certain conditions is met, whether it is social status, religion, interest, or anything else. Why can’t we just love each other? Giving hugs and kisses? Should love only be limited to a couple? Why don’t we make this world more wonderful with warm hugs?I would say, Sakura Trick had become the first yuri anime that I truly enjoyed. want, and Sakura Trick, happens to be one unique and sweet experience that I enjoy so much.Now, what makes Sakura Trick stands as a great show?

If you’re like me and not as desensitized to anime horniness you’ll find it isn't as innocent as it’s cracked up to be but that’s honestly completely fine. This would be the part where I talk about the male gaze and while yes, this is a seinen, at the end of the day we dykes appreciate leg and boobie shots as much as any straight man. With that being said however the only thing that goes on here is making out, I don't think Yuu and Haruka even know what sex...is and god bless them for it. Speaking of which basically everyone here is a dumbass but not in an annoying way. I think it’s because the characters' stupidity isn’t mean spirited. Even Haruka’s jealousy is mostly played for laughs and doesnt seriously harm Yuu.  All of the characters genuinely care about each other and it’s just as much a power of friendship show as it is a yuri show. We have a charming but not super interesting cast.

Haruka, Yuu, and Mitsuki’s confusion over their feelings being platonic or romantic is something every sapphic can relate too.

This show completely goes all out with no intent of looking back at what will go down in history of what Yuri Yuri almost was.Story: 2/10Look; there is no story. Every episode just helps each character get closer to the one they love. This anime focuses on a group of high school girls that are starting to form affection for another female. This topic is pretty iffy with some people (not me) and in other anime the line has never really been fully crossed in terms of what happens affection (physical affection) wise. Sakura Trick...says fu$# that, these bit%$es be horny as a motherf#@%er, time to get down. My jaw almost hit the floor in the beginning episode as I witnessed the main couple really get into their feelings. In other Yuri shows there is a hint of restraint and blackout scenes are used when needed. In Sakura Trick no such thing exists since when the time comes, you see all the affection. I was quite flabbergasted that they went into such detail on some of the scenes (again it didn't bother me I was just literally awestricken).But plot wise it is just a slice of life so it moves quite slow. You see the same gags in each episode so you might get a little bored with the same cycle over and over and over again.Animation: 7/10Not too bad actually. The character models look pretty good and there seemed to be a pretty smooth frame rate throughout the entire show. The use of light colors really matched the carefree feeling of the show.Sound: 5/10Average performance, average soundtrack, subpar opening and ending songs.Characters: 4/10Again pretty average by my standards. There are some somewhat touching scenes later on but I never really felt totally invested. The characters worked well with each other and helped form some funny scenes here and there but it wasn't really a knock-it-out-of-the-park performance.Overall: 4.5/10This show is just really average. If you are into Yuri stuff then you will love this show. However if you are looking for substance, comedy, or character development be ready to be pretty disappointed. It is though very very very kawaii.Enjoyment: 4/10Thanks for reading my review!

If yes, this is the show for you. If not, you should watch something else.Really that's all there is to this show. The characters are meh, the art is decent, the music is catchy as hell, and there is at least one kissing scene per episode.Personally, I loved this show. But that's because it caters directly to my tastes - I'm a big Yuri fan.Some more annoying aspects about the show are that it ends before much is resolved, doesn't really have much happen in it, and the backgrounds/extras are literally just linework on occasion, but the main couple...are really cute, and not just physically, either. They're adorable characters.Bottom line: This is a Yuri anime meant for Yuri fans. are really cute, and not just physically, either.

It's not the best animated, it's not the best written, it's not the best soundtrack. What it will do is fill that hole in your heart with some cute yuri goodness. While there is an emotional journey I have seen it done better. It's best to take this show as a cute, lighthearted, semi serious show dealing with kissing and emotions. It's a show, deeper about self discovery. It does suffer from Yuri universe syndrome, in where, everybody is a yuri. While that's not a huge problem it always feels like...it pulls away from the main message of being able to accept who you are. When literally there is not much of a struggle because 100% of our recurring cast is in the same situation. At the end of the day I fully recommend this show.

That's what this show does with the introduction of Mitsuki Sonoda. From the moment she's introduced into the show, the show is slowly trying to commit suicide, until the final two episodes where it's stabbing itself with a knife.My first impressions with the first about 3 episodes were that it was a definite 9, and possible even a 10. Then the show goes on and it might be a more average 8. But Mitsuki becomes more and more annoying...of a character. She appears more frequently and becomes more oppressive, not just to the Main Characters but to the mood of the show itself. It became a chore to enjoy the good moments when you were too annoyed by the feeling that you knew Mitsuki would come and sour the waters.I was very seriously considering dropping the show on episode 11 and not watching episode 12. I had to pause the last episode quite a few times to sigh in disappointment, roll my eyes, and grunt in disappointment. The actions the Mitsuki character takes in the show are at the mildest annoying and rude, but more accurately, the way she acts and thinks is reprehensible; she's a disgusting person. The problem is that that's clearly not what you're meant to think of her; only one of the MCs barely manages to get a bit annoyed with her, and the show itself depicts her like you would a cute, lovable, side character, especially when she reaches her epiphany in ep 11 or 12.I seriously question if the show knows what its own appeal is. Mitsuki is an incredibly discomforting presence and incredibly centralizing in the latter half of the show. of a character.

I loved the main romance as well as the side romance between Shizuku and Kotone, and thought that both romances were incredibly cute. The only place this show failed imo is by adding in some out of place ecchi moments as well as basically the entire character arc of Mitsuki. As someone who really likes monogamous relationships in stories and gets really annoyed by infidelity, a lot of the things that Mitsuki did made me angry, but this ultimately was patched up by the end. On the whole though, I really liked this anime and would...recommend it for anyone who wants a nice romance story. recommend it for anyone who wants a nice romance story.', 'Uhh... so what I really liked about the show are the kissing scenes...Oh wait, no no no no. I actually enjoyed the complicated relations between the girls and their relatives, their integration in society, coming out as homosexuals and the importance of gay acceptance.Actually who am I kidding. It\'s literally about girls kissing each other. Even the intro is about kissing and dancing, but mainly kissing. Also the general content of the entire anime consists of kissing and kissing is hands down the strongest selling point of the show. Yeah...I mean yuri is a very ""difficult"" genre. Difficult as in what exactly is the show...gonna be about. Probably girls, right. But what are the girls doing? Well, we can either make them kiss or we can straight up make a slice of life and put a yuri label on it, let it be about female friendship and be done with it (aka Yuru Yuri etc.). Sakura Trick is more of the former than the latter. So yeah, kissing. I\'d like to tell you there\'s more to it, but there really isn\'t.In the end it\'s still a slice of life, so it\'s pretty chill, you don\'t have to think about the show while watching it, after watching it and you actually don\'t have to think about the show at all. That being said, it\'s all about the visuals, sir. Don\'t expect a real story besides girls being friends (with benefits).Oh and kissing. Did I mention the kissing part? That\'s pretty important. 10/10 (actually a 6/10 is more appropriate). The visuals though. gonna be about. Probably girls, right. But what are the girls doing?

The visuals though.', 'An adaptation of a 4-koma manga revolving around the sweet and innocent relationship between two high school girls? Sign me the hell up!Story - 7/10Sakura Trick’s main plot revolves around our central couple Haruka and Yuu. Best friends since middle school they have always been closer than usual. During a fit of jealousy Haruka ask Yuu if they can do something which other friends won’t think of doing. What would that be? Why a kiss on the mouth of course! This bold move sparks a fire between the two of them leading to at least a single kiss per episode. The reason why I personally...enjoyed the simple plot of Sakura Trick, is exactly because of the simplicity. A large problem which I have with the romance genre, is the convoluted mess the romance usually becomes. This occurs when the writer tries to blend drama into the story. Luckily Sakura Trick has hardly any drama within the anime. A thought that might occur when reading the previous sentence is: “ Then how does the author manage to keep you watching?” By focusing on the innocence of young love. Seeing Haruka and Yuu realize that their feelings - and kisses - might hold a deeper meaning than simply extremely intimate friendship is what made the show charming to watch. Other than the romance, Sakura Trick is primarily a SOL series. I personally enjoyed the interactions between all of the different characters and their conversations and managed to make this callous person smile.Art - 7/10An aspect of Sakura Trick which really annoyed me was the fanservice. Fanservice doesn’t bother me as much as it did in the past, however in the case of Sakura Trick I was appalled so much so that I nearly stopped watching the series. Most of the character have been enhanced in “certain areas” and the amount of times the camera focused on those places were unforgivable. The problem with the fanservice in Sakura Trick is, that it simply doesn’t work with the central themes of the series. Oversexualizing characters in a show mainly about the sweetness of young love, just absolutely destroys the atmosphere. Other than that, the art style is fairly basic. Nothing looks horrible, but nothing looks amazing either.Sound - 8/10Sakura Trick has what I like to call a stupidly-fun soundtrack. Everything from the background music to the opening and ending are all super fun to listen to. The vocalists must have had a blast when recording the opening, because it is filled with joy. It has a cheerful and happy tone and makes the anime all the more fun to watch. I really enjoyed the voice acting for Sakura Trick, because of they made the characters sound sweeter than they already are. Even though Sakura Trick’s soundtrack isn’t a masterpiece by a longshot, it remains to be an absolute joy to listen to.Character - 7/10Haruka is our jealous protagonist who just wants to love her adorable Yuu-chan. If the world were to end and she and Yuu are the only people alive, she could die happy and content. Yuu is the sensible person in their relationship and tries thinking ahead whenever Haruka wants to pucker up. Even though she might appear cold towards Haruka’s advances, she really does care for her beloved deeply. Shizuka and Kotone are the pair with the more complicated relationship as their personalities are the polar opposites of one another. This made for some great dialogue between the two and their friends. Next we have the strict-but-sweet Student Council President Mitsuki. Out of all the characters she was my favorite as she was constantly questioning her feelings for her sisters friend Haruka. Seeing Mitsuki act like a tsundere to the oblivious Haruka, were some of my favorite scenes throughout the anime. Lastly we  have Yuzu and Kaede, the pair who are constantly trying to calm their friends.Enjoyment - 8/10I enjoyed the simplicity and innocence of the relationship between the two characters and the dialogue between them and their friends. The soundtrack was super fun to listen towards. The fun characters, themes and soundtrack are what made me love the series.Overall - 7/10If I were to compare the romance to another anime, Karakai Jozu no Takagi-san is a fitting match as both series revolve around the concept of young love. Sakura Trick is cute little slice of life revolving around the relationship between two girls. If you are looking for a deeply philosophical anime, then Sakura Trick definitely not the right anime.

It has your typical rom-com aspects and Yuri content is there in spades beyond just the main characters. The side characters are well developed and fit just exactly what the plot needed. I was surprised at the comedy part of it and how much it made me chuckle out loud. There was something in at least one half of every episode that got me. The only had to be small things and subtle things, but they delivered.There are only a few complaints that I have, most of them...being with the fact that we have way, way too much lip lock in our faces rather than trying to develop full formed relationships. We can all see where Haruka and You are headed and there\'s finally inkling of what you can expect in a relationship at the very end, but I think it\'s a little too late. It should have been introduced gradually rather than as it tapered off. Meat ski is a terrible sister and shame on her for acting like she did. Thankfully Yu was extremely tolerable what she saw. No matter where it landed them in the end, that should have been enough to destroy that poor girl\'s heart. I would like to have seen a little more development of Kotone and Shuzuki They were more what I was hoping for rather than just being a snog fest. I honestly believe they could rename this ""the make out anime""  and it wou cover everything we would need to know about it.And now, I have to address my absolute favorite and critical part of an anime, the visuals. I think the colors did a wonderful job setting the feelings and the moods behind the characters. They were bright and solid, enough to warm up the scenery while still highlighting the characters, no matter who they were, as they were needed for each different scene. The backgrounds changed to fit times of stress specifically, especially around Mitzuki. The music also accompanied each scene and set the mood very deliberately.Soft piano at the right times to convey the romance while including sharp strings delivered at a high pitch while giving you the feeling that there was a sharp and cold feeling going down someone\'s spineI can\'t say that it would be something I would rewatch, but I most definitely would recommend it. being with the fact that we have way, way too much lip lock in our faces rather than trying to develop full formed relationships.

I guess making them full blown Lesbians out the gate is too much for the Japanese to handle.Back to the subject; you will find that the animation itself is nothing...groundbreaking, and it didn\'t have any memorable soundtrack that I can think of.Character\'s are quite..flat(some quite literally) Most of their personalities consist of being gay for X. The main thing character\'s do in this show is become flustered and confused as hell when gay unfolds. The anime dosen\'t focus on strengthing these relationships, but merely relies on gayness to keep the episodes flowing.It\'s hard to give any reason to say that I love the yuri couples in this show. Which is pretty ironic consider how many non canon lesbian animu chick\'s I have shipped during my years watching anime. groundbreaking, and it didn\'t have any memorable soundtrack that I can think of.Character\'s are quite..flat(some quite literally) Most of their personalities consist of being gay for X.

It's can't quite claim the title of ecchi anime since they never draw any nipples, but I'm sure there's someone out there who tried to fap to this. Like I said there's a lot of girls kissing and some of the time it gets pretty heavy.The premise is pretty funny in that the girls only start doing their secret kissing play because they wanted to have more special...memories with each other than just what they did with their usual friends. But then the one girl's older sister and student council president starts to catch wise about their intimacy and of all things starts to feel jealous of her sister. Hijinks ensues. Beyond the kissing stuff it's a pretty standard comedy anime, or slice of life whatever you want to call them. Some of the other characters might have trouble standing out and aren't given a lot of spotlight. The relationship and eventually love triangle of the main 3 girls seems to take focus most of the time.If you like yuri and don't mind excessive fanservice over plot then this is probably your kind of show.

Oh and the animation was on the edge of being a slideshow. That's about it.There's nothing else I could write. was there even a plot? What is a plot anyway? I think they kissed in a public place once. Scandalous. Why is this a classic? Are we so starved for animated representation that we go buck wild for a kissing montage made in PowerPoint?What more is there to say about this work? The twintail protagonist remind me...a bit of Raibaru from yandere simulator. In the sense that the only memorable personality they got is being gay and having orange/blonde twintails. a bit of Raibaru from yandere simulator. In the sense that the only memorable personality they got is being gay and having orange/blonde twintails."", ""Something that has always fascinated me was yuri. People have such a passion for this genre and bring it up all the time. I wanted to know what this genre was capable of. That's why I watched Citrus. A friend recommended me this anime as a way to screw with me. It did. Awful storyline, awful characters and awful first episodes. I was exhausted after watching Citrus, but I knew that there was more to this genre and didn't give up hope. After dabbling in a few other yuri's I came across Sakura Trick, an anime that had a premise of girls kissing each other...(which rarely happens in other anime). After finishing the anime, I can definitely say that they got the kissing part at least right. Does it deliver on other fronts?Let's begin with what you see right away: The animation. The color pallet is very bright and soft, often having a spring vibe. Nothing too interesting or special, but still nice to look at. The animations are okay, the backgrounds are nothing noteworthy and the expressions are what you would expect of a high school anime. It is basic stuff. What is noteworthy are the symbol scenes. Sometimes between scenes there is a brief scene transition animation that shows what is happening. For example: when Yuu gets closer to Haruka a brief animation appears showing Yuu's flower symbol moving closer to Haruka's flower symbol before it cuts to the next scene. These scenes can sometimes help getting a better understanding of what is going on, other times they are just repeating things which already were obvious. It's a neat thing nonetheless.Great, I was able talk a 140+ words paragraph on how the animation is just average. The same thing goes for the OST. The opening and ending songs are nice to listen to, but aren't noteworthy beyond that. I can't remember much about the other songs in the anime, except the one that plays during in the emotional scenes. That song is cute and surprisingly emotional.Now we get to what I consider the most important aspects of an anime: The story and the characters. The story begins with Haruka and Yuu on the first day of high school. They are really close friends and love each other dearly, but now they only got 3 years before they go to different colleges, so they both set out to get the most out of their time together. So that's when they decide as a way to cherish this period in their lives to have a kiss. A very passionate kiss at that. Then a few days later they kiss again. Then another few days later they kiss again. And again. And again. And again. Their friendship turns into a full-fledged lesbian relationship. Now it is their job to keep this relationship alive and keep it a secret from others. The story is pretty original for an anime, but is inherently nothing that special and is just kind of dull.The character cast consists of 7 characters. The two you are going to see the most of are Haruka and Yuu. Haruka is the raging lesbian. Every time she sees Yuu do anything or sees two girls do something gay she gets extremely... happy (to put it lightly). Yuu is the child. She looks like a child and acts like one, but she never struck me as annoying, which are I am very grateful for.Then there are five other side characters. Shizuku is the quiet one. She doesn't speak up a lot and is kinda shoehorned into the cast. She is in a relationship with Kotone, the big sister (personality wise). She is very responsible and teases Shizuku a lot. I enjoyed their relationship and how it played out, but there was not enough time devoted to them which makes me question why have time devoted to them at all, except for that they then have another lesbian couple and so they can tease the viewers with the third ''lesbian'' couple, Kaede and Yuzu. These two characters have basically the same personality (the friendly bro's). Their only difference are their characters designs and I have to admit I like Yuzu's design with the cute cat ears. The last character is the actual big sister of Yuu, Mitsuki, the closet loser. She very dependable on the outside, but in reality she is very nervous and gets quickly jealous.Is it complaining time? It is complaining time.In the first episode Haruka and Yuu meet the rest of cast and decide that they are friends. So now they all are friends because they say they are. Character development? Missed the train. The character development takes longer than usual and it makes the first few episodes frustrating to watch. That is disregarding the fact that first half even without the late character development generally worse is than the second: Less story, less conflict, less excitement. So if you are not immediately invested in the premise from get go your first impressions will not be good.Another problem I have is that the humor is crap. The anime only got a few chuckles out of me *in its 12 episode series*. The humor boils down to characters making puns and the music stopping like you are stopping a record player to follow up with a lame punch line. It is hard to express my distaste, but you have to see this for yourself if you what to get a better understanding of what I mean.So with these two big problems and some other smaller problems (like character similarities and average aesthetics), you have an anime that is nothing special and doesn't succeed in its most crucial moments. Does the anime have any redeeming qualities? Yes it has: The kiss scenes. These scenes play out as simple as the title: The characters just kiss. Even with that, I can't help but really like these scenes. They have tons and tons of passion and are generally really well animated. The buildup is also really good too and it feels you genuinely deserve to watch these scenes after what they went through.Sakura Trick was an interesting watch. It is mediocre to the core with a boring first half, slightly above average character cast and bad humor, but the kiss scenes are just nice enough for me to enjoy it. I encourage you all to check it out if you just want to have an anime where girls kiss. If you want to have an anime with great characters and fantastic humor, then go watch Nichijou or something.

Welcome to another installment of Robert\'s Too Late Reviews! If you\'re looking for plot details, check the synopsis for the skinny on all that. Sometimes, though, reading what a show is about doesn\'t give you a good feel for how the anime works out, what your expectations should be, and whether the general concept is compatible with your tastes, right? Well that\'s where your friendly neighborhood...reviewers come in! Will this make the lost RTLR wall? Let\'s talk about the good, the bad, and the kissy faced found in Sakura Trick!I\'m a big fan of romance anime, I...consider Kimi no Na wa to be one of the best movies I\'ve seen, and I\'m a big fan of yuri anime, which inexorably lead me here. If you look on just about any major list of \'top yuri anime\' you\'re going to find Sakura Trick on the list somewhere. While it is two girls crushing on each other, but make no mistake, its not romantic in the same sense as Aoi Hana, nor is it is straight up hardcore yuri like Strawberry Panic. It is a bit more than the class-s yuri such as Maria-sama ga Miteru. Basically your mileage on this series depends on your stance on kissing and young girls making out. If repeated kissing scenes does not float your boat, head out to open water and pass this one up, as that\'s the central focus. We\'re getting quickly to kissing, and never moving past that. So straight up, this is an one trick pony. That\'s not to say it\'s not fun, a show doesn\'t have to be shocking at every turn to be \'good\'. Sometimes knowing what\'s coming doesn\'t keep you from enjoying how the story gets there. This is the case with Sakura Trick.Story: 7As I said, we have a comfortable groove in this anime, with starry eyed Haruka just plain crushing on her schoolmate, the more reserved Yuu. It does not take long at all for our two girls to begin the smooching, and the rest of the series revolves around the circumstances of these make out sessions. Basically we see a pattern of hijinks, make out sessions, almost getting caught kissing, and back around to hijinks to set up the next round. The joy comes in how they get into the situations they find themselves in, how they are nearly caught and by whom, and how they confirm they really are crushing on each other and are both wanting their relationship to be romantic in the sense that applies to their level of maturity.Again, this series is *not* Strawberry Panic with heavy sexual overtones (and more) but it\'s not a tender moving story based on character exploration such as Aoi Hana. This is purely fluff in the sense that not even the show takes itself too seriously. The setting is pretty much standard slice of life fare, festivals, school activities, homework, etc. This can be comforting because we don\'t have to wrap ourselves around any errant details, and we can watch at a much more relaxed manner than we\'d have to take for something like, say, Fate/Stay Night for example. Each full episode is split into two parts, so instead of a single 24 minute runtime, we get two 12-14 bites which makes the plot a good deal better paced. Even the anime itself realizes that a full show would be too much to stretch the thin plots over. If you\'re familiar, this is very similar to the structure of Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt.This is a silly show without the need to take notes or keep up with complicated plots. The series limits itself mainly to the main couple of Haruka and Yuu, even though another couple exists but is not really explored, I think due to a desire to stay focused. The humor is provided by a pair of friends that are fairly clueless about what is going on between Haruka and Yuu, and are generally just funny, even occasionally breaking the fourth wall. The main antagonist is more a concept than a person, being usually the risk of getting caught kissing and having their secret uncovered. Yuu\'s big sister gets into the fray at one point, with disapproving views on the relationship she\'s suspicious about. Her motivations for disapproval aren\'t a big surprise, but they fit with the flow of the series, and make sense in that respect. Of course the big sister involvement leads to more hijinks and therefore more excuses for spit swapping, but hey, like I said, that\'s what you\'re signing up for here.Art: 9The girls are all expressive, and varied enough to carry their personality forward. They aren\'t copycat depictions with slightly different haircuts, as some anime use. The different effects played are fun and interesting, the backgrounds are all nicely done and flow with the rest of the artwork very well. Nothing to complain about here.Sound: 7I have to ding the score here a little bit as the two girls can get to moaning during kissing to the point we\'re pushing near porn grounds. Its at a level I wouldn\'t watch without headphones or being alone, as they are at times embarrassing to people who have, you know, actually kissed someone before. Otherwise the sound is fine. I find the opening and closing songs both to be absolutely a ton of fun, and I\'ve been known to randomly break into song with ""Love! Won\'t you kiiss? Kiss and love!"" Yeah, my family all look at me funny! If not for the over the top moaning, I\'d really have no knocks against the sound.Character: 8If you\'re with me for the kissing ride, then you will likely fall in love with the characters themselves. Haruka is so openly crushing on Yuu its so cute. She is stereotypical in the fact that she has eyes only for Yuu and even quickly becomes jealous if Yuu has anything to do with the other friends. This jealousy is really well related to the feelings I had when I was her age with my first few girlfriends, before I learned how to act like a mature person in a relationship, so her feelings are authentic from where I\'m sitting. Yuu tries so hard to make it seem as though she\'s almost not interested in Haruka in a romantic way, but she\'s quickly changed after a few kisses, and even though she continues to act standoffish most of the time, she burns for the kisses as bad as Haruka does. They are complimented by four other friends, two that are the couple I mentioned in the story section, and the final two friends are the comedic foils, and are hilarious in the way they puzzle over many of the things that happen in the show. Yuu\'s big sister is pretty funny, and even looks a great deal like Yuu, leading to some more hijinks type moments.These are a bunch of silly girls doing silly girl things, obsessing over things girls obsess over, and generally acting like you would expect silly girls to do. And guys, we were silly (in a *manly* way of course) at that age too, just girls are more fun to watch. The characters are great, even if they are fairly one-note types.Enjoyment: 8I clearly enjoyed this show, I admit that it was refreshing for me to think of young love, or well, in this case young crushes where things were as simple as finding a quiet spot to share a quick kiss or two. By limiting the story to just this level without slathering on all the sexual stuff there is a level of (strangely) innocence presented. Even being a grown man I can think back on my first kisses with a girl and the feelings I had then, and this anime does a good job of bringing those memories back to life.Yes it is predictable, it does repeat the same few basic plot points over and over again, but sometimes just taking it easy and blushing as the girls kiss and you remember those early awkward days of stepping freshly into love can still be a great experience. I wouldn\'t call this a yuri \'romance\' but it is a fun little anime about crushes and kisses, and gets my vote of approval! They scored one pic on the RTLR wall, of Haruka and Yuu holding hands. Only question is, won\'t you kiss? consider Kimi no Na wa to be one of the best movies I\'ve seen, and I\'m a big fan of yuri anime, which inexorably lead me here. If you look on just about any major list of \'top yuri anime\' you\'re going to find Sakura Trick on the list somewhere.

Only question is, won\'t you kiss?', ""I'm a big fan of yuri, so this show came out of the gates promising to be a personal favorite.  As many of the reviews point out, there are multiple scenes with girl kissing per episode starting in episode 1.  I'm very easy to please when it comes to yuri, so these scenes never got old to me.  However, the story and characters would constantly get in the way of the experience, especially in the later episodes.Early on in the show, the main characters, Haruka and Yuu, already have a great friendship and decide to make their friendship even more special by...kissing each other.  While the reasoning for this is pretty weak, who cares because yuri.  For the first 7 to 8 episodes, these kisses seem to become more meaningful for both of the characters and they seem to be moving towards an honest, open relationship.  However, around this point the show makes a huge misstep in my opinion.Yuu is generally more reluctant to kiss than Haruka, although there are exceptions to that at times.  This shyness is usually cute and by the 7th or 8th episode, she is more active in initiating kisses and the relationship becomes better as a result of that.  But for some stupid reason, the show decides to have Yuu's older sister enter into the picture and try to interrupt the relationship.  This arc was so damn frustrating, the point of it from a plot perspective was to force Yuu into realizing how much Haruka means to her, but as a viewer it felt shallow and frustrating.Yuu's sister plays off her actions as a noble deed because Haruka and Yuu don't know what their doing, but this holds little weight for me considering that she's trying to steal her sisters girlfriend.  This character, quite frankly, was the worst.  It was also aggravating watching Haruka consider someone other than Yuu, especially when that someone is Yuu's sister.  Overall, this entire situation seemed to exist entirely to push the relationship between Haruka and Yuu past a superficial level.  However, it was handled in such a lazy way that I actually felt like their relationship got worse.All in all, this show has some good moments and features a lot of yuri, so that alone made it a worthwhile watch.  The issues with the story and annoying characters ended up detracting from the experience enough that what should've been an easy 8 or 9 for me ended up closer to a 6. kissing each other.

(In a good way, thankfully.)As usual in shows that are rather heavy-handed with the Slice of Life element, I should probably start out by saying that that's not really my thing. I typically prefer shows with a little more action. But I have found some enjoyment in them in the past and like to give everything a try. And on that note, I will say I really liked this underlying theme they had of making the most of every day and...appreciating what you have before it's gone-- spurred on by the atmosphere of their school's pending closure. (Although, even this, I felt, fell short in some ways. The series only covers the girls' first year, and so we don't get to see that through to the end. I really felt like some sort of official goodbye and a graduation scene was in order.)But let's be honest; we all know what everyone's really here for. I found the romance to be... cute. I felt like that 'making the most of every moment' atmosphere was a good backdrop to their relationship, and it was satisfying to see them both grow over the course of the series. You can really see them going from being little kids-- just imitating adults-- to being two people capable of managing a relationship. But even on top of just making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, this show got more serious than I expected it to. LGBT+ issues in anime have been done well in the past, (as well as done poorly its fair share of times) but I still rarely see them addressed openly. Which is why I was really optimistic about the plotline with Mitsuki. Honestly, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if she hadn't developed a crush on Haruka herself, but they really pull it together by the end. I really liked the shift near the end, where they were finally confronted and asked to define their relationship for what it is. It's not everything I wanted it to be... but they come pretty damn close, I'll give them that.I will say that the characters in general fell a little short for me as well. Honestly, Haruka and Yuu were a little bland. The Slice of Life element didn't really help them there, as it started to feel at times like all their mini adventures chronicling their everyday lives was just an excuse to see two girls kiss in a variety of different scenarios. (It felt a little... exploitative at those times, particularly around the middle of the anime.) It certainly didn't help that they were consistently upstaged by the relationship between two of the side characters. Shizuku and Kotone, on top of having stronger personalities, just had a more interesting story between them. A story that really highlights that 'making the most of every day' theme.A lot of things about this show even out. Like, the visuals are about as simple as it gets, (with the exception of a few dramatic scenes near the end, where the lighting was used really well) but their comedic timing was always really good.

And if you're looking for a shoujo-ai story that's generally lighthearted but does have its heartfelt, meaningful moments, I would definitely recommend this one. appreciating what you have before it's gone-- spurred on by the atmosphere of their school's pending closure. (Although, even this, I felt, fell short in some ways. The series only covers the girls' first year, and so we don't get to see that through to the end. I really felt like some sort of official goodbye and a graduation scene was in order.)But let's be honest; we all know what everyone's really here for. I found the romance to be... cute. I felt like that 'making the most of every moment' atmosphere was a good backdrop to their relationship, and it was satisfying to see them both grow over the course of the series. You can really see them going from being little kids-- just imitating adults-- to being two people capable of managing a relationship. But even on top of just making me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, this show got more serious than I expected it to. LGBT+ issues in anime have been done well in the past, (as well as done poorly its fair share of times) but I still rarely see them addressed openly. Which is why I was really optimistic about the plotline with Mitsuki. Honestly, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if she hadn't developed a crush on Haruka herself, but they really pull it together by the end. I really liked the shift near the end, where they were finally confronted and asked to define their relationship for what it is. It's not everything I wanted it to be... but they come pretty damn close, I'll give them that.I will say that the characters in general fell a little short for me as well. Honestly, Haruka and Yuu were a little bland. The Slice of Life element didn't really help them there, as it started to feel at times like all their mini adventures chronicling their everyday lives was just an excuse to see two girls kiss in a variety of different scenarios. (It felt a little... exploitative at those times, particularly around the middle of the anime.) It certainly didn't help that they were consistently upstaged by the relationship between two of the side characters. Shizuku and Kotone, on top of having stronger personalities, just had a more interesting story between them. A story that really highlights that 'making the most of every day' theme.A lot of things about this show even out. Like, the visuals are about as simple as it gets, (with the exception of a few dramatic scenes near the end, where the lighting was used really well) but their comedic timing was always really good. It's cute and lighthearted... in a way that dragged just a little for me. They start to address the real issues-- of Haruka and Yuu only having to keep it such a secret because they're both girls... but still kind of skirt around it by the end.

It doesn't pull you in with deep and meaningful plot, or excessive or playful ecchi. It does one simple thing very well and everything else is just a sideshow.

Probably. Should it have made me cry? maybe not. Is it special to me to the point where I want more of the same and nothing else? absolutely, I adore this anime. Is that pathetic?

Since watching it I have evolved out of liking ""cute girls doing cute things"" and ""slice of life"" anime so I thought it would interesting to give it a rewatch.I did not like it. I can see how my younger self liked it however. This is the kind of anime where you don\'t really have to worry about plot or character progression or anything like that. You just relax and watch what happens. For one, that kind of storytelling doesn\'t interest me...anymore. I could barely make it through half of this because nothing was happening. Secondly, the characters are annoying as hell. Especially the two mains.

Obviously you won't enjoy this if you are not a yuri enjoyer such as myself. This is actually the first yuri anime I've seen, and overall I enjoyed it more than I didn't like it.

It\'s heavily implied that Haruka\'s a bit of a loner, but when she met Yuu, she was able to mesh into her group of friends.  Once they join high school together, they seem to find their little friend circle, which includes them, Yuzu, Kaede, Kotone and Shizuku.  Together, they go about day-to-day life in school.  However, we are...shown very shortly in that Haruka and Yuu are actually romantically interested in each other.  What follows is we get to view their life in their first year in high school, which include various events, or the crew just hanging out with each other.Each episode is broken down into two halves.  Similarly to Bloom Into You, each half has its own episode title and focuses on a certain story aspect.  However, unlike Bloom Into You, the halves don\'t transition into each other very well at well.  If you were to air each half individually, it wouldn\'t feel any different. There are episodes where they do make a bigger attempt to transition smoothly, but I felt this broken pacing felt really awkward.  It\'s a shame too because I found myself very interested in each half, individually.  I really enjoyed the story throughout, as each episode looked at a different event or aspect of the girls\' life.  It wasn\'t too boring, and while I do agree that this broken pacing between episode halves can introduce different settings quicker, I felt like the payoff didn\'t full pan out.Sakura Trick makes an interesting decision to try and include some fan service.  There are a lot of random jokes made at Haruka\'s breasts and there are a lot more kissing scenes here than you\'d likely see in other romance anime - especially because they\'re so long and passionate.  They both probably occurred more often than was necessary to make the point... but they\'re there if that\'s your thing.  I actually didn\'t mind the kissing scenes because it emphasized a point between Haruka and Yuu, and rarely do you see that kind of feeling in the genre.  Being different isn\'t a bad thing!One aspect I respect is that they created a situation where Haruka and Yuu feel like dating as two girls could be viewed as being frowned upon.  This is an issue that isn\'t tackled in many anime in any depth but I do like what they did with it.  I would have liked them to dive a little deeper into this, but it\'s a nice step, especially considering this anime\'s somewhat old.  They end the series off nicely in that it does feel complete.  I believe the source materially reaches beyond the girls\' first high school year, but with this being seven years old now, at the time of the review, I wouldn\'t be surprised if the idea of continuing the story was nixed.  (9/10)Characters: There\'s a nice blend of characters here, but I feel like they really held back on a few of them.  Haruka doesn\'t have a ton to her character on the surface, but there are interesting plot points here.  As mentioned before, she did feel like she was alone when she started middle school - and most of her life, as she doesn\'t have any siblings.  However, she met Yuu and she feels like her whole world opened up.  This is great to see because it allowed her to be way more open.  I really like the angle they went about it, and it really explains why she\'s in love with Yuu.  As far as character progression goes, she does take a bit of a hit here because you probably want to see more growth.  However, I\'d argue that multiple characters didn\'t really grow in the series... which I actually didn\'t mind terribly here.  Yuu seems to be a little more outgoing than Haruka, but she\'s generally the more laid back person of the pair.  Her approach to a lot of situations feels somewhat messy and she\'s not great at focusing on certain situations, but Haruka does keep her in check.  Yuu seems to be the more reluctant of the two to officially date, but she clearly knows what she wants from Haruka.Shizuku & Kotone are two of Haruka and Yuu\'s classmates that we aren\'t told much about at the start.  The series does dedicate an episode to them, which was nice to see because they are interesting characters with interesting backstories.  Shizuku seems pretty reserved in her personality.  She is the one of the six girls who did not come from the same middle school as one of the other cast members so she does start the series off to be somewhat distance, but warms up pretty quickly.  Kotone\'s way more outgoing and I would have liked to learn more about her than what is simply said by other characters.  Yuzu & Kaede got as much screen time as the previous two characters, but their inclusion here feels lost in the mix.  They just don\'t feel like they have a spot here, other than two more characters in the group - followers of sorts.  I wish they dedicated an episode for them too, because I found myself not really caring much about them.Mitsuki gets introduced a few episodes in and is Yuu\'s sister.  She feels almost like a carbon copy of Yuu, so their approach to her character felt somewhat lazy.  She has the same interests and goes apart from likely being a better student, doesn\'t really separate herself from Yuu a whole lot.  She tries to be a ""motherly"" figure, more than a sisterly figure, so I suppose she had that going for her.  She does show some real character progression though, unlike a lot of the main cast members.  I understand why her inclusion in this series made sense, but I didn\'t much care for her.This might be one of few romance anime where I can excuse the lack of character progression, just a bit.  They clearly wanted to focus more us learning about the main cast (and Mitsuki), but I wish they followed through on Yuzu & Kaede, just a little bit more.  (7/10)Art: Sakura Trick has an art style that differs from most other anime I\'ve watched.  The characters pop a lot off the backgrounds and they like to blur out other random characters / backgrounds to show that the girls are kind of in their own world.  Another thing they did a lot is represent everyone with a plant / fruit in quick time, likely for the furthering ""cute"" effects that they like to keep to.  Honestly, this all worked really well for me.  It keeps the tone of the series well defined.  The drawback is that if you don\'t like this sort of this much, you\'ll probably be turned off by this series in a hurry.  It\'s not for everyone. (8/10)Sound: Similarity to the art, the sound is very light and tries to keep the very ""cute"" atmosphere.  It works well, for the most part.  The OP and ED are good matches here, even if I didn\'t much care for the songs themselves.  Like all Japanese VAs, I thought it was pretty well done.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: The series as a whole was pretty solid.  It didn\'t do a ton to say it was exceptional, but the constant cute tone kept things very light, without getting annoying.  If you\'re a few episodes in and you don\'t like, I don\'t really advise watching more, simply because you kind of know what you\'re getting after a few episodes.

The genuine teenage concerns of love, unrequited love, school not lasting forever and parental expectations re arranged marriage are dealt with in a very rose-tinted and simple...way, which still puts this series well over dramas that contrive angst, erase the gays or abuse women for fun.

Nothing could ever emulate the pain and disdain I felt watching it for the first time. My hatred is so storng that I'd even consider this to be my least favorite anime of all time. Yet, the other day I felt compelled to rewatch this anime. Whether it be out of masochism, wanting to look at this show objectively, or a mix of both, I decided that it was a good idea. I wasn't too...sure what I was looking for, but I can say, after rewatching, that it isn't as bad as I first made it out to be. However, the animosity I feel towards it still burns deeply.Sakura Trick follows our main couple Haruka Takayama and Yuu Sonda who have just entered highschool together. Feeling like their friendship is weakening, they decide to share a kiss together in order to create a special bond between them. This is essentially the only romantic development Haruka and Yuu get. Sakura Trick only gives a vague reason why they might like each other and they roll with it for the entire anime. Their romance feels very shallow and doesn't really go anywhere. I'm pretty sure the only reason the romance was there was to have an excuse to have two girls kiss. Sakura Trick definitely delivers, but boy does it deliver way too much. While kissing is normal thing to do in any romantic relationship, Sakura Trick does it way much. Every episode sees our main couple kissing at least twice or more. In fact they kiss over 50 times throughout the entire show. This amount of kissing is frankly ridiculous and is just there for the sole reason of fanservice. A kiss is normally a sign of affection and love however, when its done to much it just becomes obnoxious. Every episode finds some contrived excuse to see them kiss and it got really old really quick. Its unusual how unsatisfying Sakura Trick makes kissing feel. Usually, a kiss scene is one of the most impactful or tantalizing moments in almost any romance. Sakura Tricks shows us that if you do it too much it ends up not achieving its purpose. It killed any remote form of excitement I could've had knowing that these two were gonna end up kissing just because.To be fair with Sakura Trick, the entire series isn't just about two girls kissing. Most of this anime is pretty similar to your average cute girls doing cute things show. Each episode is split into two parts, with each focusing on a different event or joke. It consists of the girl's school life and some of their exploits outside of school. I would describe this part as being inoffensive. The jokes are decently funny, but nothing really stands out as particularly hilarious. They do many of things that you'd expect, like prepare for a school festival or going swimming. If you seen any cute girls doing cute thing show then you are familiar with the things this show will cover.Now lets talk about the characters, starting with the main couple. Haruka is up first and I have a couple problems with her. Haruka is best described as being obsessive, jealous and extremely gay. Most of the jokes revolving around her are imagining being with Yuu, being distressed when she's not in her general area or fantasizing about other girls. She was kinda entertaining at first, but a lot of her jokes are basically the same. She never changes and quickly becomes annoying. Yuu is no better. She's stupid, dense and needy. She actively fuels Haruka's jealousy, seemingly on purpose. She often ditches Haruka and even shows preference for the other girls of the cast. She's so frustratingly dense that I wondered whether or not Yuu even liked Haruka. She quickly becomes an annoyance and isn't fun to watch at all. Their interactions with each other are also frustrating. Most of it consists of one of them whining to the other until they get what they want. I can't deny that it might of been cute to have a needy couple. However, it is so overplayed that instead of being cute it becomes annoying instead. Most of the time they are together one of them was whining so it was hard to put up with them. Their relationship is also static and doesn't go anywhere. Despite being a romance, Sakura Trick never properly develops their relationship. From start to end they feel like the exact same couple. Nothing that might change their view point of their relationship ever comes up and always was just a matter of loving one another because they loved each other. They do try to force in some development towards the end, but the end result is just admitting that they love each other(which was apparent considering how many times they kissed).While the main couple might be obnoxious and a real pain to watch, the other characters are a lot better. Sakura Trick actually does have another romance in it, between Kotone Noda and Shizuku Minami. Individually, they were entertaining. Kotone's energy definitely brought some life into the jokes and even had some funny lines. Shizuku on the other hand might not talk much, but she does have some cute scenes. Their relationship is also far better that the main one. Unlike Haruka's and Yuu's, Kotone's and Shizuku's is cute and well developed. Despite their contrasting personalities, they seemed very close and felt like they had a legitimate bond. It was pretty cute see them together and most of their interaction were pretty fun. They even get some development and face some conflicts that might change their relationship. That being said, their relationship is sadly underdeveloped. Their relationship doesn't get much time to actually flourish and its mostly a side plot. It kinda sucks because it seemed far more interesting than Haruka and Yuu's relationship.Another likable character was Yuu's sister Mitsuki, who has a crush on Haruka. Despite being the student counsel president Mitsuki was often shown to be awkward and clumsy. She a lot of cute scenes where she gets flustered after thinking about her crush or just doing things that only a klutz would do. She was entertaining just because she was cute and is fortunately given a good amount of screen time. While her cuteness is a upside, a minor problems with her involves her crush for Haruka. For the most her crush for Haruka is mostly just a joke however, they do try to establish a semi-serious love triangle and it doesn't work. Mitsuki isn't given a reason why she likes Haruka, until the very end. This is a problem because this love triangle is the source of the only conflict this show has and without a reason it just fails to be a good love triangle where she has any chance. That being said the love triangle isn't a huge part of the show, so its somewhat forgivable.The other characters are mostly forgettable. They don't do anything particularly interesting and exist just to tell some jokes. Their presence  neither hinders nor helps the show in any significant way. Kaede does have some funny lines but that's really about it. The rest of the cast are all side characters and get very minimal development, which is fine.One of the problems I want to expand on is Sakura Trick's fanservice, specifically its kiss scenes. I already mentioned the excessive kissing in this anime. While the amount of kiss scenes itself is already a problem, another problem I have with them is how they're presented. I'd definitely describe Sakura Trick as a cute moe show however, the kiss scenes might suggest otherwise. Plenty of kiss scenes had a lot of tonguing and moaning. It was kinda uncomfortable to watch these scenes and they felt more at home with an ecchi or even hentai series(I swear some of the lines fit right into one). This is definitely more of a personal complaint, as I don't think scenes that feel extremely sexual fit into a cutesy show such as this. The contrast was jarring and uncomfortable for me. While it also has other forms of fanservice, they more acceptable to me (like a swimsuit episode or random cuts to some of the girl's breasts). For the most part I don't mind these in cute shows as they aren't that sexual and comparatively innocent.I actually really like the art style of Sakura Trick. It has a very pleasant, cutesy style that I enjoy and most of the characters also looked really cute. The animation was also interesting. Some of the scenes were kinda structured like something you'd see from a Shaft show, with simplistic backgrounds. As I am a huge fan of Shaft it was nice to see. The music was also decent and the OP is kinda catchy.You might be reading this review and wonder why I feel such hatred to this show, especially considering that I actually like some of things this show does. My hatred stems from the first time I watched this series and how I my mindset back then. I actually wasn't all into yuri at first, in fact I had mostly avoided it. After hearing about how notoriously sexual yaoi was I just assumed for yuri. After sucking up, I decided to pick a yuri to watch and I chose Sakura Trick. After watching, it validated all my fears for the genre and I swore off it for months. So I really don't hate Sakura Trick for the content itself, but mostly for making me think poorly of a genre that I now enjoy. So is Sakura Trick the worse thing ever made? No, I've definitely watched worse. Do I still hate it? Yes I do. Do I recommend that you watch Sakura Trick? No there are far better yuri series out there(unless you really want to see two girls kiss a lot).Thanks for Reading!My Ratings:Story 4/10Character 5/10Art 8/10Sound 6/10Personal Enjoyment 1/10Overall 4/10 sure what I was looking for, but I can say, after rewatching, that it isn't as bad as I first made it out to be.

It's that kind of a show that doesn't try to have an interesting, original story, or great writing, or something that would make you use your brain a bit more, it's the exact opposite. It's one of the shows that is based on fan-service, moe, and cliches that appeal to the major part of the audience. In my opinion, there are two goals shows like these are trying to accomplish. One - make theviewer feel good, two - make money, attract as much viewers as possible by providing them straight-forward,...easily-digestible plot and writing, with all of the 'moe' traits mentioned above, and nothing more. Seems like these types of shows are getting more and more popular nowdays, which is a result of modern media consumerism, but that's a topic for another article.But all of that is fine. I was fully aware of this when I started watching this anime. I wanted to turn my brain off, I wanted to get that quick quilty pleasure from watching idealised girls in a yuri relationship, I wanted to watch something that would entertain me in a cheap way, I can enjoy shows like these. The problem is, this anime failed even at doing that. It's fucking boring.The writing even at this level is incredibly bad. The plot consists of things that you've seen a million times before that are guaranteed to work, like studying sessions, exclusive rooftop access, pool cleaning, etc.. but this anime failed at making them entertaining. The dialogues are stupid (again, even when taking into account what kind of show this is) completely irritating, they feel like they don't have any meaning or goal. Those stupid animation quirks are overused to shit, combined with the dumb dialogue and I'm actually having trouble watching it because it causes me so much discomfort. I feel like that thing with the flowers representing character interaction that pops up for like 2 frames without a chance of actually realizing what it represents is slapped between every third shot, and its fucking bad. The only time dialogue is somehow relevant is on kissing scenes, but they just ended up using the same formula for their intimate talk and it becomes annoying. It's pretty obvious that the kissing scenes are the main driver and behind this show, the ultimate trump card for the viewer, and it shows. There is a lot of them. The thing is, the huge contrast between the stupid brainless character behaviour, and the seduction thats going on while they're kissing, makes it feel completely out of place. Characters are a bit below average for a show like this. We've got the cheerful girl with short/playful hair, then the bit more reserved (but not too much) girl with longer/boring hair and big tits, one of them has an older sister with an overprotective complex. Then we have the supporting characters - the girl who is a part of the student council, the loli girl with all of her typical loli traits, and I'm not even going to continue because I'm sure y'all can guess what the rest of the characters are like (I don't remember a single name). The problem with the characters for anime like this is the lack of defining traits, I feel like apart from their looks and personality, there is absolutely nothing I can say about them. No interests, no nothing. Well, we know that the most important aspects of this anime are fucked, one thing that could potentionally make this anime 5 times more enjoyable for me remains - the art/animation. And it's dogshit. I hate it. It's way too simple for trying to display a real world. It works for certain shows with more surreal ake on the world, but not this one. Characters lack any detail as well. The little animation that exists (usually kissing scenes) looks bad. It just doesn't work, and I don't think I came across one shot that looked aestethically pleasing. Can't say anything about the sound, I had it turned off.This anime is a failure. I'm having trouble following the show, either because the writing is terrible, there are flowers jumping around on my screen, I'm falling asleep or my thoughts are trailing off because this shit is boring - the most important trait that any media should avoid.(don't take me so seriously) easily-digestible plot and writing, with all of the 'moe' traits mentioned above, and nothing more.

I am not someone used to Yuri but I thought I'd start with Sakura Twist because people talk about it enough to do say why not start with it. This is my second time watching this as the first time I got to episode 1 or 2 like Re-kan and gave up but I loved Re-kan on my second attempt and finished it so thought I'd give this...a second chance. Then Citrus, Bloom Into You or something else later like I have certain Fujoshi, Fudanshi or other types of shows with such characters and themes.The animation is fine, it does what it needs to. The dialogue can be very awkward or very straight forward. Almost like how the student council president feels of why are they acting weirdly but as the viewer than a character but they do have the thoughts of the viewer whether intentional or because it is weird as a sibling or others going why are they acting that way with everyone outside their bubble questioning things as they do.To me for only episodes 1-6 so far (finished it by now and still found it not that much better, it's good fine moments but I don't remember many) it's pretty alright I was bored for certain scenes having seen so many slice of life or cute girls doing cute things shows it was on the lower scale of excitement for me compared to even the simplest/basic ones of those with pretty standard scenes, some parts with the imagining was a enough to keep watching but I wasn't actively interested to see it even if watching it further than I did before.The main characters are fine but not all are engaging I liked Yuzu and Kaede the most (the other couple also are more exciting then two main characters) though not just because they are the only ones that don't kiss either and even with what they are given of moments with the other characters. The focus on kissing is fine a bit too much I found and I can understand couples may do that and it's fairly believable I guess even if exaggerated or like they have to but it is a bit overly done at times to be annoying and me not caring.Like a 'see they like each other's as a reminder than anything is how it felt while other romance anime don't have this. I'll know more with other Yuri and better understand again this is my first after all and will make my way to others like Citrus, Bloom Into You and more. I'm used to undertones of Yuri though not Shoujo-Ai or Yuri straight up so it is new to me. If others do this or just Sakura Twist only then sure.That and compared to romance shows even where they don't unless like maybe 1 scene whether the 'hey get out it's private or embarrassing' type or they actually can and no one is bothering the.. To me it's been alright but not as engaging compared to other cute girls doing cute things shows as I do enjoy a fair few but the show does a fine job of they kiss, they are in situations that are fine day to day, whatever they imagination, can be a bit (I have to be close to you or I'll explode if I don't touch your lips as if it's required like the saliva in Mysterious Girlfriend X even though it isn't that story reason even for how particular that series was with it) and talk about whatever the episode has of topics.Most are pretty standard for slice of life at least to me can't say for Yuri series standards though but to me episode 6 specifically the second half got me to pay attention because of what it does. Nothing amazing but made it engaging to me and for Festival episodes even which I don't mind but seen one seen them all you'd think.To me episode 6 is interesting because while the animation is pretty alright and the imagination moments are enjoyable the moments in ep6 made me go 'oh they are giving the characters more than to talk about with backstory for side characters, pointing out they get ignored all the time for the girl they want to kiss all the time (making me favour Yuzu and Kaede more as characters than the other two couples because while they don't kiss or are a couple they same and do things then have filler moments).The backstories were fine, the hair disintergrating was funny/a surprise of animation I did not expect, like it was something from another show. The part that really surprised me was when Yuzu says she hated the festival food. I mean sure it probably doesn't taste great and not all students will be but I was surprised as anime always makes something sound amazing.Sure you have your characters that can't cook and poison it but otherwise they always make it that it's something good they are eating even the most mundane things the flavour of chips would be so good even if it's just a simple thing. A minor detail but something that surprised me with.To me it's the type of episode that feels like an OVA different from the manga following, that 1 6th or whichever episode that has the beach, festival or whatever original idea as filler the studio makes in the middle or at the end and it shows because it was weirdly engaging for the first half to be what it was and the second half to be the original moments.Episode 6 was just a stand out, minor details but it felt like a 'yeah it's doing the usual to' wait what the animation there was not what I expected, they are self aware or point out they ditch Yuzu all the time, what 180 did I land into with this second half. I can see whether those elements or the lack of kissing to other examples as to why episode 6 is their favourite for sure. A second half of n episode doesn't sell you on a show but still it's appreciated the staff went to the effort I like when they get the universe and go out of their way to use it's structure in a particular way it's great to see.I'll edit this review accordingly with whether other episodes offer more or are just as flat/standard but still what a 180.

A minor detail but something that surprised me with.To me it's the type of episode that feels like an OVA different from the manga following, that 1 6th or whichever episode that has the beach, festival or whatever original idea as filler the studio makes in the middle or at the end and it shows because it was weirdly engaging for the first half to be what it was and the second half to be the original moments.Episode 6 was just a stand out, minor details but it felt like a 'yeah it's doing the usual to' wait what the animation there was not what I expected, they are self aware or point out they ditch Yuzu all the time, what 180 did I land into with this second half. I can see whether those elements or the lack of kissing to other examples as to why episode 6 is their favourite for sure. A second half of n episode doesn't sell you on a show but still it's appreciated the staff went to the effort I like when they get the universe and go out of their way to use it's structure in a particular way it's great to see.I'll edit this review accordingly with whether other episodes offer more or are just as flat/standard but still what a 180.

Kyuuketsuhime Miyu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1384/Kyuuketsuhime_Miyu,"['this is a classic 1988 anime in the fact that it has a great story, great characters, but bad voice acting. Miyu is a fascinating character tipe and has been underrated. i found the VHS for all four episodes in a Little miscellaneous store that was about to shut down and i payed $6 for it. If i had know that i would like it so much then i probably would have payed the man more. If you like classic anime and also are a big vampire fan than this is the perfect anime for you....Vampire Princess Miyu is so well done you forget about the bad voice overs and focus completely on the plot. Vampire Princess Miyu is so well done you forget about the bad voice overs and focus completely on the plot.', ""Miyu is a Guardian, a vampire whose destiny is to hunt down stray shinma (demons, shapeshifters, vampires) and send them back into the darkness from whence they originated. Unlike the TV Series, the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA has a secondary lead character in Spiritualist Himiko. Himiko is under the impression that Miyu has something to do with vampiric victims, and follows her around trying to find out what is going on and to get proof.The OVA's strength is that the stories are much more interesting than most of the ones in the TV series. There are only 4 episodes and each is unique. The weakness...is it tends to be like X-Files, here is the mystery of the week and the shinma/monster of the week. It gets predictably boring after a while, but luckily the short 4 episode length managed to keep it from being too boring or predictable. If there were more background or an overarching plot it would have scored higher. is it tends to be like X-Files, here is the mystery of the week and the shinma/monster of the week.

Most people would naturally write off shows like these popping up around this time as a sort of generic, simplistic garbage. I can see why though, one does not need to search far to reinforce the pure late 80\'s cheese we all know. Yet Vampire Princess Miyu does stand out among many shows and for good reason. While the ever growing theme of vampires have been done over and over again, this anime offers a unique approach to the gothic and vampire aesthetic. Instead of just...shooting for a straight typical vampire story, it offers a lot of difference in terms of storyline and execution. It tells a short tale of a girl named Miyu, whose destiny is to banish demons called Shinma and return them to the land of the dark. She is then pursued by a strange woman who desperately wants to find out about her origin. Already, we have a very unique and engaging plotline. Sadly, despite it\'s very short length, it becomes incredibly repetitive very fast. Each episode is told from the perspective of the woman who is hunting after Miyu, trying to stop her from taking innocent human lives. It follows an incredibly repetitive and formulaic approach to storytelling, which makes for in turn, very predictable outcomes. Of course, I could not also go without mentioning the main thing that never fails to drag down old school anime: the voice acting. I felt as though if I had watched the subbed instead, I would have gotten a lot more enjoyment out of the show itself. The incredibly laughable and non-emotional dialogue between characters is really what dragged it down so much, but I suppose it\'s  something that was to be expected.Yet, like with all late 80\'s shows, I just love the ""rough"" look of everything. The animation is nothing short of very well down. The mysterious demons and environments are incredibly detailed and add a very great atmosphere. The action sequences, while very few, definetly keep you enthralled. As for the characters themselves, there was a good number of development going on. It delved into all of the main character\'s back stories without feeling incredibly forced and overdone. It gave a very good insight on each of the three involved. Despite all of this, the very short length, awful voice acting, and very formulaic episodes are what makes it just satisfactory, rather than anything noteworthy. However, the fact that this short little OVA will never see the light of day for most people, it is really worth your time to check out, as it won\'t take anymore than 2 hours.

A very unique and awesome approach to vampire storylines and great use of visuals and atmosphere.', ""Welcome back, my friends, to horror anime month. This week we'll be looking at an OVA about a vampire. After last week I needed something with a strong and well developed female character who isn't sexualised, so we're looking at Vampire Princess Miyu. Vampire Princess Miyu originated as a manga by a married couple: Hirano Toshiki and Kakinouchi Narumi. You may recognise him as the director of Magic Knight Rayearth, Devilman Lady and many others. Her works are quite a bit more obscure so if you've heard of her it's probably going to be because of this or Yakushiji Ryoko no Kaiki Jikenbo, which she...did the illustrations for. Vampire Princess Miyu has two adaptations, an OVA from the late 80s and a TV series from nearly a decade later. I might get to the TV series at some point, but right now let's look at the OVA.There's not a major over-arching story for this. Basically, each of the episodes tells a different story. The first begins with a spiritualist named Himiko. She's called in to investigate a young girl who's been asleep for months. A condition that her parents believe is caused by possession. When she investigates she discovers that women have been being found with all the blood drained from their bodies. She's attacked in the dead of night by a swift moving robed figure and finds herself rescued by a girl in a kimono, a girl who feeds on blood and knows more than she'll reveal. Don't worry, I'm not going to do that for all four episodes. One thing I can say to the OVA's credit is that it has some really good suspense, a lot of which is created through mysteries. In the first episode you're left wondering what exactly is attacking people and what its connection to Miyu is or even if there is any. Every episode has a mystery like that, except for the last which answers a mystery that's been building for the entire OVA. The only real downside is the second episode which isn't nearly as suspenseful or interesting as the rest. A lot of the issue is that its mystery has an obvious solution virtually from the beginning. It's not really scary, but it does have some legitimately creepy moments so it's doing better with the horror aspect than everything I've reviewed so far this month.There are really only three characters worth mentioning in this. Miyu, Larva and Himiko. The other characters show up for one episode or part of an episode. A few of them do get developed, but most just serve a very specific purpose and never get actual development. As for our three major characters, Miyu is fascinating. A lot of the details about her are left unsaid, but very effectively illustrated. She's a multi-faceted character who's neither a paragon of virtue nor a blood sucking monster. She has a great deal of verisimilitude. Larva is less developed. He's a very mysterious character with motivations that are touched on a bit, but not much. He's mostly defined by his protectiveness of Miyu.  Himiko is another interesting character. She wants to find and stop Miyu, but frequently ends up on the same side as her. She's the most relatable character since she's an ordinary human who's trying to make the most of extraordinary circumstances. So there's a lot of character depth for these three. Especially when you factor in the number of episodes.The art is reminiscent of 3x3 Eyes. The character designs use the same basic style and both feature very stylized and interesting supernatural elements. Vampire Princess Miyu has very atmospheric art. The backgrounds, the character movements, the entire aesthetic really, helps with the sense of suspense. That isn't to say that it's perfect. There are some scenes where the characters mouths aren't in sync with their dialogue but that's a minor complaint. The biggest art issue is that the action scenes aren't particularly intense. They tend to end pretty quickly. Although I'm not going to hold it against the series too much because it does use that time effectively to build suspense and develop the characters.The voice acting is pretty well done. I really like Watanabe Naoko's performance as Miyu. The laugh especially is just perfect. Which is good since you hear it quite a bit. Koyama Mami doesn't do as well in her role as Himiko, but she still does a good job. Shiozawa Kaneto only gets a few lines, but he gives a good performance. The music in this is amazing. It works with the art to establish and maintain a really strong atmosphere. Kudos there.The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's really nothing homoerotic here.My final rating for the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA is a 7.6/10. The stories have good suspense. The characters are well developed and interesting. The atmosphere, from a combination of the art and sound, is amazing. If there's one thing that holds it back it's the second episode and even it's okay. If you like 3x3 eyes or suspense in general you'll probably enjoy this too. did the illustrations for.

The narrative is so rich it could branch out and nest other narratives within the main plot, but there isn\'t enough awareness and craftsmanship in the execution to reach those higher levels, but we are content.What I love about this story, as I mentioned in my other comment on the TV edition, is the gentle and eloquent situating of sadness, both in the images and the stories within, and it\'s crucial to mention that the ""visual poetry"" is of higher caliber on the OVA, while in the TV edition the...""narrative poetry"" is far more prevalent. In this version, we are missing an ingredient most important, that is the Western shinma and their connection to Larva, only a brief and sketchy appearance of one in the third episode, unlike the memory embossing and haunting passages we have of them in the TV edition (that blonde girl with a conch on the flying sea ship). On the other hand, the traditional calligraphy role is far more better here, giving some of the most chilling and almost dancing-like performance of fighting scenes, resembling the movement of brush and paper cutting, emphasizing the Kabuki reference, it\'s almost talismanic and ceremonial at one point. The only parts of the narrative here that I can applaud are the ones in the first and second episodes, I can contemplate on such stories and images all day.I\'m quite aware that not many see what I\'m seeing in this anime, and despite the technical inconsistency here and there; I guarantee it\'s worthy of your time to meditate on these ephemeral streams of blood, ink and tears, try giving it a chance. I\'m crossing my fingers that the original manga will be the one nearing or attaining perfection. ""narrative poetry"" is far more prevalent.

As each decade of anime has its strengths and weaknesses, this OVA stands as a quintessential representative of the 80s, with all its ups and downs. While bearing this identity of the time in which it was made, it manages to tell a rich, action-packed story that remains engaging to this day. Indeed, it remains superior to the full-length anime it would receive nearly a decade later, which would dilute the personality of Miyu and the general mystique of the OVA. This stands as a testament to the quality of the...original, which I will review here. Right off the bat, the story is my favorite aspect of this show. It builds an intricate world without going into laborious detail, which nonetheless obeys certain rules and keeps everything in relative context. It deftly unfolds across its 4 episodes, revealing things at the perfect moment for story progression and viewer satisfaction. As Himiko unravels the mystery of Miyu, the viewer is taken along each step of the journey, resulting in pitched battles and confrontations with unique challenges, each one distinct from the last. Speaking of which, the art is quintessentially 80s. That is to say, it features painstakingly detailed backgrounds, electric fight scenes, and a tactile sense of presence, all the while suffering from noticeable production artifacts and subpar facial animation . Characters here suffer from what I term the 'dreaded mask', a fairly common problem in anime which appears throughout its history, where character's faces often fail to portray sufficient emotion, despite its obvious presence in a given scene. However, the best aspect of the art has to be the design of the Shinma, who appear visually striking and well-designed throughout. The sound design is competent, with the music being a good, if sometimes cheesy, accompaniment. The voice acting and sounds of life meet the standards of the time in which they were made, but the music elevates the whole thing and makes for a more engaging experience. The work of Kenji Kawai, his style shines through in spades, and is reminiscent of the work he would later do for Higurashi. While it does date this show quite a bit, with heavy synthesizer and motifs common at the time, the fact it dates it doesn't really detract from the experience. As I said before, it elevates it, and lends the show a certain aesthetic quality that is unique to itself. The characters are tailor-made for the world in which they inhabit, embodying that 80s stylistic flare coupled with an outlook on life which is nuanced in the face of unknown horrors. My favorite characters have to be Miyu and Himiko, which may be expected given that they receive the vast majority of screentime. Their interplay lends a lot of interest to the OVA and provides a driving force which moves the story along. At first, I didn't really like Miyu's character, but as she develops she becomes a more multifaceted, tragic character, and is as a result far more interesting by the end.

As an...introduction to Miyu’s premise, this OVA does a solid job exploring our female lead’s exploits and origins within its 4-episode runtime. The first two episodes serve to explore Miyu’s encounters with enemy Shinma, while the later two explore elements of her character that include her bond with Larva and her past before hunting enemy Shinma. The series carries a haunting and bittersweet tone throughout its run to show how dark Miyu’s world is when dealing with her duties and those who become involved with the world of the Shinma, allowing the series to carry an effective sense of horror as it explores more of Miyu’s world. The animation does an effective job at conveying Miyu’s setting and characters with nice animated details and muted colors to compliment the anime’s tone. Backgrounds are a bit on the sketchy side, but the OVA does an effective job at depicting its occasional bits of action that demonstrate Miyu’s power and the dark nature of the Shinma she confronts.The OVA does have its faults. Himiko’s character contributes little to the series as she mainly exists as a human observer of Miyu’s actions, is exclusive only to this OVA from what I gather as she never appears in the 1990s TV anime adaptation that later came out, and can be a bit grating with her protests at challenging Miyu. Plus as this series mainly exists to promote its manga source material, the storytelling within Vampire Princess Miyu is largely self-contained in each of its episodes and doesn’t give viewers much to go back to, which could limit its rewatchability with some fans wanting a longer series run given Miyu’s premise.Still if you are a fan of old-school anime and craving horror with your viewing, Vampire Princess Miyu offers solid horror and storytelling with dabbling into Miyu’s exploits dealing with enemy Shinma and her origin story. introduction to Miyu’s premise, this OVA does a solid job exploring our female lead’s exploits and origins within its 4-episode runtime.

As good as the story and characters are, you just know you\'re watching something that\'s 31 years old now- and just like how movies from back then have that look about them, so the cracks are starting to show in Vampire Princess Miyu.I love Miyu herself- a vigilante vampire princess is just something that sounds...amazing, and she\'s obviously that shade of gray between the evil Shinma and humanity- but Himiko\'s black-and-white mentality just gets to be frustrating, sometimes.  I understand that she\'s dealing with the human side of things, but you\'d think maybe she could just hear Miku out once or twice- and maybe the hint that she hasn\'t gone on a blood-fueled killing spree would convince her...?But the animation and sound have just not aged well, if at all.  I want to like this.  But it needs a remaster, and a re-animation very, VERY badly. The voices aren\'t clear, the animation just looks aged and terrible compared to other titles, and while I do suggest you watch this once, because it deserves at least a single watch, you won\'t want to give it more than that.Others have called it ""Vampire X-Files"", and I agree- but seeing as how it\'s four episodes long, well, it\'s one decent and three crappy episodes of Vampire X-Files.  It\'s good for a bite-sized binge if you want- you could binge it in an afternoon in less than two hours.Just because it\'s a classic doesn\'t mean it\'s worth watching more than once. amazing, and she\'s obviously that shade of gray between the evil Shinma and humanity- but Himiko\'s black-and-white mentality just gets to be frustrating, sometimes.

The voices aren\'t clear, the animation just looks aged and terrible compared to other titles, and while I do suggest you watch this once, because it deserves at least a single watch, you won\'t want to give it more than that.Others have called it ""Vampire X-Files"", and I agree- but seeing as how it\'s four episodes long, well, it\'s one decent and three crappy episodes of Vampire X-Files.  It\'s good for a bite-sized binge if you want- you could binge it in an afternoon in less than two hours.Just because it\'s a classic doesn\'t mean it\'s worth watching more than once.', 'Kyuuketsuhime Miyu is an OVA series that features a compelling, unpredictable plot and interesting characters all shrouded in a cloak of mystery. The animation is of high quality, but the excessive panning and zooming techniques undermine the talent of the animators, resulting in missed opportunities for dynamic scenes. The main character is complex and well-written, contributing to the series’ appeal and making her a standout character. However, while the plot is engaging and builds up suspense, it remains unresolved, adding to the air of mystery but leaving the viewer feeling dissatisfied and yearning for a more conclusive ending. Ultimately, Kyuuketsuhime Miyu is a peculiar series...that meets expectations in all aspects but fails to truly distinguish itself, ending up as a competent but forgettable production. that meets expectations in all aspects but fails to truly distinguish itself, ending up as a competent but forgettable production.', 'Vampire Princess Miyu (the 1988 OVA) is a masterpiece of gothic horror. It is the legendary ""Dracula anime"" that you have been waiting your whole life to see, without so much as knowing that it ever existed. If all you\'re looking for is a quick recommendation, then you have my blessing to go and watch it right now; I have already given this OVA my highest possible endorsement, so you can stop reading here and thank me later. Your time is sacred, and so too is beautiful artwork. If you are looking for a more thorough introduction, read on.Vampire Princess Miyu (the franchise) is also...one of my favorite IPs of all time. Without spending too much time discussing the specifics of the OVA, I\'d like to explain a bit as to the matter of ""why"" that is, as well as express my strong feelings about the Miyu IP in a more general sort of way. This will require discussing both this OVA and the 1997 revival TV anime series, which I will do in an entirely spoiler-free way and at no great depth. To that end, this may read a bit as a heartfelt history lesson, moreso than a review... At first. My hope is that you will eventually see some of what made/ makes this series appeal to me, decide on a watch order, and experience ""Miyu"" for yourself.And now, a brief history of ""Miyu in the West.""In the West, knowledge of Vampire Princess Miyu (the franchise) would have mostly been confined to an older generation of otaku, who happened to be very active during the dog-days of VHS hunting... The era when all anime were considered ""obscure,"" by Western standards, and some happened to be less obscure than others. These individuals would have likely been between the ages of 15 and 30-something years old around the time of the OVA\'s release and, further still, likely also had some direct or indirect connection to Japan, through which they were able to source their anime. That is already a very exclusive group of people, and the problem only gets worse as time goes on... I shall continue. While I was not alive at that time, going off of the various second-hand accounts that I\'ve obtained through former hardsubbers, I have developed the understanding that, while Vampire Princess Miyu (the OVA) was \'known of\' amongst Western otaku, it was still a fairly obscure IP at that time. This seems to have been a result of being buried by other anime which were popular at that time... Namely, Maison Ikkoku, Kimagure Orange Road, Urusei Yatsura, etc... as well as having the problem of needing to be translated, in order to be understood.In summary... In order to watch this OVA, in the West, at the time of its release, you first would have needed to:1 - Have been an active otaku VHS-hunter.2 - Have known that Vampire Princess Miyu (the OVA) exists. This process would usually involve either direct mention from another otaku, with some connection to Japan, or buying a physical Japanese-language catalogue and attempting to read it.3 - Have been actively hunting for the VHS.4 - Have successfully sourced the VHS, likely either from a college club, or else directly from Japan.5 - Have devised a way to consume the content. This could have involved knowing how to speak Japanese, getting a Japanese-speaking friend to translate it for you, obtaining a rare, hardsubbed VHS from an anime club, obtaining a synopsis write up and/ or consuming the anime without actually understanding any of its contents.Failing any of that... And you likely would have failed, somewhere along that chain... You would have to wait until 1996, when AnimEigo released a dubbed version of the OVA to VHS, and either buy it or rent it from your local video store (Ie: Blockbuster,) assuming it was locally available. This would have been the easier way to watch this OVA, by far, all the way up until AnimEigo released it as a DVD in 2001. If you missed that, then you probably would not be watching it until anime entered the fully digital age, sometime between \'07 & \'12... At which point, somebody would have likely uploaded it to an early streaming site.Even then, at this late stage, you most likely would not have known about the existence of ""Miyu"" (the OVA.) By this point, this OVA would have been over 20 years old, and a bygone phenomenon. Yes, there was a made-for-TV anime series, but this did little to draw attention towards the OVA, which pre-dated it by around ten years. Unless you were an extremely early MAL-user, or you were otherwise introduced to the OVA by some other friend, website, or happy accident, then there was only one other way to learn about it. This final way would have been to somehow catch the dubbed version of the 1997 revival TV anime series, enjoy it enough to care about the franchise, and eventually come to learn about its superior counterpart later in life, as a result of your dedication.Lo\' and behold, that is exactly what happened to me. I got my first taste of ""Miyu"" (the 1997 anime) as a teenager in the later 00\'s, via its release to Comcast\'s infamous \'DVR\' selection, not ever knowing that OVA existed until just recently. For those not familiar, Comcast would occasionally release anime titles to a dedicated subsection of their On-Demand video titles, called ""Anime On Demand"" or just ""Anime."" These titles often included that which was far beyond the pale of what your average kids would have been familiar with at that time, or been groomed to expect at their local video stores. You would often see titles with extremely dark themes released to this platform, without any warning whatsoever to the consumer. While by no means the worst offender, ""Miyu \'97"" was no exception to this pattern, and this is precisely what I liked about it as a teenager. The format of the ""Monster of the Week"" also worked well for a release to DVR, because anime releases to DVR came in batches, and were never consistent. In other words, you were very likely to be missing episodes, in between updates to the catalogue. Considering the format, that didn\'t matter so much, and it was okay by me at that time.I recently revisited that anime for the first time in fifteen years, rounding off the episodes I had never seen, and ultimately completing my rewatch just prior to watching this OVA. Half a lifetime had passed, in the time since I had last seen it... And yet, I was surprised to see how well most of the episodes held up over the years. While its visuals and the school setting are somewhat dated by today\'s standards, the 1997 anime boasts an utterly impressive soundtrack, excellent Japanese voice acting, an often-excellent episodic structure, and a unique aesthetic feel that has stuck with me all my life. The titular heroine, Miyu, is a complicated character, but mostly likeable and very unique. Her motivations are so unlike other heroines in anime, and that is what I find so fascinating about her. Without going into depth, Miyu can be called neither good nor evil. So marked are Miyu\'s and Reiha\'s actions throughout the duration of the \'97 anime, that I am forced to laugh any time that a mid-wit poseur claims Madoka Magica to be a """"""deconstruction"""""" of the magical girl genre, in any way whatsoever. Yes, it is true that, among the 26 episodes, there are a handful of stinkers. Episode 18 comes to mind, as does the very end of the series (which I appreciated, for what it was, but did find unintentionally funny at times.) Even those episodes were charmingly awkward and/ or funny, and were inoffensive in the grand scheme of things. But of course, the number one thing which makes Miyu \'97 so noteworthy-- and this does carry over to the OVA-- is that almost every episode, no matter how good or bad, hits you with an ending that absolutely slaps you in the face. Just watch episode 2 and tell me that I\'m wrong. Miyu \'97 may not be the bloodiest show that you will ever watch, but it will always deliver some of the coldest, most brutal scenarios and episode-endings that you will see put to anime. This brand of horror-factor is the main appeal of the franchise, as I see it, and thus I have elected to underline it here. You will be creeped out, and thrown off.Queue my contemporary introduction to this OVA, through MAL, and I have totally fallen in love. The OVA completely does away with all of the nonsense that the TV-anime did not need, and leaves you with only the undiluted essence of what makes ""Vampire Princess Miyu"" (the IP) so great. There is no more school setting, no Pikachu-esque mascot character, no convoluted re-writes of established source material, no episode padding, no occasionally-terrible artwork, and no bullsh!t. All four episodes are fantastic. This is a beautiful anime; the soundtrack is once again excellent, and may I just say that it really does show that the entire thing was drawn on cels. Best of all is that Miyu completely drops her TV-anime stoicism act for this OVA. Miyu is an evil little b!tch, and you will love every second of it. She is totally different from the Miyu in Miyu \'97, and that\'s an incredible thing to see once you have that context. The final product is easily a 9/10; maybe a solid 10, under weaker standards. The fact that this OVA not only scored lower than the TV anime series which it easily surpasses, and no higher than a 7 at the time of my writing this review... while crap like Freiren sits on top of the whole pile... is such a funny joke that I forgot to laugh.Now, the question is: Do you watch the OVA first, or the TV anime which succeeded it? Personally, I would elect to do as I did, and watch the TV anime first, assuming you have the time and interest to do so. Otherwise, just watch the OVA if you\'re short on time. If you can manage to get through the TV series first, however, you\'ll really appreciate both products more, both on an individual and a collective level. The most compelling reason to do this is because the TV anime does possess a slew of great episodes, but is also a flawed series. Trust me when I say that you will not want to miss \'97\'s best episodes, or its best ""mic-drop"" moments. I also appreciated  the creative process behind the \'97 anime much more in retrospect, after watching its source material unfold before me in real time. But you won\'t want to bother completing a 26-episode slog, if you watch the OVA first only to find yourself disappointed with what comes next. Either way, definitely watch the OVA no matter what, if for no other reason than the visuals. one of my favorite IPs of all time. Without spending too much time discussing the specifics of the OVA, I\'d like to explain a bit as to the matter of ""why"" that is, as well as express my strong feelings about the Miyu IP in a more general sort of way.

I really don’t get why her friend keeps trying to force Yumemi away from the Magical Kingdom and Munto, even when she herself was able to see it herself.

It frustrates me that they waited so long for it to actually start up.The animation stepped pretty far down from the original. Many of the wonderful character designs seem lack luster and bland. The 3D animation also doesn’t seem to fit and feels forced within it. It’s like they rushed to get this OVA out after the other. It’s really sad to because it had the potential to be pretty good.

Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33003/Mahou_Shoujo_Ikusei_Keikaku,"['This anime in 8 words: “Anticlimactic Magical Girl Death Game With Wasted Potential ”Yes, this is just another magical girl dark twist anime. Unfortunately, it\'s not that great of one either and here\'s why:This is what a series looks like when it tries to have emotional shock factor, but fails because it\'s only 12 episodes long and has too many characters. When characters die, most of the times you won\'t even care because there are too many of them and you don\'t ever know their backstory until the episode of their death. This series has a damsel in distress, innocent, naive main protagonist. There...are no moral messages to be gained from this anime and no overarching reasons for the events that happen. It’s, simply put, excessive “just because” death-game violence. However, I believe it\'s still worth watching if you like seeing violence and/or the death of magical girls.I want to note that I actually did enjoy watching the series for the most part, but this is from my unbiased perspective as a person who has seen a lot of anime. It will probably be a lot better to the people that haven\'t seen as many anime.This being a thriller, you should go into series expecting there to be intense, edgy battles and deaths. Most of the characters could have been expanded upon, but weren\'t, and that largely took away from the potential of the series. I honestly believed that it started off with the potential to be outstanding, but it quickly went downhill once the death game began. The great characters started dying off too quickly without me building any attachment to them. The main protagonist “Snow White” was excessively naive and innocent throughout the whole anime. Consequently, I did not enjoy almost any time she got screentime after the first few episodes because every side-character was significantly more interesting than her.Story: 4/10The basic premise of the story is that ordinary people were selected to become magical girls while playing a magical girl phone game. They are then forced into a death game where the magical girl with the least amount of ""candies"" at the end of the week dies. They initially gained these candies by performing acts of goodness, but Fav (the Kyubey knockoff) continuously adds in new elements that push some of the magical girls to kill each other instead. This is definitely not a ""psychological"" series; you can tell as it presents itself in the cliche, archetypal, non-unique characters. Taking that into consideration, I feel that the writers tried, but failed, to portray powerful concepts like friendship, desperation, loss, and psychological twists. This is largely because they introduced these archetype characters with amazing potential, but then got rid of them just as fast. Unfortunately, the fast pacing and the anticlimactic ending left me with feelings of wasted potential as I finished.Art: 7/10The art was nothing outstanding, but pretty good. There wasn’t anything particularly unique about it. I enjoyed the battle scenes and the fluidity of the animation. The characters were a bit too colorful and cute for me personally, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The brightness of the characters in combination with the dark background made the series feel less dark and more lighthearted.Sound: 6/10Non-unique, average, unmemorable ost. Although, the ending theme was relatively nice. Both the opening and the ending didn’t really suit the anime. Music was a bit too lighthearted for what was happening.Characters:4/10As I mentioned before, most of the characters die soon after they’re introduced. I liked most of them because of their diverse personalities, but I don\'t think you will be getting any new favorite characters out of this anime. If this anime was a real magical girl series with the same characters and similar deaths, I feel that it would have been significantly better. Most of the characters had great potential for development, but I could not form any attachments to any of them because of their short screen time and lack of backstories until the moment before their death. It was such a waste… *shakes head*Enjoyment: 6.5/10All things considered, it was alright. Never watching it again, but I don’t regret watching it at all. The fighting and characters were enjoyable enough for me to continue watching it this season. I looked forward to seeing what would happen in each new episode, but the end of the series made me feel that it’s just anticlimactic overall with nothing to be gained from the resolution (not even satisfaction). I would watch a season two to see where they go from here because it\'s still entertaining nonetheless.Overall: 6/10I can\'t give this series any higher than a 7 because it wasn\'t really that good and no less than a 5 because it certainly wasn\'t below average overall.Bottom line: Would I recommend this to you?If all you want is the gore/killing, then absolutely.If you want a great story, then no it’s just wasted potential.If you want both, then try Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero (anything but Ilya from the ""Fate/"" Series), Akame Ga Kill, or Mirai Nikki.If you want a similar concept that’s better imo, then try Madoka Magica, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha, or Btoom.Hope this helps you make your decision!

If so, let me know by clicking helpful! If not, let me know why you disagree~', ""“I kinda like it when a lotta people die.” --George CarlinSometimes, all you need is kill. Ing. That’s what I was looking for with Magipro. I was a little stressed, you see. I was in a weird spot at the beginning of the season: pets dying, mothers hospitalized, promotions at work, dads who live forty miles away and need rides to work another forty miles away. Oh my god. I have RESPONSIBILITIES?!Tough times call for easy viewing. I wanted something that I didn’t have to think about. Something fun. And the synopsis of Magipro fit the bill. Magical girls killing each other? Don’t care...why, I wanna see it. People dying is sensational and thrilling. Violence, murder, blood, death, despair! Sometimes, all we need is a little action. Fantasy is for the things we don’t want to experience. It’s all just for fun. Kill to thrill. It’s no fun ‘till someone dies.And that’s why… I was actually disappointed with Magipro when it started. They give an obvious implication that things will go very wrong for everyone on screen, but if it weren’t for that small foreshadowing then this would’ve been seen as nothing more than a mediocre mahou shoujo anime. It starts off with talking. Then more talking. Followed by more fucking talking. Then the main character gets a template-level transformation and runs around town helping strangers over some exposition and incredibly light music. Where’s the charm? Where’s the MAGIC? Being a magical girl sounds really fucking boring given this show’s depiction of it. Madoka Magica was such a thrill because it had a really interesting depiction of magical girls until things got really fucked up. In Magipro, dying is the most interesting thing you could do.I need to pause for a moment to calmly explain to you, kind readers, that if you continue comparing a show that is nothing more than a bloodbath to a complete deconstruction of an entire genre, I will find you, rip your arms off, and recreate Sentarou’s drum solo from the pilot of Kids on the Slope using your severed limbs as drumsticks. Please stop making this retarded comparison. The shows have nothing in common beyond being dark magical girl shows, and Magipro doesn’t even hold a candle to Madoka’s spectacle.Now, back to the review.Soon enough, the killings begin! ...In the form of really soft and boring deaths. Magipro is more of a competition in the beginning with the weakest link getting killed off. This is then revealed to the other girls by a couple people gathering info and sharing it around. They then complain by gathering in a chatroom and arguing with something that that is way too obviously a combination of Kyubey from Madoka and Monokuma from Danganronpa. Yawn. Where’s the drama? Someone just fucking DIED for fuck’s sake! Where’s the intensity?!Alright, so eventually they start killing each other… it’s kinda nice, but also… I dunno, tame? No single fight nor death stuck out to me. There’s not much else to the show beyond magical girls killing each other, so you’d think this would be played up much more. Nah, no one had a crushingly brutal death, it’s more like they just lost in a fight and death was more of a side effect. I’d recommend seeing your doctor if you get a side effect of death, though. But there IS a lot of blood. Blood is fun, so the more there is, the better. One scene had multiple characters die in the same place, with blood splashing over some other characters. I jerked off to it. It was art.One good thing about all the deaths is that they come at a pretty alarming rate. Perhaps it’s for the anime’s benefit that few people die in the early episodes, because that means multiple deaths in each episode later on. That’s when things get fun.The way things play out can be interesting. Magical girls form pairs or teams, leading to tag-team fights and surprising betrayals. The drama is surprisingly decent, but it’s not too hard to throw in a bunch of crazy shit happening with a cast of sixteen characters. But still, it was nice to see certain bitches get double-crossed and some deaths can be unexpected. Except for… you know, the ones that happen about five minutes after someone’s backstory is revealed. Death flags are thrown around a lot, and that’s no fun. It’s like hearing what you’re gonna get for Christmas. I can’t be surprised about getting a PS4 and now Christmas sucks. Thanks, Trump.The characters aren’t that good since they’re all meant to die anyway, but I still found myself rather amused by most of them. Many of them have their own idea of what it means to be a magical girl, and their access to power twists their mind a little. Say what you want about how bitchy Ruler is, she was one of the strongest characters. But none can compare to best girl TOPU SPEEDO. She wears a big witch hat and rides a broom. Everyone else go home. Anyway, the characters are just adequate--when the backstories are timed well, they’re actually pretty satisfying. Seeing a person’s life before their transformation and how much they’ve changed was interesting.However, NONE of the above can be said about the main character, Snow White. She is an utterly atrocious character. There might as well have not been a lead, because she literally does jack shit besides cry, get upset, cry, lament about people dying, cry, and complain about her definition of being a magical girl not getting across to anyone else. Tough luck, bitch, go fucking murder people. I need to watch things die at a good safe distance, and you’re not helping. Why is she here? Can her parents please pick her up?I mean, it’s cool that she’s the innocent character who cries about death all the time, but the fact that she isn’t even around for 80% of the time means she probably gets less screentime than several other people. Kinda hard to consider her the lead at this point. If she were at least part of the action and tried interfering with people every now and then, I could get behind her involvement, but I’m not joking when I say that she did nothing in the entire season. She makes Yukiteru Amano look like Yuno Gasai.Their designs are pretty great for the most part and have a lot of detail and personality to them, but uh… what’s with all the fanservice? No, I’m not about to go “WAHHHH! THERE’S CLEAVAGE IN MY ANIME, MAKE IT STOP!!! WAAAAAAHHHH!!” It’s just weird when half the girls have big tits and wear super revealing and tight-fitting outfits to compliment their big tits, and the other half are practically flat and wear more creative and cutesy outfits. I don’t mind fanservice as a whole, and some sexuality is always expected, but goddamn, Magipro. Why don't you just dispense paper towels at the start of every episode? Top Speed still the hottest though. Get a witch hat, idiots.But the best thing, of all things… are the names. Goddamn do these characters have beautiful names. Ripple. Calamity Mary. Winterprison. Hardgore Alice. Izetta the Last Witch. Holy fuck these are edgy. That’s so cool. I love them so much. I like edgy things because I like having fun every once in a while and don’t need to look mature by putting down teenage angst. I embrace it when it doesn’t go too far because it’s fun. Magipro is fun. It can afford to be a little edgier, though.So, Magipro had some good moments. It ultimately delivered on its promise--a bunch of cute girls dying. It did what it was asked to, but didn’t exceed expectations nor disappoint. It was just a perfectly adequate job. Watching it was tiring at first, but I found myself having fun after a few slow episodes. In the end, that’s what matters, even if it could’ve been better. I recommend it for that, but I’m sure there are much better battle royales out there. Hell, I would actually say that Mirai Nikki is unironically better. Might need to put a trigger warning somewhere, though.I gave it a 5 because that’s average. It’s not a low score, it’s the midpoint between 1 and 10. Don’t blame me for having “low scores” if you think 7.7 is “average”.Oh, I guess I forgot the art and sound sections. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yep they exist.

Plot: Girl(s) with ``surprise surprise’’ problems in the real world distract themselves from their problems by playing a free to play (*with micro transactions) magical girl game on their android or IOS devices. But! Get this, in the game The Magical Girl Raising Project, one in tens of thousands of people to get to be a...real ""magical girl” even guys apparently... that’s a spoiler for another day.  Besides the unwanted shock at the beginning of the series, the plot of the story was for the magical girls’ to race each other and collect more ""magical candies"" than their competitors. You know, a sweet and fun game that young girls would probably play… maxing out their parent’s credit cards on the micro transaction, but I digress.All of this changed however, and the edginess kicked in. Instead of working together to defeat the common evil, the girls instead start killing each other because that is the easiest and most logical solution to solving problems.The edginess and darkness that the story adds for shock value is simply repulsive. There was too much effort made to try and set this title apart from similar mahou shoujo titles with unique rules stipulations. Often time given out by some sort of creature or deity. I felt that the entire story was supposed to be going for “uniqueness” and there is no doubt that the staff reached their goal however, somewhere along the lines the staff got too involved in trying to recreate the same ``dark & edgy’’ formula seen in titles like Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka. So to a certain extent it just feels like watching a knock-off version of YuYu or Madoka.This approach took away a lot of the good parts and redeeming qualities that the story had to offer. Rather than focusing on a story that branches out more on the game and characters, you’re greeted to a blood fest rumble where the main focus leans on shock value and a darker narrative. The story feels too constricted as well as repetitive with it\'s choices in storytelling. The most noticeable patterns are plot twist, shocking moments, and of course blood and gore. There are lighter times however; they are kept to a minimal. Only to be used when they need to add a quick plot twist. Because of the lack of freedom in the story, I found it difficult to remain engaged and satisfied with the events taking place in the story.The animation for Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is impressive nonetheless! Lerche is a pretty reputable studio putting out hit titles like Assassination classroom, Danganronpa, School-Live (*maybe not so much) and of course Monster Musume. All shows with amazing visuals and special effects. I found myself most intrigued by the battles in rising project, which should be no surprise. The destruction of scenery coupled with the determination and fear on most girls’ faces while fighting were well displayed. I felt like the visual tension between the characters made most fight scenes feel more dramatic too.The best fights where the animation felt clean and fluent had involved Calamity Mary and Cranberry. So I would highly recommend watching them in action. I mean you know a battle is done right when you want to go back and re-watch it.The soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the battles. The well composed songs create a good amount of tension and exciting during events throughout the anime. While I felt the soundtrack was good, I did feel like it lacked the replay value and lasting effect that puella magi madoka magica soundtrack had. That aside, the voice actors were pretty good. I felt like each actor did an amazing job representing their perspective characters and giving them personality… except that dog girl whose name I cannot remember, and I’m too lazy to go close out of word and Google it. I’ll probably edit this out… or not.The enjoyment of the series would have to be the fighting.  I would’ve said drama however, Magical girl rising project is the kind of show where the drama tends to drag on. It goes on to the point where you’ll probably lose interest and skip forward a little.Overall the show isn’t “bad” as in “the worst thing ever.” It’s just full of too many cliché’s and predictable moments depending on how experienced you are when it comes to watching anime. If there were any changes that needed to be made for the shows second season, if green lit. I would hope that they use an approach that isn’t so… one-sided. I want to see more than just violence and drama. I would like to see more into the characters daily lives and happier moments that last longer than 6 minutes (in screen-time.)I gave Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku a 7/10 because I felt like despite all of the problems the show presents, it still manages to captivate audiences with its intense fights, drama, and unique cast of characters. real ""magical girl” even guys apparently... that’s a spoiler for another day.  Besides the unwanted shock at the beginning of the series, the plot of the story was for the magical girls’ to race each other and collect more ""magical candies"" than their competitors. You know, a sweet and fun game that young girls would probably play… maxing out their parent’s credit cards on the micro transaction, but I digress.All of this changed however, and the edginess kicked in. Instead of working together to defeat the common evil, the girls instead start killing each other because that is the easiest and most logical solution to solving problems.The edginess and darkness that the story adds for shock value is simply repulsive. There was too much effort made to try and set this title apart from similar mahou shoujo titles with unique rules stipulations. Often time given out by some sort of creature or deity. I felt that the entire story was supposed to be going for “uniqueness” and there is no doubt that the staff reached their goal however, somewhere along the lines the staff got too involved in trying to recreate the same ``dark & edgy’’ formula seen in titles like Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka. So to a certain extent it just feels like watching a knock-off version of YuYu or Madoka.This approach took away a lot of the good parts and redeeming qualities that the story had to offer. Rather than focusing on a story that branches out more on the game and characters, you’re greeted to a blood fest rumble where the main focus leans on shock value and a darker narrative. The story feels too constricted as well as repetitive with it\'s choices in storytelling. The most noticeable patterns are plot twist, shocking moments, and of course blood and gore.

What happens next is that, in a district where there are 16 girls, the administration thinks it should reduce the number of ""magic girls"" where each one should consume some ""magic candies"" but something becomes twisted and then the anime turns out into a giant plotwist for survival.Since the concepts of ""mahou"" animation from Cardcaptor Sakura to Madoka Magica, mahou anime were always in a fan idea, yet it is not exactly a genre that can be enjoyed to the fullest because it is not generally interesting, so it is normal to people ignore it. Unlike other anime of the same genre, Ikusei Keikaru is everything but original, this series lives basically and during the episodes, the typical cliché. It\'s pretty clear that every character who has (or counts or shows) a backstory is pretty much a victim of each episode.In a certain part of the story, the writers should have decided that the anime alone was not edgy enough, unless the characters passed on their way of life as a form of currency. It\'s a little hard to understand, but let\'s just say it\'s like stepping on legos, it hurts but then it\'s okay. In terms of art, the anime is horribly bad, not as bad as Dangaronpa for example but it is down the middle. The design of the characters is a disaster and honestly it was the part that I really didn\'t liked in the series. When I say that art is bad, I am also talking about the characters.The anime starts from the first episode to be defined with the tag good vs bad so it is possibly what ""feeds"" the series. In fact, no character is able to ""save"" the series because in general, the characters are very limited.An ""mahou"" anime can not have more than four characters as main characters and even then four is already a lot, the ideal is really three for each fight or a goal and better the anime mahou, in general.Now, the problem resides in the Rest of the characters, this rest is all those that appear in two or three episodes and die without having their moment of the series. The more the part of the series that has each person has an arc, half of the episodes neither serves for nothing by that person is dies and is dies, all was in vain.I had this anime in my plan to watch because I was missing the animes that came through in the old days and that I came to see more recently, but I was not expecting anything like this. This anime is super annoying and I advise no one to see it, unless you are a person that is an undisputed hardcore fan who thinks that all animes are really good but still (Mahou Shoujo) Ikusei Keikaru proves that no. the humans.

If it\'s towards the peaceful characters, LA gets it that some want to keep to the ""rules"" of the game, but it leads to be too naive of the plot at hand and the more obvious being having an easy target on you, the easiest towards this goes to Sister Nana voiced by Saori Hayami, Snow White voiced by Nao Touyama (especially at the start) and Top Speed voiced by Yumi Uchiyama. On the other spectrum, the more psychotic characters actually makes the anime\'s plot move forward and alot more interesting what with their character backstory as to how they became magical girl and for what reasoning, as much as this statement kinda of sounds like what Fav voiced by Kurumi Mamiya, the mascot of the Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (and obvious Kyubey stand-in), but in terms of plot and interest, the anime wouldn\'t been this interesting enough, anyways the more psychotic characters that fit this bill going to Cranberry voiced by Megumi Ogata, Calamity Mary voiced by Kikuko Inoue and Swim Swim voiced by Inori Minase (halfway through anyways)The characters do bring up themes of morality especially from Top Speed, it even brings themes of gender disparity especially from La Pucelle voiced by Ayane Sakura (slight spoilers...but La Pucelle is Snow White\'s male childhood friend...no LA didn\'t do a typo, anyways since La Pucelle\'s interest to magical girls at an early age and was humiliated by his friends, it kinda reflects the ACTUAL audience especially those in the male demographic who watches it..LA doesn\'t know if it\'s meant to be a jab at the audience or it\'s being self-aware that the audience are mainly males and maybe due to the atmosphere of the anime, it makes sense)The plot twists really comes in the form of the characters true identities/backstories and how their deaths comes be in the end, some do get a short backstory after their deaths, some goes more into greater detail in order to motivate the other magical girls. What the only flaw to some of the death plot twists comes in form of the backstory coming in as a hint to who\'s gonna die next (not always but it comes up as a major predictability). Nonetheless the plot twists varies in how it\'s executed. LA also thinks that because of this, it\'s less Puella Madoka Magica and the more referenced in this review, Battle Royale.As much as deaths are concerned however, LA will say at the very least that due to the major ""villains"" presented and given backstory on, they at the very least helps makes the entire ""Battle Royale"" schema along with the interesting villains propel the plot and makes it all the more interesting what some of the more unhinged and utterly psychotic villains there are, don\'t forget the magical girls\' morals getting put into question along with their social mobile game turn into ""survival""...and quite later on ""slaughter"".The animation by Lerche, it had quite the crisp animation especially concerning the character designs and battle animation and the more brutalized deaths (seemed Lerche is going Danganronpa levels of animation detail). The animation at best was consistent for the majority of the animation, though LA rarely in the later episodes saw the animation dip slightly but not to the point LA wouldn\'t have distracted LA.In terms voice acting, the majority of the voice cast did exceptional, with some standouts going to Kikuko Inoue, Inori Minase and Manami Numakura who voiced by Ripple. As much LA wanted Nao Touyama to be LA\'s favourite in this section, she did at best, her typical genki girl archetype though towards the end of the anime she showed a bit more, no LA\'s favourite voice actors would go to Kikuko Inoue and Kurumi Mamiya who voiced Fav.The ending was at best, showing Fav\'s true colors and at the same time, it was solely a satisfying ending, though the ""final battle"" felt slightly anti-climaxed, nonetheless, it made sure the anime ENDED without any hint of a second season, it concluded the anime quite nicely with all thing considered even with it\'s slight anti-climax.Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku maybe seen as another ripoff of the dark magical girls trying to STILL ride on the coat-tails of the Puella Madoka Magica, but for all LA can see, it\'s definitely trying to be it\'s own thing and sure the allusions of Madoka are there (Snow White\'s pink hair, her indecisiveness, the dark themes, a mascot character with ulterior motives etc.), but as LA said at the start of this anime review, it\'s definitely trying to be it\'s own thing under a Battle Royale setting with interesting villains and peaceful characters that quite frankly should have been another genre but nonetheless their contrasting personalities towards the social game and it\'s rules and even better the plot twists to finding out Fav has lied to them raises it as an interesting development.

Then I decided on a whim to choose this, and I don't regret it at all. There are two main reasons:The first reason is.. a lot of types of mahou shoujos!yes, each with different ability. I thought that it would be interesting to see them battle each others. And it is executed very well I say. The battle scenes are not much, but they are pretty good. Sometimes they are not fight heads on but...trick each others, which is interesting to watch too.Another reason is.. there are some plot twists in this anime. No, I'm not talking about how they'll die here. Anyone who see this anime will be able to conclude, which one will be dead next time after watching few episode, because the pattern is repeated. But there are some minor twists in the story that are unexpected, which make this show enjoyable to watch until the end. I bet you'll not be able to tell which one that will survive until the end, because some of them are not really stand out at the beginning.There are another good things from this show, like the OP and ED. especially ED which is really suit the mood. some interesting psychological story telling, although not too deep. That is understandable considering the length of this anime is only 12 episode, and with so many characters too. Good thing that there are almost no useless fan service here.So my final verdict is, you can enjoy this anime as simple fantasy action anime, don't expect too much on psychological aspect (go for madoka or even wixoss series for that). also, beware that there are gore and bloody scenes here, I think that's not for everyone to enjoy. trick each others, which is interesting to watch too.Another reason is.. there are some plot twists in this anime.

Through a mobile app game, girls are chosen by the magical entity Fav for unknown reasons, but they accidentally selected too many girls to become magical girls, and so now they all need to compete in a competition of either gaining the most candies or killing each other (someone will die by the end of the week regardless) in order for them to survive.-------------------------Story: 3/10Story-wise, Ikusei Keikaku...is filled to the brim with nothing but terrible cliches. It became clear that any character whose backstory was shown was very likely to be among the victims of that episode, and if that wasn\'t enough, they made sure to try to employ every type of sympathy-tool for the casual audience as they possibly could.Character death not sad enough? Oh, well, they were pregnant. Also a housewife. Or they helped the homeless. Maybe they were bullied in school. They had found love. Their friend witnessed their death. Or maybe all of the above because this anime really has no dignity in its story. Death means nothing in this show, but I will explore that later on.At some point in the series, the writers must have decided that the show just wasn\'t edgy enough unless the characters spent their life force (measured in years of their life) as a form of currency. I don\'t particularly count this as a spoiler because it hardly has any actual relevancy in the anime. It\'s just that they needed something to increase the variety of action in the show, so they added new items and they needed to make it ""dark"" for their teenage audience who thinks they\'re dark lords, so they made them use \'years of their life\' as currency.-------------------------Art: 5/10At first it doesn\'t really look bad to me, but the more I look at it, the more I\'m slightly repulsed by it. I mean, the combat is kind of okay, but the proportions on the characters are pretty bad and the designs themselves are fairly unimaginative. The combat scenes can be alright, they\'re nothing special or worth noting, but they at least can have a moment of something at least looking decent.-------------------------Sound: 6/10Probably the best part about the show is its sound. Not even so much the music, which relies on a set few soundtracks to play on repeat through every single episode. It\'s mostly the magical sound effects that give life to the series. If not for those, this anime likely wouldn\'t be heralded by much of anyone. My rating for this might actually be more of a case of, ""It\'s good by comparison to everything else"" rather than it being good as a standalone entity, but I\'ll stick by my rating of its sound quality for now.-------------------------Character: 2/10For the most part, the characters in Ikusei Keikaku are defined by their abilities and where they fall on the good vs. evil spectrum, with barely anyone at all falling in the middle. Either they\'re hardcore good or hardcore evil. Even characters that are super evil and have been killing off characters for the duration of the series are given backgrounds that try to ""redeem"" them and try to make the audience have sympathy for them, which really shouldn\'t work for anyone who isn\'t just watching for mindless entertainment.Characters will either be ""I will defend the ones I love!"" or ""I will protect myself by killing those who stand in my way."" This is pretty much the case for absolutely everyone with maybe one or two exceptions.This anime falls drastically to the curse of having too many characters. That might not always be a problem, there are plenty of anime out there that have a wide cast array but still manage to make them feel like more than plot devices. For Ikusei Keikaku, it\'s more that each character is a cameo appearance until they have their own arc. How do you know its their arc? The episode will introduce their backstory and say ""hey, maybe there\'s an actual character here"" moments before killing the character off and stopping any hope of feeling any legitimate attachment to the characters.If you feel anything for the characters, I feel like I can definitively say you don\'t actually like the characters, you just like the atmosphere and the fact that the anime is forcefully telling you to care for them. It\'s not a natural ""I care for these characters because they\'re good,"" it\'s a ""I feel obligated to like this character in order to enjoy the series.""-------------------------Enjoyment: 2/10I originally saw this anime and was really anticipating it probably more than anything else in the season. And as it started, I detracted on that position almost immediately. After the exhaustively obvious formula of who is going to die next was figured out, it wasn\'t really worth caring for any of the characters. Not in that it was a defense mechanism for me not to care, but because the anime didn\'t give me a reason to care. The anime just kills characters and hopes that you\'re sad at the concept of meaningless death as long as they toss in some crying friend or sappy flashbacks at the moment of death.The most enjoyment I got out of it was laughing at how abrupt or sudden a death was. There\'s no actual reason to care for any of the characters because they never provided a reason to care, so attachment was out the window from the get-go. It was hard for me to look at this anime and even see the worldbuilding aspect of it because you can just see that the writer just wanted to showcase magical fights in a ""dark setting where hope is hard to find.""-------------------------Overall: 3/10Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is desperate for reaction. It tries everything it can to force reactions from the audience rather than letting the audience feel things by themselves, and in doing so, comes across as petty and undignified. It\'s nothing more than a disappointing cash-grab that has nothing to offer anyone in any form. is filled to the brim with nothing but terrible cliches.

The episode will introduce their backstory and say ""hey, maybe there\'s an actual character here"" moments before killing the character off and stopping any hope of feeling any legitimate attachment to the characters.If you feel anything for the characters, I feel like I can definitively say you don\'t actually like the characters, you just like the atmosphere and the fact that the anime is forcefully telling you to care for them. It\'s not a natural ""I care for these characters because they\'re good,"" it\'s a ""I feel obligated to like this character in order to enjoy the series.""-------------------------Enjoyment: 2/10I originally saw this anime and was really anticipating it probably more than anything else in the season. And as it started, I detracted on that position almost immediately. After the exhaustively obvious formula of who is going to die next was figured out, it wasn\'t really worth caring for any of the characters. Not in that it was a defense mechanism for me not to care, but because the anime didn\'t give me a reason to care. The anime just kills characters and hopes that you\'re sad at the concept of meaningless death as long as they toss in some crying friend or sappy flashbacks at the moment of death.The most enjoyment I got out of it was laughing at how abrupt or sudden a death was. There\'s no actual reason to care for any of the characters because they never provided a reason to care, so attachment was out the window from the get-go. It was hard for me to look at this anime and even see the worldbuilding aspect of it because you can just see that the writer just wanted to showcase magical fights in a ""dark setting where hope is hard to find.""-------------------------Overall: 3/10Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is desperate for reaction. It tries everything it can to force reactions from the audience rather than letting the audience feel things by themselves, and in doing so, comes across as petty and undignified. It\'s nothing more than a disappointing cash-grab that has nothing to offer anyone in any form.', 'In recent years there has been the rise of a sub-genre of anime I’d like to call ‘moe flip’. In this sub-genre, cute characters are immersed in harsh conditions, often brutal, that are unlike what the characters represent by their looks alone. These shows engage the audience through their shock value; having cute characters commit brutal actions or transform into psychological monsters. The masterpieces in this sub-genre go beyond the shock value and deliver compelling characters.Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a ‘moe-flip’ show that excels in delivering great shock value but fails to present meaningful characters.[Magical girl battle royale]Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Magical Girls...Raising Project (MGRP for short), is a fantasy thriller adapted from a light novel of the same title by the studio Lerche who’ve also created other ‘moe-flip’ shows as Gakkougurashi. The story revolves around magical girls (mahou shoujo) who are forced to fight each other for their survival. Himekawa Koyuki, also known as the magical girl Snow White, is thrust into a role so different from what’s she’s dreamed of and tries to stick to her ideals. This task becomes increasingly difficult as the high stakes slowly reveal the monsters that have hidden in the midst of the magical girls.[Lukewarm reception]MGRP initially received a lukewarm reception when it began airing on the 2nd of October, 2016. People who’d gotten wary of the abundance of ‘moe’ anime were turned off by the character designs, calling it another ‘moe’ show. It’s magical girls theme didn’t help either - but its shock value did. With the first flip, the first death of a magical girl, the interest waxed. And when the show revealed its most influential character, it gained a steady following. This interest was maintained by the shows consistency in delivering shocking events albeit with the absence of a good plot.[A thin plot]The entire plot - or most of it - of MGRP is told in the first two episodes of the show. As with most ‘moe-flip’ shows, the pacing is not slow; the ‘flip’ often happens early. The first episode introduces the two main characters, the Magical Girl Rising Project which is actually a mobile game, as well as a few supporting characters. The second episode introduces the major conflict of the show through the death of one of the magical girls. Afterwards, the show became a series of battles with the occasional backstory employed for emotional impact. Unfortunately, this was ineffective as there was too little time to get invested in the characters; a lot of the characters died too quickly. MGRP was a victim of its large cast but there were a few standout characters that drove the story.[Diverse characters but not much development]Koyuki is the designated main character, as identified at the beginning of the show and has a few recognizable traits that define her. She’s pure-hearted, diligent and passionate about being a magical girl. As a result, she’s the least prepared for the changes that occur after the game’s mascot, Fav, announces that it’d need to cut down the number of magical girls. She grows during the course of the series, becoming bold enough to choose to rescue people at the risk of being attacked and killed by another magical girl. But at different points in the first few episodes she often has more battle-hardened and mentally strong characters come to her aid. One of those characters is Sazanami Kano, also know as the magical girl Ripple.Kano is one of the few characters in the show that’s well-developed; there are many scenes of Kano outside her magical girl persona unlike most of the cast. She’s introduced as indifferent to the system and the other magical girls but becomes more involved after a traumatic event. She’s stronger than Koyuki psychologically and isn’t afraid to battle with the other magical girls. But Koyuki and Kano are not the most influential characters in the show; that title goes to Sakayagi Ayana, also known as the magical girl Swim Swim.It’s difficult to state how compelling Ayana is without spoiling parts of the show. She’s a product of the new system created and uses it to her advantage.Unlike other magical girl shows that feature high school girls, MGRP has a vast array of characters. There are high school girls, a girl in middle school, an office lady, female college students, a lesbian couple and even a boy. This diverse cast is further augmented by their diverse skills and brilliant character design.[Great character design with a glum mood]Each of the magical girls has a unique design that reflects their ability. In fact, all but one of the designs for the characters and their skills were picked by the girls (and boy) themselves. For example, Ruler looks like a princess complete with a cape and sceptre and her ability is to force anyone in front of her to obey her commands. Tama’s ability lets her dig 1m wide holes in any surface and she looks like a dog. The character design is made more remarkable by the art style and the overall mood.While the character art and art within the game is done in a cute style, the background art is not. The backgrounds are mostly done in washed out colours and most of the scenes are at night. This gloomy mood is complemented by the often sober music.[Fitting music but immemorable scores]A good aspect of MGRP’s music is that there’s almost no cheery tunes; the tracks always seemed to propel the ominous mood of the show. Unfortunately, they seemed generic; one of the tracks even sounded like it was from a retro video game.MGRP was enjoyable for its take on the magical girl sub-genre and its shock value. It’s diverse cast made it easier to connect to its characters. A fan of brutal thrillers would find this worth watching.

In nearly 12 eps, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku turned a unconvoluted premise convoluted, obtuse, unfocused, and just outright weird.The entire core of Magical Girl Raising Project was inspired from Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a critically acclaimed gem from 2011 that received praise for subverting the magical girl genre. It really blows that one of the few if only merits of the series is inspired from another, arguably better series made several years ago.The main content of Magical Girl Raising Project is watching Magical Girls perform brutal violence. The first four...episodes had great pacing, shocking twist, and established the characters. Then it proceeded to drop the ball on every single plot point. Character motivations cease to make sense, the lack of logic becomes hard to ignore, and the one track mind homicidal maniacs ruin any sense of attachment that I had towards the series.Mayoiga, another obtuse, but surprisingly good, anime shares some commonalities. They both have very brief cutscenes interjected clumsily episode after episode to provide backstories for the characters, and both shows are unintentionally funny at moments. While Mayoiga was bad, there were redeeming qualities. Magical Girl Raising Project is a trainwreck and not an entertaining one. Crucial characters will disappear for episodeson end and plot points that you think would have been resolved in prior episodes pop back up for seemingly no reason.And just to beat a dead horse. At the very least I could say that this show delivered something worthwhile thematically. Nope! not at all.

The method of execution is what usually enamours the audience, which is a quintessential requirement for its overall success. Now can be it done with magical girls? The answer is a yes but the degree to which it is provides an entertaining storyline is variable. Anyone who is well versed with a last man standing format should have a complete grasp of the problems associated with it.The conspicuous social experiment that enables a total...of 16 magical girls battling each other to the death sounds amusing at first. The chosen participants are selected on a purely random scale each with their fair share of problems to boot. It looked rosy at first with the magical girls conversing with each other in the common chat room, only to take a sinister turn moments later. The news of the passing of the friendliest magical girl instilled fear and worry which was only going to get worse from this point. A battle royale truly begins when the first participant dies and Nemurin was the catalyst for the violence and destruction that soon follows.The rules for the social experiment need to be addressed as I find it to be a major concern of mine. The objective in the magical girl raising project is to avoid getting the least amount of magical candies which are obtained through honest good deeds that signifies one being a Samaritan. The reward for aiding the vulnerable populace is clear but to me becomes irrelevant for the magical girls. Why waste your time when you can simply kill other magical girls to fulfil the requirements of the game? This quota in place holds no significance for the murderers who have no qualms about ending another’s life which include the public. It’s either dying by having no magical candies or being murdered by another magical girl. This is such an ideal scenario for a devout pacifist…The game-master who oversees the pandemonium Fav is a pure mystery at this point. This fluffy and shrewd AI thing that only appears through holograms (through the communication devices) is just incompetent in my eyes. The thing isn’t even neutral like you expect him to be and is aligned with a certain magical girl in the social experiment.  Fav is unjust, there is no concise and clear instructions made despite having an initial rundown on the rules. During the experiment, Fav is always adjusting the rules which can be agitating in my eyes as a third-party spectator. For example, always reducing the total numbers of magical girls limit to better ‘distribute’ the magical candies. I’ve explained it above and this shows you why it’s just a simple killing game with no substance.The level of violence and profanity is a tad bit excessive in my opinion, with the show presenting majority of conflicts as being gore-fests meant to shock the viewer in all means possible. Death plays a pivotal role in how the characters develop, with many of them being direct casualties thus I find it redundant that some mourn for their allies despite being informed of the consequences. What the series performs well in are the number of alliances that is evident between participants. The concepts of deceit and betrayal is magnificently done with certain plot twists arising because of that. The amount of backstabbing witnessed in this social experiment is a valid representation of human behaviour when dealing with a life or death situation. The idea of being pitted against one other is detrimental for one’s frame of mind and this anime does a superb job at portraying the despair and bleakness.This was also going to be a complaint of mine from the beginning and so you could do say that it was inevitable. Plot armour is deemed to be one of the most exhausted plot conveniences. If you have main characters such as Snow White and Ripple, it is only natural you expect them to make it till the end. The same rules apply to overpowered characters such as Cranberry and Swim Swim who display abilities that are overbearing compared to other magical girls. The survival of the fittest concept works wonders in a battle royale format considering it weeds out the weaker participants that die off first. This show could have been a great subversion if it tried to do things differently but instead we got the usual which is disappointing.The characterisation of the cast is a bit mind boggling at times. Every single magical girl is given flashbacks which I find to be quite lazy and uncreative. The show is being melodramatic when it presents the sad backstory of a girl/boy trying to evoke emotion out of me. Every character has similar unfortunate circumstances making it difficult to differentiate characters based on prior experiences. The only one I can think of would be Top Speed who had a relatively normal backstory, she is not a deranged individual and exhibits qualities that of a kind and endearing person. The only dynamic characters I find even remotely interesting are Ripple and Swim Swim who’ve had various setbacks and proactively learn from them.The animation by studio Lerche (Assassination Classroom, Gakkougurashi!) is well produced and there isn’t anything being sub-par in quality. The action scenes which are frantic and erratic are well produced and goes hand in hand with the colouring scheme which just adds to my immersion. The art style which includes the character designs is generally pleasant. The designs for the magical girls are very cute and adorable (would be a discredit to lolis) which is synonymous with the sub-genre. Each character was given a unique selling point making it easy to recognise them instantaneously.The music composition is done by Iga Takurou who is a relative newcomer with hardly any titles worth mentioning. The opening was standard for a show but the ending was fantastic listening to repeatedly as it complemented the background scenery. The insert music used within the show usually only manifested itself in the intense scenes, where events leading to deaths were made better through careful track selection. There were plenty of occasions in which individual piano scores were used during somewhat miserable scenes which I found was appropriate. The music is not the selling point of the show as other aspects such as animation are much better.I’m not really impressed with anything apart from the animation and art style which are top notch for its setting. The plot however is kind of forgettable and certainly needs to be revised to give a better experience. This is adapted from a light novel, so you may check that out if this series is to your liking.

Watching this series unfold I was never really 100% sure how it would win,The story itself is really cool, others have compared it to different anime, but maybe it's just my lack of seeing many but I found it different enough that I ddn't notice or care.Visually I would say it's not too bad either, giving you enough of what you want, without...going too far, from what I understand the manga and anime are a bit darker, but it didn't bother me that it lacked some of that here.I would give this series a definite recommendation, and suggest anyone thats curious about it checking it out, it's a good strong 8 out of 10 for me. going too far, from what I understand the manga and anime are a bit darker, but it didn't bother me that it lacked some of that here.I would give this series a definite recommendation, and suggest anyone thats curious about it checking it out, it's a good strong 8 out of 10 for me."", ""Character deaths done right are one of my favourite things in fiction. The absolute gut punch of losing a character I cared about, the ways the story's cast will play off of it and develop, and the impactful, irreparable tone shifts.You've already read the score I'm giving this, so I'm sure you realize none of that applies to Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku.It isn't hard to look at Ikusei Keikaku and see exactly what will go wrong with it. It's a one-cour show trying to tell the story of sixteen different magical girls -- and if that wasn't already a difficult enough task, it's a battle...royale where this expansive cast get butchered.In other words, the show rides or dies on one specific thing: making me care about these characters and the tragedy that befalls them. It has far less than an episode to do that per character (even before I consider the focus on major characters, the world-building, the set-up, etc.).The end result is a bunch of meaningless edge and gore as the show introduces characters, develops them for /maybe/ three minutes, and throws them into a blender. Any punch the initial chaos or 'twist' has gets sucked out after episode beyond episode of the exact same formula repeated ad nauseum. It quickly loses any feeling of genuineness when it only exposition dumps a character's backstory right before they're killed in the most underwhelming, blink-and-you-might-miss-it ways. Any impact most of these deaths would have is quickly erased as the show moves onto the next one, and any lingering callback or development it tries to make feels half-baked and hackneyed. Even the fights are often pretty lackluster and can feel rushed through, which is rather problematic when they're one of the core attractions of the show.That all being said, the most frustrating thing about Ikusei Keikaku is that I care /just/ enough to get frustrated by it. Most of the character concepts and designs are compelling, and there's a fair bit of creativity put into the designs, personalities, and backstories behind them. A trans magical girl, a pair of lesbian lovers, even a buddy cop dynamic -- any one of these could be taken and fleshed out so much more. There's all sorts of differing motivations behind them, and in hindsight I've only grown to appreciate them.Unfortunately, the show also decides to kill most of the interesting characters quickly and focus primarily on the least likeable and unique of the bunch. This only serves to aggravate the aforementioned issues.Mild spoilers ahead (though I'll try to avoid the specifics). Our protagonist Snow White is yet another Madoka clone. She's a goody-two-shoes who just wants to help everyone and be friends with everyone and... dear god does this character not have a place in this story. I get what they were trying to go for -- a contrast between the incredibly dark storyline and the cliche heroine. However, what we end up with is a character who doesn't want to participate in the death game because she's too much of a good person... and she indeed doesn't. She continues to survive purely off other characters protecting her/dying for her, or just the blind luck of not being targeted. All the while she wallows in misery about her friends dying and how terrible the world is and just... exists. She's never really directly plot relevant so much as just observing, but even then, the show spends more time away from her than not. Whenever her struggles show up, they're simply not very interesting and a distraction from any meat in the show.The other main character Ripple is among the least memorable characters in the show. I don't really have anything against her, but her only real personality and charm revolves around her relationship with Top Speed -- beyond that she's a cliche sullen teenager that the show doesn't really do anything special with.Finally, the third significant character is a major antagonist, Swim Swim. Her power is interesting, but beyond that she's 7 years old and acts like it almost the entire time. Unsurprisingly, an antagonist with the mental capacities of a toddler isn't compelling in the slightest. There's not really much more to say about her, either.There's a few other things I could pick at (Fav is an embarrassingly blatant attempt at ripping off Kyubey, the initial tone of the show doesn't shift gracefully into the dark 'twist' [which isn't even a twist because it's the entire point of the show], and the ending's character arc resolution feels strange and unimpactful [albeit the source material continues from that point, so it may play off it in more interesting ways]), but there's not much to say about them. The production quality of the show is fine but unremarkable, and the opening and ending songs are both solid but nothing too special.For closing thoughts, I will at least say that I can't bring myself to really hate this show because I was almost interested in it. I can't say I'd ever recommend watching it, but if you really want to see some mediocre kill-em-all action, you'll find it here. royale where this expansive cast get butchered.In other words, the show rides or dies on one specific thing: making me care about these characters and the tragedy that befalls them.

She continues to survive purely off other characters protecting her/dying for her, or just the blind luck of not being targeted. All the while she wallows in misery about her friends dying and how terrible the world is and just... exists. She's never really directly plot relevant so much as just observing, but even then, the show spends more time away from her than not. Whenever her struggles show up, they're simply not very interesting and a distraction from any meat in the show.The other main character Ripple is among the least memorable characters in the show. I don't really have anything against her, but her only real personality and charm revolves around her relationship with Top Speed -- beyond that she's a cliche sullen teenager that the show doesn't really do anything special with.Finally, the third significant character is a major antagonist, Swim Swim. Her power is interesting, but beyond that she's 7 years old and acts like it almost the entire time. Unsurprisingly, an antagonist with the mental capacities of a toddler isn't compelling in the slightest. There's not really much more to say about her, either.There's a few other things I could pick at (Fav is an embarrassingly blatant attempt at ripping off Kyubey, the initial tone of the show doesn't shift gracefully into the dark 'twist' [which isn't even a twist because it's the entire point of the show], and the ending's character arc resolution feels strange and unimpactful [albeit the source material continues from that point, so it may play off it in more interesting ways]), but there's not much to say about them. The production quality of the show is fine but unremarkable, and the opening and ending songs are both solid but nothing too special.For closing thoughts, I will at least say that I can't bring myself to really hate this show because I was almost interested in it. I can't say I'd ever recommend watching it, but if you really want to see some mediocre kill-em-all action, you'll find it here."", 'So, this series attempted to do something unique with the magical girl genre; turn it into a real battle royal.  However, in it\'s attempt to do that, it completely gutted itself and ruined any potential it had.I\'ll start with the good things.  The character designs were somewhat unique.  Despite feeling like some of the characters were blatant rip-offs of a certain other magical girl series, there were also several that had super unique abilities and how they used them were well designed.  Especially Swimswim, I liked her ability... even if at times it felt like they didn\'t quite stick to it...fully.The art and animation for the series was also above par.  I wouldn\'t say it was anything groundbreaking or specifically a reason why you should watch it, though.  The voice acting was also pretty good.The story was... bearable.  For what it was worth, I didn\'t want to drop it expressly at any point, but that\'s probably because I quickly realized it wasn\'t going to have any potential and instead just let myself be pulled along for the ride.However, that\'s about where the good points end.For detractors, where do I start? How about the fact that they started with by far too many characters.  16?  Really?  Is that necessary?  If you need to end up chopping half of them out (or more), how are you going to give them any type of proper character development? You have 12 episodes, 16 characters... that\'s not even an episode worth of mild character development per character...Due to this, none of the characters get any solid character development.  Not even our ""main heroine"" who, tbh, isn\'t that main.  With the lack of development, this leaves you without any type of character connection or  relatability, so you have no reason to emphasize with the characters as they hit the chopping block.  On top of that, with the speed they do it, and lack of any backstory before they lose, you never get to the point of really wanting one to last till the end.  Yeah, they kind of steer you towards a few you don\'t want to see win, but you\'re more wanting to see them lose than care about others winning.So remember how I said they don\'t get any real development before they lose?  That\'s the kicker, when they do lose, THAT is when they get a very small semblance of trying to build a backstory. Talk about bad story telling.  The writer obviously doesn\'t know wtf they\'re doing. Yes, attempt to give me a reason (poorly told ones at that) to like the character after they\'ve ALREADY LOST!  What\'s the point in doing it now?Another thing they tried to do, but didn\'t do too well at, was emphasize the shock factor. You could tell what happens to characters when they lose long before they ""revealed"" it. You also knew what the purpose of the whole thing was.  I mean, look at the title... (I might have used rearing instead of raising, personally, though).  There was no surprise.  The only surprising event was how early they removed the one chance they had of trying to make the viewer empathize with the main heroine (hint: EP6).Next, the shrinking of the number of ""winners"" they could have through out the series was horribly done.  There was little planning, little lead up, and no reasoning (other than our obvious end result reason) given. ""Oh, we just need to reduce the number"" is not a well written reason.  Come on, even I could give a more convincing reason than that and write it in a way that it didn\'t feel shoehorned in just as a story driver.Next, the one orchestrating all this, Fav, was a shitty antagonist, and another example of the author not knowing how to write a good story. It\'s importance entirely revolved around nothing more than to prod the girls.  It wasn\'t trying to stick to some moral high ground, or be actually evil... it couldn\'t commit to anything.  Too many times did it prod or give information it shouldn\'t have, only to then say that it\'s just a observer and shouldn\'t be influencing the events.Further, the rabbits foot usage.  So, this for me was the crucifix that marked the series as poorly written and even more terribly executed.  There is a more appropriate, more emotional scene (for the MC that is, not for us) for it to have come into play than when it did (hint: EP10).  That is when this should have kicked in, considering it was there and there were far more emotions flying around from our MC.  But poor writing struck again, and it only ended up being used as a shallow (and poorly executed) plot driver.All in all the story telling was pretty bad, to be honest.  So many things were written out of order, there was no character development, no shock & awe, no getting the viewer to feel invested in the characters or the story... and there was no satisfying ending. They never gave an any purpose as to why they were trying to ""raise them"". All they said was to find the strongest... but for what?  Why?  What good would it do for them? But I would say there was one good aspect to the story, and that was what I\'ll call the underdog factor when it came to which characters lasted the longest and earned the most... uh... wins.The last detractor that I\'ll cover was, and this may be due to my personal like of the series, but how much it felt like it stole some of it\'s items from Madoka Magica.  Our ""main heroine"" feels very much like Madoka, who doesn\'t honestly do that much through out the series, and is instead attempted to be further driven into depression to have her be there at the end to make some final event happen.  Calamity Mary is, well, a partial rip-off of Mami.  Her fighting style and abilities are fairly similar and they both have unstable personalities. And then there\'s the Homura copy, who I won\'t say who she reminds me of (as that\'s spoiler I feel), but the character is your reclusive, kind of dark feeling, black hair, I\'ll do things my own way type of character.  Only thing missing is the backstory between the two (but again, this series doesn\'t have any of that anyway).  On top of that, we have a poor Kyubey rip off, Fav.  He\'s has a similar but different white design, is ""misunderstood"" (sort of), is alien to the story\'s world, and is there for some ""greater good"".  Come on... if you\'re going to try this, at least make the core set of characters look different!Summary:So all in all, the series is decent if all you want is a battle royal with magical girls, but if you\'re looking for anything beyond that, you\'re in for a massive disappointment, and I\'ll tell you you\'re better off looking other series (may I suggest Mirai Nikki or Akame ga Kill). fully.The art and animation for the series was also above par.

I just watched episode twelve tonight.I am not that into ""magical girl"" anime, so I won\'t be very bias in my review.メ Story: The story is very good. I am judging the story on it\'s plot twists and fear factor. The first three episode are delivered as the entire anime was meant to continue to be calm, but friendship is fickle in this one. There is a lot of intensely edgy backstories and death that make this anime even more edgy. It\'s sad at points if you get easily attached to characters...like I do, otherwise you\'ll think it\'s a ""over-the-top edge-fest"".メ Art:  The art of the anime was very good in terms of movement and shading. The style in some frames could have awkward movement at some times. The art style is different. It\'s cute like you would expect a magical girl anime to be, but the direction and the fact many scenes take place at night make it ""dark"". Hell, ""Nanbaka"" has more sparkles than this!メ Sound: The sound is very good. I always judge sound on how memorable it is. During the sad moments, there is this piano piece that plays and I can\'t forget it. The ending is good as well. It\'s like a cool-down song similar to Death Parade\'s ending theme. The opening is nice, but I wish they did alternate versions of the opening as more characters died or as the plot progressed (ex. Dangan Ronpa 3: Hope Arc).メ Characters: I think the characters are good. I am glad the characters are not all in a similar age range. Most of the characters have an edgy backstory and diverse living standards. To be honest, their are still common character tropes for some characters (but they are hard to avoid).メ Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime. It\'s something I have never watched before (as I have avoided Madoka Magica). Snow White is a wimpy main character, and her uselessness can be annoying sometimes. Even so, if it weren\'t for that I am not sure if she would have ""changed"" at the end.In summary, if you enjoy having your heart ripped out, blood/gore, no friendship power and dark stories...this is for you.Thank you.- PlumAppleJuice like I do, otherwise you\'ll think it\'s a ""over-the-top edge-fest"".メ Art:  The art of the anime was very good in terms of movement and shading.

Honestly. It does. But the execution of that premise and the direction the story goes is very mediocre. All of the characters are excellently designed. Aesthetically, they're pleasing and they have pretty deep backstories. But then they're all killed off like such fodder, with the viewer being given so little real time to grow with them, that their deaths aren't what anger you. What angers you, or more accurately frustrates you, is the absolutely squandered potential of each and every one of them over the course of the show.On top of that, everything is very predictable.  Who'll...die next, why everything's happening, who will be the last one standing... And the motivation behind the conflict is not only revealed halfway through the show, rendering there no surprise or twist to be given but on top of that, it's very shallow to begin with.To be clear, I don't hate this show. I absolutely adore the characters. I hate how much the show failed me, disappointed me and let me down. I had very high hopes for it. die next, why everything's happening, who will be the last one standing...

I had very high hopes for it."", 'Magical Girl Raising Project brings the gore and intense action but other aspects of the show leave a lot to be desired.This anime may not be the best overall show but I am still glad I watched it because it succeeded in packing in some awesome and intense gory action sequences.  The storyline is pretty basic but the overall theme of magical girls fighting each other to the death through brutal action sequences and twisted super powers was pretty entertaining at times.  One of the reasons these actions sequences were so much fun is because the powers of the magical girls are smartly...varied.  There are girls with gun skills, speed skills, melee skills, and interesting other super powers.  This keeps the action and suspense interesting throughout the show because it is hard to predict which girls would win which matches.  The extreme gore and all out horror themed settings/backdrops also added to the action because it created a “no strings attached” exploitative feel to the series and as a fan of horror this kept me looking forward to each episode so if anything this anime definitely isn’t boring.  The action was well paced and well-crafted consistently throughout the show and the sleek and modern animation style added an incredible amount of detail during these bloody sequences.  The animation also elevated the fear and intensity of the character expressions adding to the horror action elements of the show.Unfortunately while this anime’s horror action is fun to watch the rest of the show is pretty shallow.  The first disappointing aspect of this show is the characters.  The main character Snow White is supposedly the moral compass of the show.  However, she is incredibly flandarized as an overly cutesy and naïve person.  Because of this, I never connected to her as a character because she was not multi-dimensional.  This was made worse by the fact that her character never changes from the beginning of the show to the end.  The rest of the side cast is annoyingly underdeveloped as well as the show tries to develop every member of the side cast but fails because there are over 16 other magical girls besides Snow White and there are only 12 episodes in the series.  Therefore, we learn about the backstories of every girl but besides their backstories there is hardly any time to connect with any of them emotionally.  The other way in which this affects the show is that some of the magical girls are clearly more interesting and unique then others so certain characters feel annoyingly sidelined. Personally, I wanted to learn a lot more about Hardgore Alice and Calamity but we never got the chance.  Overall, there were no bad characters but no characters who I felt a connection to either.Another problem with this show is the overall storyline.  It is a very standard “fight to the death” storyline.  It is tightly wound and entertaining.  However, it is nothing new or unique in today’s current times and it does feel like wasted potential as the writing often alludes to greater ideas but it never takes that leap to become something amazing.  On top of that there are certain “aspects” that are clearly “inspired” by Madoka Magica.  I won’t go into them in detail to avoid spoilers but it was something that held the show back from becoming its own unique experience.  Overall, the story isn’t particularly bad but it is very linear and standard.I am still glad I watched Magical Girl Raising Project because of the fighting sequences and as a fan of horror it was fun at times.  However, the rest of the experience was to lackluster for me to recommend this to those just getting into anime or those searching for a memorable experience.

Character development is all rushed and last minute to the point where it's kind of insulting that we're supposed to care about the characters at all. The weakest character happens to be our protagonist, who hardly gets any screen time and doesn't develop very much at all throughout most of the season. Then again, she's the only character who reacts to her circumstances like a real person. Everyone else just kind of hopped on board the death and murder train the second they found...out about it.

This anime is so poorly written that is predictable.Story 3/10What happens when an anime based on a game doesn\'t follow its own rules? Well, this happens. I will quote Danganronpa.  Danganronpa was a killing game that had precise rules: they will apply to...anyone and they will be followed no matter what.  This anime doesn\'t do this.  At first, they tell you they need to cut the magical girls to 8, then they tell you you can buy magical items to get an advantage, then they tell you that they have to modify the rules yet again so the plot keeps going.  This is totally dumb and unimaginative.  Instead of the girls trying to figure out how to avoid getting killed by following the rules, they are forced to do stupid things like buying magical items.Then I must tell you this is heavily rushed.  At first i felt the pacing was just right, but then we get 4 deaths in an episode.  That means 12 minutes of flashbacks.But the greatest sin of this anime is letting you know who is going to die just before they do.  I feel like watching Akame ga Kill, when someone is about to die, they just show you a flashback of how this magical girl got her powers.  And even after all this senseless slaughter, it was completely predictable who was going to win.Character 1/10Pathetic.  Characters are pathetic.  We have Snow White, she doesn\'t do anything at all except crying while everyone wants to protect her for some reason.  People tell me not to compare her to Madoka, well, she\'s Madoka, except she doesn\'t do anything at all in the end.  Then we have Ripple and Hardgore Alice which admire Snow White for some reason, in a Homura way, I guess.  The cast is divided in 2: bad magical girls and good magical girls that protect Snow White.  Fav is a Monokuma-Kyubei clone and it\'s dumb.  Also, all of the cast get like 3 minutes of development prior to her deaths.  I\'m sorry, but this is not how you write a character.Sound 5/10I don\'t even remember the ending because I skipped it, generic.Art 6/10The designs were good, I must admit.  But I hate the placement.  They all fight in the city at night, and they don\'t do anything else.  Most of the fights develop in a building\'s ceiling.  Cool, I guess.Enjoyment 4/10Decent entertainment because you are trying to figure out who is going to get killled next...then the death flag appears.Overall 3/10Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a poor anime.  Bad story, bad writing, terrible characters.  Even the fans of gore will likely find amusement in another story.  Please avoid it at all costs. anyone and they will be followed no matter what.

Please avoid it at all costs.', 'So, I\'ll be honest with you, I was really hyped for this show. Sure, it was being done by a studio that isn\'t very well known, but the premise pulled me in. Studio Lerche also did a good job with  Magical girls fighting to the death. Sure, it probably wouldn\'t be a masterpiece, but at least it would give me what I expected. A good battle royale, kill-\'em-all. Sadly, that wasn\'t really what I got. Instead I got a boring piece of trash.Magical Girl Raising Project is about 16 girls who all become magical girls because of this mobile game. What a bunch of...casual gamer trash! They then have to compete among each other to survive. They compete by collecting magical candies that you get from helping people, although we never actually see these magical girls helping people. Kind of odd. They then turn to murdering each other, and the show forgets that the competition was about magical candies and helping people, not who can murder more people. Honestly, this side of the anime showed much more promise. Sadly, the show can\'t follow up on the potential and the disappointment was crushing. Despite this, there is one form of entertainment that the story brings to Raising Project. Laughing at how poorly executed it was.So, I\'ll be honest with you, again, after my expectations were crushed just like my will to live, at least the fight scenes could be decent, and I could have not TOTALLY wasted my time on this show. To quote Donald Trump-sama, ""Wrong"". Besides the fact that each and every fight in this anime that is literally about fighting each other is bad, they are also weighed down b the fact that Raising Project crams all of a characters development in ONE EPISODE. Bravo! So, the structure for an episode where someone dies basically goes like this. 2 characters fight. 1 beats the other. Right before said defeated character dies, all of her development is crammed into that 1 episode. To be fair, some characters that die didn\'t get the privilege of Studio Lerche giving them any development at all.Ok, so the protagonist probably doesn\'t deserve her own paragraph, but I don\'t know how to write so, eh. The protagonist of this instant classic (if you couldn\'t tell, that was sarcasm) is known as Snow White. As a protagonist, she fills many roles, like helping to move the pilot forward, like any good character. Unless you\'re a pussy and don\'t believe in murdering other people. Don\'t be a pussy like Snow White. She ultimately does nothing to advance the narrative, a horrible trait to have as protagonist. She is super whiny, which becomes a bore to watch after like, 1 second. So, yah, she sucks.[SPOILER ROUND]Yah, this show sucks. I think I\'ve established that. What I haven\'t established is some of the specifics of why this show sucks. Or basically, why the ending sucks. If you haven\'t seen the show, its best to skip this paragraph and go straight to my closing thoughts and scores. Let me just say, Magical Girl Raising Project was an interesting ride. It will most likely be one I remember for awhile, even if it is for the wrong reasons. I reached the end of the show, and there will only two girls left. Snow White (the whiny bitch), and Ripple (look at those tits!). One thing this show did well was character design. Ripple\'s design was always mediocre, but in the final scene, she actually looks badass. Of course, this scene takes place months after the events of Magical Girl Raising Project. Apparently, Ripple and Whiny Bitch have been helping people since Monokuma from Dangan Ronpa was destroyed. They fight, and the show ends at that. This is probably the best scene in the entire show, and is actually not half bad. It almost shows some synergy between the girls, and it is the nicest-looking scene in the show. The roller coaster ride is over, and it is now up to us, the community, to give our final judgement on the show.[CLOSING THOUGHTS]Magical Girl Raising Project was a clusterfuck that couldn\'t decide on what it really wanted to be. Did it want to deconstruct the genre, or be a simple battle royale? The character designs look nice, but I can\'t help feeling there wasn\'t one true vision behind them. Some look like big-titted hookers, while others look like traditional magical girls. Also, these are the most un-magical girl magical girls ever. Being one seems extremely lame. Wow, I get to jump around on buildings. And I also get to jump on buildings. And I guess murder people? If this show didn\'t call itself mahou shoujo, I would have never guessed. Slightly off-topic, but damn were there a lot of plot holes. Maybe not SAO-level plot holes, but still. Overall, this show was just kind of average. Nothing stands out as especially horrid, or good. Would I recommend it?

It admittedly lacks any sort of grace, yes, but if executed well, can work some wonders. Does MahoIku achieve that though? Actually, yes, mostly.There is reason for me to believe that the author is really, really clever, namely him bringing his A game to the table with conceptually smart ideas as far as the characters are concerned:- Ruler is among the hardworking elite on paper except life played her a different card and now she\'s stuck with making coffee and given her superior, one can\'t fault her too much for probably thinking she\'s the smartest person in the room. This, of course, leads to an inferiority complex and the strong desire to boss other people around, something her power does for her except it\'s specific enough for her to need help by other people. Ironically, several of her servants would argue she doesn\'t behave any different from her actual boss (which I\'d disagree with but oh well) and what causes her undoing is one of her subjects taking her orders too seriously at any given point of time.- Cranberry, on paper and in practice, is the strongest character around but due to her own tunnel vision of only seeking the strong, doesn\'t really accomplish any of her goals and gets killed by Tama, the weakest character who only ever strolled along.- Winterprison comes across as someone not very good at socializing apart from interacting with her lover Sister Nana, who, very much on the opposite end, takes socializing to the point where she genuinely believes that making friends in a death game would be the best way to go which goes down as badly as you\'d expect, with Winterprison sacrificing her own life to ensure Nana\'s survival who, however, couldn\'t live without Winterprison and chooses suicide instead. This was generally really well done as their romance was quite possibly the most genuine, heartfelt one I\'ve seen in 2016 and the characters had all the necessary build up for their conclusion to be quite a blow to the stomach.- Hardgore Alice is brilliant insofar as that everything from the first time she gets mentioned screams ""Surely she\'s a villain!"": She\'s the mysterious sixteenth person thrown into a death game, has an unhealthy obsession for the protagonist, kills someone in cold blood the moment she meets her, has the cloth of a dark goth girl and her name contains ""Hardgore"", albeit only because her powers lead to her getting turned to mincemeat but how were we supposed to know? The audience is with Snow White insofar as that almost everything revolving around Alice leads up to misinterpretation (fun fact: in the fanbook, she gets five stars for ""Wrong First Impression"") until you really get to know her and she\'s about the nicest girl in the universe. Her power also matches her greatly as in that he always wanted to die before meeting Snow White, yet can\'t in magical girl form, only to die in human form after finding hope for herself.- Calamity Mary, someone who\'s never been up to any good as someone who divorced her husband and hit her child, gets a companian through Magicaloid, who\'s a homeless teenage girl with no parents around. The writing sadly doesn\'t really do much with that but it\'s a cool thing on paper at least.- The family theme goes on with Ripple, someone who had a genuinely terrible family life, moved out and is now going through some hard times and Top Speed, someone who used to be a troublemaker in the past and can therefore relate to Ripple and wants her to change accordingly just like herself, now a soon-to-be (or not) loving mother. While Ripple\'s growth feels somewhat artificial (as she only really warms up a few second before Top Speed\'s death), it\'s generally neatly done.If anything, MahoIku really doesn\'t go by the numbers but at the same time, also doesn\'t construct and kill off its characters without rhyme or reason. Needless to say, being able to actually care about these characters is a good thing for an anime like this. Its setup is primitive in nature but that gets saved by the capable execution.Antagonist-wise, MahoIku plays some genuinely interesting cards as well yet overall leaves behind a bit of a lacking aftertaste though:- First we have Calamity Mary who fares really well - you\'re not supposed to like her but she manages to impress nonetheless. Her fight against Hardgore Alice is the smartest in the series and she gets incredibly thorough with it. She\'s clearly established as a strong threat from the very beginning on but is also level-headed to a certain degree or else she wouldn\'t have accepted Magicaloid or played GTA: Real Life Edition to get Top Speed and Ripple back on track. There\'s a bit of a system to her madness and that\'s a good thing. With all that said though, her getting offed by ninja stars just like that was quite a low point of the show.- Cranberry initially succeeds as the character we know nothing about other than her being a whole lot of trouble but her involvement with the other characters is so non-existent, it sure makes one wonder. She was passive enough with Winterprison to not get anything out of it, never even considered fighting Mary and her faux backstory gave us nothing on her before she left this world behind.- Swim Swim is a fascinating concept taken to the logical extreme and established a coup d\'etat we didn\'t really see coming but she gets stale after a while. She admittedly got some really good killings out of the show but practically offed six characters with the motivation of ""That one dead character once said this and that"". She\'s an unconventional villain no doubt but at some point, was only there to kill your favorite character (she got all three of mine, so there\'s that) and that felt rather lacklustre. It also severely limits the variancy among match-ups which became noticable every now and then.At the end of the day, I\'d still like to applaud MahoIku for being generally unconventional with its figures as that\'s a good thing.As MahoIku also features a good chunk of action, I\'d also like to mention that one\'s writing at least once as it positively stands out most of the time. Admittedly, there are some fights that felt like a grind (Mary vs Ripple) but in general, there is some creative use of tactics and gimmicks. A four on one battle such as with Winterprison is supposed to feel like a mess and with walls popping out of nowhere, someone\'s skull getting crushed (now THAT was satisfying to watch), the entire floor collapsing and an arm getting severed, MahoIku gets the job done. I\'ve also mentioned Mary vs Alice before and that one really should drive the point home that action certainly isn\'t one of MahoIku\'s weaknesses luckily.Which isn\'t to say that MahoIku is perfect and I do have a few issues with it:The first two episodes deliver on a really ungood package. Starting out the show with sixteen minutes of that one really bland protagonist who\'s obsessed with magical girls wouldn\'t sit well with anyone and even at the end of episode 02, all the anime had delivered on was that one twist we all saw coming. In general, these episodes\' biggest weakness is that they are very heavy on Snow White and she is really boring, she\'s the protagonist but refuses to be part of her own show to the point of being the least influential character around and while everyone was busy thinking and doing things, she just kind of moped around until the end of the show and that\'s it. I suppose it was for the better since her eating up screentime would have been disastrous due to how bland she was but I can\'t really say ""Way to go, protagonist, you were a vital and interesting element to the show!"". The less said about her the better.Some deaths towards the end also were all sorts of crammed in and felt like they just had to be there to write characters out of the show: I\'ve already mentioned Mary\'s and Cranberry\'s above so let\'s move past that but Top Speed\'s wasn\'t particularly stellar either. It had the element of surprise on its side but it was hard to get emotionally invested, as what followed was a really badly done battle with no conclusion, stretching the distance between the audience and Top Speed\'s death, leading to little more than Ripple staring in shock at Top Speed\'s corpse. Admittedly, the two of them got fantastic closure in episode 11 but the death itself was lacklustre to say the least. On that note, Swim Swim killing off Top Speed due to a surprise attack made little sense as it would have been smarter to get rid of Ripple first and Top Speed being good friends with Ruler really didn\'t go anywhere in regards to that. Going back to episode 03 and seeing Top Speed offer Swim Swim a ride, saying ""We\'re going to be good friends!"" is hilariously ironic though.Alice\'s death was also rather dumb as ""I can\'t focus to transform back into a magical girl"" was a really cheap excuse and while her flashback story started out promising, it really didn\'t go into the specifics or felt well-rounded, not to mention Snow White picking up her missing keys back in the beginning didn\'t quite carry as much weight as it should have and I felt all of that was really shallow and a disservice to her character.And then there\'s Sister Nana, someone who really should have kicked the bucket at the end of her own episode. With that said, these are five out of twelve deaths so you do the maths.There\'s also the issue of flashback stories being shoehorned in right before a character dies, making the flow of events really predictable. Frequently, the flashbacks themselves are effective at what they set out to do but the anime hardly gets to wow you over that one death you didn\'t see coming (there are some flashbacks not set right before the crucial moment though, take Mary\'s, Top Speed\'s or Tama\'s).Last but not least, Ripple and Snow White surviving was a rather foreseeable conclusion and while I think that MahoIku ending on a human coming of age note (Ripple having both a scar and Top Speed\'s cloak was neat symbolism and a reminder for her growth), it\'s still a bit of a shame we barely got any backgrounds on why any of this took place to begin with. Something less abstract than a vague two minutes infodump from Fav would have been preferable but oh well.Audiovisual Execution:Hey, guys, it\'s Lerche! Rings any bells? No? Well, let me name a bit of their TV output: P4, DeSu 2, Dangan Ronpa, MajiKoi, the Hamatora sequel and you\'re slowly but surely getting the gist that these guys are a small studio frequently running into production problems and while there have been laudable exceptions (hearsay has it Gakkou Gurashi is one of them, MonMusu had the Arve Rezzle/Muromi-san sakuga backing and Ranpo Kitan, while hardly outstandingly produced, was Kishi working stage play-esque wonders for the direction by not being directly involved with a single episode, don\'t ask me how that works), MahoIku unfortunately doesn\'t fall into the category of better looking anime.Which is not to say that it looks disastrous but occasionally, things do get really ugly, especially Ripple\'s first fight against Swim Swim which looked like shit and was insanely hard to follow and that\'s not a good thing. As far as battles in general are concerned, you\'re hardly in for any sakuga miracles and I can\'t recall a single one that was genuinely well-animated but for what it\'s worth, the action animation is passable. Not much to see there but hardly a collection of poorly put together stills and speedlines either. Every now and then, the anime even does bring some nice imagery to the table, take La Pucelle\'s/Snow White\'s rooftop scene or Top Speed and Ripple having their final goodbye and rarely, there\'s a bit more of slight stylization with its art going on but with all that said and done, you really are not watching this for the visuals.For what little can be said about it, the soundtrack is rather nice actually. There\'s hardly a standout piece that would come to your mind thinking of MahoIku\'s scoring but I\'ve kept a note in the back of my head to check out its OST upon its release as several of the darker/more urgent themes struck quite a tune with me.Bottom Line:At the end of the day, I feel like there\'s a lot I really, really like about this one but also some stuff that\'s kind of a downer. I just really do think that a better execution at times could have really saved the day but time constraints are a thing so most of it was probably hard to avoid.So yes, I do have my fair share of gripes with this anime as I think there are just too many flaws to get to an area where the really good stuff assembles but hey, at the end of the day, this is still among the best output in 2016 and this franchise has won me over to the point of getting to its source. Something that can\'t be said for most of the seasonal output out there. and, of course, girls, we all knew the cheap copycats would want to have a piece of the cake as well.Needless to say, I think stiff Madokants shouldn\'t really lose their heads over there being other things right next to their favorite title but what do I even know.In more recent news, the review itself features spoilers yet no scores and also doesn\'t mention Madoka since I figured that\'d be for the better.Writing:You know, I\'m really glad about what MahoIku isn\'t: This could have gone down the Akuma no Riddle or Mirai Nikki route of one cannon fodder after another challenging only the really boring protagonists and getting offscreened as a result but I\'m really glad it didn\'t and achieved what these two couldn\'t: Bringing to life a rather diverse, colorful cast of characters where you\'re actually inclined to pick your many favorites.Which brings us to this essentially being another Battle Royale-esque story following the very primitive principle of getting you to like a few characters and then taking them away from your clutches because now that\'s how you get an emotional reaction from your audience.

Actually, yes, mostly.There is reason for me to believe that the author is really, really clever, namely him bringing his A game to the table with conceptually smart ideas as far as the characters are concerned:- Ruler is among the hardworking elite on paper except life played her a different card and now she\'s stuck with making coffee and given her superior, one can\'t fault her too much for probably thinking she\'s the smartest person in the room. This, of course, leads to an inferiority complex and the strong desire to boss other people around, something her power does for her except it\'s specific enough for her to need help by other people. Ironically, several of her servants would argue she doesn\'t behave any different from her actual boss (which I\'d disagree with but oh well) and what causes her undoing is one of her subjects taking her orders too seriously at any given point of time.- Cranberry, on paper and in practice, is the strongest character around but due to her own tunnel vision of only seeking the strong, doesn\'t really accomplish any of her goals and gets killed by Tama, the weakest character who only ever strolled along.- Winterprison comes across as someone not very good at socializing apart from interacting with her lover Sister Nana, who, very much on the opposite end, takes socializing to the point where she genuinely believes that making friends in a death game would be the best way to go which goes down as badly as you\'d expect, with Winterprison sacrificing her own life to ensure Nana\'s survival who, however, couldn\'t live without Winterprison and chooses suicide instead. This was generally really well done as their romance was quite possibly the most genuine, heartfelt one I\'ve seen in 2016 and the characters had all the necessary build up for their conclusion to be quite a blow to the stomach.- Hardgore Alice is brilliant insofar as that everything from the first time she gets mentioned screams ""Surely she\'s a villain!"": She\'s the mysterious sixteenth person thrown into a death game, has an unhealthy obsession for the protagonist, kills someone in cold blood the moment she meets her, has the cloth of a dark goth girl and her name contains ""Hardgore"", albeit only because her powers lead to her getting turned to mincemeat but how were we supposed to know? The audience is with Snow White insofar as that almost everything revolving around Alice leads up to misinterpretation (fun fact: in the fanbook, she gets five stars for ""Wrong First Impression"") until you really get to know her and she\'s about the nicest girl in the universe. Her power also matches her greatly as in that he always wanted to die before meeting Snow White, yet can\'t in magical girl form, only to die in human form after finding hope for herself.- Calamity Mary, someone who\'s never been up to any good as someone who divorced her husband and hit her child, gets a companian through Magicaloid, who\'s a homeless teenage girl with no parents around. The writing sadly doesn\'t really do much with that but it\'s a cool thing on paper at least.- The family theme goes on with Ripple, someone who had a genuinely terrible family life, moved out and is now going through some hard times and Top Speed, someone who used to be a troublemaker in the past and can therefore relate to Ripple and wants her to change accordingly just like herself, now a soon-to-be (or not) loving mother. While Ripple\'s growth feels somewhat artificial (as she only really warms up a few second before Top Speed\'s death), it\'s generally neatly done.If anything, MahoIku really doesn\'t go by the numbers but at the same time, also doesn\'t construct and kill off its characters without rhyme or reason. Needless to say, being able to actually care about these characters is a good thing for an anime like this. Its setup is primitive in nature but that gets saved by the capable execution.Antagonist-wise, MahoIku plays some genuinely interesting cards as well yet overall leaves behind a bit of a lacking aftertaste though:- First we have Calamity Mary who fares really well - you\'re not supposed to like her but she manages to impress nonetheless. Her fight against Hardgore Alice is the smartest in the series and she gets incredibly thorough with it. She\'s clearly established as a strong threat from the very beginning on but is also level-headed to a certain degree or else she wouldn\'t have accepted Magicaloid or played GTA: Real Life Edition to get Top Speed and Ripple back on track. There\'s a bit of a system to her madness and that\'s a good thing. With all that said though, her getting offed by ninja stars just like that was quite a low point of the show.- Cranberry initially succeeds as the character we know nothing about other than her being a whole lot of trouble but her involvement with the other characters is so non-existent, it sure makes one wonder. She was passive enough with Winterprison to not get anything out of it, never even considered fighting Mary and her faux backstory gave us nothing on her before she left this world behind.- Swim Swim is a fascinating concept taken to the logical extreme and established a coup d\'etat we didn\'t really see coming but she gets stale after a while. She admittedly got some really good killings out of the show but practically offed six characters with the motivation of ""That one dead character once said this and that"". She\'s an unconventional villain no doubt but at some point, was only there to kill your favorite character (she got all three of mine, so there\'s that) and that felt rather lacklustre. It also severely limits the variancy among match-ups which became noticable every now and then.At the end of the day, I\'d still like to applaud MahoIku for being generally unconventional with its figures as that\'s a good thing.As MahoIku also features a good chunk of action, I\'d also like to mention that one\'s writing at least once as it positively stands out most of the time. Admittedly, there are some fights that felt like a grind (Mary vs Ripple) but in general, there is some creative use of tactics and gimmicks. A four on one battle such as with Winterprison is supposed to feel like a mess and with walls popping out of nowhere, someone\'s skull getting crushed (now THAT was satisfying to watch), the entire floor collapsing and an arm getting severed, MahoIku gets the job done. I\'ve also mentioned Mary vs Alice before and that one really should drive the point home that action certainly isn\'t one of MahoIku\'s weaknesses luckily.Which isn\'t to say that MahoIku is perfect and I do have a few issues with it:The first two episodes deliver on a really ungood package. Starting out the show with sixteen minutes of that one really bland protagonist who\'s obsessed with magical girls wouldn\'t sit well with anyone and even at the end of episode 02, all the anime had delivered on was that one twist we all saw coming. In general, these episodes\' biggest weakness is that they are very heavy on Snow White and she is really boring, she\'s the protagonist but refuses to be part of her own show to the point of being the least influential character around and while everyone was busy thinking and doing things, she just kind of moped around until the end of the show and that\'s it. I suppose it was for the better since her eating up screentime would have been disastrous due to how bland she was but I can\'t really say ""Way to go, protagonist, you were a vital and interesting element to the show!"". The less said about her the better.Some deaths towards the end also were all sorts of crammed in and felt like they just had to be there to write characters out of the show: I\'ve already mentioned Mary\'s and Cranberry\'s above so let\'s move past that but Top Speed\'s wasn\'t particularly stellar either. It had the element of surprise on its side but it was hard to get emotionally invested, as what followed was a really badly done battle with no conclusion, stretching the distance between the audience and Top Speed\'s death, leading to little more than Ripple staring in shock at Top Speed\'s corpse. Admittedly, the two of them got fantastic closure in episode 11 but the death itself was lacklustre to say the least. On that note, Swim Swim killing off Top Speed due to a surprise attack made little sense as it would have been smarter to get rid of Ripple first and Top Speed being good friends with Ruler really didn\'t go anywhere in regards to that. Going back to episode 03 and seeing Top Speed offer Swim Swim a ride, saying ""We\'re going to be good friends!"" is hilariously ironic though.Alice\'s death was also rather dumb as ""I can\'t focus to transform back into a magical girl"" was a really cheap excuse and while her flashback story started out promising, it really didn\'t go into the specifics or felt well-rounded, not to mention Snow White picking up her missing keys back in the beginning didn\'t quite carry as much weight as it should have and I felt all of that was really shallow and a disservice to her character.And then there\'s Sister Nana, someone who really should have kicked the bucket at the end of her own episode. With that said, these are five out of twelve deaths so you do the maths.There\'s also the issue of flashback stories being shoehorned in right before a character dies, making the flow of events really predictable. Frequently, the flashbacks themselves are effective at what they set out to do but the anime hardly gets to wow you over that one death you didn\'t see coming (there are some flashbacks not set right before the crucial moment though, take Mary\'s, Top Speed\'s or Tama\'s).Last but not least, Ripple and Snow White surviving was a rather foreseeable conclusion and while I think that MahoIku ending on a human coming of age note (Ripple having both a scar and Top Speed\'s cloak was neat symbolism and a reminder for her growth), it\'s still a bit of a shame we barely got any backgrounds on why any of this took place to begin with. Something less abstract than a vague two minutes infodump from Fav would have been preferable but oh well.Audiovisual Execution:Hey, guys, it\'s Lerche! Rings any bells? No? Well, let me name a bit of their TV output: P4, DeSu 2, Dangan Ronpa, MajiKoi, the Hamatora sequel and you\'re slowly but surely getting the gist that these guys are a small studio frequently running into production problems and while there have been laudable exceptions (hearsay has it Gakkou Gurashi is one of them, MonMusu had the Arve Rezzle/Muromi-san sakuga backing and Ranpo Kitan, while hardly outstandingly produced, was Kishi working stage play-esque wonders for the direction by not being directly involved with a single episode, don\'t ask me how that works), MahoIku unfortunately doesn\'t fall into the category of better looking anime.Which is not to say that it looks disastrous but occasionally, things do get really ugly, especially Ripple\'s first fight against Swim Swim which looked like shit and was insanely hard to follow and that\'s not a good thing. As far as battles in general are concerned, you\'re hardly in for any sakuga miracles and I can\'t recall a single one that was genuinely well-animated but for what it\'s worth, the action animation is passable. Not much to see there but hardly a collection of poorly put together stills and speedlines either. Every now and then, the anime even does bring some nice imagery to the table, take La Pucelle\'s/Snow White\'s rooftop scene or Top Speed and Ripple having their final goodbye and rarely, there\'s a bit more of slight stylization with its art going on but with all that said and done, you really are not watching this for the visuals.For what little can be said about it, the soundtrack is rather nice actually. There\'s hardly a standout piece that would come to your mind thinking of MahoIku\'s scoring but I\'ve kept a note in the back of my head to check out its OST upon its release as several of the darker/more urgent themes struck quite a tune with me.Bottom Line:At the end of the day, I feel like there\'s a lot I really, really like about this one but also some stuff that\'s kind of a downer. I just really do think that a better execution at times could have really saved the day but time constraints are a thing so most of it was probably hard to avoid.So yes, I do have my fair share of gripes with this anime as I think there are just too many flaws to get to an area where the really good stuff assembles but hey, at the end of the day, this is still among the best output in 2016 and this franchise has won me over to the point of getting to its source. Something that can\'t be said for most of the seasonal output out there.', ""Magical Girl Raising project is a good anime, though not for the faint of heart.The series wastes no time in giving us what we've all come for: Magical Girls killing each other.

It\'s little more than the Hunger Games with magical girls. That\'s it.

I just finished watching it and I found every twist and turn very exciting! It follows middle-school student Koyuki Himekawa who, after playing the social app ""Magical Girl Raising Project"", discovers she can become a magical girl. In total, there are 16 magical girls in the city. She soon discovers that Fav, the mascot character of the game, miscalculated the number of magical girls he\'d be able to accommodate for, and so has to half the number to eight. This starts of a simple competition, where each magical girl sees who can complete the most good...deeds in order to collect candy, and whoever has the least drops out. However, the rules soon become twisted, and the girls are forced into a much more sinister game. I think this set-up with the great twists and mysteries really made the story!Art7/10I found the art of this anime, although a bit basic, to be very pretty. The backgrounds are  excellently drawn, and the character designs are, overall,  very well done. However, there is one problem I did notice. Some of the character designs seemed a bit thrown together. Designs like Sister Nana and  Hardgore Alice were very simple and sweet, and looked like complete characters. But characters like La Pucelle and Swim Swim seemed a bit mis-matched in their designs. For example, Swim Swim had a swimming outfit, head phones, bunny patterns, bat wings and some weird wire things coming off if her. None of these elements were bad, but they didn\'t seem to go together at all, and ended up making her look messy.Sound6/10The intro to Mahou Shojou Ikusei Keikaku, Sakebe, wasn\'t anything remarkable. It wasn\'t a bad song by any means, and the animation that went with it was very nice, but it got a bit boring after a while and I found myself skipping it at the start of every episode. The same goes of the ending theme, Dream Catcher. They\'re both nice songs, but I didn\'t really feel like they fit the tone of the series at all.Character8/10The character were one of the best elements of this anime. Every single one had great personalities inside and outside of their magical girl forms. My particular favorites were Top Speed, Cranberry and Hardgore Alice. The reason these characters all stood out is because they all seemed like they were going to be very stock, but all ended up surprising me. Top Speed had a lot more depth and motivation than I thought she would, Cranberry wasn\'t just a basic hotheaded rival, and Hardgore Alice wasn\'t just a dull kuudere.

I have only watched the anime.I won\'t watch this again.---- Positives ----Although visual character design is peculiar, the art backing it up is good.Each character gets good quality art, except for Hardgore Alice\'s dress. The art quality is notable because of the wide variety of costumes drawn....Snow White stays a pacifist.She claims that she won\'t hurt anyone and she doesn\'t at any point in the series. Pacifist characters in Death Game series too often claim pacifism at the start only to make exceptions later on. Pacifism isn\'t a ""sometimes"" thing.Cranberry was voiced well.Voice acting all around is decent. Cranberry stands out as well-voiced.---- Negatives ----Overarching Negative : unguided Death Game disguised as Magical Girl genre.The root negative of this series is that, under the guise of being a Magical Girl series, it\'s a Death Game series that isn\'t guided by any author-level planning and is lacking any strong overarching themes. We get a situation, and we get some characters. Nothing is explored deeply and, instead, we watch the characters arbitrarily act after having wrenches thrown in their environment.Opportunity for cancel: No. An unguided series fails as a story on a fundamental level. This series needed at least one strong theme, but didn\'t have one.The violence is bloody and sharply differs from other scenes in the series.One moment there are magical girls, the next there are magical girls sent flying into concrete walls bleeding profusely from having their faces smashed. There are many such examples.Opportunity for cancel: No. I didn\'t understand the contrast here.Character backstories are almost entirely given too late.Backstories are mostly either given after the character has died or just before they die. We aren\'t given enough chance to care about many of the characters before they\'re killed off.Opportunity for cancel: Partially. At the rate that characters are focused on and then killed off, it makes the backstory a sort of poetic memorial, especially since they all lived differently - though if that\'s what this series was intentionally going for, that should have been made clearer by focusing on an overarching theme mentioning that these girls are all going to die.The characters are apparently-normal children in real life, but are somehow unremorseful when they kill.In particular, Swim Swim seems to be a grade-schooler in real life, yet she goes around killing the other magical girls without it seeming to bother her at all. She even participates in killing the magical girl that she admires (even after her death), on more-or-less of a whim fed to her in a dream by Nemurin.Opportunity for cancel: No. This personality distinction isn\'t explored in the series.The magical girls are almost all excessively bizarre (visual character design).Few of them actually look like magical girls. The rest are excessively bizarre, such as a girl in a dog costume and a girl with a large tail. There\'s a scantily-clad ninja and a robot too...Opportunity for cancel: No. I don\'t see what the motivation was behind the quirky character design. To some degree, their designs fit their personalities, but design still faltered.The series genre-hops before settling on an unfitting genre.It starts off as ""Become A Magical Girl"" and ""Trapped Inside A Game"" (with a twist, because it\'s a layered over the real world and they can transform back to normal - although they can never fully return to being normal people), then abruptly slides into ""Unwitting Death Game"" (sub-genre ""Nonsensical Bloodbath"").Opportunity for cancel: No. The characters don\'t spend enough actual effort talking about and coping with the genre changes. They just superficially try to talk things out before kicking the bucket (Sister Nana especially), or too readily resort to killing, in which case they haven\'t examined the genre changes.It turned into ""So Who\'s Going To Die Today?"".Once the series gets rolling, we have characters dying left and right, sometimes multiple characters per episode. At some point I had to stop mentally following any of the characters because I figured they were going to be murdered in another episode or two.Opportunity for cancel: No. The story doesn\'t initially present itself as this - Fav just keeps lowering the survival maximum, each time to the surprise of the participants. Without mental preparation, this makes it seem that characters are being killed off arbitrarily by the author.The final moments of the series attempt to bring back a weakly-explored theme.After everything that happens, the series ends with Snow White talking about becoming a strong magical girl, since that\'s always been her dream - even though it\'s been branded as childish. She seems to somehow avoid mentioning the bloodbath that just occurred - and that was pretty important to the story.Opportunity for cancel: No. The author just brushed aside the chaos and tried to pretend that it was all about a light-hearted, innocent theme all along. Snow White stays a pacifist.She claims that she won\'t hurt anyone and she doesn\'t at any point in the series. Pacifist characters in Death Game series too often claim pacifism at the start only to make exceptions later on. Pacifism isn\'t a ""sometimes"" thing.Cranberry was voiced well.Voice acting all around is decent. Cranberry stands out as well-voiced.---- Negatives ----Overarching Negative : unguided Death Game disguised as Magical Girl genre.The root negative of this series is that, under the guise of being a Magical Girl series, it\'s a Death Game series that isn\'t guided by any author-level planning and is lacking any strong overarching themes. We get a situation, and we get some characters. Nothing is explored deeply and, instead, we watch the characters arbitrarily act after having wrenches thrown in their environment.Opportunity for cancel: No. An unguided series fails as a story on a fundamental level. This series needed at least one strong theme, but didn\'t have one.The violence is bloody and sharply differs from other scenes in the series.One moment there are magical girls, the next there are magical girls sent flying into concrete walls bleeding profusely from having their faces smashed. There are many such examples.Opportunity for cancel: No. I didn\'t understand the contrast here.Character backstories are almost entirely given too late.Backstories are mostly either given after the character has died or just before they die. We aren\'t given enough chance to care about many of the characters before they\'re killed off.Opportunity for cancel: Partially. At the rate that characters are focused on and then killed off, it makes the backstory a sort of poetic memorial, especially since they all lived differently - though if that\'s what this series was intentionally going for, that should have been made clearer by focusing on an overarching theme mentioning that these girls are all going to die.The characters are apparently-normal children in real life, but are somehow unremorseful when they kill.In particular, Swim Swim seems to be a grade-schooler in real life, yet she goes around killing the other magical girls without it seeming to bother her at all. She even participates in killing the magical girl that she admires (even after her death), on more-or-less of a whim fed to her in a dream by Nemurin.Opportunity for cancel: No. This personality distinction isn\'t explored in the series.The magical girls are almost all excessively bizarre (visual character design).Few of them actually look like magical girls. The rest are excessively bizarre, such as a girl in a dog costume and a girl with a large tail. There\'s a scantily-clad ninja and a robot too...Opportunity for cancel: No. I don\'t see what the motivation was behind the quirky character design. To some degree, their designs fit their personalities, but design still faltered.The series genre-hops before settling on an unfitting genre.It starts off as ""Become A Magical Girl"" and ""Trapped Inside A Game"" (with a twist, because it\'s a layered over the real world and they can transform back to normal - although they can never fully return to being normal people), then abruptly slides into ""Unwitting Death Game"" (sub-genre ""Nonsensical Bloodbath"").Opportunity for cancel: No. The characters don\'t spend enough actual effort talking about and coping with the genre changes. They just superficially try to talk things out before kicking the bucket (Sister Nana especially), or too readily resort to killing, in which case they haven\'t examined the genre changes.It turned into ""So Who\'s Going To Die Today?"".Once the series gets rolling, we have characters dying left and right, sometimes multiple characters per episode. At some point I had to stop mentally following any of the characters because I figured they were going to be murdered in another episode or two.Opportunity for cancel: No. The story doesn\'t initially present itself as this - Fav just keeps lowering the survival maximum, each time to the surprise of the participants. Without mental preparation, this makes it seem that characters are being killed off arbitrarily by the author.The final moments of the series attempt to bring back a weakly-explored theme.After everything that happens, the series ends with Snow White talking about becoming a strong magical girl, since that\'s always been her dream - even though it\'s been branded as childish. She seems to somehow avoid mentioning the bloodbath that just occurred - and that was pretty important to the story.Opportunity for cancel: No. The author just brushed aside the chaos and tried to pretend that it was all about a light-hearted, innocent theme all along.', 'MAY HAVE SPOILERS FOR POSSIBLE VIEWERS OF MGRP:UNMARKED...Ahh...the magical girl genre. The innocence, the justice and more. It\'s just that there\'s one part of the magical girl genre we all know. The dark magical girl genre.Okay, you may say ""Oh my gosh, this is a copy of PMMM!""Nope.As a LN reader, I get offended when people compare MGRP to PMMM. They are nothing similar. One is about 16 magical girls and they get halved and the other is a totally innocent magical girl show.If you\'ve watched PMMM, at least give this a chance. I promise you, it\'s not that bad.Story:7Okay, the story is what you probably would expect. You have your ""weak"" main character(I say this because she does grow) and she turns into a magical girl. Then (huh!!!) everything quickly turns twisted. I have to say, thestory was kind of cliche. There are a lot of tropes in this series like, ""Childhood Friend"", ""Weak Main Character"" and etc. The anime sort of screwed up the ending by not telling us viewers why Snow and Ripple were fighting at the end and by also not introducing a certain character.Yes, the story is somewhat mediocre. But, as the episodes rolled on, I felt like it got better and better.So: RECAP: First half, weak. Second half, good. Ending, eh?Art:6Okay, guys, I\'m not an art person. Despite art being my minor, I can\'t draw. So please don\'t take this part as seriously as the other categories of the series. Okay, so I believe the art was okay. Wasn\'t bad, wasn\'t very good. The animation wasn\'t very fluid to me. It kinda just used exaggerated movements to depict action. During the fights, however, the animation is very fluid and is great.The character designs are actually pretty good. They represent the character that received the design.Sound:5Ok, just no. Why was this done like this?In the first episode, the music was decent to me. However, when they start repeating the music OVER and OVER, it gets very boring and tiring. To me, there are only like 6 songs in the soundtrack.Ok, see?1. Opening2. Ending3.Battle Theme4. Fun Theme5. Calamity Mary vs Ripple(Finally!)6. Sad ThemeThe ending and the opening were good, at least.The sound effects were good, as well, but the whole sound of the anime was very mediocre.Character:7The characters were good. Although the main character was sort of bland at this point in the MGRP series, the other main characters were reasonably developed, however, the went overboard on the backstories.Nothing else to say, really. The characters were not 3-dimensional, but weren\'t like cardboard either.Enjoyment:10This is the high-point of the anime. The theorizing about who dies next and who kills who is very fun. It\'s tragic when someone dies, but that\'s then enjoyable part of the series.Overall:7The series isn\'t that bad. Granted, it isn\'t very good either, but as an LN reader, I can tell you that the next few arcs do a way better job at composition and stuff. Ahh...the magical girl genre.

I believe a lot of the people who watched this especially with the cover art were not wanting an original story but some mindless drivel. However, I like stories that don't fall into the same model. The darker the better for me.The art is pretty and makes a great cognitive dissonance from the story.Both the OP song and the ED songs are wonderful and worth watching an episode just to hear them each time.The characters are...likable and easy to get attached to. And it is something I can see power watching again.  Solid ten from me. likable and easy to get attached to. And it is something I can see power watching again.  Solid ten from me."", ""You might notice this anime gets compared a lot to Madoka Magica, however, they aren't nearly the same thing. Madoka aims to be a deconstruction of the magical girl genre while magical girl isn't even the primary genre of Magical Girl Raising Project. It's a survival game anime, it just has magical girl characters, that's all. The magical girl concepts take the background really quick, in fact, you can probably show someone a random episode of this anime and they wouldn't even guess it's a magical girl anime, just eccentric girls dressed in weird clothes killing each other.So that's the kind of show this is...and you'd probably enjoy it for reasons you'd enjoy survival games. Seeing the cool fights and how characters go through the anxiety of the kill or be killed situation. How some of the characters want to find peaceful solutions, some wanting to go ahead with the killing game, how some betray the others and so on.From the beginning, the characterization was done really well even if all the characters are magical girls, there is even one guy who turned into a magical girl if you're interested in that. There are a variety of them with different personalities, designs and issues they deal with, particularly in their backstories. Certain character's actions are even quite shocking but then make sense if you think about it.The pacing for the first half of the anime was great in getting us to know the characters while building up to the major conflicts that will occur then having some interactions between to have us feel the characters. Unfortunately however, this fine pacing doesn't last. After approximately the halfway point, this series becomes really action focused, many character interactions and tension build up get rushed just to get to the kickass fights.The fights themselves are all good though, well paced long enough to show the abilities of the magical girls and seeing how one overcomes the other. Sometimes you can really feel the characters struggles and it's fun to see how the different match ups play out with them all being unique in their own way. It's just the problem is that many fights feel like they just come out of nowhere.Another problem with this series is how it can be predictable in most cases due to being formulaic(as I said, there are of course exceptions). Many characters get a tonne of death flags before well... their deaths. Usually in the form of some backstory reveal.Other than that, the art is pretty and there's nothing wrong with the animation. Get used to watching night time settings though, because that's what most of this show takes place during. The opening and ending songs are nice and although the scenes themselves have a lot of quiet moments, when the fights come, there are usually some epic music to enhance them.So that's it, this is a fairly good show although it could have been great. Perhaps it suffered the limitations of just being 1 cour, if it had been longer, they might have been able to take time with the tension build ups, have room for character interactions and explore their backstories without having them be blatant death flags.It is surprisingly great for an anime filled with cute girls however, so you might like to give Magical Girl Raising Project a go even if you aren't usually into those kinds of shows. I'll be giving this anime a 6/10, though keep in mind that a 6 is in now way bad. It just still has some problems and I just like to reserve higher scores for the amazing stuff. Maybe if this anime had fixed some problems mentioned and it had been 2 cours, it may even reach a 7 or 8. Well if you decide to pick this anime up and watch, enjoy. and you'd probably enjoy it for reasons you'd enjoy survival games.

Now at the end I must say I am deeply impressed by this series as it has exceeded all my expectations.Do not watch this expecting to be Madoka, some characters might look similar but this is a whole different story. Although in Madoka, none of the magical girls know about the world they live in, here all but the main character know about the world they live in and the...twisted personalities.In my opinion this is a psychological masterpiece. This anime manages to portray society with 16 characters, amazing indeed. To really understand this anime you need know know a bit of psychology. You have abusive characters, you have deeply sociopathic characters which get abused by the abusive ones (as in real life this does not go well), you have the transgender type and the lesbian couple (bold in my opinion to be portrayed in anime). You have relationships between these characters, however the relationships and character development is portrayed very short throughout the anime but in a enough quantity to understand the character. How much can you fit in 12 episodes and 16 characters?The main character, although fundamentally reminds of Madoka, in fact she is very different and also exhibiting psychopathic (not sociopathic) traits having little empathy for what is happening to people around her. Should there be a second season, she will be explored more.The art is good, lighting is very well made, the emphasis on the eyes of different characters is very nice also. Some key battle scenes contain flashbacks of the protagonists so it kind of breaks the rhythm if you will.Also I think the biggest negative aspect is the predictability of the person who is going to die, most episodes contain a flashback of the next to die at the beginning. The element of surprise could have been better made in my opinion. As for music, I really liked the end and beginning songs, apart from this nothing special in my book.Again from a psychological point of view the portrayal of certain personalities is top notch. It will be an emotional roller-coaster, you will love characters, some are funny as hell and lovable without being lollis,  you will deeply hate others and wait for the next episode in hope they will die...in blood since it's fitting for them, wait I sound weird....but yes, it's how this anime plays with your emotions.

It has the moe-like characters, and the innocent Magical Girl era through the beginning until it takes a turn to a more dark atmosphere. You can\'t help but feel attracted to it, as if, you\'re being pulled in. This anime is beyond the best.Snow White reminds me of Madoka. La Pucelle reminds me of Sayaka. Ripple reminds of Homura. Top Speed reminds me of Mami. Pon reminds me of Kyubey. Not sure who the other characters remind me of, but it just brought...me those Madoka Magica feels during Raising Project. No words, I cried at the deaths of Weiss Winterprison, Sister Nana, Top Speed, and La Pucelle. My personal favorites were Ripple and Weiss, I have to say, the designs were perfectly well done. The music was catchy, the opening was amazing. Each episode, brought chills up my spine and you can\'t help but keep watching since you want to know what happens next. Cranberry and Swim Swim weren\'t obviously my favorites, but the other Magical Girl\'s pasts were just... I was speechless. I was just mindblown. Tama\'s past was the one that made me cry the most, and Ripple\'s as well. You couldn\'t blame poor Ripple for punching those who said those horrible things. Neither could you blame Tama, she was doing her best at everything she could!La Pucelle was a character that you could enjoy and a character that you could think of in a romantic relationship with the caring and sweet, Snow White. It was a shame Cranberry came in... That, by far, was my only favorite pairing in the whole anime. Otherwise, everything of this Magical Girl anime is the best. It\'s amazing. You can\'t unsee this, the second time you watch it, you\'ll start to feel attached to one of the Magical Girls. Obviously enough, it was like Madoka Magica. I DO NOT like Pon, at all.

Since this is based off a light novel, the plot was slightly compressed, but still works well.Art: 10The art just perfectly hits the line between realism, and cel shading. Characters are drawn in a traditional anime style, but scenery, such as buildings, trees, and roads, are drawn to be extremely realistic.Sound: 10The OP and ED are amazing (especially the ED)! The soundtrack also matched the animation....Character: 8MSIK has a bunch of characters, each with unique personalities and powers. They range from sweet yet crazy little girls to sociopathic adults. However, some of the minor characters were given much more screentime, but not a lot of characterization.Enjoyment: 8MSIK was a pretty good anime for me. Some parts felt a little slow and boring, but with the constant battles and deaths, there are always parts where you're left wondering what will happen next.

Without looking much up, I went for the show, and just downed it in one go. While it did manage to keep me up overnight, and I was certainly not wrong about the serious topic issue, it just.. took too many of them off the shelf to the point of becoming both melodramatic...and extremely predictable.Story - 2The story went just a slippery slope downhill and it felt incredibly forced in the direction it was going. I feel like the creator was really trying to imitate Madoka Magica, but failed miserably. as the story lacked thrill due to its predictability, frequent nonsensicalness, and just flat out melodrama. The premise and initial information gets quickly derailed into something that initially wasn\'t there, resulting in more plot holes than swiss cheese.I can\'t give it higher than a 2. The only thing that was good was the initial premise and the idea behind it. Too many shows these days do that - fantastic concept, horrible flow.Art - 7Nothing special, but the art was quite gorgeous at points. It didn\'t delve deep into aesthetic and atmosphere, but I liked its looks.Sound - 5It wasn\'t... memorable? There was nothing ear-catching nor off-putting about the sound. I liked the ending theme, but the opening theme was very run-of-the-mill. Medioce rating for that.Character - 3While the characters could\'ve been the strongest aspect of the show, and one of them was a reason why I finished the series in the first place, more often than not they were shallow and underdeveloped and some of them were very confusing.The show merely didn\'t let the characters grow as people, or grow in attachment to us. This was because the show was very rushed, or well... yeah the characters got killed too fast.Another big problem there was is that very often the characters\' objectives became nonsensical or questionable. It\'s almost as if a simple story got the better of them and made them just be slaves of the story, rather than players in the story.Finally, a big flaw is the story\'s main character. She isn\'t even important for half of the series, just happens to be there at the end. Props for not making her overpowered as shit I guess though???Enjoyment - 4 [completely personal section for me]Surprisingly, the show was decently enjoyable. Mainly because of the few characters I liked some of the characters, and because it was 5AM.It doesn\'t make you cringe on every centimeter, that\'s for sure, but it does look back on critical hindsight. The plotholes and nonsense were annoying at worst, not frustrating as I feel with some shows after a few episodes. It\'s watchable, but not something I would talk about for longer than a day.Overall - 3 - Poor [4 - Bad]Had the show fleshed out the characters more before parting them, kept more of them in the game - or had fewer to begin with, it would make the show far more enjoyable and exciting. Clarifiying some characters\' objectives, and not making them slaves of the story, would also help this show greatly.I recommend for: If you are flat out looking for downhill drama, I guess?

I\'m going to do my best not to drop spoilers, and if you liked this thing you\'re entitled to your opinion, but god. Just christ almighty.Story: 2/10I\'m going to say this as someone who enjoyed DanganRonpa, marginally enjoyed Mirai Nikki, and is always looking for interesting Deadly Game type stories. This story was... garbage. All the twists were clearly visibly...from a mile away, characters didn\'t get background until they either a) Died or b) were about to die. The story itself just felt like it was checking boxes. Heartbreaking friend death, innocent child\'s death, etc. The plot has a nasty habit of jumping to one character, focusing solely on them for episodes, then completely ignoring them. You\'ll spend episodes with a character or three, watch a few die, then never learn that they had prior obligations or anything until 3 episodes later. I know that they only had 12 episodes to get this barely-a-story across, but honestly, I don\'t think they would\'ve benefited from any extra episodes. A lot of this stuff felt gore-porn-y and torture-porn-y, and relying too heavily on those tropes destroyed any interest this could\'ve had for me. It failed to deliver on the premise that made it so promising.In other words, it was trying so hard to be edgy while also collecting tropes and attempting weird character skips that the plot essentially evaporated.Art: 2/10I\'m sorry, I know a lot of the reasons people picked up this thing was because of the cute art, and I will agree that sometimes it has its moments! But the mascot looked, sounded, and acted like some combination of Monokuma and Kyuubey, to the point I could\'ve just switched one for either of the others and the plot would\'ve been the same. Also, and this is more of a personal thing here, I absolutely hated how every girl looked like she was 12. We have characters in their late teens, 20\'s, and early 30\'s and possibly 40\'s here and they all look like they aren\'t a day out of elementary school. It\'s especially bothering considering they were capable of drawing adult looking characters, clearly pointed out by the amount of civilians who look normal! And god, the magical girl outfits. I absolutely hated almost every single one. They were clunky, boring, too busy, all sex appeal or just plain bland. Out of 16 magical girls I think I only liked about 2 or 3 of the outfits (Magicaloid is a robot, and therefore I\'m not sure if she counts as an ""outfit"" but she was one of the designs I found interesting.) The artists clearly struggled with making good color palettes here, because the colors too were either so pastel the character looked washed out or clashy and uncoordinated. This might sound like too much time to spend griping about character outfits, but a lot of magical girl anime\'s charm is the cute outfits, and as that feels like it falls under art, I wanted to critique it here. MSKI didn\'t even fall short within my expectations. It fell 1000 feet away from my expectations.In shorter terms, everyone regardless of age looks like a middle schooler, making this uncomfortably like a child gore show. Also outfits were ugly.Sound: 4/10Not a lot to say here. Pretty standard magical girl soundtrack. Wasn\'t terrible, wasn\'t jaw dropping good, generally fit whatever mood the story was struggling to convey.Character: 1/10I\'m prefacing this with, usually, if a character\'s personality/writing is good I can ignore lazy writing. But they were not good at all. It was impossible to care about any of these characters whatsoever, because all the background we got on them was seconds before they died. I can\'t miss a character if there\'s nothing to be missed. Haphazardly throwing in things like ""oh she\'s pregnant!"" or ""oh they\'re dating!"" moments before death or episodes after isn\'t development. There\'s no meat to the characters, there\'s nothing to actually hold onto and fall in love with. They\'re all basically just bloodbags for the plot to rip open so it can deliver on the ""Ohh uwu edgy"" that it keeps trying to tell you it\'ll deliver. A character who gets exposition and expanded on moments before or after their death is not a round, fleshed out character. They\'re just a flat character with something tragic pinned on them to try and get audiences to care. Backgrounds aside, the personalities were bland and trope-y. We\'ve got the god-complex girl, the crazy girl, the naive girl, the stupid girl, the NEET girl, on and on. Everyone fits a trope. It wouldn\'t be bad if they had tried to subvert the tropes, but they didn\'t try at all. And that\'s not bad either. Unless you\'re trying to market a diverse group of magical girls.Shorter: Boring characters with shoddy ""development.""And while I\'m under characters, I\'d like to take a moment to talk about Snow White. Despite being the headliner character, she\'s almost completely absent, only showing up to cry to whoever is going to die for her this time about how little she wants to kill and how oh so cruel it is that they\'re in a killing game. It gets annoying. She never toughens up, she never tries to protect anyone, all she does it watch while her friends go down for her one by one, give up their lives so she can live another day, then she just cries about it. Now, arguably, she also has one of the weakest magics, but come on. She\'s a magical girl! She can still punch and kick, and for over half the crew that\'s all you really needed to do to get them to step off. I found myself actually feeling nauseous every time I saw her face, because all she did was whine and complain and cry and every time she did I knew whatever magical girl was with her at the time was definitely toast. She\'s like a banshee, if you hear her start to cry about how cruel whats-it\'s-face the mascot is, or how she didn\'t want being a magical girl to turn out like this, you know any other character within earshot of her is completely boned. She\'s a boring and bland protagonist that only serves as a red flag that someone in the scene with her is gonna die.Enjoyment: 1/10I think the paragraphs above accurately portray how I felt about this show. I took a 5 minute break from this show and ended up having a 4 minute existential crisis, so take that how you will.Overall: 2/10The extra point here is from sound. Overall, this was a godawful experience for me, and I write this in the hope it\'s a warning akin to my head on a pike in front of the wasteland of this anime.

""Entertaining, but forgettable."" is the best way to quickly describe this anime.There are quite a few things people miss about this show, and I am writing this review to stress that enjoyment of MGRP requires an open mind. Don\'t make the mistake of trying to compare MGRP to other ""Dark Mahou Shoujo"" titles like Madoka or Yuuki Yuuna, because MGRP isn\'t really similar to either of them. If anything, this show is more like western literature and bares extreme similarities to novels such as The Hunger games or even Maze runner. Calling MGRP ""Hunger Games with magical...girls"" wouldn\'t be that far off and you could even stop reading all the reviews here and decide whether or not to watch this show on that note alone, so I will write the rest of this review on a pro/con mindset.-=Things the show does wrong / CONS=-The characters themselves aren\'t all fleshed out into good enough detail. It did an OK job with what it had, but when you have a ton of characters in a 12 episode show it\'s not easy to give each of them enough spotlight to care about them. MGRP certainly tries, and succeeds with a few characters, but with the majority of them you really feel nothing when they die because the show didn\'t do enough with them. Sometimes you will find yourself thinking ""Oh not her! I Liked her!"" and other times you will be ""Oh she died. Literally who?""Another problem with the show is the order in which the characters die works against the pacing of the story. Some of the poorly designed characters should have died sooner, while some of the better characters should have been more drawn out and killed later to make for a more climactic ending. Instead MGRP tries to go a more random route with some of the most boring characters of all managing to survive for far longer than their due date. While this makes the story more ""realistic"", realistic doesn\'t always mean good and this is one of those cases where it certainly does not. While the overall story is decent, they could have made the plot FAR more emotionally involved and FAR more interesting if they developed some of the girls better and made their interactions less predictable. In this sense, MGRPs biggest con is that it is wasted potential. This anime could have easily been topping the charts with just slightly better writing.-=Things the show does right / PROS=-For all its troubles, this anime actually does have a coherent plot. And if you pay attention to the details in between all the blood and guts, you will notice it also surprisingly has decent world building when you piece the puzzles together. This is the part where I believe a lot of people miss out on enjoying the show, because the answers to the questions the show raises are there but subtle. For instance, hints are dropped all over the show about the magical society behind the scenes. Without spoiling anything, this mage society here in fact operates very similar to the magicians society of Type Moon fanfare. Calculating and efficient, but ultimately cold blooded and unsympathetic towards the plight of non-mages. Once you understand it, you will find it all fits together quite nicely and requires a lot less suspension of disbelief than the average installment to the Mahou Shoujo genre. Again, it does require you to actually pay attention to the parts that at first might seem boring, but it\'s worth it.The final good note of MGRP is that it goes all in on the dark theme. Often times shows try to be dark and edgy but they wuss out on the blood and guts in order to try and appease a broader audience. MGRP doesn\'t do this and deserves respect for being front about it. Limbs will fly, heads will get chopped off, and pools of blood will be all over your screen. It\'s good mindless humor so if you are a fan of that kind of thing this show is definitely worth a watch. girls"" wouldn\'t be that far off and you could even stop reading all the reviews here and decide whether or not to watch this show on that note alone, so I will write the rest of this review on a pro/con mindset.-=Things the show does wrong / CONS=-The characters themselves aren\'t all fleshed out into good enough detail.

Now finally, we have one that can be labelled great. I present to you Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (Magical Girl Raising Project),the best elimination game/battle royale show since 2012\'s Fate/Zero.One aspect which the show does really well is that there is very equal distribution of screen-time amongst the characters. This series avoids the all too common pitfall of battle royale series focusing too much on one character and...setting them up to obvious be the ""good guy"" and win against a horde of ""bad guys"". Of course. this series has a protagonist, but she does not influence the main plot very much in comparison to many of the other characters, and the motivations and psyche of the side-characters are explored as well.The cast is really diverse. Though technically they are all magical girls, their real-life personas are that of a lesbian couple, an alcoholic divorcee, a salarywoman, a politician\'s housewife, twins studying in university, a grade schooler, an actual boy, and so on and on. Some are total psychopaths, some are useless white-knights, some are morally grey characters.Viewers can see a character dying way before it happens. But I think it is justified as killing a character out of nowhere would bring complains that there is no viewer attachment to that particular character. And for a show with only a runtime of 12 episodes and having more characters than episodes to kill, I think it did its best in utilising it\'s runtime in making the viewers care for the characters. Most of the deaths were impactful to me, which is very impressive given the number of characters and the very short amount of time to forge a connection.The show never aimed to create any suspense about whether a character would die. It was more of when, not if. No character is safe, no plot amour exists here. I got sick to the stomach and dead inside repeatedly seeing characters I cared about dying over and over.The fights are short and quick, there\'s no monologuing in battles; the girls don\'t stand and gloat over their opponents before finishing them off. In fact, in most cases, the causes of death is just a sudden split-second hit. There\'s no long drawn-out scenes of magical girls beating the shit out of each other (unlike basically every Hollywood superhero film nowadays) and it really highlights the danger and the power of the magical girls. One hit and you are dead. A moment of hesitation, a moment of distraction, that\'s all the difference. In other shows, characters can take crazy amounts of hits and damage, but here, out of nowhere, holy fuck they died?Don\'t go into the show comparing it to Madoka. While it does have a lot of similarities, the key concepts are vastly difference and it is a fantastic watch regardless.I don\'t rate my anime as 7 is average unlike most people on MAL. 5 is average, 6 is good and so on. So this rating of 8 means a lot.Definitely anime of the year. Criminally underrated. setting them up to obvious be the ""good guy"" and win against a horde of ""bad guys"".

Yes, since it\'s the type of show I like. However, even if you don\'t like it, you might want to give the show at shot. Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is one of the few survival death games shows where the participants involved actually had enough characterization for the show make me care about some of the characters.I think that this show had some potential to be as good as something like Puella Madoka. The reason why it doesn\'t comes down to a few factors: the pacing, art...style, animation, and execution of a lot of the scenes in the show.These problems kind of intertwine with each other. The main reason why I liked this show to begin with had to definitely be because of the fact that the prologue to the free-for all death battle was actually really slow paced. The first 4-5 episodes were actually just setup for the actual free-for all battle to come, and that was what made the characters not complete pieces of cardboard when they started battling each other. With the slow pacing in the beginning, it doesn\'t come off as edgy compared to the shows that just start off with killing each other. Oh boy, well, it does definitely become edgy as hell. However, for the beginning of the show, I think that the various alliances and relationships of all the characters are delineated quite well, and is definitely one of the main factors for the show\'s success. I mean, it\'s really hard to have 16 relevant characters, let alone in just a 4-5 episodes. Puella Madoka clearly has an easy time of having good character development because there\'s only like, 4 characters to worry about in 12 episodes. It\'s also the main reason why death game shows tend to be more shallow and have way less character depth. It\'s true. However, despite all odds, this show, given the cards that they were dealt with, manages to make the best use of their time to try introducing so many characters in so little time.That said, the second half of the show is quite fast paced, and a lot of the battles don\'t have much impact because they occur at such fast timing. There\'s not much investigating into a person\'s powers, and nor is there any scouting out opponents. It\'s more like, people agree to fight in a specific location, or one party manages to track down the other party with no explanation. That\'s one of the main reasons why a lot of the times that people die in this show don\'t have as much impact as they should. Still, when people died or backstabbed one another, it was still pretty intense, and I myself had moments when a character lived or died.Of course, pacing is way too fast, but the other problem is the execution of all of these battles. See, what Puella Madoka beats in this show tenfold is the atmosphere. When this show has battles to the death, it doesn\'t feel like it. There doesn\'t seem to be any tension in a lot of the scenes. This is mainly due to animation costs. The fights and backgrounds, and any character facial movements are so simplistic and low-cost that it actually cheapens the scenes by a large amount. The framing, the backgrounds, the perspective changes, and the pacing of a lot of the serious scenes in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is one of the reasons why these dark scenes stick and are memorable. This show kind of has no such impact and has no memorable scenes. In fact, it\'s kind of difficult to ""just"" blame the poor animation, since the damn lighting is so bright. Why is every fight so bright when it\'s at night? I usually complain that shows use too dark of a color pallete when it comes to horror/gore, but this show has such bright lighting despite almost every single fight occurring at night. It really dampens the mood when the show should be, well, dark. Another thing is voice acting. It\'s not that good. A lot of the lines that are said that should have been serious turn into more of something that\'s reminiscent of a comedic skit just because it\'s so badly delivered sometimes. An example:""She\'s going to kill everyone if I don\'t stop her.""""Seriously?""The ""seriously"" line was delivered as if the other party said she was breaking up with her boyfriend or something, not one that entails a battle to the death. Of course, some of this can be due to the ridiculous naming. Calamity Mary, Swim Swim, WinterPrison, Cranberry, and a lot more cringe names are used in serious scenes, and it just makes me laugh instead of thinking that it\'s serious.Other than that, there\'s the edginess of this show: it is high. It is sometimes cringe, but mostly, it\'s edgy. But, hey, it makes sense. Unlike other shows where people are edgy and stupid for no reason, this show has a really good reason. A lot of girls picked with a lot of different backgrounds were deliberately picked. No difference there, but girls were picked in various age groups, so you\'ll literally be having high school students fighting elementary students, and middle school students fighting mothers. Most of all, a lot of these girls were picked because they were crazy, while others were picked because they fit the role as orthodox magic girls.  I enjoy the character variation. Some girls are smarter than others, while some possess different mindsets and resolutions to kill other people. Other girls are just outright insane. Actually, despite not liking the pacing or animation of a lot of the fight scenes, the actual contents of them are well made. It\'s usually not just a ""1 on 1,"" and there\'s definitely a lot of different sorts of fights, with a lot of variations depending on which characters are present, and what powers are available to them. You definitely do not get bored from all of the different fights. Usually, most of the girls fight really inefficiently, or just plain stupid, and it\'s only near the end where fights become more and more between experienced players familiar with their powers. And it makes a lot of sense considering that many of the characters are different ages motivations, and powers.Lastly, I suppose I\'ll talk about the main character. While other main characters in shows may piss you off because they\'re a super generic shounen protagonist whose only trait is that they\'re ""kind to their friends,"" this show has a main character, in my mind, was deliberately made to piss you off the most. She was definitely created to be hated. While other main characters have plot armor in the form of OP powerups, our MC has powerful plot armor in that she just survives. Without spoiling anything, I can\'t say anymore, but of course the MC survives. In fact, there\'s a girl pair that I think is deliberately written to mirror the MC and even her companion, but since they\'re not the main characters, they die off in a pretty predictable manner. But not for Snow White! She will survive. Snow White really was such a hateable character, but since that\'s what I think was the point, she\'s a well written character. She\'s weak willed, powerless, and our one and only main character. When she survives instead of another character that actually had some motivation, to survive and the powers to back it up, you really wished that she survived instead of Snow White.Overall, this show only adapts one volume of the quite long Light Novel series. I enjoyed this series so far, so I will give it a read, but I really do wonder what made the novel series rush the beginning so much. If this show was spread into maybe, 24 episodes, it probably would have worked out perfectly, pacing wise. I definitely hope that the rushing of the story gets justified in the plot that follows in volume 2. style, animation, and execution of a lot of the scenes in the show.These problems kind of intertwine with each other. The main reason why I liked this show to begin with had to definitely be because of the fact that the prologue to the free-for all death battle was actually really slow paced. The first 4-5 episodes were actually just setup for the actual free-for all battle to come, and that was what made the characters not complete pieces of cardboard when they started battling each other. With the slow pacing in the beginning, it doesn\'t come off as edgy compared to the shows that just start off with killing each other. Oh boy, well, it does definitely become edgy as hell. However, for the beginning of the show, I think that the various alliances and relationships of all the characters are delineated quite well, and is definitely one of the main factors for the show\'s success. I mean, it\'s really hard to have 16 relevant characters, let alone in just a 4-5 episodes. Puella Madoka clearly has an easy time of having good character development because there\'s only like, 4 characters to worry about in 12 episodes. It\'s also the main reason why death game shows tend to be more shallow and have way less character depth. It\'s true. However, despite all odds, this show, given the cards that they were dealt with, manages to make the best use of their time to try introducing so many characters in so little time.That said, the second half of the show is quite fast paced, and a lot of the battles don\'t have much impact because they occur at such fast timing. There\'s not much investigating into a person\'s powers, and nor is there any scouting out opponents. It\'s more like, people agree to fight in a specific location, or one party manages to track down the other party with no explanation. That\'s one of the main reasons why a lot of the times that people die in this show don\'t have as much impact as they should. Still, when people died or backstabbed one another, it was still pretty intense, and I myself had moments when a character lived or died.Of course, pacing is way too fast, but the other problem is the execution of all of these battles. See, what Puella Madoka beats in this show tenfold is the atmosphere. When this show has battles to the death, it doesn\'t feel like it. There doesn\'t seem to be any tension in a lot of the scenes. This is mainly due to animation costs. The fights and backgrounds, and any character facial movements are so simplistic and low-cost that it actually cheapens the scenes by a large amount. The framing, the backgrounds, the perspective changes, and the pacing of a lot of the serious scenes in Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica is one of the reasons why these dark scenes stick and are memorable. This show kind of has no such impact and has no memorable scenes. In fact, it\'s kind of difficult to ""just"" blame the poor animation, since the damn lighting is so bright. Why is every fight so bright when it\'s at night? I usually complain that shows use too dark of a color pallete when it comes to horror/gore, but this show has such bright lighting despite almost every single fight occurring at night. It really dampens the mood when the show should be, well, dark. Another thing is voice acting. It\'s not that good. A lot of the lines that are said that should have been serious turn into more of something that\'s reminiscent of a comedic skit just because it\'s so badly delivered sometimes. An example:""She\'s going to kill everyone if I don\'t stop her.""""Seriously?""The ""seriously"" line was delivered as if the other party said she was breaking up with her boyfriend or something, not one that entails a battle to the death. Of course, some of this can be due to the ridiculous naming. Calamity Mary, Swim Swim, WinterPrison, Cranberry, and a lot more cringe names are used in serious scenes, and it just makes me laugh instead of thinking that it\'s serious.Other than that, there\'s the edginess of this show: it is high. It is sometimes cringe, but mostly, it\'s edgy. But, hey, it makes sense. Unlike other shows where people are edgy and stupid for no reason, this show has a really good reason. A lot of girls picked with a lot of different backgrounds were deliberately picked. No difference there, but girls were picked in various age groups, so you\'ll literally be having high school students fighting elementary students, and middle school students fighting mothers. Most of all, a lot of these girls were picked because they were crazy, while others were picked because they fit the role as orthodox magic girls.  I enjoy the character variation. Some girls are smarter than others, while some possess different mindsets and resolutions to kill other people. Other girls are just outright insane. Actually, despite not liking the pacing or animation of a lot of the fight scenes, the actual contents of them are well made. It\'s usually not just a ""1 on 1,"" and there\'s definitely a lot of different sorts of fights, with a lot of variations depending on which characters are present, and what powers are available to them. You definitely do not get bored from all of the different fights. Usually, most of the girls fight really inefficiently, or just plain stupid, and it\'s only near the end where fights become more and more between experienced players familiar with their powers. And it makes a lot of sense considering that many of the characters are different ages motivations, and powers.Lastly, I suppose I\'ll talk about the main character. While other main characters in shows may piss you off because they\'re a super generic shounen protagonist whose only trait is that they\'re ""kind to their friends,"" this show has a main character, in my mind, was deliberately made to piss you off the most. She was definitely created to be hated. While other main characters have plot armor in the form of OP powerups, our MC has powerful plot armor in that she just survives. Without spoiling anything, I can\'t say anymore, but of course the MC survives. In fact, there\'s a girl pair that I think is deliberately written to mirror the MC and even her companion, but since they\'re not the main characters, they die off in a pretty predictable manner. But not for Snow White! She will survive. Snow White really was such a hateable character, but since that\'s what I think was the point, she\'s a well written character. She\'s weak willed, powerless, and our one and only main character. When she survives instead of another character that actually had some motivation, to survive and the powers to back it up, you really wished that she survived instead of Snow White.Overall, this show only adapts one volume of the quite long Light Novel series.

I definitely hope that the rushing of the story gets justified in the plot that follows in volume 2.', ""Spoilers in the review are kept to a minimal, though proceed with caution if you are about to read this before watching the show.While there is normally at least one ‘Battle Royale (or Hunger Games if you want something more familiar)-esque show’, with Mirai Nikki having set the trend, even that show has been more or less a way for critics to circle jerk all day because of how bad it is. Sadly, this has been true for a lot of anime that has attempted to follow its foots steps: Fate/Zero had amazing potential if three quarters of the whole show hadn’t been spent on...dialogue, Fate/Stay Night (lumping both its Ufotable and Deen counterparts respectively) was basically a cocky writer thinking that any plot convenient tool can be passed as high art, Danganronpa was well… Danganronpa, and Big Order was basically Mirai Nikki if none of the staff working on it gave a flying fuck about quality control!And thanks to studio Lerche (who ironically created that piece of cancer called Dangonronpa which I still refuse to watch) we finally got a decent Battle Royal anime show – which I suppose it’s better late than never, but this is modern anime we’re talking about.Okay, if you’re already getting annoyed now that I am referring the term ‘battle royale’ as ‘battle royal’, I’ve done five seconds of research: http://grammarist.com/spelling/battle-royal/Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Raising Project (half of the English title) as I would rather prefer to call it, has actual character depth and development, in the sense that you actually get to know who these magical girls are as people and not just cute girls doing cute things – you get to know how they live their daily lives, how they treat the people around them and how their personal experiences influence their actions as Magical girls. Despite some of the characters being archetypal, there seems to be a significant portion of the cast where you can see that person as a somewhat viable human being which expands on the archetype, something I rarely see in anime, since most archetypes are just cookie cutter placeholders for either clichés or ‘cute girls doing cute things’.What really separates Raising Project when compared its (mostly!) retarded battle royal counterparts is that rather than ‘only one can be claimed victor’, there should be ‘some survivors’ of the whole battle royal ordeal to be claimed as winners. This little gimmick actually poses some additional factors as to how the survival game has to be played: making alliances would become a more effective option, teamwork would be seen as valuable in surviving the game, characters have a greater tendency to trust each other and it’s an overall refreshing twist on the genre. Maybe it’s just that good to be classified as battle royal anime.I should definitely give the show a lot of praise if it actually stuck to that formula; nearing the end of the show, a new game master was revealed and then the rules changed saying that actually, only one needs to survive in order to win. While that does spark some sudden tension and conflict within the cast, this also the turning point when things start to feel a bit rushed: battles start using less tactics and became more of battle of ‘who has the coolest powers’, certain characters’ start dying so quickly to the point I forgot about them and the ending – though quite an unexpected resolve and is something that should be seen to be understood, I can’t help but to have this gut feeling that it’s just an excuse for sequel-baiting.Even some of the newly introduced cast on the beyond the half-way point of the show start to feel lacking in excuses for the audience to care about them – yes it is an admirable attempt that the writers like to show a character’s background just moments later they are killed off (which of course is still leagues ahead than treating a character like cannon fodder), but that’s just the laziest form of persuading an audience to care about a character.If I were to give the benefit of the doubt, the show had far too many characters and too little time (like 12 episodes worth) for viewers to be emotionally invested in any form. Really, the show was a pretty cool twist on both the battle royal and magical girl genre, with substantial amount of good material to chew through until it starts to feel a bit rushed in the end; it could use another 12 episodes to develop the cast better and for everything to be put in a neat little package. Still worth the watch, especially if you are comparing this show from everything else in 2016, then this the surprise of the year!And if you wanted me to talk about the art, sound and animation... it exists... as if it's just, mediocre?

Think of SAO with magical girls instead. The story follows the girls after they were chosen to become magical girls after they were chosen from a game that they were all playing.In terms of setting this takes place in modern era Japan which also serves as the area for this death game.Snow whiteSnow white...voiced by veteran seiyuu Nao Toyama is one of the magical girls that take part in this game. Unlike most of the other girls Snow believes strongly that magical girls should only help people and not harm or kill others and as such when the game become a death game she was visibly unhinged. Despite everything Snow white stayed above the killing and managed to survive not because she was lucky but because she had strong allies that sadly perished in her defense. This had the effect of affecting her mental status but she did not break down and instead kept surviving until she was confronted with the horrible truth. Other combat oriented magical girls like Ripple or swim swim Snow white has weak magic and combat skills but loves to help people making her the ideal image of a magical girl. Being able to hold to your ideas despite threat of death is no small feat and i respect her for that. Nao Toyama as always did a excellent job portraying snow white.Ripple played by veteran seiyuu Manami Numakura of Unlimited Fafnir fame is a fellow magical girl that is dressed and equipped like a ninja. She and Top speed were partners and Top speed was Ripples mentor. As such they had a very close bond with each other. Due to family trouble Ripple moved out of her family house and lives alone thus causing her to be rather antisocial and aggressive which i guess why she styled herself as a ninja. Ripple is a quiet person by nature and warms up slowly to others with Top speed the only one she talks constantly with. However Ripple does respect those that keep to their ideas like snow white. As one of the most combat oriented magical girls Ripple fights multiple battles with the other girls notably against Calamity Mary and Swim Swim and surviving both.I felt that Manami Numakura did a great job voicing Ripple and arguably after snow white she's one of my fav characters.Ruler played by veteran seiyuu Yoko Hikasa of the devil is a part timer fame is a fellow magical girl that styles herself as a queen. Ruler leads a small group of magical girls that operate on the fringe of the city that the anime is based in. Despite appearing horrible to others Ruler does try to help members of her team when they need it like when she helped Tama understand parts of her order book that Tama didn't understand. Despite that her overbearing nature proved to be her downfall after a shocking betrayal.La Pucelle played by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte fame is a fellow magical girl and a childhood friend of Snow white. Along with Ripple and Winterprison La Pacelle was one of the most combat oriented of the magical girls and as such was able to deal with ambushes from Rulers team quite easily. La Pucelle can best be described as a loyal, quick thinking person that values Snow white and respects her for her ideas. Sadly La Pucelle did not get to see how the game ended.Magicoloid44 played by veteran seiyuu Satomi Arai of Re zero fame is a fellow magical girl that is actually a robot. Due to being homeless in her real life she values money more than anything else and will not hesitate to harm other girls if only to survive the game. Her ability is to draw a random gadget from her backpack once a day but the catch is that it could be anything and sometimes it can be a useless gadget as well. Because of her focus on money i actually wonder why she become a magical girl in the first place lol.Winterprison played by veteran seiyuu Yu Kobayashi is a fellow magical girl that is partnered with Sister Nana. Winterprison and Sister Nana are close both in real life and in game being a real life couple that value each other dearly. Winterprison can be described as calm, logical and quick thinking and is a formidable combatant but despite that still fell to a sneak attack. Winterprison's ability was to create walls of any form using the terrain that she stands on which can be used in both offence and defense.Calamity Mary voiced by veteran seiyuu Kikuko Inoue is a fellow magical girl that largely operates alone. Of of all magical girls she is the most unstable out of them and to top it off she kills more than she saves with her weapons being firearms. Her ability seems to a perfect fit for her as it enhances her weapons with magic. Arguably the most aggressive and egomaniac of all the girls Mary cares little about saving people and merely lives to fight.Top speed voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumi Uchiyama of The irregular at magic high school and Arpeggio of blue steel fame is a fellow magical girl and the partner to Ripple. Wise, calm and logical Top speaks in a peculiar accent and dresses in the outfit of a traditional western witch. Of the pair Top speed is usually the one that stops Ripple from doing dangerous things and as such they have a rather strong bond. Top speed was one of my favorite witches on the show and it was sad seeing her fate. Her real life persona was actually very similar to her in game self as well.Sister Nana voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Hayami and my third favourite seiyuu is a fellow magical girl and partner to Winterprison. Sister Nana's most prominent trait is probably her outfit in which she is dressed like a western nun. Kind, kind hearted and good nature Sister Nana like her namesake detests fighting and like snow white believes that Magical girls should be helping people and each other. Sister Nana upon finding that the game has become a death game tried her hardest to contact the admins to end the game to no avail. Sister Nana has a deep bond with her partner and was devastated upon losing her.Hardgore Alice voiced by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sword art online fame is a fellow magical girl that is the newest magical girl to the game. Her name is a play on Alice in wonderland and her outfit is from that that is draped in black. Alice displays very few emotions due to her real life persona's personality which meek and unsociable due to family trouble. Alice's ability is rather peculiar in that even when reduced to a head Alice can still regenerate herself. Alice respected Snow white a great deal as she was the reason that she become a magical girl and as such she wanted to meet her and though scaring her at first with her appearance they soon become fast friends. This role is very different to roles that Rina Hidaka usually takes but its nice to see that Rina is trying to branch out.Cranberry voiced by veteran seiyuu Megumi Ogata is fellow magical girl that mostly acted as the recluse until much later in the series when she become the main villain. Cranberry was part of the previous intake of magical girls and enjoyed killing so much that she decided that she only existed to fight strong enemies. A powerful combatant Cranberry was a strong villain that Snow white and others and to contend with until her unlucky death. Being one of the two villains in the show Cranberry did well and was a great villain being both powerful and crafty.Swim Swim voiced by veteran seiyuu Inori Minase is a fellow magical girl that was initially part of Rulers group but later went her own way after her betrayal. Swim Swim is calm, precise and smart able to act on information that she finds with great speed and skill even more so when she begins using a scythe as a weapon of choice. Swim Swim has a rather quiet and reserved personality but nonetheless a great planner and came close to actually winning the game. Swim replaced Cranberry as the second villain after Cranberries untimely demise.Fav is the mascot of the game that communicates with the girls in the game. Although at first helpful to the girls Fav's attitude changes as the game goes on and the body count rises becoming more cynical as it goes. Fav is one of the overseers of the game that orchestrated this entire game with Cranberry to choose the right girl for their project. Arguably one of the most hated villains in the series.Arts and animationArt style for the series i felt was done well with the character designs being especially well designed. The fight scenes themselves were also pretty well designed and each of the abilities of the girls used was animated well.Voice actingVoice acting i felt was pretty good especially Nao Toyama who voiced Snow white, Manami Numakura who voiced Ripple and Yumi Uchiyama who voiced Top speed. Saori Hayami who voiced Sister Nana and Rina Hidaka who voiced Alice also did pretty well.MusicThe music i felt was well done and the scene music felt appropriate for the scenes that it was in.

It gives you hope that its gonna be a cutesy magical girl show, but destroys it ever so slightly.None of the characters IMO were...likeable, except maybe hargore alice, and only because of her backstory episode (i wont spoil it) I feel like without having read the original light novel Im missing general empathy towards them.The only thing I dont have a gripe on is nano's ending song, its a good relief from mediocrty.I do like what characters they kill off when they kill them off, instead of keeping 'main' characters and 'evil' characters in trope form....In all honesty this series would be a great AMV series.... likeable, except maybe hargore alice, and only because of her backstory episode (i wont spoil it) I feel like without having read the original light novel Im missing general empathy towards them.The only thing I dont have a gripe on is nano's ending song, its a good relief from mediocrty.I do like what characters they kill off when they kill them off, instead of keeping 'main' characters and 'evil' characters in trope form....In all honesty this series would be a great AMV series...."", 'This is the worst magical girl anime I have ever seen.Atrocious voice acting in the English dub from fake British accent girl to fake US cowgirl and others. Immature, obnoxious, aimed at a very young audience writing. Cringe-inducing names for the magical girls with such gems as ""Swim Swim"", ""Top Speed"" and ""Hardgore Alice"" (NOT a typo for ""hardcore"").The show, as a whole, is a blatant ripoff of Madoka Magica top to bottom (cute unassuming mascot that actually has devious intentions that grants the girls the ability to be magical girls but doesn\'t tell them the full extent of what that entails or what...the consequences are, ""dark"" plot hidden behind lighthearted and cutesy, innocent and pure-hearted main character, etc) only very much dumbed down and made for a younger audience. I\'d say the target demographic here is teen and preteen girls, which is a demographic I\'m not remotely close to.Being a newer anime, the visuals were nice and I guess the soundtrack was okay? The girls are kind of cute and have nice designs. Even if the presentation had been absolutely mindblowing, however, which it was not, that wouldn\'t save this anime from being the juvenile, obnoxious, unoriginal slop that it is. Like I said, this is the kind of thing I\'d expect a 12 to 15 year old girl to be watching, not me, and even if they were to love it it\'s certainly not because this is actually any good- it\'d be because they don\'t know any better.If you consider yourself anything remotely close to a proper adult, pass on this.

Not even worth a rental.OBJECTIVE RATING- 4.5-5PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I was raised in a good home, a loving home.I had my wants and my needs like any other kid, but, looking back on what my parents provided me, there’s absolutely no way I could complain about my upbringing. The family get-togethers. Trips to the ice-cream parlor and the video-game store. Support in my endeavors, schooling, and milestones. I don’t tell my father and my mother every day, but I thank them, with all my heart, for giving me a childhood that led me to a worthwhile adulthood.Truth be told, my parents never did raise...me as a magical girl. And, after watching Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, I’m gladder than ever that they didn’t.STORYIkusei Keikaku follows Koyuki Himekawa, a sweet middle-school girl who dreams of becoming one of the very magical girls that she so often fantasizes about. To her surprise, the mobile-phone game she was playing grants her wish, giving her the chance to help as many people as she can. However, something sinister lurks in the nearby shadows.Those shadows are light at first. New rules are enforced where the lowest-candy-getting girl of the week loses her magic. Then the shadows get darker when the loser has a coincidental heart attack in her sleep. And they get at their darkest (and stay this way) after the girls escalate their plans to thievery, violence, and eventually straight-up murder.Much of Ikusei Keikaku’s content is quite demented. For example, Cranberry forces La Pucelle to walk out into oncoming traffic, mangling his body so profusely that his parents couldn’t even provide an open casket at his funeral. Some of it is morbid, like when Sister Nana commits suicide by hanging herself with her beloved Winter Prison’s scarf (which she received from Sister Nana) following her death. But no matter the case, each encounter is inhumane in some way.And that’s the biggest reason (arguably the only reason) to watch Ikusei Keikau: witness a bunch of cute girls eviscerate each other in cruel ways. Smashing their heads, slicing their necks, and burning their disintegrated bodies are just a few of the actions made by the girls and women as they go about attacking one another. It gets a little strange when the audience is reminded that half the “candidates” are in middle school or younger, but this contrast between the innocent portrayals and the brutal betrayals makes for an entertaining time.Oddly, some of the deaths and kills are anticlimactic, or, at the minimum, they occur in a way or at a time that doesn’t seem like the best point to off the cast. Calamity Mary is a wildcard psychopath, but she dies to just one of Ripple’s shuriken. Cranberry, despite reigning as the mastermind behind the whole murder-fest and being the (in some sense) final boss, has the top half of her body completely obliterated by Tama in a sudden turn of events. These two are the most extreme examples in terms of oddness, but many of the magical girls, once death is imminent, find themselves out of the match per se.Arguably, these unexpected outcomes are a positive. Not only do they keep audience members on their toes as they watch the story play out, but also these outcomes give Ikusei Keikaku a realistic edge. The anime doesn’t setup any unfair scenarios based on the contexts created, simply removing the next unfortunate soul in the plot’s path.Looking more closely at the narrative structure of the anime, though, it’s about as pretty as Ruler’s bloodied corpse.The show sometimes tries way too hard at appealing to the audience’s emotions for many of its revelations. Top Speed was more than three months pregnant when she was killed by Swim Swim. Indicated by her holding her bigger belly in her death pose and dropping her maternal notebook on the ground next to her. And Ripple’s new “dad,” courtesy of her lascivious mother, is so beyond creepy that it’s a miracle he has been able to hide his sick behavior his whole life.These scenes are meant to influence the audience, get them understanding bluntly the messed-up world a lot of these girls come from and the untimely deaths they experience. Instead, they only deliver a hefty case of the eyerolls.Ikusei Keikau also falls prey to the depict-personal-backstory-right-before-it’s-needed syndrome. Often times, it kicks in immediately before a character dies, like when Winter Prison remembers Sister Nana or when Tama explains her entire past (since she was intentionally a useless character up until her demise). Where the bluntness from before tries too hard, these last-second scenes don’t try enough, making it hard to care for some of the proceedings since the anime likewise didn’t seem to care about them to begin with.There’s also a very lazy attempt at making the plot even more dire with the introduction of purchasable special items. Energy medicine and a rabbit’s foot literally shave off years of the buyers’ lifespans – but only supposedly because this life-shortening deal has no impact on the events therein.These items even call into question whether the anime did enough with the girls’ own powers. The invisibility cloak and the giant halberd are practically required to spice the events up because the show failed to have many of the characters interact with one another, and, subsequently, their abilities were not combined in intriguing ways.Ikusei Keikaku does contain a couple of nice story beats. The girl that Snow White helps later comes back as Hardgore Alice, a magical girl. And Nemurin’s death, despite being the first, isn’t at all pointless since it is her words that (accidentally) spur Swim Swim to take over Ruler’s role and (indirectly) cause most of the chaos.But more pitfalls exist. The behind-the-scenes magical-girl society is barely touched on, and the show’s shoddy attempts at exploring strength, idealism, goodness, and purpose are jammed into the plot without grace.In the end, if one is only looking for violence and nothing more, then the story delivers on that front. Otherwise, the narrative needed to earn a few more candies to come out unscathed.ANIMATIONIkusei Keikaku puts a ton of stock into its character designs, demonstrating finesse and care in the looks they bring.For instance, Snow White’s design is quite involved. She dons many muted colors – light pinks, whites, greys – that match her soft personality. The darker colors, like the brownish headband and the black scarf, starkly contrast with this softness, giving her design an aesthetically pleasing balance. Her frilly dress, her flowers, and her golden eyes not only up her cuteness levels but also contribute to her sense of innocence and purity and goodness.Not every design is as nuanced as Snow White’s, but they bring their own flavor nonetheless. Yunaelle and Minaelle are twins, so their designs are nearly identical save for the mirroring, single wing they wear upon their backs. Tama, a dog in design, wears a spiked collar that dangles a bone. La Pucelle’s blue-and-gold armor, antennae, and long dragon tail allude easily to her knightly nature while concealing her true gender.Simply the sheer variety of looks that are easily discernable at a glance is commendable. Ripple is a ninja. Top Speed is a witch. Calamity Mary is a cowboy. Magicaloid 44 is a robot. Sister Nana is a nun.On top of the detail and the variety, their designs also often coincide with their abilities. Swim Swim dresses like a swimmer (one-piece bathing suit, goggles) for her phase-through-anything power, and Nemurin (clouds, pillows) invite sleepiness, and thus dreams, just by looking at her.The character designs are arguably Ikusei Keikau’s strongest trait, so it’s unfortunate that the rest of the artistry misses the same appeal.The constant nighttime period and refusal to move away from anywhere but the city and a couple of forests drag the locales towards blandness. Cinematography and shot composition don’t try for anything fancy either, leaving many of the scenes wanting. At the minimum, the anime does show off as much of the violence as possible. Sister Nana’s swinging feet, Cranberry’s lower half falling limp, and Winter Prison’s flying severed arm are enough to get the points across.As for actual animation, the anime doesn’t have many strong moments, but it doesn’t have many weak moments either. Ripple jumps, Calamity Mary fires her sniper, Tama digs, Winter Prison summons her slabs, and La Pucelle swings her sword. None of the battles have sustained choreography due to the nature of their abilities and the quickness with which their duels end, but, given that no notable mistakes or lags were seen, the show remains consistent in quality throughout its run.CHARACTERSIkusei Keikaku houses a large cast with over sixteen different magical girls struggling to survive.Anime with a lot of characters like this one inherently make it difficult for themselves to let everyone feel worthwhile in some form. Not that they all need to be, depending on the circumstances. But, given the fight-for-the-death-brawl format that Ikusei Keikaku crafts, each character is more or less as important as the next.To this end, the anime deserves at least some credit. It manages to explore each magical girl (however slightly), providing their backstory or focusing on their development to some extent. Naturally, some receive more attention than others, but they each get something.For example, several characters are given the bare minimum. The twins were college girls who not only did everything together but were practically identical (hence their twin status). Calamity Mary was a horrible mother and fervent alcoholic who drove away both her husband and young daughter. Magicaloid 44 was girl who always did what she wanted to do, including sharing meals with and talking to a kind homeless man beneath a bridge.Again, that’s not a whole lot to go off of for a character, and many of the characters receive about as much, meaning they simply aren’t very interesting. But these snippets of their past keep them from being just another lifeless body.Some characters are given more, especially on a relationship basis. Ripple and Top Speed connect thanks to Top Speed empathizing with Ripple’s behavior as well as doing what she can to look out for the troubled girl. Snow White leans on La Pucelle for support, the latter vowing to be her steadfast knight. Sister Nana and Winterprison are romantically involved.Arguably, though, the best and most intriguing relationship exists between Swim Swim and Ruler. Ruler commanded her “idiots” with meanness and derision, but her wisdom was not unfounded. Swim Swim, like a watery sponge, absorbed everything that Ruler taught her to an unorthodox degree. Unfortunately for Ruler, Swim Swim (from Nemurin) got it in her head that she no longer wanted to be a “liege” but rather a full-fledged princess – just like Ruler. So, Swim Swim eliminated the very woman she idolized.In fact, Swim Swim may even go down as the best character of Ikusei Keikaku simply for being an unconventional villain. The plans she carries out almost always work, netting her (directly or otherwise) almost half the kills among the sixteen magical girls (Ruler, Winterprison, Top Speed, Sister Nana, Hardgore Alice, Cranberry, and Tama). She never does anything of her own thinking, instead relying on past words and remembered guidance from Ruler. And her potential psychopathy can be attributed to the fact that she’s literally a kid (and the youngest magical girl among the group), turning her deranged delusions into “mere” childlike wonderment.Interestingly, another major character is likewise unconventional in her role. And, doubly likewise, she also deserves an analysis: Snow White.Technically speaking, she’s the outlier among the other characters. She wants to be a magical girl through and through, so she strives to be “pure, righteous, and beautiful” in all that she does. And she achieves just that. Aiding people as much as she can, she exemplifies what being a magical girl truly means, and, for her, she has finally accomplished her dream.However, once the conniving and killing gets underway, Snow White does next to nothing of merit.She sits atop the radio tower too much. She has her candies stolen from her. She cries a lot after La Pucelle dies. She pushes Hardgore Alice away when she tries to get closer. She shows up way too late to the final duel between Ripple and Swim Swim. In a way, Snow White is less the main protagonist of this story and more the cute bystander who nobody seems to care about or listen to.In context, though, that makes sense. After all, she herself cannot do much. She’s a pacifist not only because her ability is almost solely for helping others but also because of the tenets she vies to uphold. And the demonizing events, the loss of her best friend, and the unbelievable reveals make her sadness and her lameness understandable.As such, Snow White’s passiveness was constructed to give her some of the only tangible development in the season. Come the end, she yells at Ripple to not listen to Fav, going against her own perfect persona. Plus, she ignores the admins of the magical girls by helping other districts without their consent, and she trains with Ripple, learning how to properly fight to protect those in the future to atone for the ones that she could not save before.Unfortunately, this development comes in the final few minutes of the last episode. And, given how she was sidelined for nearly the entire story, her transformation from wholly good to still-good-but-not-wholly-so isn’t compelling let alone impactful. Still, like the other side characters and knowing the anime is more story-driven than character-driven, it’s something.There are other smaller moments and ideas at play. La Pucelle’s fear when she is about to die at Cranberry’s hands earns sympathy from the audience since it’s one of the only times where someone acts or responds rationally. And the anime may even have something to say about what people “deserve.” That is, nobody deserves anything. From broken families to failed expectations to wanting to start anew, the girls, like every human being, have a past. Pasts that are most likely not the same and that don’t automatically give the girls special treatment. Evident in the anime killing off whichever characters it wants whenever it so chooses.This last idea is not explored outright. However, it at least allows the characters’ deaths to not be as in vain as they perhaps are, boosting the cast’s execution to some extent.SOUNDAlongside the character designs, Ikusei Keikaku’s ending track stands out as a clear strength. It gives off a strange, almost unfitting optimistic feeling when considering what the show actually entails. The whispering and space-like sound-effects in the beginning start the track as peaceful, and, as the English lyrics interweave with the rising beat, the tone gradually shifts into that hopeful territory. Strong vocals carry the piece through to the end, leaving its listeners conflicted as they already know what has become of the girls therein.The rest of the music sadly doesn’t reach the same heights as the ED, but it deserves some credit. Listening to the opening track, it blares at first, gives way to a soft, acoustic segment, and finally transitions into violins and vocals that match the intensity of the anime itself. As for the other soundtracks, the anime uses a mixture of techno, light piano, and grating sounds. These instrumental choices help with giving the battles more pop, supporting the more bittersweet scenes, and creating the spooky, foreboding ambience that directs the content (respectively).And for the voice-acting performance, only Kurumi Mamiya as Fav provided anything notable. The cute, digital overseer of the magical girls seemed to always have left over pep to share as well as a “pon” or two lying about.ENJOYMENTMy biggest issue with this one comes from the simple fact that I don’t care about almost all the characters.A lot of that comes from the lack of info or attention given to them. Nemurin and Cranberry come to mind in this category. It also comes from general unlikability. The twins Yunaelle and Minaelle were always too mean, Calamity Mary was too over-the-top, and Magicaloid 44 was too untruthful in her dealings.Interestingly enough, I didn’t mind Ruler despite both of the above points. She at least looked out for her subordinates because, as she similarly phrased, a leader is nothing without her followers. Ripple, too. She was a bit disgruntled all the time, but her constant “Tch!” remarks and drive to avenge Top Speed made her all right in my books.Unsurprisingly, I was more a fan of the nicer girls. Top Speed for her easygoing attitude and motherly instincts. Sister Nana for her absolute kindness. Tama for her innocent behavior and spare comedic relief. La Pucelle for protection of Snow White, and Snow white herself for being the only true magical girl. Again, they weren’t outstanding in my eyes, but they at least prevented me from outright disliking the entire cast.If nothing else, the violence was entertaining. It’s no doubt demented, but watching Ripple stab Swim Swim’s corpse a few times too many and seeing Winterprison smash Yunaelle’s head into a concrete wall had me laughing at the gratuitous gore and guts.Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku brings magic and blood, but this occult combo doesn’t summon anything too worthwhile. The character designs are quite detailed, and the ED should be listened to more than once. Unfortunately, similar thoughts cannot be had for its story, characters, and the remainder of its content. If only it was raised by loving parents.SUMMARYStory: Bad, the dichotomy of cute girls murdering one another is a spectacle, but the obvious appeals at emotion, the lazy writing, and the lack of further substance leave the narrative bruised and bloodiedAnimation: Fine, involved character designs are a definitive strength, but artistry and actual animation does not go for anything interesting let alone fancyCharacters: Fine, everyone was given at least something, and both Swim Swim and Snow White were unconventional in their rolesSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, uninteresting characters all around, but the violence was eye-catching on occasionFinal Score: 4/10 me as a magical girl.

However, it at least allows the characters’ deaths to not be as in vain as they perhaps are, boosting the cast’s execution to some extent.SOUNDAlongside the character designs, Ikusei Keikaku’s ending track stands out as a clear strength. It gives off a strange, almost unfitting optimistic feeling when considering what the show actually entails. The whispering and space-like sound-effects in the beginning start the track as peaceful, and, as the English lyrics interweave with the rising beat, the tone gradually shifts into that hopeful territory. Strong vocals carry the piece through to the end, leaving its listeners conflicted as they already know what has become of the girls therein.The rest of the music sadly doesn’t reach the same heights as the ED, but it deserves some credit. Listening to the opening track, it blares at first, gives way to a soft, acoustic segment, and finally transitions into violins and vocals that match the intensity of the anime itself. As for the other soundtracks, the anime uses a mixture of techno, light piano, and grating sounds. These instrumental choices help with giving the battles more pop, supporting the more bittersweet scenes, and creating the spooky, foreboding ambience that directs the content (respectively).And for the voice-acting performance, only Kurumi Mamiya as Fav provided anything notable. The cute, digital overseer of the magical girls seemed to always have left over pep to share as well as a “pon” or two lying about.ENJOYMENTMy biggest issue with this one comes from the simple fact that I don’t care about almost all the characters.A lot of that comes from the lack of info or attention given to them. Nemurin and Cranberry come to mind in this category. It also comes from general unlikability. The twins Yunaelle and Minaelle were always too mean, Calamity Mary was too over-the-top, and Magicaloid 44 was too untruthful in her dealings.Interestingly enough, I didn’t mind Ruler despite both of the above points. She at least looked out for her subordinates because, as she similarly phrased, a leader is nothing without her followers. Ripple, too. She was a bit disgruntled all the time, but her constant “Tch!” remarks and drive to avenge Top Speed made her all right in my books.Unsurprisingly, I was more a fan of the nicer girls. Top Speed for her easygoing attitude and motherly instincts. Sister Nana for her absolute kindness. Tama for her innocent behavior and spare comedic relief. La Pucelle for protection of Snow White, and Snow white herself for being the only true magical girl. Again, they weren’t outstanding in my eyes, but they at least prevented me from outright disliking the entire cast.If nothing else, the violence was entertaining. It’s no doubt demented, but watching Ripple stab Swim Swim’s corpse a few times too many and seeing Winterprison smash Yunaelle’s head into a concrete wall had me laughing at the gratuitous gore and guts.Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku brings magic and blood, but this occult combo doesn’t summon anything too worthwhile. The character designs are quite detailed, and the ED should be listened to more than once. Unfortunately, similar thoughts cannot be had for its story, characters, and the remainder of its content. If only it was raised by loving parents.SUMMARYStory: Bad, the dichotomy of cute girls murdering one another is a spectacle, but the obvious appeals at emotion, the lazy writing, and the lack of further substance leave the narrative bruised and bloodiedAnimation: Fine, involved character designs are a definitive strength, but artistry and actual animation does not go for anything interesting let alone fancyCharacters: Fine, everyone was given at least something, and both Swim Swim and Snow White were unconventional in their rolesSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, uninteresting characters all around, but the violence was eye-catching on occasionFinal Score: 4/10', ""Is the tragic situation that happened at the Mahou Shoujo is just an ordinary competition progressed too far, or is part of a big plan from someone who is evil? Whichever be the true purpose of this anime, she was never able to give a satisfactory explanation of the background of why the characters have tokill each other. For, even though if the situation is considered an intentional engineering, Fav and game MahoIku oversized control over the lives of the girls, so that they feel the urge to kill each other automatically becomes unrealistic. How could Fav could simply determine that they are losing their...rights as Mahou Shoujo will also automatically lose their lives? Is he some kind of god that at any time could kill anyone without having to do anything? And is not the Mahou Shoujo rivalry then began to turn serious just because there is a risk of death if they lose? Unless someday appear plausible reason why Fav and game MahoIku can freely revoke a person's life, this anime stories still seem very forced, and feel he wants to create atragic was in the end never feels real. Plus, with a storyline that drove fast, anime is also hardly gives an opportunity for any emotion to the characters grow from the dead, then is left of the story is really just a series of scenes of violence and brutal killing of a vacuum. rights as Mahou Shoujo will also automatically lose their lives?

It's very unique and different than usual magical concepts. This anime started like a normal magical story would  look like then it went to a battle to the death type story. It's not like Puella Magi Madoka Magica at all, so please stop comparing them with each other.I loved how Each character magical girl had their own personalities and their outfits were just beautiful.If you are fragile about death, blood and suicide. I recommend not watching this then.but if you aren't please watch this. "", 'I knew nothing about this show going in, and I was really hoping it would it good.. but it fell way short of being anywhere near good. This is a magical girl anime with a ""dark twist"", that  feels incredibly rushed and poorly written.Story:The story had so much promise in the beginning, but as it progressed it started to degrade into complete nonsense. Character backstories are briefly touched on either as the character is about to die or after their death, leaving you with really no attachment to anyone who...dies and essentially making all deaths completely meaningless. The story does try and attempt to have heartfelt scenes, but with little to no reasons to care about any of the characters, they really just don\'t land. The ending is anticlimactic as well.Art:The art is not so bad, with a lot of cute themed character designs. I like how each magical girl had their own unique style that set them apart from each other.  The scenery could have been better, with only a handful of settings used it can get pretty dull.Music:There\'s like 4 tracks it cycles through the whole time, and they aren\'t ones I could see myself listening to outside of the show itself. I give it a 3 though because of the opening.Character:As I explained in the story section, characters aren\'t explained at all until either right before or after their death. I think there was some promise there but in the end, it was very poorly executed. In my opinion, the thing that holds it back is the lack of development for the characters. The snippet you see of who they are as humans really just isn\'t enough to make you care about any of them.  The main character also doesn\'t really play any big role in the story, and for the most part you\'ll be watching other characters fight.Enjoyment:This anime did a complete and total 180 on me.

Magical Girl Raising Project is one such anime and it must be said that it very much lives up to the genre\'s less-than-favourable reputation. The anime has a fairly simple premise, centred on a death game which (as the title suggests) features a cast of magical girls. Unfortunately, the creators evidently failed to understand the appeal of either genre, resulting in a joyless unfocused...meander of an anime that fails to take advantage of its own ideas and presenting its audience with disappointment after disappointment.One of Raising Project\'s biggest issues is its extensive cast. With more than sixteen characters to keep track of over the course of only twelve episodes, the anime spreads what little time it has for character development extremely thin. As a result, most of the cast have little in the way of proper motivation or characterisation, with maybe a smattering of largely irrelevant backstory at most. What\'s worse is that the show makes poor use of the characters it does have. Generally, the more likeable or potentially interesting a character is, the sooner you can expect them to be killed off, meaning that the last third of the anime consists largely of unengaging fights between glorified extras, only occasionally stopping to check in on Koyuki ""Snow White"" Himekawa, the requisite do-nothing pacifist protagonist who can be summed up as a shallow Madoka Kaname expy with all the character\'s depth left out.In terms of plot and themes, Magical Girl Raising Project is a messy directionless trudge through a valley of exposition and action scenes, punctuated by the occasional flashback or character moment that serves no greater purpose than cueing up the audience to feel sad when the character in question dies. While a good Death Game anime would use its premise to raise questions about the ethics of survival by pitting good people against each other, this is impossible in Raising Project, as half of the cast consists of cold-blooded remorseless murderers. Yes, literally half of the cast; that wasn\'t hyperbole. This makes it all the more galling when the anime attempts to generate sympathy for one of the underdeveloped murderous psychopaths just as they\'re about to die.Another common direction for both Magical Girl and Death Game anime is the clash of ideals, in which the protagonist\'s idealism and refusal to make moral compromises is tested against both the harshness of the scenario they find themselves in and the cynical self-serving attitudes of the antagonists. Naturally, due to Raising Project\'s shallow characters and constant use of a meandering ""and then"" style of storytelling, this angle is also squandered, with Snow White surviving as long as she does due to her irrelevance to the events of the story, as well as the occasional rescue, rather than any virtue or ability that she possesses. Even the show\'s moment-to-moment storytelling is poor, fraught with poorly established and inconsistent rules, characters that just stand around or forget about their abilities when the plot requires it and other such contrivances occur even in plot-critical moments.To conclude, Magical Girl Raising Project is as lacking as one would expect. Too derivative and blatant in its intent to be subversive, too clumsily constructed to tell a compelling story and too overstuffed with with half-baked characters to get the audience invested; Raising Project is a resounding failure in every regard and in no way can I recommend it.

Well I think Magical Girl Raising Project was really exciting, fun and unique, I don\'t think the story or characters were all that good. Magical Girl Raising Project just felt rushed in a few areas such as story and character development.This review will not contain any spoilers as all i\'ll be talking about you should be expecting before coming into this...anime.I won\'t talk about any of the characters deaths or anything, just the premise of the anime. Magical Girl Raising Project uses ""kill all characters"" as it\'s main focus and will not hesitate to kill off a few characters like a typical ""Rogue Magical Girl"" anime should consist of, however the real problem I have with this anime is not that they like to kill off characters (trust me I love anime\'s that are able to kill off characters in order to move to plot forward.)The real problem I have with this anime is that none of the characters are able to get any real character development due to the anime only having 12 episodes... This is where the underlying problem in the anime comes from, they aren\'t able to make the characters likable enough that you actually start caring when they kill off or threaten to kill off your favorite character. If this anime had maybe about 24 episodes or so it definitely could\'ve lived up to Madoka Magica but since there was such little time no character development ever happened in this anime, which is why this anime just didn\'t seem as good compared to Madoka Magica. Don\'t get me wrong it was still good, but there was so much wasted potential because this anime was only able to get 13 episodes.This genre is gonna be one of those genres that if a series doesn\'t get more than 22 episodes, they\'re gonna have a hard time being considered ""good"" no matter how nice the animation and original the concept is. Because in order for an anime all about killing off fictional characters to be successful you have to be able to create a bond between these characters and the viewer, having only 13 episodes means that if you want to kill off lots of characters and have an actually decent story you\'re going to be rushed and have to spend less time creating this bond, which was why Magical Girl Raising Project was unable to live up to Madoka Magica. Everything about this anime was really good, the animation, the fight scenes, the plot. However the characters just weren\'t developed enough for me to even care about any of them and well their deaths were ""sad"" so different reasons, I just found myself shrugging it off like ""Eh they were a boring character anyway."" anime.I won\'t talk about any of the characters deaths or anything, just the premise of the anime.

In my experience, I\'ve found that a ton of survival game or battle royale series really fail to make a huge impression on me, which is a shame, because the genre itself is pretty entertaining. This series really isn\'t any different.If you\'ve watched Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Juuni Taisen, then you\'ve already watched this anime. It\'s essentially nothing more than a combination of those two shows (with a little Danganronpa added in the mix). It tries to be...a another new subversion to the magical girl genre, but fails to do anything meaningful.Before I address the characters and the story, I want to briefly mention the animation and the sound, which were actually two pretty strong aspects of this show. The OST is pretty nice, although I really can\'t pick out a point that I liked aside from whenever Hardgore Alice was with Budget Madoka. The creepy undertones were a great tonal touch to the scene. The opening and ending were also executed extremely well.The animation isn\'t anything particularly special, but works pretty well for the show. It\'s not horrible, but it isn\'t exactly Violet Evergarden either. The character designs were also appealing to look at. They weren\'t necessarily creative, but they were very well executed. Of course, if Charlotte and Btooom! have taught me anything, it\'s never to judge an anime solely on the production value. MagiPro no doubt looks pretty, but in this case, that\'s all it has going for it.The characters were atrociously handled, however. You know how I said that this show was like Juuni Taisen? Not only was MagiPro a survival game, but the tried and failed method of giving a soon-to-die character a backstory became really irritating. I didn\'t have time to get invested in the characters because they had such a small window of time to convey any meaningful history to the audience.I\'m fully aware that survival games involve killing; that\'s sort of the entire point of the show. However, this show frustrated me by killing off a good chunk of any characters that had potential to be interesting. La Pucelle, Ruler, and Magicaloid 44 had far more potential to be interesting characters than many of the girls that ended up surviving the majority of the game. Say what you will about Ruler, but at least she had some iota of intrigue. No doubt she was pompous and condescending, but she had more of a presence than many of the other girls.Then you also have your classic tsundere who suspiciously looked way too much like Akatsuki from Log Horizon. You have the bubbly and kind girl who loves everyone, but you really don\'t get to know more about her since she\'s the first one to meet her end. Both of the angels were obnoxiously annoying, when they really had no reason to. I also really couldn\'t be bothered to care about Winterprison or Sister Nana either. I thought their relationship was sweet, but that was pretty much it.Also I wanted to reach through the screen and smack Tama. Her incessant whining and subservient attitude got really old after a while.The antagonists were pretty weak too. Mainly because after watching this series, I still have no clue what any of their primary motives were. Cranberry, wanted to fight strong people. That\'s about it to her. I couldn\'t get a clue on what Calamity Mary wanted, aside from maybe wanting to cause mayhem. Don\'t even get me started on Swim Swim. If I remember correctly, then her goal was to be like Ruler. If I\'m wrong, then I have absolutely no idea what the purpose behind her bloodlust was. (Being ""crazy"" is not an excuse).Oh, and I almost forgot, the starter of the entire game, Fav, or as I like to call him, Monokyumey. If I\'m being honest here, I still don\'t know what his purpose served. It\'s almost like the writers took Kyubey, and tried to make the same concept work for this knock off. There\'s no reason behind the bloodshed or the death in this game. At least with Madoka, Kyubey was tricking the magical girls into signing contracts with him so he could benefit his race with the deaths of them. With Fav, it seems that the only motive is to satisfy his own desire for blood. Now normally, this approach for a character isn\'t necessarily bad. I still think that Tatsumi from Shiki fueled the actions of the other vampires with his nihilistic lust for violence. His sadism makes sense in the context of his respective story. However, with Fav, there really seems to be no motive behind him, other than seeing cute girls die. He mentions the magical world, and the Magical Girl Raising Project, but nowhere do we get any indication that there\'s someone behind the scenes pulling his strings. Sure we find out that Cranberry was the mastermind behind this game, but there\'s really nothing more than that. They were just cruddy and uninspired villains.And finally, we have our protagonist, if you can even call her that, Snow White, or Budget Madoka. Of all of the anime I\'ve seen so far, she may be one of the worst protagonists I\'ve ever seen. Not because she\'s a bad person, she\'s just a horrible character. You rarely see her throughout the entire run of the show, and when she\'s in camera shot, she does practically nothing. Fav literally states in the last episode that Budget Madoka never even had to get her hands dirty. I\'ve made my distaste for Future Diary and its main character (among others) known, but at least Yuki had some semblance of a personality or drive. Yes, I\'m actually using Yuki as a POSITIVE example here. I know that I have to suspend my disbelief whenever I watch fiction, but MagiPro made it really difficult for me to keep that suspension. There\'s just no realistic way Snow White would have ever survived this game.The only character that didn\'t bother me was Top Speed, but again she got such a small amount of history that even then, I find it hard to connect to her character.The story ultimately becomes extremely convoluted. The first episode had promise, but after finishing, I\'m left with more questions than when I started. What exactly is the magic world? The only thing we know about it is that it exists. We don\'t know if it\'s an alternate dimension or a separate planet, we don\'t know about who lives there, we don\'t know the purpose behind the Magical Girl Raising Project at all. Since if there\'s a world inhabited by magical girls, then what would be the purpose behind the project?How are the magical girls chosen? Is it at random? I find that relatively hard to believe considering a pair of twin sisters were chosen. Is it based on merit? Well then that would rule out Calamity Mary, who was nothing more than a drunkard who abused her daughter. The method on how they\'re chosen is never really specified.Also, what was the entire purpose behind the deaths? Kyubeykuma mentioned that other magical girls were chosen by defeating a monster or doing good deeds, so why did it suddenly change to a death game? I refuse to accept that there aren\'t other forces beyond Cranberry and Fav that determine how the games play out. Something had to have created Fav, and that something or someone had to have access to other worlds. It just makes no realistic sense for someone to change from pacifistic methods to ones that end in bloodshed. Fav mentions that if he doesn\'t find another master, that he\'ll be in trouble. Why is this the case? Hell if I know, and it looks like we won\'t be receiving another season any time soon. I could be wrong since the manga is still in production, but as of recent news, this is all we have.I really wanted to like MagiPro, I really did. The show definitely has its merits, but the numerous plotholes and shallow characters overshadow them significantly. a another new subversion to the magical girl genre, but fails to do anything meaningful.Before I address the characters and the story, I want to briefly mention the animation and the sound, which were actually two pretty strong aspects of this show.

(Being ""crazy"" is not an excuse).Oh, and I almost forgot, the starter of the entire game, Fav, or as I like to call him, Monokyumey. If I\'m being honest here, I still don\'t know what his purpose served. It\'s almost like the writers took Kyubey, and tried to make the same concept work for this knock off. There\'s no reason behind the bloodshed or the death in this game. At least with Madoka, Kyubey was tricking the magical girls into signing contracts with him so he could benefit his race with the deaths of them. With Fav, it seems that the only motive is to satisfy his own desire for blood. Now normally, this approach for a character isn\'t necessarily bad. I still think that Tatsumi from Shiki fueled the actions of the other vampires with his nihilistic lust for violence. His sadism makes sense in the context of his respective story. However, with Fav, there really seems to be no motive behind him, other than seeing cute girls die. He mentions the magical world, and the Magical Girl Raising Project, but nowhere do we get any indication that there\'s someone behind the scenes pulling his strings. Sure we find out that Cranberry was the mastermind behind this game, but there\'s really nothing more than that. They were just cruddy and uninspired villains.And finally, we have our protagonist, if you can even call her that, Snow White, or Budget Madoka. Of all of the anime I\'ve seen so far, she may be one of the worst protagonists I\'ve ever seen. Not because she\'s a bad person, she\'s just a horrible character. You rarely see her throughout the entire run of the show, and when she\'s in camera shot, she does practically nothing. Fav literally states in the last episode that Budget Madoka never even had to get her hands dirty. I\'ve made my distaste for Future Diary and its main character (among others) known, but at least Yuki had some semblance of a personality or drive. Yes, I\'m actually using Yuki as a POSITIVE example here. I know that I have to suspend my disbelief whenever I watch fiction, but MagiPro made it really difficult for me to keep that suspension. There\'s just no realistic way Snow White would have ever survived this game.The only character that didn\'t bother me was Top Speed, but again she got such a small amount of history that even then, I find it hard to connect to her character.The story ultimately becomes extremely convoluted. The first episode had promise, but after finishing, I\'m left with more questions than when I started. What exactly is the magic world? The only thing we know about it is that it exists. We don\'t know if it\'s an alternate dimension or a separate planet, we don\'t know about who lives there, we don\'t know the purpose behind the Magical Girl Raising Project at all. Since if there\'s a world inhabited by magical girls, then what would be the purpose behind the project?How are the magical girls chosen? Is it at random? I find that relatively hard to believe considering a pair of twin sisters were chosen. Is it based on merit? Well then that would rule out Calamity Mary, who was nothing more than a drunkard who abused her daughter. The method on how they\'re chosen is never really specified.Also, what was the entire purpose behind the deaths? Kyubeykuma mentioned that other magical girls were chosen by defeating a monster or doing good deeds, so why did it suddenly change to a death game? I refuse to accept that there aren\'t other forces beyond Cranberry and Fav that determine how the games play out. Something had to have created Fav, and that something or someone had to have access to other worlds. It just makes no realistic sense for someone to change from pacifistic methods to ones that end in bloodshed. Fav mentions that if he doesn\'t find another master, that he\'ll be in trouble. Why is this the case? Hell if I know, and it looks like we won\'t be receiving another season any time soon. I could be wrong since the manga is still in production, but as of recent news, this is all we have.I really wanted to like MagiPro, I really did. The show definitely has its merits, but the numerous plotholes and shallow characters overshadow them significantly.', '*SPOILERS*7 Art:The character designs are cute and match the characters abilities / powers like Nemurin\'s design for example...7 Sound:Not really something I pay attention to, the intro song is pretty neat.5 Characters:They\'re great and definitely the type you\'d fall in love with, the main character is shit the type that\'ll have you contemplating on whether you should continue to watch this anime or not because of her uselessness, Some characters you hate and just wish they\'d just die already and Some characters you\'d wish they don\'t die because they\'re too innocent well this Anime really disagrees with you if you think that because||v3 Story:I love magical girl animes, Madoka Magica for example.

The power they're given are also cool none of them being boring and teamwork plays a huge role in a lot...of fight.Now on the problem, there's a number of them but most are rather minor, like the fact that the goal of the whole project stays rather undefined. The real problems can be sum up in 2 points:- The MC, remember when I said that all the characters are good? (if you don't stop reading that and go see a doctor) Well, I was lying, the MC is the exception. She and her power are boring, she doesn’t do much and even as the cliché good hopefull girl since we already have a better character for that role. She could be cut out of the story that not much would change, hopefully, we don't follow her much.- The power use, it's an issue only at times but when it's the case it's really infuriating. For example, the ninja has a power which makes projectiles always reach the target, but she sticks to usual throwing weapons when she could use needles or glass shards to make them unavoidable or on the other hand really big objects which would be hard to parry. Some detail about the way power and transformations work are rather unclear which is overall quite frustrating for example power sometimes works without transformation, sometimes they don't.At times It really feels like a cheap way to have the plot progress.So to conclude it's not fantastic but if you're in the mood for that kind of edgy, gore battle royale between moe thing then give it a try. of fight.Now on the problem, there's a number of them but most are rather minor, like the fact that the goal of the whole project stays rather undefined.

While there are still the light and fun shows that have been around since Sailor Moon, the dark magical girl genre has taken hold since the release and success of Madoka Magica. Predictably, this critical success created to several Madoka-type anime clones throughout the past few years. Some of these ranged from cringe-worthy and awful to good anime on their ow rights. Where does Magical Girl Raising Project stand in comparison? Well, I thought it was a good show... but it could have been better with some tweaking.Story: 7The story of...MGRP is fairy straightforward. The plot combines your typical battle royale type anime with the magical girl genre and delivers a lot edgier of a magical girl experience. The pacing overall is solid. The action and talking segments are pretty fairly distributed each episode and the show is rarely boring because of this. So, I give credit to the show-runners for keeping a balance.I also thought MGRP stuck the ending for the most part. Not perfect, but satisfying enough to me. However, the problems in the story and pacing come in with its flashbacks. Like many other anime, there are too many of them. Some of them come out of nowhere, do not tell enough, or slow down the pace.Additionally, I feel like Magical Girl Raising Project forgets who the main character is in the second half. She disappears and re-appears out of the action constantly without much explanation. Lastly, MGRP needed 10 more episodes. Too much story is crammed into twelve episodes and would have really benefited from more time for character development. That being said...Characters: 5The biggest problem with MGRP. While there are several characters with fun, interesting, and zany personalities, almost none of them receive enough development. Without spoiling too much, this show has a lot of death. I appreciate a show willing to kill off its characters greatly. However, when the character doesn\'t receive enough screentime, the deaths ring much hollower than they should. There\'s several girls I was very interested in learning more about, but we never really found out much of anything. The villains in particular do not have much motivation to their actions without much reason giving. One was stated to ""have a screw loose"", and that was all we got. As stated in the story section, this anime really needed 22 episodes to develop the magical girls\' characters better. That would have given the deaths more emotion and a longer time to know each of them before their demises. That being said, I thought several characters were genuinely likable and there was no character that was outright bad. Still, a disappointing category.Sound and Art: 7For me personally, art and sound do not play much of a role in me enjoying an anime. Unless the two are really bad or really good, it does not make much of an impact on me. With that being said, both were good but not all that memorable. The opening was catchy and looked good and the ending was above average. Overall, I thought everything here was fine.Enjoyment: 8The strongest aspect of MGRP is the enjoyment factor, which is the most important score for me when grading a show. The fights were some of the better in the magical genre that I have seen. Each character used a unique fighting style which made each fight more enjoyable. In my opinion, they were the strongest part of the show. While a few were predictable, the anime also has a few nice twists I did not expect. As previously stated, I really wish each girl had better character development and the show was ten episodes. While I still think this, I was anxious every episode to see if any of my favorite characters would be killed. Not as nervous as I would have been had the characters been better developed, but it made MGRP more suspenseful.Overall: 7The math I had gave Magical Girl Raising Project just short of a 7. Despite this, I\'m going to round up to a 7 due to its enjoyment factor alone. If you like the dark magical girl genre as much as I do, give this one a try. You could watch way worse 12 episode anime. If you like the battle royale genre in general, I would give this one a try too.Pros and Cons:+ Solid fights and fight choreography+ Brutal Deaths+ Fluid Pacing, sticks the land-Not enough character development-Show needed ten more episodes to spread out development-Too many flashbacksIf you liked this one, try...Madoka Magica (if you have not somehow seen it)Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero!

Oooh the magical girls are all killing each other!!I thought this anime was just another madoka magica ripoff, same as most other people who left reviews, and yet, a few years later, I start to realize how decent this anime is beneath it's premise.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's original with it's way of handling the exact same idea, but it just executes it in a FAR superior way. Maybe it's the characters, or the situations they put...them in, but I'm damn sure this anime can perfectly classify as an horror show because you actually TENSE UP when watching it. Something about the way it's built made me come out of most episodes with a serious case of the shakes, something which no anime has done, even when they are supposed to straight up be horror anime.It's probably the most raw anime in this subgenre, where the characters attempt to kill each other in a realistic and brutal way, minus the magical girling of course, they don't use giant guns or become threatened by giant monsters, instead they stab and shoot eachother in a generally mundane way. There's a certain death where the killer is throwing bullets and bombs for over 2 minutes, not freaking out, just coldly but surely. It seems more like a battle royale than a magical girls killing each other show, with less than 3 deaths being actually results of magic.It also has an amazing set of characters, particularly Swim Swim, I think she might just be one of the best anime villains in retrospective. What at first seems like a controlled yet ruthless character turns out to be the most sadistic and uncontrollable character, not because she's very brutal in her actions, but because you can sense an order to her lack of control. Not exactly calculated, just orderly.The other characters are also great, a lot of them have great backstories and determination. I like that the show made itself a little premise before the premise too, they could have easily fooled viewers to think the first episode was a normal magical girls anime because they made it seem like a completely logical premise for a show like it. The protagonist is the typical wimpy girl, but she is never consolidated nor does she ever develop any backbone, this leads to her constantly being put down, the other characters act like she's an idiot because she IS indeed an idiot, it's strangely different...So while I don't claim it's perfect, it DELIVERS when it comes to emotional impact, even characters with predictable plot and arcs manage to drive an emotion out of you thanks to the music and character writing. if some of it isn't special, I can at least say I've never had the same experience with any other anime before or since.

I don't know all the typical jargon and what have you, so I'll just give an honest review as I can.WARNING!!! AHEAD THERE BE SPOILERS AND I'M UNSURE HOW TO TAG IT!!![spoiler]The story could have been better and I'd have rated it higher if they had just allowed the characters stories to flow naturally. Instead what you have is a story that had great potential crammed into 12 short episodes. And it simply wasn't enough. While the whole idea of the story intrigued me (what isn't intriguing about a virtual world and its...effects on real life?) the reality that I was given left me feeling bitter.I don't want to fall into the same misogynistic feelings thrown at Snow White and I understood WHY she wasn't involved in the bloodbath it all led to, yet I still felt zero remorse for what happened to her. I just didn't care? Characters like Top Speed, Ruler, Sister Nana, etc were all painted as victims in their real lives, some way or another. Snow White doesn't have the same background as either and yet her survival whilst the others died just seems so...ugh. It's hard to describe. It feels as though they were meant to die in the first place because of their use of physical strength versus Snow White's lack of physical strength. It felt wrong to me and to be frank, I felt that the 'main' protagonist should have been Ripple and Snow White to not even be included.A lot of it just felt very rushed and in the end, predictable. The characters who were to die would get their back story in a few, simple flashes and that would be it. It left me feeling hollow and not in a good way. Like many have said on here already, the anime gave me something to do and it quenched my thirst to watch something but it didn't do much else. Characters were pushed aside for a plot that could barely keep itself together and it just wasn't as good as I expected it to be.That's not to say the whole of it was bad, because it truly wasn't. The opening intro was fairly good (if somewhat spoilery) and I enjoyed the ending too. Again I say that the story, what little there was, wasn't awful and it definitely had potential. There was perhaps just too many characters to balance in the format that it was and it made some character's deaths feel overly cheap and unsatisfactory to watch. There were characters like Top Speed who I felt was really well done up until the moment of her death, which just left questions unanswered and not in a good way.  The gore and suspense that was there kept me wanting to know more, but after the ending it just felt like a cop-out.So overall, the potential of the series is what made it enjoyable to me, but was also what made it irritatingly disappointing too.[/spoiler] effects on real life?) the reality that I was given left me feeling bitter.I don't want to fall into the same misogynistic feelings thrown at Snow White and I understood WHY she wasn't involved in the bloodbath it all led to, yet I still felt zero remorse for what happened to her.

If you have seen and enjoyed Madoka or the Fate/stay franchise, you'll definitely like this show.The rest of this review contains spoilers, so if you haven't seen this anime yet, go watch it then come back... Yes, right now.Back? Good! How'd you like it?Personally, I'm a sucker for the grim dark mahou shoujo genre, so this was a very satisfying watch for me. That being said, Magical Girl Raising Project felt manufactured at points....Compared to the Fate franchise and Madoka, the action was less intense, character backstories less detailed, and character deaths (on the whole) less poignant. Again, that isn't saying Magical Girl Raising Project is a bad show, it just didn't hit the same highs that the shows that inspired it had.Something I really enjoyed about the series was how the magical girls weren't just elementary/middle/high school girls, but they were all different ages and they all had unique backstories. Every single character in this anime has a well written backstory that is explained before they die, which added a lot of meaning to character deaths. While all the backstories were good, their implementation became a little formulaic by the end. Backstory is important for character death to have meaning, but when the show only ever tells you backstory either immediately before or immediately after a character dies, the process becomes repetitive and loses some flavor.On to the specific character deaths, they are all tragic but can be hit or miss. Top Speed dying while pregnant, Hardcore Alice bleeding out in the arms of Snow White (the one who inspired her to become a magical girl), and Sister Nana hanging herself with her lover's scarf were all horribly tragic deaths. Sister Nana's death in particular really tore at my heartstrings, as they take time to build the romance between her and Weiss Winterprison before killing both of them off. The scenes of Nana mourning over her beloved before eventually taking her own life with the scarf she knit for her were terribly tragic, and made for some of the best drama of the series.Some of the other characters' deaths felt really lackluster though. Usually this is due to the character being killed very abruptly, but two in particular stood out to me as being very poorly written. The first is the death of La Pucella. He's basically just shoved into traffic and gets hit by a truck. Considering he was one of the main characters and that he had just finished a big epic battle with one of the series' antagonists, I was expecting a flashier, more noble death. I wasn't even sure that he actually died until multiple scenes later where we see a funeral service, that was how underwhelming his death was.The other character death that really wasn't given any attention at all was Ruler. She was built up as the first antagonist of the series, and it was a very big moment when her underlings betrayed her. Her death would have meant so much more if after being betrayed, we saw her attempt to exact revenge on her subordinates and see the weakness of her magic exposed. Or, you know, at the very least they could have exchanged some dialogue. Instead we get a lame death and a plot hole. One scene Ruler is standing there in disbelief, the next she is dead on the floor in a puddle of blood. Who killed her? When Nemurin died, she just passed out dead. The fact that Ruler was laying in a puddle of blood means that a fight must have broke out. Again, it would have been incredibly tragic to see the weakness of her mind control magic exposed as her subordinates teamed up to kill her, and this was a great opportunity missed. Almost worse is the fact that after this is all said and done, Swim Swim drags her body outside and hides it behind a bush. None of them even think to dispose of the body properly, they just hide it in plain sight!The ending of the series was also pretty gratifying. It's pretty edgy how Snow White runs away from home to be a rogue magical girl that goes against the system and does things her own way. I just don't like the whole thing with the rabbit's paw reviving Ripple. I don't have a problem with Ripple living in the end, I'm just not a fan of the 'tears of the maiden resurrecting the fallen' trope.Magical Girl Raising Project comes with my highest recommendation for anyone who enjoyed the Fate series or Madoka, and while it's not quite as good as these classics, it is the next closest thing and will certainly help tide you over until the next season of Fate or Madoka is made. Over the course of this review I have been pretty critical on some of its flaws, but believe me, the reason for this is that I enjoyed the show so much that I had to point out the shortcomings that I saw. Because the show was pretty great overall, the scenes that were poorly done or out of place really stood out and bothered me. But, being the diehard Madoka and Fate fan that I am, it didn't bother me too much, and I reveled in every twist and turn this similarly wild ride took me on. Compared to the Fate franchise and Madoka, the action was less intense, character backstories less detailed, and character deaths (on the whole) less poignant. Again, that isn't saying Magical Girl Raising Project is a bad show, it just didn't hit the same highs that the shows that inspired it had.Something I really enjoyed about the series was how the magical girls weren't just elementary/middle/high school girls, but they were all different ages and they all had unique backstories. Every single character in this anime has a well written backstory that is explained before they die, which added a lot of meaning to character deaths. While all the backstories were good, their implementation became a little formulaic by the end. Backstory is important for character death to have meaning, but when the show only ever tells you backstory either immediately before or immediately after a character dies, the process becomes repetitive and loses some flavor.On to the specific character deaths, they are all tragic but can be hit or miss. Top Speed dying while pregnant, Hardcore Alice bleeding out in the arms of Snow White (the one who inspired her to become a magical girl), and Sister Nana hanging herself with her lover's scarf were all horribly tragic deaths. Sister Nana's death in particular really tore at my heartstrings, as they take time to build the romance between her and Weiss Winterprison before killing both of them off. The scenes of Nana mourning over her beloved before eventually taking her own life with the scarf she knit for her were terribly tragic, and made for some of the best drama of the series.Some of the other characters' deaths felt really lackluster though.

Still, I have to say that Ikusei Keikaku is one of the greatest examples of a subcategory of the ""Magical Girl"" genre, ""Dark Magical Girl"".First of all, the concept is simple, a group of girls from all ages became magical girls and needed to do good actions, and then they start killing each other until the winner remains. I think it is interesting that the characters\' death may not be gory or bloody, but they hurt and have a deep meaning.Additionally, the opening and ending are bangers, especially the latter, which is sang by Nano, who...never disappoints.Finally, I understand that this anime is not a masterpiece, even though I almost rate it like one, but I think it is a fresh premise and can be a good start for an anime franchise based on the light novels of the same name. never disappoints.Finally, I understand that this anime is not a masterpiece, even though I almost rate it like one, but I think it is a fresh premise and can be a good start for an anime franchise based on the light novels of the same name.', ""There are 3 major problems the show has: justifying it's narrative, the pacing, and the characters.

One of the best things about this series is that because of the...way the magical girls were selected there happened to be a lot of variety in the people, instead of most magical girl animes which just have a bunch of high school girls.

Puella Magi Madoka Magica for example challenged the trope by giving a mahou shoujo anime a darker turn while some other brings a little twist by having the protagonist mahou shoujo as an adult male; mahou shounen. Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Magical Girl Raising Project is leaned towards the former, with its own unique twist.warning: might have some obvious spoiler.The anime start off with a rather cheerful and happy tone, typical of  a mahou shoujo anime. Things take a darker turn 2-3 episodes later, as the rule took...turn for the worse, in the end become a huge battle royale between the mahou shoujos.

There are no concrete explanation as in why they have to result to murder, since alternatively they could talk through it. Some do it just for fun, some just following orders while this one girl cold heartedly just kill every other girl, devoid of good enough reasons. While this is all just to push the plot and to make a darker show of mahou shoujo series, it is indeed rather disheartening to see your favourite girls die one by one each episodes. Conversely, this show does breed some of the most hated character this season. Most of the death is foreshadowed in a way that most of them shows a little flashback of the characters backstory before they meet their demise, while some other is rather unexpected in term of how they would die regardless. The story went full on battle royale till the end, with a decent closure. The drama aspect of the anime itself felt really forced, to the point that they dragged on too much. While overall it is actually a prologue to a much longer light novel series, it is mediocre enough to be adapted as one.The main characters in the story is Snow White, an ideal representative of how Magical Girl should be; cheerful, always happy to help other and disliked conflicts. She had a rather useless looking ability (in term of combat at least, well not yet fully developed at this point) in a way she could hear the voice of distress of other people. The only problem with her is that she is mostly useless for most of the story itself. She haven't done much to actually influence all the other magical girl, in which her absence could brings little to no different to the outcome of the story. She is there mostly as a symbol of pure mahou shoujo; the only one existed amidst the conflict brewing. The other main character is Ripple, also have little backstory to show behind her. She is a quiet ninja+mahou shoujo, with her action in the beginning driven only by her mentor, Top Speed. Other characters are not so really worth mentioning, since they are there only to have little backstory to tell before they actually die. And yeah, Swim Swim in particular; my hate for her is more than the force of thousand suns burning.Animation is good in general. The quality is mostly consistent with little to no animation problem. The shift in art and mood from a bright, cheerful tone to a muck dark, less vibrant colour is a nice touch to emphasize the central theme of the anime itself. The use of special effects along with the determination and fear on most girls’ faces while fighting were well displayed. The sound overall nothing special, mostly mediocre. The OP and ED both had a not so cheerful tune, directly implies to the viewer that this is not your average, happy go lucky mahou shoujou anime.Overall, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a rather decent enough anime to watch.

This show turned out to be a waste. I had dropped it for 6 months because of how much of a disappointment it turned out to be. There are several issues, first one being the lack of character development. I had zero vested interest in any of the characters. Why? Because there was no development. It was only after they died, there was maybe 5 minutes showing their story. In all honesty, that was my biggest issue with this show . It is a 12 episode show that introduces too many characters...without time to build up each one.Second issue that really got to me was the lack of care in the animation. The biggest one is when Swim-Swim is searching for Cranberry. Cranberry pokes out from behind the trees as if the show was a comedy.And lastly, the main character. The entire show, 99.99% of it all she does is cry and say ""stop fighting"". She was developed as if she was suppose to be the savior, but spends the entire show doing absolutely nothing.The one good thing I will give this show is the violence and gore. But at the same time the deaths are very anticlimactic.Would I recommend this to anyone? No. It would not even cross my mind.

I have not read the manga or novels.Ultimately I have mixed feelings. I went into this without high hopes as I usually am pretty eh about the magical girl genre, however this anime deconstructed the genre pretty fast (similar to Madoka in a way but less trippy).The good: The show managed to have some pretty unpredictable moments. The premise was pretty interesting, starting off as one kind of show before quickly transforming into something very dark...and disturbing. There were quite a few interesting kills and some of the abilities of the girls and how they were utilized was very cool. There is a trans character (tho they were too cowardly to come right out and say she was, I personally think it\'s what they had in mind) among other LGBTQ+ representation in their characters. It wrapped up pretty neatly too. It also had a pretty decent dub.The bad: Most of the characters were extremely one dimensional, this isn\'t uncommon in anime, especially Death game animes but for a very character focused show, some of the characters who stuck around for longer could have benefited from being fleshed out a bit more. The constant back and forth with flashbacks also made it a bit confusing at times and some of the kills were very predictable based on the show revealing their backstories in the previous episode, tho not always. There were also a fair amount of plot holes. Furthermore I disliked that the ""winner"" won by pretty much doing nothing the entire game.The ugly: Snow White, who was the closest thing we had to a main character, was UNBEARABLE, and had literally no character development throughout the entire show. The kills were also heavily censored, this isn\'t surprising but it\'s always super annoying.6 out of 10 stars.

In fact, the amount of episodes is so bad that the main character (Snow White) actually barely has screen time. I practicially don't know anything about the main character except that she's nice and likes magical girls.

Not at all, similar shows manage to develop everyone properlym Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku fails at this terribly, to the point where you dont feel bad for anyone when they die, and if you do its either because the character has a disability (saying this to not spoil), or because it looked like they were gonna...develop the character further and make the plot interesting, oh, he died, welp, rip, there goes the only interesting character. And thats how the entire thing goes, they never really develop any characters because the cast is too big and when a character starts being interesting it instantly dies.Now the protagonist, the protagonists in this kind of animes usually start exactly like the one here, they cry for everything and dont do anything, but as the story goes on and more and more people die they grow up as a character and start to fight for what they care, right? Well, here that doesn't happen at all, the anime pretty much ends and the protagonist not only didn't do anything, but they end up slapping there in the last 2 minutes that she beated the entire mafia or some garbage like that (watched this a bit ago dont quite remember tbh) when she didn't do anything in the whole anime.The music and the animation were pretty good for me, I loved both the OP and ED, but that alone doesn't save it from a 4/10.I can't recommend this at all, I'd recommend watching Madoka Magica or Mahou Shoujo Site (I find it insulting that Mahou Shoujo Site has a lower score than this tbh) instead, both of these have a similar plot, a way better character development, plot and protagonist, but thats just my opinion. develop the character further and make the plot interesting, oh, he died, welp, rip, there goes the only interesting character.

I was introduced to this anime through a dumb death counter on youtube. Though I didn\'t watch them, I already knew about the death aspect of the anime, so that part didn\'t surprise me, though it was still interesting nonetheless. The one thing I wish this anime could had provided was a longer experience. I felt the anime was a tiny bit short and I would have loved to see more of the characters that were killed off, but in the ""short"" amount of time that some of the characters were around for, I...think they were shown off well, especially with the small looks into their real lives.

I would have liked to see the dream aspect of the show be explored a little more and I think Hardgore Alice\'s power was not explored all too deeply either. When you have a character that cannot die, there\'s a lot of potential for hijinks and the sorts to throw at said character, and honestly she was the best looking magical girl in the entire show so it\'s a shame she went out the way she did.

Other than that I though the sound design was okay, I don\'t really pay much attention to sound design unless it\'s absolutely brilliant or halariously bad so I don\'t have much to say about that. The story was okay but very interesting. The switch to the death aspect of the show was a little quick and I would have liked an extra episode or so before we enter that part. The dark take on the magical girl genre of anime is always my favorite, and I think it was done well in this show, but again, there were some things I felt they could have explored more and so on.

The characters tend to stay adorable throughout, for the most part, and the show was simply nice to look at, and it helps that the animation was good as well.

A ""killing game"" type show that seemed to be all the rage back when Danganronpa was popular, and you will definitely see the influences there, but this time it\'s got a magical girl aesthetic. It\'s standard fare if you understand that going into it, so there isn\'t much to say about it.However, watching it strictly from the perspective as a ""magical girl"" show is rather interesting in it\'s world building. The characters get powers because they played a magical girl themed mobile game for way too long, which is pretty funny. They all have enhanced physical abilities and their magic is expressed through...one unique ability of theirs. The main character\'s power is to hear the sound of people in need, which is pretty protagonist-y, but then you got weird powers like the girl who can swim through solid objects, which does make for pretty cool mechanics. Unfortunately, as this is a ""killing game,"" you only get to see them really fight each other instead of the creatures of darkness you\'d get in a more standard magical girl show.The characters themselves have some interesting characters with varying motivations for doing the things that they do, aside from the general goal of not dying.  The personalities can be enjoyable to look at, which is more of why you\'d watch a show like this. There isn\'t a lot of action in the show, but for what there is, it\'s serviceable. Some good fight scenes, though it\'s not going to devolve into them punching each other as in Dragon Ball or Yu Yu Hakusho or something like that. There\'s some light romance in the show too, but due to the nature of the show, well...So I\'d say if you want a killing game thing but also really want it in a magical girl aesthetic, this show will probably scratch that itch. Otherwise, it\'s nothing special. Definitely a let down if you were expecting bootleg Pretty Cure. one unique ability of theirs.

Regrettably, none of them are any good and some are really, *really* bad. Even Yuki Yuna is a Hero which I didn\'t absolutely hate is a big mess. But Magical Girl Raising Project kind of sets the standard for this misguided, embarrassing subgenre of movies that confuse cruelty for angst, violence for shock and misogyny for depth.This one has a pretty straightforward premise: there\'s a Magical Girl gacha game which starts recruiting random players (or it seems fairly random) to be real Magical Girls! They have...to collect magical candies by doing good deeds and helping people. But we learn pretty quickly (the second episode, I think) that All Is Not As It Seems, because if you lose the weekly candy tournament you die in real life. Then Fake Kyubey (who is supremely annoying, with a grating verbal tic that makes you want to scream, POM) changes the rules so that only half the Magical Girls can live, which naturally leads to our cast murdering each other. So it turns into Magical Girl Battle Royale for the bulk of the series, only more mean-spirited.I suppose with decent writing and some empathy for its protagonists this premise could work, but the way it\'s constructed is disastrous. This twelve-episode series has 16 Magical Girl protagonists, which makes it impossible to give any of them real development. A few characters get brief flashbacks to their pre-magical lives just before they die, which after the first time it happens makes it easy to spot who\'s about to eat it. The protagonist is your standard goody-two-shoes Madoka clone who literally does nothing but watch everyone else die, her closest sidekicks (S&M Homura and Trans Mami, the latter of whom would be a neat character in any other show) flit around the narrative without purpose, and who cares about everyone else? You have a huge cast who are either boring (all I could tell you about Cranberry, the faux-Kyoko, is that she wants to fight people) or obnoxious (I hated Calamity Mary, the crazy bikini cowgirl, and not in the way the show wanted me to hate her) clogging up space while the narrative spins its wheels and the body count stacks up.But, yeah. If Madoka is sometimes accused of being misery porn, Killing Project is just plain sadistic. Besides the aforementioned method of ""character development,"" the character deaths are extremely graphic; decapitations, disembowelment, throat cuttings, shotgun murders, bikini cowgirl going on a killing spree against normies, all depicted with Wes Craven levels of gore. The premise lends itself to nihilism but it doesn\'t make some of the deaths any less cruel. One of the nicer characters gets her head lopped off by one of her friends/allies for no reason that I could discern, except a brief moment of ""shock."" But is it<i> really</i> shocking, when we\'ve seen it happen a dozen times already? Killing Project, evidently written by an edgy 12 year old boy, thinks so.Eventually (like, in the very last episode) we learn from Fake Kyubey that this whole game was set up by the Magical World (about which we learn nothing) to train and select Magical Girls, POM. But, in an added twist designed to crush the viewer\'s spirit, we *also* discover that Fake Kyubey deliberately set up the murder tournament because he was ""bored"" with the usual selection process and it\'s fun to watch adolescent girls eviscerate each other, POM. I guess this could be meta commentary on the kind of person that watches shows like this, if you want to read it that way. But Killing Project isn\'t that deep or intelligent.And the way you know this is because after all but two of the cast have been brutally killed and the system exposed for what it is, it tries for a cynically contrived Madoka grace note. The protagonist decides to continue being a Magical Girl because she still believes in the ideals of justice. This makes her seem like an idiot. Madoka Magica ends on the same tone, but Madoka actually *does something* to change the system and redeem the wishes and dreams of the girls victimized by Kyubey. Killing Project doesn\'t do a damn thing to earn this hopeful ending, because the protagonist has no arc, no personality and just stands idly by while S&M Homura murders Fake Kyubey (POM), with no indication that they\'ve actually undone the system. Protagonist decides, gee maybe I should fly across the world to help old ladies cross the street, because isn\'t that what it\'s all about.Can I say *anything* nice about the series? I actually do like the premise of Magical Girls just generally helping people rather than battling monsters or whatever. This could sustain a decent series on its own, even if it would risk becoming cutesy. There\'s some decent queer rep (besides Trans Mami, two other girls are explicitly a couple) but that\'s pretty standard in this genre these days. Umm...the animation is okay (though the character designs aren\'t very interesting) and the music isn\'t bad.

Orenchi no Furo Jijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24211/Orenchi_no_Furo_Jijou,"[""Orenchi no Furo Jijou is a 4-minute-per-episode anime about a guy who finds a merman, and their completely heterosexual adventures that all take place in a bathtub.Story: 5/10As minimal as it gets. Each episode has some central problem or event and it's always something very light. Nothing special, but this setup is pretty normal for shorts. You can watch it all in under an hour!Art: 7/10Decent but never astounding, not too much to talk about. Although, they did a good job animating and drawing the merman's muscles, those stand out as quality parts of the show.Sound: 6/10There was background music? I hate to keep...playing the nothing-special card, but this really applies to the sound. The OP sounds nice but feels completely out of place.Characters: 8/10Now we're talking! The main character looks like a yellow eyed messy hair edgelord, but is actually a pretty nice guy, just not very talkative. His merman buddy is far more outgoing and flamboyent, creating a classic comedy duo. The merman's also got some monsterboy buddies that show up in a few of the episodes, they're all diverse and enjoyable for the brief times they appear. The one character I dislike is the MC's sister. She fits every annoying little sister trope imaginable, has a gross onii-chan fetish, and just adds loli to a show that doesn't need loli at all. She's only around for 2 episodes, so it's tolerable.Enjoyment: 8/10Sometimes the show is funny. More often then not the attempts at humor fall flat or just don't seem to exist, but the show always ends up being absolutely adorable, and it's never a chore to get through episodes (partially because they're so short).Overall: 7/10Orenchi no Furo Jijou ends up being an absolute fluff-fest starring some extremely straight characters. It's not groundbreaking, but hey, there's nothing wrong with cute boys doing cute things together.You can get through the show in less than an hour, so it's a pretty low-risk investment even if you're not the biggest fan.Did I mention how heterosexual this show is? playing the nothing-special card, but this really applies to the sound.

If you're someone like me who's also looking for a quick pick-me-up that's not plot intensive but nevertheless has the capability of making you feel the most relaxed you've been in quite some time, look no further.Orenchi no Furo Jijou is a slice of life comedy with episodes that span for only 4 minutes each, featuring the life of a boy who has a merman living in his bathtub...(quirky, right?)Story: 9/10In all fairness, this is NOT a plot-based anime so there is no plot progression and definitely no plot twist. Each episode features the main characters (and their friends, who're introduced in subsequent episodes) going about their daily life and facing small, mundane day-to-day issues. It is very common to come across overused tropes in slice of life shows, so I was pleasantly surprised at the absence of any boring, cliched tropes. Then again I guess it is pretty hard to use the generic slice of life tropes in an anime with a story as unusual as this one.Art: 8/10Keeping true to the manga, the art of the anime adapts the same dual style, seamlessly switching between its normal realistic style and its cute chibi style. For an anime that has a bathroom as the main backdrop, the color palette is pretty warm, which goes a long way in adding to that idyllic, soothing vibe the anime gives off. The chibi forms of the characters, especially the merman Wakasa, are incredibly cute and I kept wanting to see more of the chibi style than the actual normal style, which is a first for me (lol)Sound: 8/10Considering this is an anime with episodes that span only 4 minutes, it would be tough to establish a recurring musical theme/background score. The OP is very dramatic and intense, and feels a little misplaced in a slice of life anime, but I have to say that I actually grew quite fond of it by the 4th or 5th episode and didn't feel like skipping it. The voice acting was very consistent, with each seiyuu's voice perfectly fitting the character they played. I personally loved Wakasa's VA the most, it was the PERFECT casting.Character: 10/10The main reason why this show shines, and why I loved it as much as I did, is because of the characters and the characterization. Due to the brevity of the episodes you don't really get any deep background story for the characters or some kind of astonishing character development but somehow none of that matters because you still get attached to them anyway. I don't think words can express how LIKABLE the characters are. All the characters - starting from the VERY lovable and cheerful merman Wakasa to the somewhat quiet but very thoughtful guy Tatsumi whose bathtub Wakasa lives in, to Wakasa's buddies who show up in some episodes - each and every character is very distinct and very original and very funny. Wakasa and Tatsumi have a dynamic that's very refreshing and somewhat reminiscent of The Odd Couple. They're the perfect foil to each other, and the hilariously funny situations resulting from their attempts to learn to live in harmony together is what makes the show what it is. The only character that I somewhat disliked is the MC's sister, who fits into quite a few of the annoying little sister tropes, and is also pretty annoying herself. Thankfully though we only get to see her for 2 episodes, and she's so forgettable you won't even think of her for the rest of the episodes which she doesn't show up in.Enjoyment: 10/10With slice of life anime, more often than not, there's a huge chance of the jokes falling flat or failing to hit the mark, but Orenchi no Furo Jijou has none of those issues. Not once does it feel like a joke is put there for the sole purpose of trying to draw out a laugh from you. All the humor in the show is completely organic, and it flows so well it actually feels like there's zero effort to try and get the audience to laugh, but you end up laughing anyway.Overall: 9/10Orenchi no Furo Jijou is a very light-hearted, feel-good show that by the end of its 13th episode will, no doubt, leave you feeling a lot calmer and a lot de-stressed than when you started watching it. I kept wishing the episodes were longer, just so I could have kept feeling happy for a little while longer. 13 episodes didn't feel like enough, and I sincerely hope they decide to make a second season someday.So if you're looking for a quick, light-hearted show to cheer you up when you're down and/or to unwind after a long day, look no further than Orenchi no Furo Jijou.Oh and if you're wondering if it's BL/shounen ai-ish, then all I have to say is that this does have BL-ish undertones, but that's only if you squint :) (quirky, right?)Story: 9/10In all fairness, this is NOT a plot-based anime so there is no plot progression and definitely no plot twist.

Quite fitting that an anime of a 4 panel comic has 4 minute episodes.Story: 5Basically nonexistant. Each episode contains its own small plot. Due to the rather unnatural circumstances of a merman living in the bathtub, though, the episodes generally don\'t fall into boring, overused slice of life story tropes. However, the premise is almost overly simplistic, and rarely are the practicalities of the situation brought into question.Art: 8This is definitely a part that benefited from short episodes. The art is smooth and vibrant, often seamlessly flipping between its...normal style, a more ""bishoujo"" sparkly style, and a simple chibi style.

It did what it needed to do, very effectively.Sound: 7While there were no particularly memorable themes, music was another large factor to the mood of the show. Of course, due to the length of the episodes, any kind of recurring musical themes would more likely become tiring rather than adding anything. All the songs were appropriately placed. ...except for the somewhat strange opening theme, which is a lot more intense than the show itself. Voice acting was also great. Every character was distinct in their tone and manner of speaking, with their voices fitting their characters quite well. Sound is similar to art in the fact that it does exactly what it needs to do.Character: 8Due to the brevity of the series and relatively simplistic situations, character depth isn\'t explored much except for one episode. Despite that, the characters are all very distinct and enjoyable. It was cute to see how each character had adopted some of the characteristics of the animal they were based off of. My one critique would have to be the protagonist\'s sister. Her attachment to her brother seemed a bit beyond sibling love. Nothing is explicitly stated though, so it may just be my cynicism reading into it too much.Enjoyment: 9Normally, I\'m not a fan of slice of life animes. Orefuro is different in that it kept things fresh with its short episodes and simple yet cute stories. It\'s light, easy to watch, and a very good feel-good anime. I was skeptical at first, but after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. My major issue is that there isn\'t more of it! It works quite well with shorter episodes, but I almost wonder if it would handle a 10 minute episode length. It would keep the brisk pace of shorter episodes, while also allowing for a little more depth of story.

However, this show really makes the most of it and is actually an enjoyable watch.Story:Near non-existent. Read the two first sentences of the summary on MAL, and you wont be surprised. At all. The story is really that simple, following the life of a teenage boy with a merman living in his bathtub. No plot twist, no anything, just the characters solving their small everyday problems. The pacing of the story is fine, introducing new characters once in a while and the show never grows boring. Still the story is poor, and...I can't give it more than 3/10.Art:The art is one of this show's good points. While it is in no way great, the character design is really cute and quite unique, all the characters being quite handsome. The style fits the show well. There aren't really any changes of setting and the bathroom looks rather plain, but in episode one, 'outside' looks good, the water being sparkly in the sunset and all. The opening is quite pretty as well, even if the video doesn't really fit the show. Art gets a 7/10.Sound:The sound is all right. The voice-acting is quite good, the background music sounds funny and fits well.   I see a lot of people complaining about the opening being dramatical and thus unfitting. And yes, it is dramatical. But that's the hilarious part! I really think they made it like that on purpose, to be ironical. Sound is ok and gets a 6.5/10.Character:The characters are definitely largely why anyone would watch this show. The show is very short, so we don't get really close to any of the characters, like their backgrounds, how they really feel and such, which is a shame. Still, all the characters are really funny and very original! Wakase and Tatsumi make the perfect pair of mains, Wakase's bright and cheerful personality  bringing out the best in Tatsumi, who is rather dull. The side characters are funny and very different from each other, spicing the show a bit up. Characters are a 7.5/10.Enjoyment:I usually don't take enjoyment into account, but for such a short show, I think it's necessary, especially since it's comedy. Of course, most shows wont be able to send an important message with only about 3:30 minutes of plot (not including opening) and neither does Orenchi. However, I still really enjoyed watching it. This show is a sweet, feel-good comedy and it can definitely cheer you up! I thought it was quite hilarious and definitely a good 4-minute break.  7.5/10Overall:Orenchi is definitely a show aimed at girls. While it does have homosexual hints, this is not of importance. It's merely a bit of fanservice. I think anyone could watch orenchi and enjoy it, if they were looking for a short moment of hilariousness. The show scores an overall of  6/10.

Characters are super gay merman, and the other guy. I don't think they have names, but that merman is one compelling, fully developed character. The struggle he faces of being driven out of his river home is just touching. And you also really feel the underlying statement about pollution of our rivers and natural areas. The animation is decent, though there isn't much to animate. I can't really judge it's animation honestly.There's nothing abhorrent, and it...works well. Personally, I enjoy the show purely because of its ridiculousness, and the fact that it is only 4 minutes. That really helps with the enjoyment of it. You can just pop open an episode and watch.

At least, that\'s how I felt right after watching this!Orenchi no Furo Jijou or the aptly titled ""Merman in my Tub"" is about just that. 13 bite-sized episodes chronicling the everyday life of a stoic teenage boy living alone who brings home a merman of all things to freeload--in his bathtub. And as one would expect when picking up fantastical strangers off the side of the road--er, river, and dumping \'em tail and all in your bathroom, quite...a bit of chaos ensues. And it\'s really quite fun to watch!Seeing as this was adapted fron a 4-koma manga, I think the format of the episodes, stories, and the entire series in general is just right. There\'s no overarching plot, no confusing twists and turns; you could randomly pick out any episode to watch and you\'d get the gist of the whole thing without really missing out on anything else. The overall tone of the anime is very upbeat and quirky (in contrast with the seemingly dark, depressing and out-of-place opening PV & song--which I personally think was a kickass move on the studio\'s part. Way to positively bamboozle your audience!) I watched the entirety of this while eating lunch with my little brother, which should give you an idea of how easy & quick it is to watch. And even if you didn\'t like it after watching the whole thing, it ain\'t that much of your precious time lost.Orefuro\'s concept is endearing, fun, and (almost) all the colorful characters of it\'s world are as cute as a button. There\'s quite the lively cast of aquatic amigos we\'ve got here; besides the main merman Wakasa, you\'ve got a rough\'n\'gruff octopus, a shockingly sweet jellyfish, and a tiny albeit hilariously bespectacled self-loathing hermit crab (who seems to be poking fun at the unloved bespectacled hermit nerds of today...and I can wholeheartedly relate.) Of course, there is ONE other character I just couldn\'t stand: Tatsumi\'s infuriating little sister. Granted, it\'s quite clear they threw her in there on purpose; everything about her screams overused loli cliche, from her Nico Yazawa-like character design to her dreadful & vomit-inducing ""Onii-chan complex."" Thankfully, though, we\'re only cursed (or blessed, depending where you stand on the lolicon spectrum) by her presence for a couple of episodes until she gets the bin.The jokes were generally quite amusing, and one episode especially had me surprisingly in stitches. I guess there\'s just something about a mer-himbo dumping extremely obscene amounts of bubble bath into water and then unintentionally causing an explosive impact akin to one you\'d see in Dragon Ball Z that really cracks me up. The art and colours are all so damn pretty and the characters are always such a treat to look at against the neutral backdrop of Tatsumi\'s bathroom. I particularly loved how there were a whole bunch of different art styles used depending on the situation, from the normal style, to a more serious and dramatic one, to an exaggerated otoge-Bishie style (roses, sparkles, the whole shebang,) and to the token chibi style from the comics. The way everything is shaded, drawn, and animated is really well done, especially when you take into consideration how short it was. The sound was great; all the voice acting was spot-on (especially Maki; Tsuda\'s dual-tone delivery is just stellar) and that OP song is a definite banger. They cranked up the quality over quantity dial a good deal when making this, and I appreciate it.I should mention that this series is more self-aware than many have noticed. That is, it does a great job at pandering to a slew of different sub-cultures found in the anime community. You\'ve got the devilishly handsome fairy tale beings for the bishounen fans, that godforsaken little sister for the lolicons, siscons and moe enthusiasts alike, a very feminine looking jellyfish for the trapsters, literal softcore tentacle porn for...well, you know who you are.

This is about the differences of the second season.Maria holic continues it's madness where it left off. Well, not exactly. It starts off right before the pool opens, and the cliffhanger from last season's finale becomes moot. That is okay though as there is no plot anyways, and it gives the same wacky comedy it did two years ago.There is not much that changes about the humor in the show so if you thoroughly enjoyed the first reason you can rest assured that the amount of laughs won't change drastically. However,...there is a surprising lack of change in some areas. There are only two new characters that make a visit to the campus. While it is good not to have to enlarge the cast, interacting with new types of people allow for more variety in the show, even if it is only for a single episode. This along with a insignificant amount of change in character make the show literally the same old same old.Overall I really enjoyed the second season. While I complain about the lack of differences if the content is great why change it? I didn't really enjoy the first season, but I am glad I gave the sequel a chance as I liked it even more with the setting and characters always established.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues.

At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But,...it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me. it could have worked without that.

That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10.The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review...I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average.

Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

I would have liked...to have the focus shared on the two as a pair and not individually,but also adding conflict because the cross-dresser has more to lose in this.

I give it a 6.', ""I had a love-hate relationship with the first season of Maria Holic. It was like a train wreck - I knew how awful it was going to be, but I couldn't look away. At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But,...it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me. it could have worked without that.

That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10.The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review...I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average.

Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

It seems like it this anime had a hard time focusing on the characters. It tried to have a main focus of the lesbian bleeder, and the cross-dressing well cross dresser. I would have liked...to have the focus shared on the two as a pair and not individually,but also adding conflict because the cross-dresser has more to lose in this.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic.

Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold."", ""Compared to the first, i think this is the worse one.I don't know why but i found it harder and harder to care or even pay attention to the story or the characters.But i guess i was just expecting something different.

I would have liked...to have the focus shared on the two as a pair and not individually,but also adding conflict because the cross-dresser has more to lose in this.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But,...it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me. it could have worked without that.

That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10.The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review...I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average. So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10.The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10.The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10.The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10.The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But,...it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me. it could have worked without that.

That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10.The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review...I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average. So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10.The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10.The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10.The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10.The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic.

So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10.The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10.The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10.The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10.The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold. I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

That is okay though as there is no plot anyways, and it gives the same wacky comedy it did two years ago.There is not much that changes about the humor in the show so if you thoroughly enjoyed the first reason you can rest assured that the amount of laughs won't change drastically. However,...there is a surprising lack of change in some areas. There are only two new characters that make a visit to the campus. While it is good not to have to enlarge the cast, interacting with new types of people allow for more variety in the show, even if it is only for a single episode. This along with a insignificant amount of change in character make the show literally the same old same old.Overall I really enjoyed the second season. While I complain about the lack of differences if the content is great why change it? I didn't really enjoy the first season, but I am glad I gave the sequel a chance as I liked it even more with the setting and characters always established.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But,...it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me. it could have worked without that.

That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10.The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review...I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average. So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10.The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10.The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10.The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10.The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic.

This is about the differences of the second season.Maria holic continues it's madness where it left off. Well, not exactly. It starts off right before the pool opens, and the cliffhanger from last season's finale becomes moot. That is okay though as there is no plot anyways, and it gives the same wacky comedy it did two years ago.There is not much that changes about the humor in the show so if you thoroughly enjoyed the first reason you can rest assured that the amount of laughs won't change drastically. However,...there is a surprising lack of change in some areas. There are only two new characters that make a visit to the campus. While it is good not to have to enlarge the cast, interacting with new types of people allow for more variety in the show, even if it is only for a single episode. This along with a insignificant amount of change in character make the show literally the same old same old.Overall I really enjoyed the second season. While I complain about the lack of differences if the content is great why change it? I didn't really enjoy the first season, but I am glad I gave the sequel a chance as I liked it even more with the setting and characters always established. There is no reason not to continue watching this series if you liked the first at all therefore I highly recommend it.I hope my review was helpful, questions and feedback are welcome! there is a surprising lack of change in some areas.

To be honest, I was very surprised that the anime even had a sequel. I decided to watch this because I was hoping that it would be better than the original. In the end, it was better. But only by a tiny amount. The sense of humor in this sequel was slightly better. I laughed to several of the funny, illogical moments that the series provided.Story? Maria Holic Alive, takes place few months after the protagonist, Miyamae Kanako\'s transfer to the Catholic all-girls high school Ame-no-Kisaki. From there onwards, the ""story"" continues. Again...and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating. Kanako\'s crazy, super nosebleeds also continues. There were also some parodies from anime Infinite Stratos, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and probably some anime which I do not know. Well, just as expected, there\'s still no hint of ""real"" romance throughout the show. This season also had more ecchi scenes than before. Still, it\'s nothing too serious.The series also introduced a few new characters. But, they did not play a major role in the show. Pretty much just more supporting characters which I particularly did not find interesting.The visuals? They are still impressive as ever. It still looks beautiful as it was in the original. So, thats a good thing.Sound? The opening and Ending theme were terrible, for me. I dont know, maybe they were not the types of songs I would listen to. The OP and ED in the first Maria Holic were far more superior. Though, the background music in some of the scenes are still pleasantly good to listen to.Conclusion? Though, I did find this sequel to be a bit more better than the original, in terms of humor, but there were also drawbacks such as the awful OP and ED, sadly, which were more superb in the first Maria Holic. In the end, I only recommend this sequel to people who loved the original Maria Holic. If you\'re looking for comedy anime, go watch something else instead. and again, in nearly all of the episodes, the narrator keeps on stating that Kanako is allergic to men, which I found rather irritating.

I was really quite sad. ;[Character: It brought nothing new to the table the character\'s never really changed except for the 2 new characters they had brought in for an episode or two.Overall: Sadly. with all that sad and done. Mara†Holic Alive, you have dashed my high-hopes for you. I can still recommend this even if you haven\'t seen the first season because you don\'t really need to know to much about the characters to watch this it will practically remind,re-tell why these chracter\'s have this issue, or this problem, why this happened. ect. ect. I give it a 6.

At the same time, it had be cringing and unable to stop my incredulous laughter. And it ended on a major cliff hanger.Season 2.. it is more like a complete filler season. It didn't progress the story line, and (for me) it lacked.. something. I think it was a (slighly) coherent story. It was so incredibly episodic, and it lacked the progression between Kyoko and Maria. I kinda wanted that. But,...it could have worked without that. It just didn't. It was too cringe worthy, and too uncomfortable, and there was *nothing* about any of the characters that drew me this season.I would still give a third season a go, but season 2 just didn't do it for me. it could have worked without that.

That's not to say there isn't new story arcs in season 2, but in my opinion its still no more interesting then season 1 which is why I gave this season the same score as season 1 a 7/10.The artwork for Maria Holic Alive was pretty much the same quality as season 1 as well, to make this review more unique from season 1's review...I'll give another anime as a example to help explain why I think this anime's artwork is a little above average. So in my personal opinion Kanon (2006) while its not a bad anime its artwork isn't quite as appealing to the eye as Maria Holic/Alive's artwork. How ever compared to some of the other anime excluding Kanon (2006) most of the anime I've seen are about the same quality as this which is why compared to them this is only average. So you could say the score I'm giving Maria Holic Alive is a little generous, the score I'm giving to it is a 8/10.The sound track for Maria Holic Alive was also about the same as season 1, in other words save for the opening theme and ending themes they were average, but I personally thought both opening/ending themes were good enough to Maria Holic Alive's sound track a 8/10.The character development was also the same as season 1 the characters really didn't behave or improve from the beginning of the season, which is why the score I'm giving to it may be a little generous anyway the score I'm giving is a 7/10.The enjoyment for Maria Holic Alive was also the same as season 1 I say this because just like season 1 every episode of this anime made me laugh a lot, which is why I gave Maria Holic Alive a score of 10/10.The overall score of Maria Holic Alive is a 8/10 but that is only because I'm basing it off of all the other scores combined and averaged together. Now if I were to score it overall and ignoring the other things I'd say its a 10/10 because in my personal opinion its also commedy gold.

I wanted more drama i guess... considering the premise and it being a sequel. More of a conflict that would affect the characters, mainly the cross-dressing one. It seems like it this anime had a hard time focusing on the characters. It tried to have a main focus of the lesbian bleeder, and the cross-dressing well cross dresser. I would have liked...to have the focus shared on the two as a pair and not individually,but also adding conflict because the cross-dresser has more to lose in this. I also didn't really feel like the two characters really connected.

Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8769/Ore_no_Imouto_ga_Konnani_Kawaii_Wake_ga_Nai,"[""People can look at this anime anyway they want, but it'll forever be (for me) a sweet story of how an older brother came to love his sister as any older brother should. So far, every episode managed to unfold into how the two get closer to each other as the older brother helps his sister with common teen problems.The story is different from other brother-sister relationship anime. Told from the brother's point of view, it's light and has no weird physical and romantic interaction between the two. I like how he started from not even talking to his sister to how he realizes...at the end of the day something new or an improvement with his sister.Having said that, I like the brother's character a lot. He's sort of ideal as a brother. He acts, responds, reacts and shows his love for his sister naturally as how any boy should. On the other hand, his sister depicts any sibling with a whole lot of pride, asking for help from someone you don't expect to get help from. It's also fun to watch how she turns to her brother for help and learns to appreciate him.Overall this anime is good and is highly recommended to those who would like to see some family values in a different way. at the end of the day something new or an improvement with his sister.Having said that, I like the brother's character a lot.

This time most of that was centered on this anime, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.  I will admit that from the first time I saw details of this show pop up I was not to thrilled with its prospects, but the hype over the show was too much to ignore and I decided to give it a go.  In the end I am left wonder just what was all the fuss about?From the start...we are setup with our typical and predictable harem anime plot, a high school guy Kyousuke who is fairly nondescript and normal finds himself involved in his little sister\'s secret hobby, eroge games and anime.  Since up till now his sister, Kirino, has basically had nothing to do with him so both her secret and her sudden willingness to open up to him is a complete surprise.  Now he finds himself helping Kirino acquire new eroge, hide her hobby from her friends, help her make new friends, and I suppose repair their sibling relationship.  Seriously a pair of siblings find happiness through the power of eroge!  Are you kidding?  Is this a PSA for the eroge industry?Now I haven’t read any of the light novels so I can’t speak for how well this anime does as an adaptation of them.  Though I can say that if this really is a good adaption then I think I will pass.  It’s not that Ore Imouto is a bad anime either; it’s just really uninteresting.  Watching this show wasn\'t a chore but I just kept wondering to myself, why isn\'t this any good?  I can usually see why someone might like or dislike an anime more that I do but with this one I cant for the life of me understand how anyone could think this one is any good.  The lack of any interesting story makes this anime completely character driven and since the characters are so awful it just feels like it doesn\'t get anywhere nor do you care if it does or doesn\'t.   Elements of the plot eventually becomes so totally implausible and unrealistic that they defy belief.Overall Ore Imouto is an idealistic view of how otaku and anime fans want to be viewed by others.  It clearly panders to the otaku community and those who fancy themselves as wannabe otaku, i.e. weeaboo’s.  They really aren\'t creepy guys who cuddle with full size oppai body pillows on the train or buy an anime special edition box because they have a pair of blue striped panties inside. They are fashion models, Buddhist monks, and super rich oujosama\'s!  It’s not that I have anything against otaku mind you, but at the same time I don’t find the lifestyle to be particularly interesting or commendable.  While I do think Ore Imouto tries to deal with some serious issues at times, Kirino\'s character makes it impossible to really accept them.  On the plus side I will give the anime credit for not caving in completely to the fan base by drowning the show in pervy fan service.The main issue overall with the story is there is too little of everything.  There isn’t any story to speak of, though that would probably be ok if it was completely episodic, but it’s not.  We start out with Kirino\'s hobby being laid out and the drama that unfolds as her best friend and her father find out about it.  Both are coincidentally very anti-anime/eroge.  Though I can’t really blame them really too much for the later, I mean she is in middle school for god\'s sake and watching/playing those things is technically illegal for her.  Kyousuke stands up for her every time along the way.  It actually sounds kind of inspiring and sweet but it isn’t (more on why later).The romantic elements don’t work either, since we really aren’t given much about each character to think there is even a relationship developing.  There is really no chemistry between any of the characters either.  This is mostly due to Kyousuke\'s complete and utter lack of anything resembling personality.  The ending is also bad, but not unexpected given the genre and this lack of chemistry.The lead Kyousuke is without a doubt one of the most uninteresting characters I have seen in recent memory.  He seems to exemplify the ordinary lifeless harem lead.  It seems he has absolutely no interests of his own.  A look into his room shows a barren waste that lacks even the most Spartan decor and might as well just be a room at a hotel.  I think his room tells you a lot about him because like him, the only time it contains anything is when it belongs to someone else.  He is like an empty glass, waiting to be filled by whomever he comes into contact with.  I mean sure, he is a really nice guy.  He helps his sister and her friends whenever they need him, every time!  All of this without any thought or expectation of a reward.  However it feels more like he does out of sheer boredom than anything else.  He doesn’t seem to really care one way or the other about anyone, especially his sister.  You get the feeling that he’s helping her out of an obligation as her brother.  Of course why would he like, let alone love her or want to help her for any other reason?  She’s nothing but a complete bitch to him anyway.Kirino is on the surface your standard tsundere archetype.  Visually she’s got everything that makes for otaku wet dreams but under the pretty exterior lays one of ugliest and most unsympathetic characters in anime.  There is a really fine line to walk when doing tsundere characters.  The difference ""tsundere"" and a ""bitch"" is extremely small.  Kirino falls squarely on the side of the bitch.  Her actions are not cute nor are they even funny.  She’s conniving, mean-spirited, selfish, vain, disloyal, and wholly unlikable.  Despite apparently ""loving"" her brother she treats him totally opposite, in true tsundere fashion but unlike most characters in this archetype she never backs down at all from this role.  She uses everyone in the cast for her own selfish wants and then casts them away when she doesn’t need them anymore.  Unable to even stay true to her new otaku friends she shuns them as soon as her ""cool"" personality and friendship with the “in crowd” is threatened.  Additionally she is utterly unbelievable as a character.  We are supposed to believe she is popular, athletic, a professional model, successful novelist, an imouto, AND an otaku?  All before even entering high school?  Right...By the end of the anime little has changed for either Kirino or Kyousuke.  They haven’t grown at all as characters or as people.  Kyousuke remains an emotionless robotic proxy with no will or dreams of his own and still unable to see all the girls throwing themselves at his corpse of a personality.  If Kirino had become better at expressing her love for her brother and her friends or even learned to embrace her hobby openly without care as to what other people thought, it might have made her character easier to take.With lead characters this bad it really makes the supporting characters seem even worse by comparison, or better depending on who you’re talking about.  The downside is everyone with the exception of Kuroneko and to a lesser degree Manami.  Manami is Kyousuke\'s childhood friend and I suppose defacto girlfriend was a likable character who I actually felt pity for than anything else.  She is poorly developed and mostly ignored by the plot but from a cast that is so poorly conceived she stands as a lone bright spot.  In a better cast and with better leads she is probably lost as just an also-ran character.Kuroneko on the other hand is different.  She is actually a really interesting and well implemented character.  As one of Kirino\'s new otaku friends she is basically everything that Kirino is not.  She is true to herself and loyal to her friends.  She is responsible and trustworthy and has her priorities in line.  In one episode that shows her taking care of her little sister you can see from her actions that she honestly loves her sibling as she plays with her, puts up with her favorite anime, which she despises but she does so anyway.  Although she is well aware that people and even her family thinks she is weird and abnormal, she doesn’t care and does as she likes.  Because it gives her enjoyment.  In my opinion Kirino doesn’t deserve her as a friend.  Of all the people in this cast the only one I would want to hang out with willingly and be friends with is her.Ore Imouto\'s visual aspects are top notch however.  The character designs are pleasing to the eye and well proportioned.  The settings and backgrounds are well done though a bit bland in some cases.  Kirino\'s room is probably the most interesting with the most amount of things lying about.  Some of the visual parodies and references to other anime and games I found were pretty amusing.  Particularly those relating to Fate/Stay Night which appeared several times.   I did enjoy the lack of tits and ass from the production and that went a long way towards making the show far less perverse as I had initially assumed it would be.The seiyuu cast is also strong, featuring Ayana Takeatsu fresh off her success as Azusa from K-ON in the title role.  It’s too bad she wasn’t given a better character to work with, but I think she played the part as well as it could have been.  Other favorites of mine such as Yukari Tamura and Saori Hayami play smaller roles but overall I found all the performances to be very good.  The music is a definite strength as well; ChariS OP ""irony"" is one of the better anime songs of the year.When it comes down to it Ore Imouto is the kind of disposable anime that comes along every year.  While it got more than its share of hype and press it is unlikely to be remembered in the years to come.  I don’t necessarily think this is a terrible show, it has aspects that I think are terrible but overall I can’t say I hated it either.  It had just enough to keep my interest from week to week and little else.  I suggest you ignore the hype and skip this anime.  If you want to see an anime about otaku that doesn’t pander to them, watch Kuragehime instead.  You can thank me later. we are setup with our typical and predictable harem anime plot, a high school guy Kyousuke who is fairly nondescript and normal finds himself involved in his little sister\'s secret hobby, eroge games and anime.  Since up till now his sister, Kirino, has basically had nothing to do with him so both her secret and her sudden willingness to open up to him is a complete surprise.  Now he finds himself helping Kirino acquire new eroge, hide her hobby from her friends, help her make new friends, and I suppose repair their sibling relationship.  Seriously a pair of siblings find happiness through the power of eroge!  Are you kidding?  Is this a PSA for the eroge industry?Now I haven’t read any of the light novels so I can’t speak for how well this anime does as an adaptation of them.  Though I can say that if this really is a good adaption then I think I will pass.  It’s not that Ore Imouto is a bad anime either; it’s just really uninteresting.  Watching this show wasn\'t a chore but I just kept wondering to myself, why isn\'t this any good?  I can usually see why someone might like or dislike an anime more that I do but with this one I cant for the life of me understand how anyone could think this one is any good.  The lack of any interesting story makes this anime completely character driven and since the characters are so awful it just feels like it doesn\'t get anywhere nor do you care if it does or doesn\'t.   Elements of the plot eventually becomes so totally implausible and unrealistic that they defy belief.Overall Ore Imouto is an idealistic view of how otaku and anime fans want to be viewed by others.  It clearly panders to the otaku community and those who fancy themselves as wannabe otaku, i.e. weeaboo’s.  They really aren\'t creepy guys who cuddle with full size oppai body pillows on the train or buy an anime special edition box because they have a pair of blue striped panties inside. They are fashion models, Buddhist monks, and super rich oujosama\'s!  It’s not that I have anything against otaku mind you, but at the same time I don’t find the lifestyle to be particularly interesting or commendable.  While I do think Ore Imouto tries to deal with some serious issues at times, Kirino\'s character makes it impossible to really accept them.

On the surface it appears to be an anime about a brother and a sister who struggle to realise their feelings for each other. But in reality it is about much more than that. We have a good chunk of the story here focused on anime and the world of otakus as well as the friendships that one can gain simply by going outside and meeting new people.That said, the plot's main purpose is to of course present us the...life of siblings who, as is often the case, display aggression and hostility towards each other but in reality care deeply for one another.The two main characters, Kyosuke and Kirino Kousaka are complete opposites when it comes to their personalities. Kyosuke is a kind and mostly peaceful person who enjoys 'ordinary and average things' - his words. He also happens to be quite possibly the unluckiest person on the planet, often blamed for things he didn't do and accidents he didn't cause. Add to that the fact that he'll do anything for his unappreciative sister and you've got the perfect recipe for a martyr-type character. Indeed the suffering this character will go through in this series is immense.His sister, Kirino, is a spoiled brat with a serious attitude problem, completely cold and hostile towards her brother. She's a tsundere without the dere part. She behaves similarly to other people apart from her two closest friends. This character annoyed me to no end and at times I just wanted to drop the series simply because I couldn't listen to her constant complaining and her ways of screwing up her brother's reputation in the eyes of many many people. Ironically however, her tsun( no dere) behaviour perfectly fits in with the plot in this series and without that disgustingly hostile behaviour this anime would not be complete.We have a few other supporting characters of course, the tall and mysterious Saori, the intelligent and menacing Kuroneko (real name Ruri Gokou) and perhaps the most relaxing character to grace the screens of anime watchers across the world - Manami.Kuroneko is your typical gothic style anime watcher who mostly spends her days writing novels that even native Japanese-speakers wouldn't be able to read. Her vocabulary is vast and getting in an argument with her is always going to end bad for the challenger.Saori is... tall. There's not much I can say about her apart from that because this series simply does not giver her enough time. From what we see we can make out that she's quite geeky and she simply enjoys spending time with her friends.Manami is a hard working and kind person - mature beyond her years. Let me put it this way, if I was looking for a life long partner she's the person I would try to get to know better. No wonder then that Kyousuke prefers to spend every free minute he has with her. A lot of characters in this anime see them as a couple and Manami's grandfather is trying every trick in the book to push their relationship to the next level. Hilarious stuff.The art is staggering. It's extremely precise and all the lines and curves are perfectly drawn. The characters look beautiful and attention has been paid to every single detail. Likewise the music is spot on and voice acting accurate and authentic.The enjoyment part of this anime is... something I had to think hard about. On one hand if you're into the whole tsundere/martyr thing then go ahead you will enjoy this series, especially since it's very realistic. But if you get easily annoyed by one character complaining about trivial matters over and over and over again every single episode then you will definitely sit there unsatisfied and more than likely, agitated. But if you ignore that one character then this anime becomes a paradise since it also focuses on the daily struggles of otakus. That's what had me thinking the whole time, this is an anime about anime (ANIMESEPUSHION!) and also a lot of other things that go with it.Personally, despite Kirino's horrendous personality, I enjoyed this series.

The concept is fairly original, featuring a younger sister who has a problem fitting in society as a high achieving student who is also balancing a hobby for collecting and playing imouto-themed eroge. While the show is beautiful with its detailed character/background designs, unique EDs for each episode, and decent voice acting, the show amounts to being almost completely worthless and an insult to the representation of otaku culture and the associated stigmas.Let's start off with the single worst thing about this show: Kirino.  Kirino is many...things.  She is a high achieving middle school student, a model, and an obsessive anime/eroge fan.  However above all, she is selfish, stubborn, and blatantly insensitive.  The latter qualities are something you usually give to either a villain, or anti-heroic character.  Kirino unfortunately is neither of those.  She is the heroine of the plot, and for the large part is never reprimanded for her flaws. It says little about the other characters of the story - especially her brother - when people around Kirino basically enable her unhealthy obsessions over imouto-themed eroge. For almost the entire series, Kirino is a bitch to her brother Kyousuke, who ends up becoming Kirino's bitch, slaving away to ensure Kirino gets everything she wants to feed her anime and eroge obsessions.  Is Kirino ever grateful? Not really. Up to the very last episode, she's still the same insensitive brat who wants to have her cake and eat it too, and she never truly apologizes for any of the illogically horrible things she does to her older brother.What was this show trying to accomplish?  Was this meant to be a comedy?  I didn't find it particularly funny when Kirino was kicking Kyosuke in the balls or ordering him to get run over by a truck for the sake of research. Was this meant to be a slice of life drama? Again what kind of a character would be ordering her older brother to get run over by a truck for crying out loud? Was this a tale of fantasy?  Maybe, because I sure as hell doubt that humans in the real world value villainous characters who get to have their cake and eat it too.  And yes, I do mean it when I say Kirino is villainous.  She deliberately goes out of her way to be cruel to people who help her, and she absolutely insists on having her way at all costs.Does this show even do anything good?  Actually the first few episodes do manage to get your attention.  See, the concept for this show was actually decently original. There is a good number of people who would be able to relate to Kirino's problems of finding acceptance in her unusual hobbies.  Furthermore AIC is big on production values and they do a fairly impressive job of detailing some of the trips to Akihabara, conventions, cosplay contests, and a few other things. The unique EDs (and OP animations) don't hurt either.  This show really did have the framework set up to be something great.  But it's a huge insult to anime fans how despicable of a character Kirino is. Why does Kirino resent her brother so much?  Is it because she doesn't interact with him much?  Heck I have a younger sister who I interact with on an infrequent basis, and she likes anime.  But she has no reason to disdain me to the irrational extent Kirino does. And I consider myself a pretty strong anime fan, but Kirino is beyond obsessed in her collection of anime merchandise that takes up an entire closet space, and she is never grateful for all the trouble her brother goes to to add to that gigantic collection.If there is a lesson to be learned from this show, it is not one about social acceptance.

I know a lot of people are going to compare this with \'Genshiken\' series, but it\'s quite different. \'Genshiken\' focuses on different kinds of otaku, and how the protagonist fit in with fellow otaku around him. On the other hand, \'OreImo\' is very much about the otaku culture seen from an average person\'s view, and depicts how the heroine\'s hobby is exposed to ordinary friends and adults around her. Most characters around Kirino represent a social group that she must seek acceptance from.Her brother Kyousuke is open-minded and willing to learn new things for his little sister. Members in this group are quite rare, but accept others quickly.The father is an old-fashioned conservative. Fortunately for Kirino, the dad is a reasonable man, and allows her to continue under certain conditions. It can also be said that when society is exposed to something new for a certain time, it eventually becomes a norm and become accepted.Then comes Ayase, the misinformed. She\'s the type who believes everything she sees in TV, and forms prejudice in her mind. This type, as demonstrated in the series, can be converted with sufficient counter-evidence.Finally, we have Kanako, who just despises and disgusted by otaku\'s creepiness... this type is probably inconvertible, but fortunately she likes to be worshipped, and otaku provide her that.Then we have the fellow otaku friends, Saori, who tries everything but doesn\'t become particularly attached to anything, and then Kuroneko, who like Kirino is very passionate about a certain genre, and unwilling to budge. These characters broaden Kirino\'s otaku life by introducing her to new things and opinions.Like \'Genshiken\', the story here does involves a wide range of otaku activities such as anime, eroge, live commentary, comic fest, cosplay, otagei and additionally production of fan novel and anime. I found it interesting that this show has a lot of self-reference with the anime production episode where a lot of ideas such as use of different ED and real stores as anime location, as well as the difficulty in maintaining original plots for anime adaptations. In the eroge episode, it shows the irony of Kirino\'s attitude toward her brother through an eroge, in which Kirino found a character very similar to her to be very annoying, and subtly realizes her own emotion. In the novel episode, it also touched on how the recent trend of moe and ecchi was degrading anime, but stated that in the end, all art works are subject of personal preferences, and there\'s no real ""correct"" answer.One nagging question throughout the series was ""why would Kyousuke go such lengths to help his sister when she`s acting like such a bitch all the time"", but Kirino eventually became quite adorable because she`s such an earnest girl who gives 100% at everything she does.Kyousuke was a really likable guy who went out and got things done for his little sister, with couple of great quick thinking in critical times. The whole theme of brotherly love was beautifully summarized in the final episode. I have to admit it was sort of corny, but a fitting ending nonetheless. The irony that the one time he wasn\'t able to make a composed decision was in an argument with his own sister, and the reverse effect actually led to the desired result.Another one may be ""why is Kirino so bitchy to her brother when he\'s doing so much good for her?"" Kirino is what they call 「ギャル」 (Gyaru) in Japan, fashion/trend-conscious girls. One of their major characteristics is that they call their parents and brothers 「きもっ」 (Gross) or 「うざっ」 (Annoying) and avoid them because these girls don\'t want to be seen as a baby who still clings on to the family, or don\'t want to be associated with the uncool. Kirino\'s character is basically stereotypical gyaru who also happens to be a tsundere, therefore the constant abuse of her brother. It was apparent that her behavior was also her clumsy way of expressing her affection and need for attention from her big brother. There\'s also a Japanese saying 「喧嘩するほど仲がいい」 ""They get along so well that they fight all the time"", as in two people are so close that they don\'t need to hold anything back, and you wouldn\'t get mad at someone you don\'t care about. One can say the argument and even physical violence in the end was a milestone in the improvement of their relationship, especially compared to beginning of the series when Kirino outright ignored her brother.Just from Kirino\'s character setting alone, you can tell this show was never meant to be a realistic portrayal of otaku culture, as gyaru and otaku have long been depicted in media as arch-enemies of incompatible personalities.As a fantasy series, it was a really well-structured story designed to be heartwarming, building up for drama and inspiration almost every episode.Art work was the weakest element of the show. Neither characters nor backgrounds were usually detailed. In fact, it was noticeably cheap, but the lazy `ordinary life` atmosphere and hectic otaku madness was presented well.Character designs are a bit heavy on moe, but quite distinguishable. I did not like how their faces were too wide in some scenes.Animation, like every other element of this show, had its moments. There are few scenes, mostly action or background had so much detail or great camera work that it takes you by surprise.Voice acting of the siblings are done extremely well. Kirino usually sound annoying and bitchy like she should, and turn cute in dere scenes. You can just feel the emotion of her voice in touching scenes, and the squirmy perv laughs were adorable. Kyousuke\'s voice was smooth and easy to listen to. All other seiyuu cast were solid in my opinion, except Satou Satomi (Manami), whose high-pitch voice was overly moe and unnaturally childish for a 17-year old character.The heavy use of brass instruments in BGM was rather refreshing, but overall the music score did not leave a lasting impression. It did occasionally help set the pace for comedy or drama.The OP (song quality, suitability, visual presentation) is excellent. `Irony` by Claris itself is like a random technopop from Japanese idol group Perfume minus the auto-tune, but surprisingly catchy and appropriate in setting the mood for each episode. OP animation is always different, introducing the side characters that will appear for each episode and having same theme as the episode.ED songs are different for every episode, ED1-11 are selected from the public contest held in Nico Nico Douga, a Japanese video sharing website, and sang by seiyuu cast in this series. ED songs were pretty weak in general with excessive beats, but at least offer refreshment value. ED12 was written by Kousaki Satoru (who also handled BGM), and really shows the difference between pros and amateurs. ED vocals were insanely good though, especially for episode 4, 7, 8, and 11.Despite being a late night UHF (independent station) anime about otaku, `OreImo` is very much a mainstream show designed for the general audience. I would think the more immersed in otaku culture you are, the more likely you will prefer `Genshiken` over this series because it goes far more in-depth on otaku culture.However, this show is more of a feel-good sweet fairytale story about platonic brotherly and sisterly love. I wouldn`t go as far as saying this series is life/perspective-altering in any way, but it also sheds light on issues an otaku would face in real life, and attainment of acceptance by the general public, though a bit too much of an otaku glorification.It\'s obvious a lot of effort was put into production, such as the revision of story structure which gave subtle character development despite the episodic format, the different ""Eye Catch"" (Cover/CD between commercials) as reference to other anime series, ""End Card"" (illustration that shows in end of the show, sometimes displayed in ED as well) drawn by various prominent manga/novel illustrators, different OP animation every episode (and sometimes use of OP in different places), and different EDs.This series is not perfect as the drama feel a bit too forced at times, but it`s not about the logic... there`s something about it that really touches you. Watching this show naturally puts a smile on my face.I really like \'OreImo\', I would even say that I LOVE it! driven by Kirino\'s selfish ""Life Consultations"" about her otaku hobby, getting her brother into all sorts of trouble.

Watching this show naturally puts a smile on my face.I really like \'OreImo\', I would even say that I LOVE it!', 'Ore no Imouto is an entertaining and cute comedy that was thoroughly pleasant almost every moment. Those are basically the 2 things it offers, cuteness and comedy. But what makes it special is the unique brand of tsundere that the main female character, Kirino, possesses. The story is shown from the viewpoint of her brother, Kyousuke, which allows you, the viewer, to also be on the receiving end of Kirino\'s cuteness, which is particularly cute because of the complexity of her relationship with Kyousuke.The main female characters look unbelievable cute, sound cute, and behave cutely, and it\'s a sexy-cute, not a childish cute. The cuteness...doesn\'t feel forced at all. It just naturally exudes from their personalities.I snicker and giggle the whole way through because it\'s very funny, just the kind of humor I love. There\'s no slapstick, gags, or chibi transformations, which tend to be mildly funny at best. This is quality humor.It\'s not all humor. The experiences they have and problems they overcome feel good to watch, and they haven\'t felt forced so far. Rather, they are quite natural.The characters are wonderful. They seem very real. The main characters, Kyousuke, the brother, and Kirino, the sister, have a very believable relationship where they sort of act like they just ""tolerate"" each other, yet very much do care for each other and both know it, but coming out and saying it bluntly would be embarrassing. It\'s really a very common type of sibling rivalry/relationship.Understanding this relationship is key to your enjoyment of the show. It seems many viewers don\'t understand this and so they think that Kirino is an unrealistically ungrateful bitch and her brother unrealistically puts up with it without complaint. But ironically, if you understand that they are really just pretending to only just ""tolerate"" each other, but really care about each other, this is what makes the show very unique and realistic. And it\'s why Kirino is so darn cute. So try to understand this while watching, and look for the hidden message or vibe that Kirino is sending even when she acts angry, and never take her ""mean"" act literally.Kyousuke is a great character, and seems to act just how I would want him to act. He\'s cool, reliable, sharp, and witty. Kirino is a tsundere-type character, but doesn\'t seem at all like a cliche. Kyousuke will sacrifice himself for his sister, which makes for some great moments as it breaks down Kirino ""defenses"" and forces her to acknowledge her brother\'s sacrifices with a grudging but sincere ""thanks"".  The other characters have strong personalities as well.The colors in the animation are bold and detailed, and camera angles and viewpoints are always keeping it fresh. The music complements the scenes very well, often breaking into the great ""theme song"" during feel-good resolutions of Kirino\'s problems when both Kyousuke and the viewers are rewarded with Kirino\'s cute fighting spirit or her grudging show of gratitude. It actually feels on par with an epic climatic scene in some lengthy drama.Towards the end of the series, there were some things I didn\'t like. The transition from one scene to another was sometimes very sudden, and some details that were important for the next scene were not sufficiently explained, almost like they were short on time and had to condense things. This happens in the last two episodes. In fact, the climatic moment in the final episode is extremely sudden, has no foreshadowing that I can see leading up to it, isn\'t clear whether it is intentional or accidental on the part of Kirino, and leaves me to have to wonder and speculate about what Kirino\'s thought\'s were leading up to the moment. I feel like Kirino should have shown signs that she was dealing with a tough dilemma, then we would then wonder what it was, and then the climatic moment would provide the answer. But as it is, it just leaves me puzzled.But overall, this was one of my favorite shows. It was hilarious, cute, and the best part is the unique personality of Kirino that is full of cute subtleties which I can easily relate to. Not your typical tsundere. doesn\'t feel forced at all.

Not your typical tsundere.', ""Believe me when I say to you, this is not what you were expecting. I've found brother-sister anime to be all either A: incestuous, or B: Completely boring. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai takes the brand new option C: Incredible. I consider myself to watch things that have a decent amount of quality to them. I don't like to waste my time watching things that end up wasting my time. After reading the description of this anime, I brushed it aside. However, after taking notice that there was quite a bit of support for the anime, I changed my mind one...boring Tuesday afternoon and downloaded the first three episodes. By the end of the first episode, I was completely immersed in the engaging storyline and the complex characters. Rarely does an anime bring me into the world of its characters, and rarely do I find myself connecting on a personal level with characters in the anime. I won't waste your time: if you're already interested in this anime, watch it. You don't even need to read the rest of this review. I'll say it right now: you're in for a real treat today.Story: 8When I first read the description here on MAL, I was skeptical. Very skeptical. Slice of life anime doesn't always have the most engaging plot structure. It tends to lack a definite climax, and often times, it seems like there's a lot left unresolved. However, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (further referenced as Ore no Imouto) was different. The first episode immerses you into its storyline, pulling you into its characters and plot, and each successive episode only serves to pull you in deeper. What was wonderful about this anime was its humor. Simply put, the story is about the strengthening of the bond between a brother and sister. The humor in this anime comes from the relationship a brother and a sister have, and, at times, the boundaries that are set by a society for a brother and sister. The story progresses as the main character's younger sister needs his help more and more. I won't give any sort of definite summary in this review. All I want to say is that the story moves continuously, there is no junk anywhere in this anime. Furthermore, the storyline is more than engaging enough to keep anyone entertained.Art: 8I didn't find the artwork to be all too impressive. However, it was plainly effective for what it set out to do. However, I would like to comment on the work that was done within anime of other fictional animes. Throughout the anime, there are other anime that appear as part of the interests of certain characters. The illustrators of Ore no Imouto did a fabulous job distinguishing the different tastes between Kirino and Kuroneko (Ruri). The contrast between these two characters made by the artwork shown in the anime that they watch greatly adds to the impression given to the reader that they're both crazy otaku, with wildly different tastes.Sound: 6I personally found no enjoyment out of the audio in this anime. While it wasn't terrible, it wasn't just outstanding. It fit the anime, which is of course what was important, but it couldn't stand up to the level of artistic intuition of the other 3 categories. It just wasn't there. There wasn't a place to put it even. Not that I can complain. The entire anime is consumed with substantial dialogue that really makes it what it is.Characters: 10Characters make this anime what it is. The characters in this anime are perfectly matched to create the perfect story. In my opinion, story is nothing without characters. The characters perfectly meld together to form interesting situations, which result in multiple laugh out loud moments. I think most people will agree that they don't laugh to themselves very often when they watch an anime. I laughed quite a few times, but at other times, this anime can capture your heart, because again, the relationship between a brother and a sister can become quite emotional. This is seen towards the end of the anime, and it is very emotional. Kyousuke Kousuka, played by Yuuichi Nakamura is the perfect older brother for this anime. By far my favorite character, his sarcastic commentary and his use of logic contrast brilliantly with his little sister's illogical and child-like desires, which seemingly have no bounds and which is he almost forced to accept. And that's just two of the characters. And normally, that's what you get out of an anime. The main characters are good, but usually, your supporting actors and actresses are a little boring. I loved several of the supporting characters in this anime, and I wish they could have made it longer so that their part in the story and their relationship with the main character could be made more definite, especially the Kyousuke and Kirino's friends, Akagi, Manami, and Ayase.Enjoyment: 10Despite what the anime lacked, I really enjoyed it. I don't think any sort of review will truly do this anime justice. This is easily one of the most humorous anime I have ever seen, with a witty and clever take on the relationship between a brother and sister. The anime kept its focus, and thereby keeps its viewers interested in the storyline and wanting more. The only problem I had with this anime was that it actually ended with only 12 episodes. Such a wonderful anime should have gone on longer, however I am definitely satisfied with the impact it left me.Just a few concluding remarks: I'd like to say this is not a ecchi incestuous anime. Although it at times hints towards that kind of anime, and although eroge does play a part in this anime, it is not actually between the two main characters. This anime seriously examines what it means to have a sibling, and the implications involved. This anime is truly something to be enjoyed for its outlook on the responsibilities of an older brother to his younger sister, and what it truly means to be there, selflessly sacrificing yourself, when someone really needs you. boring Tuesday afternoon and downloaded the first three episodes.

They can sure be a pain, and I know based on experience. They might cause you trouble and make you unhappy at times, but they really don\'t want that deep down. This seems to be the case in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can\'t Be This Cute), but maybe it was taken a little too far. I\'ll explain later.Story: 6Let me go over the story real quick. Kyousuke finds an eroge game in a DVD case. Kirino talks with him and reveals her hidden side; she\'s goes gaga for little sister eroges. Kyousuke decides to help her...out with ""life counseling"" sessions to get her to open up with her secret hobby. I\'m not gonna lie, it\'s an interesting story, to say the least. I mean we can all relate. We have secrets we might not want others to know. The problem for me is that it felt stereotypical and predictable. It had some twists near the end. but for the most part, I knew what was going to happen. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was quite sudden, which seemed forced to fit into the 12 episodes.Art: 6I\'m not gonna say much about this. Nothing spectacular. Quite generic. The end.Sound: 4I wasn\'t impressed by the sound used. The OP and EDs are forgettable. I honestly can\'t remember much that stood out at all. Oh well.Character: 3This is what made me really dislike this show. I don\'t care what anybody says; I hate Kirino with a passion so strong, it can only be compared to the force of a thousand suns. She was utterly useless for nearly the entirety of the series. I guess this is a little biased, because I hate people who care only about themselves, but that\'s just me. To me, she\'s a terrible person. She\'s not the only problem. Kyousuke, for example. He bland and boring. He has his moments, but they\'re scarce. This show has good characters though, like Manami and her grandfather. The problem is that they barely get any screen time, especially the grandfather who\'s only in one episode. Kuroneko and Saori are pretty alright characters as well, but they can\'t save the show.Overall, it\'s a story that had potential. It could have gone deeper, explaining the difficult relationship between Kyousuke helping Kirino accept the she has a hobby that she can\'t keep secret forever, but instead, we get a whiny sister and a boring brother doing stereotypical otaku things.

However, like any other hyped anime, sometimes one just has to see what is the deal with the popularity.First of all, I'll admit that the initial episodes showed promising signs. My fears of this turning into some sort of incestual fetish anime were dispelled almost immediately, and better yet, the premise while...rather ridiculous was merely a vehicle for a much more well grounded and relateable plot. At the beginning of the show, our main protagonist Kyousuke is seen to be in a rather broken relationship with his younger sister Kirino until, by accident, discovers that his sister is an closet otaku who apparently loves eroge games involving little sisters. The later confrontations over this fact would later lead to Kyousuke getting involved in his sister's secret lifestyle, and it is quite possible for this once broken sibling relationship to make amends over the glorious hobbies of an otaku.Despite all this, my initial positive impression of this show would quickly go down the drain. The show which initially presented itself both seriously and earnestly, became very dishonest. I really was tricked into thinking that they'd treat the otaku issues at least semi-seriously. The way those around her accept her as is puts me in utter disbelief. What was the point of her hiding her hobby in the first place if it was going to seem so easy to get more out in the open with it?I should have honestly seen the warning signs. Why of course, not only is our otaku in this show a moe bait girl, but she is also presented as absolutely perfect in anything she does. It's both hard to sympathize and care for the character Kirino when almost everything always works out for her.This is further exasperated by the protagonist and side character's willingness to be at her beckon call whenever a problem does arrive.It is quite apparent by at least the mid point of this show, that all Ore no Imouto truly wanted to be was some clever marketing scheme to create an otaku wish fulfillment fantasy anime. If there is one thing that I do not appreciate in anime, it is being patronized by the creators of a show. And my god, this show was certainly an insult to my intelligence.I say this of course without even mentioning just how insufferable Kirino is. Tsundere is the sort of trope where if you execute it well, you probably have a decent character in your grasp, but if you make a mess out of it, you get Louise from ZnT, and trust me, that's not a good thing...There are not many shows where the mere presence of one character seems to drag down the rest of the cast with them. Each and every character is bashed to death with the stupid stick anytime a situation with Kirino arises, in particular the main character Kyousuke. The only saving grace in the cast ever being the goth lolita charcter Kuroneko (They should just a spin off series about her). Hey even I admit that she's a bitch, but at least she's a bitch I can find amusing and sympathize with. There's absolutely nothing sympathetic about the character Kirino. She expresses belligerent behavior to those around her, especially her brother, without consequence and we're supposed to sit here and laugh.This is merely another breaking point in my suspension of disbelief (As if I hadn't reached that threshold already to some degree) for this anime. One cannot simply accept that a brother, Kyousuke, who supposedly hates his sister, would go to hell and back for a sister that shows anything but kindness to him. It just doesn't make sense. Either Kyousuke is one of the greatest saints I have seen in fiction or the writing here is just terrible and breaks characterization. To say the least, it's not enjoyable to watch either way.To sum it up without ranting too much about this trash series... If you dislike tsunderes, stay away. If you dislike otaku-wish fulfillment animes, stay away. If you are looking for a real down to earth exploration of a sibling relationship. I repeat, stay away.All we have here is an otaku wish fulfillment anime centralized around a Mary Sue character. If that is something you enjoy, go ahead.

The author brilliantly twists drama and slice of life into one of the most thought provoking pieces of Kino to ever come out of Japan. The supporting casts is of course diverse and colorful providing interesting tension as they get involved within the main characters' lives and dilemma. It is no surprise why this has become one, if not THE, most influential and recognizable non-shonen series of the early 2010s.

I especially like the parents, they seem more real than the eccentric-type parents that often show up in this kind of anime.  I also like the fact that they don't really design the little sister (Kirino) to be really sexy, and even point out her affection for the imooto-ero games is pure, which makes the anime a lot more comfortable to watch.  I hope its not like Kiss X Sis, that one weirded me out.I'd agree with the last reviewer, the series has a lot of potential....Most of the really funny stuff was during the end credits, and if that's any indication of the season, I can't wait for more.

Incest in general is just all sorts of wrong, wrong, WRONG. Plus, everything about this anime just screams ""hentai doujinshi fodder"".Putting that aside, I gave this series a chance because I was attracted by the beautiful animation and cute character designs and I was actually pleasantly surprised.Although there are some questionable camera shots of Kirino from Kyosuke\'s point of view (for the fanboys, I suppose), their overall relationship remains sibling-like and both characters are thoroughly put off by anything more than that. I\'m not...sure how this will develop in later episodes/chapters but so far it hasn\'t really set off any ""creepy/gross!"" alarms.What I enjoyed most (besides beautiful animation) is the humor. I chuckled at several scenes (I really enjoyed Kyosuke\'s ""Kick her off the bed!"" selection in the eroge game, mostly because that\'s what any REAL big brother would choose).Anyway, I can\'t say this is an anime for everyone, cause there really are some truly crazy creepy people out there that would read way into Kyosuke and Kirino\'s relationship...I would advise those people to stay away (please).

Most critiques I have seen so far of Ore no Imouto are ""My friend told me to watch it because he/she said it was really good, but it was just some anime catering to the otakus of the industry"". Reviewer then proceeds to either make fun of otakus, or even more amusing, says why this anime is actually... just an anime! An anime being anime-like? Taboo.Ore no Imouto takes a cliche school / slice of life anime setup and sets it at a new...angle. Sure, some of the character designs are stereotypical, but they\'re all created that way to convey a certain feeling to the audience. That feeling, at least in the anime (because I highly suspect the original was romantic love) is actually sibling or familial love. To break it down for those of you who still think Ore no Imouto is cliche: I don\'t know of any other anime that really discusses sibling love in a more mature light than this one.People complain about Kyousuke being a wimp, and for the most part, he definitely appears to seem like one. However, consider his father, who is actually portrayed somewhat realistically. As a sibling myself, I can clearly see how the iron fist of a father\'s control over something that is your favorite hobby could really lead the siblings to come together and make amends for their past.Another argument people have against Ore no Imouto is the ""girl who loves eroge"" cliche/catering to otakus. While it could be seen in this light, I saw it as the stereotypical anime exaggeration that we see everywhere, in order to make an important point. We see Kyousuke fighting for his sister\'s rights to appreciate and enjoy her own hobby at her own leisure without being judged by others around her. It\'s a wonderful message to send across, despite it being moved by the eroge factor. However, it\'s the very fact that Kirino\'s hobby is eroge that shows if Kyousuke can justify this hobby to those around him, any hobby can be justified, and in general, any action that does not harm anyone else.It sends a message to those radically in opposition of hobbies that others have, and a general message of acceptance. Kirino, by the end of the series, seems to be hated by many viewers for what she has done to Kyousuke. Part of that appears to be intentional, as it leaves the audience wondering ""How can Kyousuke put up with all of the crap Kirino does to him?""It\'s true, it seems unbelievable, and is highly unlikely in today\'s world. But since when has anime ever tried to accurately portray reality? Most of us watch anime because it glorifies simple personalities and relationships between people, transforming them into something wonderful. We watch it because it gives us an escape into a world that we enjoy watching, or may even want to live in, because it is so radically emotionally different than our world.It seems that some people are forgetting the magic of anime that led all of us to watch it in the first place.

However, it will be referred to as “Oreimo” in this review for convenience.The Good:-Great animation and voice acting-Not afraid to poke fun at its own stereotypes-Great cast of colourful charactersThe Bad:-Great cast doesn’t have enough time in the limelight-Most of the story progression is only in the first half...-Seems too short for what it sets out to doSynopsis:The plot focuses on 17-year old Kousaka Kyousuke and his 14-year old sister Kirino. As they were growing up, Kyousuke and Kirino’s relationship was pretty much non-existent, and besides occasionally exchanging pleasantries and arguing, they stayed out of each other’s way. One day, Kyousuke discovers a case for a Magical Girl anime called “Stardust Witch Meruru” and wonders where it came from. Upon opening the case, he discovers a DVD for an adult hentai game. He is dumbfounded and has no idea where it came from. He later discovers that both the DVD case and the game belong to Kirino. Later that night, Kirino calls Kyousuke into her room and reveals that she is an otaku and has an extensive collection of anime and adult hentai DVDs that she had been collecting in secret and hiding from her family. However, Kirino struggles with her hobby because she knows how much otaku are looked down upon by society, and so she implores Kyousuke to help her come to terms with her hobby and to help her find friends with similar interests. Kyousuke doesn’t understand much about the hobby or about what’s going on, but he reluctantly agrees to help Kirino.The main thing I liked about Oreimo is that is isn’t exaggerated in any way, as far as human interaction goes. It is firmly planted in reality and never tries to stray from it. This doesn’t mean everything that takes place in it takes place every day in real life, however; Kirino’s relationship with her hobby is soon apparent to be somewhat exaggerated, perhaps in an attempt to explain to casual anime viewers that being an otaku is just as much a hobby as any other. On the same token, though Kirino’s hobby is a mainstay in her lifestyle, she is still firmly planted in reality, and even has a job as a model to pay for the games and anime she buys. Kyousuke’s character, I found, is even moreso planted in reality. He doesn’t have a full grasp on his sister’s hobby and the way she acts, and he even shows fear of his sister, only standing up to her in dire situations.  Though Kirino was the one who implored Kyousuke to help her with her struggles, she often implies she doesn’t enjoy his company, even though she consistently forces him to spend time with her. Oreimo is a comedy through and through, and even with that said, it is wholly injected with a  healthy dose of reality.There are some things I disliked about Oreimo, however. It is only twelve episodes long. I feel like that really isn’t long enough for the show to do what it sets out to do. There is a twist, however; Episode 12 is only an “alternative” ending. From my understanding, there will be a “true” ending released with the BD/DVD release of the anime. At the time of this writing, it’s not out yet, but I’m sure they will be made available shortly after release. I found this to be a unique twist on an otherwise underwhelming ending, and I’ll definitely be interested in seeing it when released.Another thing I disliked is that most of its story progression only happens in the first half of the anime, while not a whole lot happens in the second half other than character interaction. This isn’t always a bad thing; sometimes the story set-up is more than enough to carry the show for the rest of its run. However, I sort of wished the story went a bit farther than it did.All of this said, Oreimo is a hilarious take on a very real situation, and it is probably the best anime of the fall. I highly recommend it if you love comedy.Final Rating: 9/10 -Seems too short for what it sets out to doSynopsis:The plot focuses on 17-year old Kousaka Kyousuke and his 14-year old sister Kirino.

While not quite up there with shows like Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, when contrasted with more standard efforts like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu this show it truly special.Our story follows Kyousuke who inadvertently stumbles across his seemingly perfect younger sister Kirino's secret obsession with little sister's (in games...and anime). He reluctantly chooses to support her and they progressively grow closer through Kirino's hobby.It's not the greatest idea for a story, especially straight off the back of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu which had little else going for it bar the novelty of the idea. The premise does serve to give the show an excuse to delve around Otaku culture and scenario's it would other wise struggle to incorporate into this sort of show.Depending on your tolerance and standards there is allot of subtle, or at times not so subtle fan service in this show, the character models are distinct and fantastically realised, the backgrounds are rich and vivid, the whole experience is visually cheerful and vibrant. If you hold this up against pretty much any comedy it's right up there with the best of them animation wise.The sound track complements the cheery atmosphere of the show well, i wasn't overly fond of the dramatic score they used for every dramatic scene, it seemed a little over the top at times. The voice acting was first rate, again distinctive injecting genuine individuality into a first rate cast of characters, production values are something to rave about here, AAA standard all the way.The characters for this show are truly exceptional, i'd rate the supporting cast as the best i've ever come across in a show bar none, all this considering i didn't especially like Kirino at any point in the show. Kyousuke can be compared with the Kyon's and the Tomoya Okazaki's of anime, exactly the same mold slightly sarcastic darkly likeable male lead. Kirino is loud, bold, spoilt and dominant, not my favourite among the female cast by some distance, but her personality is necessary to drive the story forward.Supporting cast member's Ayase, Kanako, Saori, Ruri even Kiriko's father, are simplly first rate, my only complaint would be they didn't get more combined screen time, an excellent mix of weird and wonderful characters who often overshadow the leads.Enjoyment wise for all my positiveness there were a good few episodes that were genuinely tedious, the episode they spent pitching an anime to studio execs springs to mind fairly quickly. This should not detract from the good 75% of brilliant material, many genuinely laugh out loud moments, a fantastic pacing and energy to the whole experience and a surprisingly good spread of themes, episode styles and character face time.Overall it is a crime in my eyes that both the front page reviews score this show to be 1 point above an average show, this was easily among the best shows in what was an especially strong season, and one of the better slice of life comedies you could hope to come across, do not be put off this is one of the easiest watches you will come across. and anime).

This should not detract from the good 75% of brilliant material, many genuinely laugh out loud moments, a fantastic pacing and energy to the whole experience and a surprisingly good spread of themes, episode styles and character face time.Overall it is a crime in my eyes that both the front page reviews score this show to be 1 point above an average show, this was easily among the best shows in what was an especially strong season, and one of the better slice of life comedies you could hope to come across, do not be put off this is one of the easiest watches you will come across."", 'IMO, this anime is mediocre at best. People at general seem to like it, but maybe I just don\'t see its full potential. I do like the ending.Kyosuke, the male lead is a doormat. He suffers from apathy, and who can blame him? Putting with all the shit his little sister does. He is basically a slave to her problems and desires and has none of his own. Yes, he gets some affection - but hell, for all the effort he is putting in that\'s insane. We can\'t put all the blame on his sister, he is a pushover.Kirino, the female lead. I hate her...character. She is basically a tsundere on steroids. The entire story revolves around her problems of being a model and a closet otaku and how her ""big brother"" helps her out. Its not as much helping out as it is pure slavery. She drags him doing shit he doesn\'t want, puts responsibility on him to deal with her things.. Nonsense drama.Supposedly the anime is great because of how real the interaction between brother/sister are and how they go from step one to uncover their true feelings. That\'s all good and that\'s the hook of the anime. I don\'t like the way Kyosuke acts. He is way too much of a doormat and a pushover and the entire anime is about that. How can an anime be about revealing feelings when the male lead doesn\'t take any action or reveal any feelings to the bullshit he is facing? Nonsense drama, that\'s how.The art is great though.

The author of it has got to be on some sort of list, as will probably happen to you if you rate this show high. Unfortunately, the first anime I watched a very long time ago and at a young age too. Only ""saving grace"" is the opening song and good looking characters, which is why anyone could find this show appealing. Even then their personalities are horrid. That is to be expected, as there is no plausible way to make a healthy and adequate...story out of degeneracy and incest.

Save your sanity, I wish I did when I was a young teen.', '""This anime can\'t be any good!"" is what I thought at first, but the name, I mean the context, is absolutely misleading.STORY: I have to say, this anime probably slapped alot of people in the face if they expected another run of the mill ecchi, moe, and or even incest anime. Well my face has a big red hand print on it.The very beginning shows a cute girl trying to wake her older brother, Kyosuke Kosaka telling him she has done nice gestures like fixing him breakfast, just like another ecchi/harem/moe/whatever else belongs there typical anime, but instead her brother becomes angry saying my sister...is never this nice, you\'re a fake, and ""My little sister can\'t be this cute!""That was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he\'s right, I don\'t think anyone would think she\'s actually that ""cute"" as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can\'t help but to feel punk\'d haha.Instead, this is a slice of life anime about Kyosuke and his little, and seemingly perfect in many ways sister, Kirino Kosaka, who is also an otaku (Or what I should say is that she is a closet otaku) who has quite the collection of little sister themed anime and game, mostly inappropriate ones that she keeps them a secret from everyone except Kyosuke who finds out about it (Because apparently up until this point, she was rather good at hiding her hobby from her friends and family).The story and plot are kinda thin, like most slice of life anime, but it\'s about Kyosuke trying to be suportive of Kirino\'s hobby as an older brother (The best comparison to their relationship would be how the characters  from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya act towards each other; Kyon and Haruhi), but she proves to be the drama case with the two arguing alot and Kirino almost unbearable attitude towards her brother.But honestly I believe a lot of anime fans are going to sympathise with Kirino about being an otaku/anime fan and doesn\'t want anyone to find out cause she feels that her hobby will damage her image that she has established in her social life and her friends.While other (Well most) viewers of this anime will just think she\'s a terrible excuse of an anime character, but that\'s the impression I get from her character.More characters appear later on, mostly fellow otaku who seemingly are based on sterotype anime fandom personalities, the somewhat gothic tsundere girl who often argues with Kirino, Ruri Goko (aka Kuroneko) and the obvious stereotype otaku looking girl, Saori Makishima.It\'s a very nice paced story that never goes into the incest line that the title almost screams at youANIMATION: Very well animated with excellent character designs, it\'s nothing awe inspiring, but it\'s much better than most would\'ve expected.SOUND: The background music is really plain, and sometimes sounds like it belonged from some unremarkable harem/ecchi anime.The voice acting is pretty good, especially Kyosuke\'s Seiyuu, though I can\'t really say cause I\'m often too busy reading the subtitles.The opening theme is very catchy pop song, Irony, while the ending theme usually changes in every episode, each one offering okay music.OVERALL:+ A better anime than it\'s name suggests+ Great animation and excellent character designs+ Doesn\'t become a creepy incest anime like the title suggests- Nothing special audio- The sister character is easy to hateDespite it\'s name, this anime is much better than most slice of life anime out there, especially if you were expecting another harem/ecchi/moe/whatever anime.SECOND OPINION: (Updated: April 26, 2011)Looking back on what I said, though it was refreshing, the series has a couple of flaws.*The main character is sort of an idiotic tool, and has the personality of a blank sheet of paper, my comparison to Kyon (The main male character of the haruhi series) is kinda loose.*Kirino is actually a little too easy to hate, though the part of her that\'s okatu is relate-able, her overall character is annoying as hell.*The background music is actually worse than what I said it was.*Not enough development for other characters, especially Saori Makishima, who receives an interesting character twist in the final episodes.*Despite it not being an incest anime, there\'s, unfortunately,  a lot of incest overtones in the anime.SECOND OPINION SCORE:STORY: 7ART: 8SOUND: 6CHARACTER: 6ENJOYMENT: 9OVERALL: 7It\'s still a fun anime, but it\'s not as good as I first felt about it.But I still like it and I would still recommend it to other fans of slice of life anime. is never this nice, you\'re a fake, and ""My little sister can\'t be this cute!""That was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he\'s right, I don\'t think anyone would think she\'s actually that ""cute"" as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can\'t help but to feel punk\'d haha.Instead, this is a slice of life anime about Kyosuke and his little, and seemingly perfect in many ways sister, Kirino Kosaka, who is also an otaku (Or what I should say is that she is a closet otaku) who has quite the collection of little sister themed anime and game, mostly inappropriate ones that she keeps them a secret from everyone except Kyosuke who finds out about it (Because apparently up until this point, she was rather good at hiding her hobby from her friends and family).The story and plot are kinda thin, like most slice of life anime, but it\'s about Kyosuke trying to be suportive of Kirino\'s hobby as an older brother (The best comparison to their relationship would be how the characters  from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya act towards each other;

I\'ve heard a bit about it and it could potentially be... Actually, no. I may be putting my foot in my mouth here, since I write the opening paragraphs before watching the actual anime, but there\'s no conceivable way this is going to be good. It\'s a harem series with a title that roughly translates to ""My Little Sister can\'t be this cute."" That just reeks of incest and sleaze. I\'m really not looking forward to this one, but when one...of my lovely fans asks me to review something, I do try to do so. Let\'s just get this over with.The story follows a teenager with a sister complex named Kyousuke. I will be simply referring to him as Creeper. One afternoon Creeper finds an anime DVD case with an ero game about little sisters inside and, being dumber than a potted plant, he can\'t figure out which of his family members it belongs to and there are only three of them besides him. After dropping some really obvious hints and laying a really obvious trap he\'s able to figure out that it belongs to his sister. The anime, naturally, never explains how a middle school kid managed to buy pornographic games. Creeper gets recruited to help his sister reconcile her hidden hobby with her personal life through a series of idiotic tasks. There\'s supposedly humour in this, but good luck finding a funny joke. Most of the jokes are based around either Creeper\'s sister complex or Kirino\'s hobby. Oreimo, just because you draw attention to the fact that your premise is gross and tell people to laugh, that does not diminish the repulsiveness. There\'s a smattering of other humour types, including an incredibly homophobic scene towards the end, but none of it is funny at all. On the plus side, the physical humour in this is quite cathartic since all the characters are annoying and horrible. It isn\'t funny, but it\'s cathartic. The finale in this is horrendous. The contrived final conflict comes out of and goes absolutely nowhere. Making it one of the most pointless finales in the history of anime. Then you have the incestuous undertones which serve to make the whole thing thoroughly unpleasant.The characters in this are incredibly flat tropes. About the only thing that makes Creeper unique as a harem protagonist is his sister complex, which is not a positive change. For Kirino they just took the tsundere archetype, except that she\'s into her brother. Again, not a positive alteration.The art is nothing special. It\'s kind of a typical moe style. What makes it worse than it could have been is the fan-service. Prepare for panty and bra shots of a fourteen year old. Then count yourself as fortunate that your name isn\'t on some type of registry. The backgrounds are pretty plain.The voice acting in this sounds pretty bad. A lot of the emotion is portrayed by yelling instead of... what\'s the word? Oh yes, emoting. It\'s sad since the actors in this can act, when they have roles that actually require them to. I feel kind of sorry for Taketatsu Ayana. Just about every time her name gets mentioned in my reviews it\'s because she was in a role that demanded a terrible performance. There\'s this, Baka to Test, Highschool of the Dead, and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou. In contrast the only review I\'ve done where she gave a truly good performance in the anime was K-on. The music is the best part of the anime. It\'s not good, but it\'s okay.The yuri factor is a 5/10. Kirino\'s reaction to cute girls and her dynamics with both Kuroneko and Ayase come off as pretty homo-erotic. You know, this anime would have been greatly improved if they\'d removed creeper completely and focused on that. It would still be stupid, but at least it wouldn\'t be gross.This anime is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The incestuous under-tones are much more downplayed and far less prominent than I thought they would be. It\'s still a stupid, stupid anime with not a moment of laughter to be found and obnoxious tropes of characters. I do not suggest watching it or even thinking about its existence. My final rating is a 2/10.Next week, I\'ll be looking at Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited- Hyoubu Kyousuke, unless something unexpected comes up. of my lovely fans asks me to review something, I do try to do so.

This is NOT a harem!Suggesting title, a theme that resembles it, moe characters, loli-like maho shoujo?, tagged ""seinen""... This gotta be a harem!! Well... yeah, it\'s not. Were you wondering if it is like KissXSis? Or you ended up here after a easygoing ecchi/fanservice?If it was the first one, you\'re wrong. Try another one. If it was the second, congratz this is the right one for you!Going straight to the point, this is a whole new interpretation of the seinen stories! HA. Who am I kidding, besides what they want you to think, this anime have nothing ""new"". There\'re some inovations but it ends up being the same.The story goes around the bitter sweet day-by-day of Kirino and Kyousuke Kousaka (YES. blood-related). Kirino ends up having a ""different"" hobbie. She loves anime, doujinshi and... erogues of \'loli little sisters\'.Recently there\'ve been a lot of animes of this kind (not loli little sisters) but instead, series that talk about themselves, was created even a category for it: ""otaku culture"" what is better to sell a product if not making the user indentify himself with it?Being it a recurrent theme, OreImo\'s staff tried to diversify a little and twisted the main concept and layout of it. For this anime, as you can see, the otaku here is Kirino, a girl, not a NEET, popular, fashionable... I admit, it is interesting, that\'s why I watched it and now is reviewing.It\'s reasonable to think a new approach to the theme, and this new kind of scenario would have some problems. The plot itself seemed broken sometimes and had lots of flaws in the background story. There\'s no development of it! They didn\'t care to explain for you some events prior to the 1st episode, for example, why Kirino and Kyousuke relationship was ""frozen"" like that. Or what about Saori? What is she? A damn billionaire?Not even in a flashback. Seriously? This wasn\'t the kind of storyline I was expecting from Aniplex (cmon, they did AnoHana).Only because it\'s a comedy anime it doesn\'t mean you\'re free from developing this part.While reviewing the story, it\'s interesting to point out, that OreImo succeded at making the anime looks like a visual novel. You have the 1st season with 12 episodes that ends in one way, and another 4 eps special with a different ending.For those in doubt, you can better enjoy it if you watch all together:Main series: 1 to 12.a""good ending""Specials: 12.b to 15""true route"" [2nd season will pick up from here]Comentary: 1 to 16 [you don\'t have to watch this one. Just chibi extras.]The production staff had very nice and interesting ideias for the OP/ED and soundtrack. There\'s a different opening and ending song for every each one of the episodes and the animation of it is also slight different. This is something to give credit for, they reinvented the OP/ED in a way it was interesting to watch, not like other animes when you just skip it because it\'s repetitive and gets boring after a while.The OP song was done by ClariS, (you probably heard about it already), they\'re two middle-schoolers girls who happened to debut as singers, another promissing new talent that fits with the concept of ""inovation"" the anime brought.Another letdown of OreImo was definitely the characters. Not because they aren\'t nice, but because there is no development of it at all. It was completly left aside. MAYBE it will get better in the 2nd season but for this 1st, it was just painful to watch. A lot of strong supportive characters weren\'t developed as they could be. For some reason (maybe the fanservice) the staff sticked with KirinoXKyousuke and forgot about the others. Ayase for example, gets a lot of screen time but her development is left off to the side making her look like a stupid side-kick that have nothing to add.On the other hand, the female lead, Kirino, is a horrible person. No matter how you look at  it. She\'s 99% tsun, 1% dere. I thought they would change it during the story but it didn\'t. She stayed with the same despicable personality the whole story in a way that makes you anger about it. I felt like I was watching SchoolDays again.Everyone was so hyper about this anime that I decided to give it a try.This was a great anime about ""otaku culture"" but pretty much sucked at other things. They tryied to catch seinen viewers by using the ""Siscon"" stuff but in the end it turns out to be an average story that could be better developed.It\'s not the best anime of its season. However, if you have free time and think of yourself as a otaku or a ""erogamer"" (whatever), you\'ll have a nice time with the tons of references  and ""visual"" jokes they present in this anime.Quoting my friend: ""Watch it for the experience""If you want a better enjoyment of the series, please read the manga.Story: 7 | Art: 8 | Sound: 8 | Character: 7 | Enjoyment: 8 | Overall: 7If you read until here BEFORE voting down (or up), thanks!!Pleeease talk with me!

However, if you have free time and think of yourself as a otaku or a ""erogamer"" (whatever), you\'ll have a nice time with the tons of references  and ""visual"" jokes they present in this anime.Quoting my friend: ""Watch it for the experience""If you want a better enjoyment of the series, please read the manga.Story: 7 | Art: 8 | Sound: 8 | Character: 7 | Enjoyment: 8 | Overall: 7If you read until here BEFORE voting down (or up), thanks!!Pleeease talk with me!

The atmosphere is lighter than the manga.  Most scenes are less intense and dramatic, with more comedic relief in the anime. But the script still balances the more serious...part of the story with the lighthearted part nicely.Story wise, it's very good actually. Most people(at least the ones that I know) expect incest to come out of this, but so far, there's none. Though I won't be discussing the story in details, basically the story is more about a brother trying to help his sister with her hobby, which carries a stigma in the society they live in.  And how he helps her juggle between this and her perfect life.Though of course it's still at episode 5 when I wrote this review, and the anime has already caught up with the manga, and I don't read the light novels, so I can't say for sure how the story will go. However, even though the story might go through the incest route, it will only deepen the story, as it will give a moral conundrum to the story, which is always nice.And finally, if you don't like too much fanservice like me, you'd be glad to know that the amount of fanservice is a little bit less than the average anime.

Then I started rewatching it, and I was completely wrong.Story - 10The story has a very unique plot that I've never seen in any other anime, which is about a girl named Kirino Kousaka who is obsessed with cute eroge games.

Knowing where it eventually ends up taints whatever satirical reading you want to apply to it, too. Regardless, its portrayal of finding a group of like-minded individuals is almost heartwarming. Almost. Kirino, the little sister, is a really bizarre creation, however. She’s almost too unique and strange to dismiss, and yet at every moment we are aware of her as a product of a calculated effort to be two things at once (both a proud enthusiast of the fetish that the show’s about, and also an object to be fetishized over by the audience). Kirino then remains more of a provocation, an...idea, than a fully fleshed-out character.

Surely, there's no way that a model middle schooler could do things like that.Or is there a way? Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is an anime that tells you a story of a high schooler named Kyousuke Kousaka. His relationship with his sister named Kirino Kousaka is...pretty troublesome, and the anime centers around that relationship. I have always liked sister & brother stories, and on top of that the anime also involves a lot of otaku culture in it. Kirino is a top achiever in her school, great athlete and also a model. And, when no one sees, she also plays eroge games and watches anime. One night, she shows her secret to his brother and asks for a life counselling. The idea itself is pretty unique to me, and from the start this anime seemed to be very funny. The story itself is not bad, but what I really liked was the characters, Kirino is a a character that you want to hug tightly, but at the same time you want to beat him to death. It seems like she is your usual tsundere, but I think she is more than that. Kirino's father is an old fashioned man that has no tolerance for things like eroge. And her mother is your typical kind mother. The only character which I didn't like that much is, surprisingly, the main character. Kyousuke could have had some balls to stand up against his sister. Their relationship works fine this way also, but I would have wanted to see him getting really mad at Kirino some times.When you put this setting into action, you can't have a bad anime. Kyousuke's and Kirino's relationship is one very interesting thing, It's like you are waiting for them to either kill each other or commit something that is also illegal at any point. It doesn't help that Kirino also plays eroges that have the objective of charming your own little sister, the sibling complex is there all the time, kinda lurking in the shadows when Kirino acts all tsundere and I love it. But there's no way that Kirino would ever look her brother that way right, it would be gross! However, in her games it's not. At the same time Kyousuke just tries to not give a fuck and just help his sister. When you mix this up with very tight dad that has no understanding for anything like that, you get very comical and enjoyable anime.The otaku culture is also very relevant in this anime. Part of this anime deals with problems that one faces when prejudged based on his hobby. You play eroges, so you are a gross human being. This anime really tries to break that and teach you that any thing that brings you such joy and unifies people like that can't be that bad. At least I saw a meaning like that behind this anime, which is a nice thing. In the end, it's just a hobby, but all people don't understand that. That plus Kirino's and Kyousuke's relationship really made this anime worthwhile. I must also mention that is was funny to see her playing those eroges, since I have played some myself and all those things that happen in that anime regarding that are very true. Anyone who watches anime can relate himself to this story and feel accepted.The ending changes every episode, and there is not even one bad ending there, I liked them all. On top of that, I loved The opening. The art seems to be your normal modern style art, very bright colors that actually do fit very well in this anime.This anime was very funny and at the same time very interesting anime that still didn't forget to convey some kinda message through you.

Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (Ore no Imouto for short) is an anime that...I really should not like, but I do...A Lot. The basic theme of incest made me sort of feel uncomfortable when I came of of the show with a smile on my face. It is one of my biggest ""guilty pleasures"".Ratings List:Story 7/10:The amount of good plot that Ore no Imouto actually has come as a suprise. While other in the slice of life genre tend to just have a group of friends that...hang out and do..well...stuff, Ore no Imoto works much more like a romance than an average slice of life. The main characters, Kirino and Kyosuke, build their relationship slowly over the course of the show.There is also a lot of comedy in the show that is hilarious. The powerful themes of fitting in and friendship that are shown over the course of the show really do hit home. The basic concept of the plot something that I have never seen before, and something that drew me in right off the bat (point for originality). Ore no imouto just has a certain way of drawing you into it\'s world and making you forget that its even and anime. I found that there were many times during the show when I could barely watch the screen because I was laughing to hard or because I was so embarrassed about a situation that the characters were in.Characters 8/10:Like in many romance/slice of life shows, its the characters and their interactions that you come to watch, and Ore no Imoto does not fail to deliver.The 2 main characters are almost polar opposites. The main character Kyosuke is a laid back guy that loves his ordinary life. The main heroine Kirino is a hyper and popular girl. She is a hardcore ( and I\'m talking HARDCORE) anime fan, but is afraid to tell her friends about it in fear of being shunned by her family and friends. These 2 lead the show and because they are so opposite in personality. Their romance feels genuine and it\'s fun watching the two grow closer over the duration of the show. Also because of their opposites in personality the romance can become hilarious at times too. Along side the main characters are a group of side characters that all have their different roles to play in the show. They were all memorable and all seems at least somewhat fleshed out. Many of the characters (even a lot the side ones) felt a lot like real people, which really helps to draw you into the world.Art 9/10:The art of Ore no Imouto was simply astounding. There is an amazing attention to detail in the background and in the character designs. The characters are always in a variety of outfits, and the art style is very colorful and cheery for the most part. That colorful and upbeat art style really fits the overall mood of the show. Personally, Ore no Imouto has some of the best art I have seen in a romance anime in a long time.Enjoyment Level 8/10:At the end of the day I have to say that I enjoyed this show a lot. Ore no Imouto is definitely worth the watch for anyone that enjoys hilarious and romantic fun. Although I was cautious about the show and its play on incest; I soon even forgot that the main characters were ever brother and sister. They are complete opposites in almost every way possible, from hair color to personalty. It has a rather good plot that can at times be rather engrossing; which is a lot more than I can say for many others in its genre.

Currently it hasn't had enough time for a development in the plot for it is only the first episode. However, it has done a good introduction of characters though between the brother and sister and their lifestyle. This anime has great potential for the paradox ( the younger sister being an otaku and playing little sister games) has the ability to become a great comedy. I'm looking forward to the next episode.- Nekocrisis_562802Now continuation of my review we go forth to episode 2 of the...series. Now, in the prior episode the audience got the introduction of the characters and the plot of the series(of course they did it was the first episode). This episode elaborated on the way others think negatively/less highly  of otakus. During this episode it showed how society views otakus and that truly gave depth to the plot because in the first episode we caught sight of this from the protagonists' parents,especially the father.This was a good development for it gave us more reasons to support the Main characters. Well, the plot has grown but with improvements on one thing one loses something, episode 2 didnt have as much comedy as the first episode. Although there could have been a great comedy scene during Kyousuke Kousaka's awkward moment. Well I'll let you make your own decisions on the matters. Well all in all it still was entertaining and looking forward to episode 3.-Nekocrisis_562802 series.

The only reason I did not drop this anime after the first 3 episodes is because I have a bad habit of finishing what I start. Also, this was just 12 episodes anyway.The imouto\'s personality is horrible and will make you feel intense hatred towards her. I already hate wimpy characters with no personality, and the male MC is like the king of such characters, who does not even try to correct his garbage little sister when she\'s obviously going down the wrong path as a human being. ""Life counseling"" my ass. ', '""mmm, this tastes pretty good.""-Kyosuke Kousaka, OreimoSuch a deep, profound quote from an anime equally as powerful in meaning. As a slice of life romcom, I didn\'t expect much from Oreimo when I first heard about it. Boy oh boy, how wrong I was, and I think this quote is a perfect example of how this anime spoke to me.Some of the greatest shows of the past few centuries (giving examples such as Boku no Pico and it\'s almost-as-good counterpart Sword Art Online) have become almost universally recognized as anime classics. Why? Because while they may seem like humble stories at first, they are ultimately...conveying a sapient message to viewers, merely using anime as a communication medium. Boku no Pico used the guise of a short love drama to relay a deeper message about the average intelligence quotient of today\'s 5-year-old-boys. Similarly, Sword Art Online was a message about how wearing black clothes magically gets you a personal harem for no apparent reason, using an adventure anime as a cover. It is the same way with the work of genius that is Oreimo.PLOT 10/10The plot of Oreimo is like none other you\'ve see in anime. It ignores all cheesy cliches of the slice of life genre. For example, the main character is a male, except he is surrounded by a hoard of females. This technique is called a ""Harem,"" and it is very rarely used in anime because of it\'s difficulty to master. Well I can say for certain that this show masters the art of the Harem. It is little details such as these which separate Oreimo from the torrents of crap romcoms coming out today.But as I mentioned earlier, Oreimo houses a deeper meaning. In reality, this show explores the meaning of forbidden love and how the social convention causes us to make decisions we may not want to do.CHARACTERS 10/10It\'s been said a unique cast of characters is all that is needed to make an anime great, and I have to say I disagreed with this statement... until I saw Oreimo. When you watch most slice of life shows, you often see a female lead who is so shallow you can predict her every line or one that doesn\'t change at all during the series. Oreimo, being the masterpiece that it is, ignores both of these cliches. Our heroine, Kirino, changes her personality arbitrarily, with no consistency whatsoever in her logic or actions. This makes her unpredictable, and thus, much more enjoyable to watch. Furthermore, she changes immensely over the course of the series. At first, she is cold to her brother, the main character, but as the show progresses, she starts to show a much warmer side. This kind of character development is very rare in the world of anime, and it\'s one of the reasons why this show is so great.VISUALS/SOUND 10/10Whoever animated this series is a god. Visually, everything in this series is stunning. While everything about this show\'s artwork is superb, there are a few bits which I consider to be among the most well drawn-frames in all of anime, the main highlight being Kirino\'s left earlobe. This earlobe has become semi-famous in the anime community for is superior art quality, and easily is my favorite anime facial body part of all time.OVERALL I give this anime a well-earned 10/10. It is an absolute work of art and must not be missed. You can watch it on crunchyroll for legal streaming, but if for some reason that doesn\'t work for you then you can stare at a piece of blank cardboard for a few hours to get the same effect.P.S., This review conforms to all review guidelines, so I\'d like to see you try and take it down, Maffy. conveying a sapient message to viewers, merely using anime as a communication medium.

You know who you are!Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is a gem of an anime and something a lot of anime fans can relate to as in no one really understands why we watch it.The story follows Kyousuke Kousaka, a Mr Average, who doesn't excel or suck at anything. His little sister Kirano on the other hand is...brilliant at everything, school, sports and is even a model. What's more they don't get on. However, Kousaka discovers that Kirano has a big secret, she is a hardcore otaku for magical anime and sister love eroge. Despite their differences and not understanding why she is into what she's into he agrees to keep her secret and helps take her first steps in to otaku culture where they both make new friends.In all honesty I began watching Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai with a bit of trepidation after reading the synopsis as I feared the brother and sister would become lovers. I am pleased to say this never materialised. Instead the main aspect of the story is the building of the normal brother and sister relationship of Kousaka and Kirano which they never had before. This is also a harem anime, however, although there are romantic opportunities for Kousaka he is actually despised by one or two of the female characters so we don't have to endure the usual harem anime jokes. The comedy in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is very good and I did find myself laughing out loud on many occasions.I enjoyed the many of the characters. Kousaka is a good central character, essentially plays the straight man and being the butt of may of the jokes. He is also a great older brother suffering at the hands of a bratish and stubborn little sister who struggles to appreciate what her brother does for her. Kirano is a character you will like in the end or hate. Her bratish personality is deliberate and essential to the story which makes watching her get over herself all the more better.Because Kousaka plays the straight man it enables the other characters to shine. The most interesting of all is the cosplaying Kuroneko who represents the anime fans who watch anime to escape for a while their normal lives. We also find out a little, but just enough to get us interested, of the other characters.Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai was never going to be a masterpiece but is an enjoyable and fun comedy yet able to sentimental without being mushing. Well worth watching. brilliant at everything, school, sports and is even a model. What's more they don't get on.

I am pleased to say this never materialised. Instead the main aspect of the story is the building of the normal brother and sister relationship of Kousaka and Kirano which they never had before. This is also a harem anime, however, although there are romantic opportunities for Kousaka he is actually despised by one or two of the female characters so we don't have to endure the usual harem anime jokes. The comedy in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is very good and I did find myself laughing out loud on many occasions.I enjoyed the many of the characters. Kousaka is a good central character, essentially plays the straight man and being the butt of may of the jokes. He is also a great older brother suffering at the hands of a bratish and stubborn little sister who struggles to appreciate what her brother does for her. Kirano is a character you will like in the end or hate. Her bratish personality is deliberate and essential to the story which makes watching her get over herself all the more better.Because Kousaka plays the straight man it enables the other characters to shine. The most interesting of all is the cosplaying Kuroneko who represents the anime fans who watch anime to escape for a while their normal lives. We also find out a little, but just enough to get us interested, of the other characters.Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai was never going to be a masterpiece but is an enjoyable and fun comedy yet able to sentimental without being mushing. Well worth watching."", 'Good evening! Hello again, this time I\'m reviewing yet another harem! Well, it\'s kinda toned down as the guy is 17 years old and the girls are 14. The title is Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai! or MY LITTLE SISTER CAN\'T BE THIS CUTE! Lengthy title if you ask me, so I just call it OreImo or My Sister.I found this anime while browsing at a blog. It\'s a relatively good anime, something everyone can relate to. Even if you don\'t have a sister or the opposite. An incest anime without the sex and the love is replaced by a...brother-sister love.It\'s centered around the distant relationship of the ""Super Average"" 17-year-old Kyosuke Kousaka and his 14-year-old beautiful, Otaku, perverted and  ""tsundere"" sister, Kirino Kousaka, and how they try to know each other despite not communicating for many years even though they\'re at the same place. The only communication they go through is ""Tadaima!"" or ""I\'m home!"" in English.SPOILER ALERT!The story starts with the male protagonist waking up. Well, got woke up by his sister. He grabs her and it turns out that it was a dream.Later on, he and she would bump, and Kyosuke finds a magical girl anime and does not know who owns it. Much to his surprise, the content was not the show but an eroge or erotic game. Dinner had passed by and Kyosuke learns that it\'s Kirino\'s stuff. Then, Kirino brings him to her room and finally leaks out the huge stash of little sister eroge she had been keeping from them until now. She is an avid fan of those themes and is an Otaku.The story progresses as Kyosuke and Kirino build up their relationship with some struggles and new friends along the way. Examples are Kirino becoming a novelist and continues her modeling. While Kyosuke, becomes Kirino\'s slave-like brother and develops brotherly feelings for her.Even though it\'s a harem anime, there\'s not much ECCHI scenes to expect. If they were to do that, the show would be canceled and it will be branded as a lolicon/siscon hentai. The anime progresses much like an eroge, as Kyosuke always defends and helps his sister, even if he has to get punished, become a laughing stock, addressed as Sexual Harassment Senpai/Onii-Chan, anything! All of it just to fulfill her needs.Every episode has a different approach and different moments to look forward too. Some scenes make you cry, make you laugh and lastly, get you turned on. Hehehe... DON\'T JUDGE ME! Why would you want your little sister playing an adult game  BESIDE YOU?! That\'s insane, but cool. >:DThe art was great, as it captured my heart instantly and made me explode with their cuteness. CUTENESS OVERLOADDDDDDDD!!!!!!! Just looking at the characters, you can already say that this one has this personality and this one with this personality. That\'s supposed to be a negative thing, but in this type of anime, it can be applied.The music was limited to OST\'s and the Irony by ClariS. But it\'s enough for a 15 episode anime. I really enjoyed the anime a lot, and yes. I like Ecchi, Harem and sisters. BUT I\'M NOT PERVERTED. It can be continued, as it lacks depth.Overall, I really like it.

I was worried there would be massive amounts of incest, as anime tends to get into if there ever is a brother/sister scenario, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. It isn\'t about that, it\'s about the sweet relationship between a brother and a sister noticing each other for the first time in their lives. Overall, I loved the main character, he was relatable and hilarious, sweet and endearing, and overall a guy I would love to...hang out with. However, his sister did annoy me, but at times I did enjoy her presence. The art was well done, simple and clean cut, the music was possibly the only lacking part of the show. If the music was more original I would have given it a 10. Overall, I love this show and when I finished the last episode I thought, ""Why did I like this? It wasn\'t though provoking or deep..."" I liked it because it was silly, carefree, and just so enjoyable to watch. I highly recomend this show! :)Sorry for the poor grammar....and spelling... :) hang out with.

The best part of her is the actual annoyance she create, I seldomly know any heroine which specificly \'exist to annoy you\' like Kirino. Most writers would want their heroine to be lovable and attractive to the audiences, but the author of OreImo decided to do the opposite, and it worked pretty nicely, though you still would want her to be alittle nicer and at least thank her brother properly for literally saving her existenceAs for Kyousuke, I find his character highly unrealistic, he might look like the best existence you can ever have for a brother, but that is where it is illogical. Kyousuke had stated countless times that he hates Kirino, right from the beginning to the end, but he will go to extreme measures for her(SPOILER ALERT, skip the rest of this paragraph if you don\'t want to read spoilers) threatening to beat up his own father(which in turn could end up in him being beaten up himself and thrown out of the house for a week). Throwing away all his pride to beg to the animator team for Kirino\'s masturbation novel that he didn\'t even enjoy himself(which his and Kuroneko\'s rude attitudes towards them could\'ve backfire them in the first place, normally if you talk like that to someone you want to please, chances are they won\'t be pleased and might even cancel out the anime project for it). Shaming himself countless times(acting like a total pervert for Ayase to make up for her friendship with Kirino, buying eroge in front of a huge crowd, seen by his own best friend and some other townspeople who show outright disgust to him), etc and YET he is willing to continue being Kirino\'s slave when he fully have the right to kick Kirino for his own frustration.For the other supporting/minor characters, many are too bland, illogical, or simply not appealing enough. Ayase, Kuroneko and Saori became close to Kyousuke for no particular reason(well there is a reason and it is: he needs a harem). Manami is the only girl who is reasonable enough to be romanticly involved with Kyousuke and yet the story would intentionally kill her charm by calling her mundane by itself, which would have raised her appeal if the story have just left those sentences out(well they have to tone her down so the harem could happen, otherwise she would officially be Kyousuke\'s legal wife and no other girl could be paired with him), and another character featured in the OVA, Akagi Sena, Kyousuke\'s friend\'s little sister, had showed severe obsession on yaoi, to the extent that it impaired her logic and moral to be stupid enough to present an idea on a yaoi game in a room full of straight guys, not noticing that it could as well get her kicked or expelled from the club, if not school.In conclusion this series is decent if you want to watch something while turning your brain off, ignoring all the illogical points and enjoying the nonsense of a seemingly masochistic brother being beaten by his sadistic little sister, but well if you don\'t like anime that annoy you, whether or not you like tsunderes or not, you should stay away from this anime just to keep your nerves intact. character, as she is very unique and stand out(you don\'t see little sisters bitching on her brother very often in anime do you?), she\'s not the whiny ""oniichan, oniichan"" kind of sister you usually get.

Often times people ignore this show due to the title implying an incestuous story, which does have a slight hovering presence over the show itself, but isn't actually a major point the show tries to push.Story-wise, the show dictates the relationship that develops between a brother and his little sister; albeit by the end of the first season it does not appear romantic.

Ore no Imouto is about a brother and sister rekindling their dissolving relationship. The typical big brother character and his seemingly unappreciative sister. I personally believe that this show is extremely underrated. The characters are extremely likable, and if you have a sibling you can probably relate on a personal level to this show. Give it a go if you enjoy a well-written story and wonderful character to character development. ', ""Amongst the things i cannot comprehend, is incest, and quite frankly, when i saw the name of this anime on my plan to watch list, i was scared senseless. Rather oddly, It wasn't as bad as I would have thought concerning the sibling relationship. And i would go as far as saying, that it was actually an okay anime. The major flaws in here would still be the fact that it tries to be taken too seriously when the matter at hand is quite ridiculous.the setting itself can't be considered original, its the same ''normal schoolboy'' setting we have all seen so many times...before and the only ''twist'' to it is the fact his sister is an eroge addict (how or where she procures herself these adults materials while she is only 14 or so is never explained). All along the anime she tries to live with her love of eroge while trying to not be viewed as an otaku by keeping it secret and I still have to admit that it is somewhat intriguing to see the view society has regarding otaku and at some times we could indeed see the social problems with being a fan of anime and feel the awkwardness of her passion, the main problem is the fact that the anime is either too serious when discussing the matter or too ridiculous when it is not the time for it. it then pleases no audience since it cannot effectively choose the timing for comedy or drama to aid the ''plot'' (which is somewhat nonexistent since the anime adopts a semi-episodic approach). In the end it was simply boring because it went for the most part with generic and ''seen before'' situation which killed the whole originality of it.The characters were sadly very clichéd, relying on some generic character personalities and bringing little to no modification to the original ''canvas'' of the character,  and that again did not help to the appreciation of the anime since it lacked originality. Plus the main characters being already quite bland, the side characters with little personality did only add bitterness to the already borderline acceptable mix. even if we do witness some kind of character development and evolution in the matter they all interact with each other, the evolution was either random or simply not important enough.In the end, the characters were still lacking, and it is sad to say because there was some potential in the character setting to make them quite good.On the plus side, the art actually surprised me a little, being somewhat better than other anime i have seen this year, it provided some acceptable character design and some alright (often animated) backgrounds.the music, regrettably, did not follow in the footsteps of the visual art, being generic and quite repetitive, it did not help to make the anime enjoyable as it did not bring any remarkable support to the visuals. the voices however were quite good and interesting, very well casted but ,again, could sometimes have been more expressive.in the end, it was an acceptable anime, wasn't that good, yes, but wasn't horrible. even if it was at times boring, it stayed interesting in the most part of the anime.

That said the relationship transforms beautifully into one any good older brother would be envious of. I mean imagine if your sister told you her problems!

Often...times animes will have a sibling bond flourishing during an anime after hitting a rather steep pit hole. Consider this a magnification of that relationship. Looking at it that way it seems much more satisfying than a weird (not to mention illegal) love story. The plot starts out as episodic and seems a bit scattered for the first half. The second half is more of a straight shot building itself on top of one another and utilizing the first half as foundation.The only real problem I can see about the plot is the protagonists back stories are not all that clear.

The story just starts from scratch which, while admirable, leaves the characters feeling a bit empty. However, the development of the cast is relatively good and easy to follow.

Its about a little sister who secret of being an Anime/Manga/Visual Novel otaku is leaked to her brother, and from then on its all Kyousuke the older brother helping her out with 'Life Couselling' as she has to deal with the secret being known to there parent, old friends and how she comes to know some new friends with the same interest.There are a lot of...parts of this show that we see quite often, the brother sister bond, now this show doesn;t do what a lot of shows do, there isn't any romance, its about them becomeing closer as family. Another thing is the otakuness about keeping her secret and is nothing we haven't seen in Nogizaka Haruka, there are even those fan clubs with the uniform we see often.The art for this show is really nice, it doesn't stand out as anything flashy but its use of soft tones really make it a relaxing show. The characters are well drawn and although it does use the cliche of having odd hair colors it doesn't go overboard with it and it doesn't stand out too much. Animation is genrally smooth an there arn't any huge pointers that spoil it.The sound is ok, the opening song is fun to listen to but i guess is a little generic, the ending though has a different song after each episode wich i quite nice as it add a little extra after you finished watching just to see what will play, each though is mostly a fun bubbly song sung by the seiyu of Kirino. The voice actors all do a good job, no one sounded forced and was always natural sounding but other than that it didn't stand out.Characters are great, Kyousuke is a great character, he's stoic but not all the time as his patience with Kirino is tested and can probably be compared to Kyon, though not as cool, and although reluctant he always gives a helping hand to Kirino. Kirino can be rather tsundere, she gets all embaressed when trying to thank her brother or gets all giggle when playing eroge, she can be rather cute at certain poits which i guess is one of the Animes selling points. The friends Kuroneko and Saori offer a different perspective, Kuroneko dresses in gothic lolita style clothing and seems to reference the world as a demonic fantasy type place, but she is willing to offer help as seen in various episodes. Saori is the super geek type, dressed rather guy like with thick glasses but throughout the show we are teased with the fact she has a different life style of an Ojou. Kirino and Kyousukes parents are very strict on her otaku habits and dislike it a lot but come to accept it, there father is extremly tsundere which is very amusing. All other side characters are all different and funny especially Manami's grandfather.The shows main theme is family. A brother and sister starting off as rather distant siblings but through various activities they become closer as siblings should. It offers a decent amounto of comedy and slice of lide all the while being cute. definitely a show that should be watched. parts of this show that we see quite often, the brother sister bond, now this show doesn;t do what a lot of shows do, there isn't any romance, its about them becomeing closer as family. Another thing is the otakuness about keeping her secret and is nothing we haven't seen in Nogizaka Haruka, there are even those fan clubs with the uniform we see often.The art for this show is really nice, it doesn't stand out as anything flashy but its use of soft tones really make it a relaxing show. The characters are well drawn and although it does use the cliche of having odd hair colors it doesn't go overboard with it and it doesn't stand out too much. Animation is genrally smooth an there arn't any huge pointers that spoil it.The sound is ok, the opening song is fun to listen to but i guess is a little generic, the ending though has a different song after each episode wich i quite nice as it add a little extra after you finished watching just to see what will play, each though is mostly a fun bubbly song sung by the seiyu of Kirino. The voice actors all do a good job, no one sounded forced and was always natural sounding but other than that it didn't stand out.Characters are great, Kyousuke is a great character, he's stoic but not all the time as his patience with Kirino is tested and can probably be compared to Kyon, though not as cool, and although reluctant he always gives a helping hand to Kirino. Kirino can be rather tsundere, she gets all embaressed when trying to thank her brother or gets all giggle when playing eroge, she can be rather cute at certain poits which i guess is one of the Animes selling points. The friends Kuroneko and Saori offer a different perspective, Kuroneko dresses in gothic lolita style clothing and seems to reference the world as a demonic fantasy type place, but she is willing to offer help as seen in various episodes. Saori is the super geek type, dressed rather guy like with thick glasses but throughout the show we are teased with the fact she has a different life style of an Ojou. Kirino and Kyousukes parents are very strict on her otaku habits and dislike it a lot but come to accept it, there father is extremly tsundere which is very amusing. All other side characters are all different and funny especially Manami's grandfather.The shows main theme is family. A brother and sister starting off as rather distant siblings but through various activities they become closer as siblings should. It offers a decent amounto of comedy and slice of lide all the while being cute. definitely a show that should be watched."", '""Don\'t mix the 2D world with the 3D world.""Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai, or Oreimo for short (which I will be calling that from now on) is an odd duck of an anime if you ask my personal opinion... you\'d have to watch it yourself in order to understand why however, because it\'s honestly kind of a hard anime to explain. Even now, I\'m having a hard time thinking about what to type. I might as well start the review right now, but I can say for certain that I did enjoy Oreimo a lot though... so let\'s get this review...started.The story is about our everyday high school student, Kyousuke. Average overall. Average grades, average looks, average life. However, the only thing abnormal about his life is his little sister, Kirino. Kirino is perfect in everything. Whether it\'s sports, school, or beauty, she\'s got it all. For ages, the two have been on bad grounds with each other. She ignores him, he doesn\'t bother her, they\'re practically strangers. One day, however, she drops a DVD while she\'s heading out the door. BUT, not just any DVD, an ANIME DVD! (Cue the gasps) What might his perfect sister be doing with an anime in her bag? Later on, it\'s discovered that she\'s a complete otaku with a hidden closet literally filled with anime, eroge, and figurines. Kirino asks Kyousuke to keep everything a secret so it doesn\'t ruin her reputation. Like the good person he is, he accepts and decides to keep her secret. Throughout the series, they go through a lot. She asks him for advice, he helps her with whatever scheme she\'s got up her sleeve... Overall it was a pretty average story line. You might see this in a lot of other animes, so don\'t expect anything amazingly unique, but it was really interesting to watch the story progress.Oreimo was brought to you by the company AIC Build, who was known for the ever so popular series, Haganai and... well, that\'s it I guess. But, even if they haven\'t made many animes in the past, their art style was definitely Grade A material. The animations were smooth and I liked the detail put into making it. Some of the characters were a bit bland, but overall it had a nice vibe to the series.The voice acting was awesome. We had some really good voice actors like Yuuichi Nakamura and Ayana Taketatsu playing the lead roles, and some other voice actors like Kana Hanazawa, Hitomi Nabatame and Satomi Satou playing some of the supporting characters. I liked the work they put into their characters and it paid off in the end.In the end, it all comes down to the characters. For starters, let\'s talk about the main characters. First off, we have Kyousuke. As I previously stated, he\'s your average high school student. I mean average in everything. However, his personality is what I really liked about him. He was funny and trustworthy pretty much the entire series, and I look for that in main characters. Then there\'s our next protagonist, Kirino. She\'s a Tsundere, no doubt. She\'s bossy, mean a lot of the time, but I like her character as well, just because she shows as much enthusiasm about her eroge as I do my anime. I can relate to her in a lot of ways if I stop to think about it. Now, on to our supporting characters. We got Kuroneko, which was my personal favorite character in the series, mainly because she\'s dark and mysterious, but she\'s super cute and funny as well. Then we have Saori, the one character who reminds me a lot of Mayoi from Acchi Kocchi for some reason... ah yes, both their personalities and voice actors are exactly the same... but she was a good character. Last we have Manami, the supporting character that gets the least amount of time for such an important character for some reason. She\'s definitely the kind of girl who would seem like the childhood friend type. A good addition to the anime. An interesting choice of characters, but a good one at that.I enjoyed Oreimo. It was super funny, and I loved how at one point in the anime, Kyousuke and I had perfect synchronization when it came to spitting out our drinks after one of the characters said ""reservation for vageena"". I laughed so hard I was crying. As a true fan of anime, I had to give this a try due to a lot of the hype it was getting. I\'m glad I did and I\'m just starting the second season right now. As for recommendations, if you liked Haganai then you might enjoy this one.Final Verdict:Story: 7Art: 8Sound: 9Character: 8Enjoyment: 9Overall: 8 started.The story is about our everyday high school student, Kyousuke.

I thought it was absolutely ridiculous to put something like this on air. she is the epitome of tsun, with the dere missing.i mean, i stuck with it thinking oh my, the dere will start to increase in percentage, but none!!! like wth, and then there was this completely alarming episode where she up and sold her story, and it was to be turned to anime?!!!anyhow, pretending for instance she was to be...the annoying herione which she omg was, and her bro was to be like the only normal one, then ya he failed!!! he was a masochistic douche. i thought ok, its fine let him just take the blows from beginning, but nothing ever changed!!! he was constantly rejected, hissed at, kicked, screamed at, and omg disrespected. at this point he should go die.well, overall, i think this was really poorly done. the plot was going halewire, the art was fine, not as awesome as others, the enjoyment was 1. like i skipped in some episodes because i couldn't afford to break my computer screen (will have none for replacement) and finally, the characterization was poor except for the girl with black hair who pointed out stuff, the whole watching world was thinking like seriously?? lol.so if it is your intention to carry on, beware of the tsundere herione, who lacks the dere part. (thinks that was harsh...really needed to vent some irritation though lol) the annoying herione which she omg was, and her bro was to be like the only normal one, then ya he failed!!! he was a masochistic douche. i thought ok, its fine let him just take the blows from beginning, but nothing ever changed!!! he was constantly rejected, hissed at, kicked, screamed at, and omg disrespected. at this point he should go die.well, overall, i think this was really poorly done. the plot was going halewire, the art was fine, not as awesome as others, the enjoyment was 1. like i skipped in some episodes because i couldn't afford to break my computer screen (will have none for replacement) and finally, the characterization was poor except for the girl with black hair who pointed out stuff, the whole watching world was thinking like seriously?? lol.so if it is your intention to carry on, beware of the tsundere herione, who lacks the dere part. (thinks that was harsh...really needed to vent some irritation though lol)"", 'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (a.k.a. Oreimo or My Little Sister Can’t be This Cute) was probably the most hyped up anime of the season. When you consider that the little sister referred to in the title is a 14-year-old fashion model with a rabid obsession over anime and erotic games, it’s not hard to see why it would get anime fans talking.|OkStory 10/10I have to say, this anime probably slapped alot of people in the face if they expected another run of the mill ecchi, moe, and or even incest anime. Well my face has a big red hand print...on it.The very beginning shows a cute girl trying to wake her older brother, Kyosuke Kosaka telling him she has done nice gestures like fixing him breakfast, just like another ecchi/harem/moe/whatever else belongs there typical anime, but instead her brother becomes angry saying my sister is never this nice, you\'re a fake, and ""My little sister can\'t be this cute!""That was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he\'s right, I don\'t think anyone would think she\'s actually that ""cute"" as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can\'t help but to feel punk\'d haha. Though IT WAS AWESOME! ^ ^Art/Animation/Character 10.10 and 10/10Very well animated with excellent character designs,Not really something I expected since I thought it would have been older, low graphics, qualities. But looks like I was wrong.Enjoyment 10/10Despite the series bringing up several controversial points which are likely to get people interested, it is lacking in one major area: plot. Since the anime itself brings up the issue of plot vs character, I thought it would try to cater to both. Unfortunately, the series does not have much story going on. Most of the time is spent with Kyousuke trying to figure out how to fix Kirino’s problems, and events from previous episodes are usually of little importance to subsequent ones. This leads me to another issue that was brought up in Oreimo: anime series that are 12 or 13 episodes long usually have stuff cut out and/or are incomplete. Oreimo is based on a series of light novels which are still incomplete, which probably explains why there was no real story in the anime.Oreimo is not an anime that everyone would enjoy. It is heavily targeted at an audience that is already familiar with all things anime-related from different genres and memes, to the wide range of merchandise, comiket, anime production, and even what the streets of Akiba look like. If you like anime for its characters and are fully versed in all things related to anime, then Oreimo would probably be a good series to watch. Conversely, anyone looking for an engaging plot or anyone who’s only a casual anime viewer would best avoid this series.Overall, well.... I\'d also give an over 10/10Well in short...Guess it really isn\'t short but mostly what I think about it.Ore no Imouto is an entertaining and cute comedy that was thoroughly pleasant almost every moment. Those are basically the 2 things it offers, cuteness and comedy. But what makes it special is the unique brand of tsundere that the main female character, Kirino, possesses. The story is shown from the viewpoint of her brother, Kyousuke, which allows you, the viewer, to also be on the receiving end of Kirino\'s cuteness, which is particularly cute because of the complexity of her relationship with Kyousuke.The main female characters look unbelievable cute, sound cute, and behave cutely, and it\'s a sexy-cute, not a childish cute. The cuteness doesn\'t feel forced at all. It just naturally exudes from their personalities.I snicker and giggle the whole way through because it\'s very funny, just the kind of humor I love. There\'s no slapstick, gags, or chibi transformations, which tend to be mildly funny at best. This is quality humor.It\'s not all humor. The experiences they have and problems they overcome feel good to watch, and they haven\'t felt forced so far. Rather, they are quite natural.The characters are wonderful. They seem very real. The main characters, Kyousuke, the brother, and Kirino, the sister, have a very believable relationship where they sort of act like they just ""tolerate"" each other, yet very much do care for each other and both know it, but coming out and saying it bluntly would be embarrassing. It\'s really a very common type of sibling rivalry/relationship.Understanding this relationship is key to your enjoyment of the show. It seems many viewers don\'t understand this and so they think that Kirino is an unrealistically ungrateful bitch and her brother unrealistically puts up with it without complaint. But ironically, if you understand that they are really just pretending to only just ""tolerate"" each other, but really care about each other, this is what makes the show very unique and realistic. And it\'s why Kirino is so darn cute. So try to understand this while watching, and look for the hidden message or vibe that Kirino is sending even when she acts angry, and never take her ""mean"" act literally.Kyousuke is a great character, and seems to act just how I would want him to act. He\'s cool, reliable, sharp, and witty. Kirino is a tsundere-type character, but doesn\'t seem at all like a cliche. Kyousuke will sacrifice himself for his sister, which makes for some great moments as it breaks down Kirino ""defenses"" and forces her to acknowledge her brother\'s sacrifices with a grudging but sincere ""thanks"". The other characters have strong personalities as well.The colors in the animation are bold and detailed, and camera angles and viewpoints are always keeping it fresh. The music complements the scenes very well, often breaking into the great ""theme song"" during feel-good resolutions of Kirino\'s problems when both Kyousuke and the viewers are rewarded with Kirino\'s cute fighting spirit or her grudging show of gratitude. It actually feels on par with an epic climatic scene in some lengthy drama.Towards the end of the series, there were some things I didn\'t like. The transition from one scene to another was sometimes very sudden, and some details that were important for the next scene were not sufficiently explained, almost like they were short on time and had to condense things. This happens in the last two episodes. In fact, the climatic moment in the final episode is extremely sudden, has no foreshadowing that I can see leading up to it, isn\'t clear whether it is intentional or accidental on the part of Kirino, and leaves me to have to wonder and speculate about what Kirino\'s thought\'s were leading up to the moment. I feel like Kirino should have shown signs that she was dealing with a tough dilemma, then we would then wonder what it was, and then the climatic moment would provide the answer. But as it is, it just leaves me puzzled.But overall, this was one of my favorite shows. It was hilarious, cute, and the best part is the unique personality of Kirino that is full of cute subtleties which I can easily relate to. Not your typical tsundere.This is a cute though weird awkward anime. It is also an epic plot thing at the end making you want more cute things happening. on it.The very beginning shows a cute girl trying to wake her older brother, Kyosuke Kosaka telling him she has done nice gestures like fixing him breakfast, just like another ecchi/harem/moe/whatever else belongs there typical anime, but instead her brother becomes angry saying my sister is never this nice, you\'re a fake, and ""My little sister can\'t be this cute!""That was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he\'s right, I don\'t think anyone would think she\'s actually that ""cute"" as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can\'t help but to feel punk\'d haha.

Abandon all hope that it'll get better or there will be character development. Main character has zero backbone and will get hit and verbally humiliated nonstop even though he constantly goes out of his way to appease the most obnoxious, egocentric, annoying character in all of anime history: Kirino (his sister). Even if this show had a good plot it would still be unwatchable due to how infuriating she is every time she takes up screen time. This show would at least make sense if the main character was a masochist or a GOOD explanation existed for why he keeps eating the shit...his sister shoves down his throat (and comes back for seconds). And no she's not a tsundere, shes just a spoiled brat.To conclude:-Boring plot-Annoying characters-Cringe comedy-Cheap animationDon't be fooled by it's popularity and waste your time. I wrote this in the hopes that I could save at least one unsuspecting soul from this show... At least then my suffering will not have been in vain. his sister shoves down his throat (and comes back for seconds).

get along but one day suddenly Kyousuke found a erogame that her sister dropped by mistake and then he founds out about her Otaku hobbies that was the starting of their good relationship.then he even helps her to keep her hobbies as secret and when their parent found out about her he even convince their parents to let her keep this hobbies and even cover for her erogame :DWhenever she get in trouble he just tell her ""Leave it to me"" and...then helps her in so many things like make new otaku friends whom she can speak about her hobbies, when her school friend found about her hobbies.and as they spent time together and he helps her he found out that her sister also has cute side.she hits her, kicks her but he still helps her in all way he can.than i really like the way they made 2 episode of 12th episode one as ""good ending"" and another ""true route"" but i really liked the ""True Route"" (last 4 ONA) in which she suddenly disappears one morning without telling him anything and went to America. after that Kyousuke started to feel lonely without her and one day when she messages her to throw her collection then kyousuke run to America to help her and bring her back.I really liked this Season of OreImo, and the attitude and behavior of her sister didn\'t bothered me bcz i have a sister who is just like Kirino really Pissed me off some time but when she come to me like ""bro plz help in this"" there is no way i can refuse to help her.Story :from starting to till end how they started to now each other, how their relationship changed over time i really liked this season\'s story.9/10Art :well i m giving Art full points bcz there are different illustration of OreImo in every single episode in the end and i really liked some of them. and as for the animation and art in anime yup they are really good.10/10Sound :now this is really something to make different ED songs for every episode. and i also liked OP of OreImo.9/10Character :hmm nothing to complain about the character well bcz as i told i have a sister and she is just like Kirino the only difference is she is not otaku XDand as for rest of the character i really like Kuroneko (Ruri Gokou), ahhhh she

into dating sims that regards the mc of the games be boys dating their little sisters...Is safe to say that she actually in a way, more likely unconsciously see's herself as the little sisters of the

into all this sister hating brother thing and vice versa, i can even get on with...her not being thankful for all he does for her... But she isn't just ungrateful she goes to extends as far as trying to sabotage his friendship with Manami...Gets angry if her friends try to be friends with her brother and even tho he humiliates himself for her benefit she over humiliate him to keep the charade...Her character is like of a person who is in need of a psychiatrist and not quite because of the games she plays but for her attitude towards them and her friends and family...The story plot becomes more and more idiotic by every episode like the writers don't even know what else to write as she becomes more and more crazy by the minute...If she was a real person she would have been intern into a mental institution in the first few episodes, but her brother trying to protect her and to keep his peace tries to help her over and over again...The 12 true route episode which is the episode she leaves is the most wonderful of all and for 3 episodes everything was peachy (not shown here but the show has 15 episodes), until the 15th when he goes to America to pick her up and bring her back...At this point i realize he is just a masochist who seems to be also be in love with his sister and i dropped it...The only characters good enough that this show has and barely get any credit are Kuroneko, Manami and Saori but even them fall short to make you watch more... her not being thankful for all he does for her...

Not in the usual way, but in ""this has been done before I wonder how they\'re going to handle it"" kind of way. With other series like ""nogizaka haruka no himitsu"" and to a lesser extent shows like Genshiken, this topic has been covered before. However Ore No Imouto took an interesting and refreshing twist with this tried and true story. Without revealing too much the plot revolves around the almost non existent relationship between two siblings, Kirino and Kyousuke Kousaka. They would then be brought together by a series of...events that reveal that Kirino has an excessive interest in anime and eroge, specifically those that deal with little sisters. The events that follow serve as both an homage and accurate parody of the world of anime and games. I greatly enjoyed this series, and will most likely rewatch it multiple times. The only fault I had with the series is that it ends. events that reveal that Kirino has an excessive interest in anime and eroge, specifically those that deal with little sisters.

The only fault I had with the series is that it ends.', 'To be honest I\'m writing this review because, among the several reviews I read, I really didn\'t find any truly balanced reviews. Either people have a sort of blind love for the show or have a lengthy scathing rant based mostly on Kirino. Not that she doesn\'t deserve it, but still, I\'d like to see a bit more balance from the reviews so I will try one.The story is pretty easy to pick up. On the surface it is about a secret otaku whose brother goes out of his way to cater to her needs even though he really can\'t stand her. It also deals...with how an otaku deals with things like friendship among normal people and otakus. Yes it is pretty predictable, but there isn\'t anything really wrong with that, especially not for this type of show. The story itself is rather shallow, as it is mostly about the characters and the dialogue. It isn\'t exactly about incest, but that is something that is discussed and even flirted with at times in the show. I understand that the original ending to the show was not really straight from the manga, but without having read that, I felt like the ""good ending"" fit pretty well unless they have already decided to continue the show. I\'ll not say much more for fear of spoilers. I give the story an unspectacular 6.5.The art is pretty well done. The characters are all proportional unlike many series these days, and in my opinion they are all pleasing to the eye. Kyousuke is rather bland himself, and his childhood friend Manami is even more so. I think this is intended, but it feels rather odd with all of the colorful imoutos that are shown throughout the series. I noticed that they really wanted Kirino\'s nails to stand out. She frequently had different colored fingernails, and they were in bright colors that were easy to spot. The opening and ending animations were also pretty well done but not spectacular in my opinion. I give the art a good 8.5.The sound was decent. The voice actors seemed to do a good job with the characters. I have no real complaints there. The cutesy anime music drove into my nerves at times, but that\'s to be expected with this kind of show, and I don\'t really feel like it was overdone or anything. The music for the opening and endings was also well done but unspectacular. Overall I score sound as a solid 7.Ok the characters is the part where I really have some trouble with this series. Kirino is as most people have said, mostly a bitch. Actually, no, she is a total bitch. She really steps all over Kyousuke, but then continually asks for his help with ever matter. Not to mention that aside from her personality, she is pretty much perfect. An honor roll middle schooler who is a model, a top athlete, a successful author, and soon to be anime creator. But she is completely horrible to the one person who supports her wholeheartedly. Even if she is shy and stubborn about showing her feelings, until the very end she never changes her ""Kyousuke is a dormat"" policyKyousuke himself is as I said earlier, pretty bland. This seems intentional, but still feels off. Ever other main character in the story has a lot going for them. Even Manami, who seems forcibly bland herself, is a cute girl and an excellent cook. But Kyousuke is your generic ""normal guy in a harem"" so he has to be overly....normal. He is obviously very kind and means well with everyone around him, but that just makes it worse to watch him continually apologize to Kirino for going out of his way to be there for her no matter how bad she treats him. The relationship between them is odd and tense too often because of this. Yes the show flirts with the incest theme, and it even implies that there is some attraction from Kirino and possibly Kyousuke as well. But overall, it mostly portrays Kyousuke as the dutiful brother who really makes the extra effort to help out his little sister.Kuroneko and Saori are by far and away the best characters in the show. They are given stereotypical otaku girl looks, and do not try to hide their hobbies like Kirino does. Saori ends up playing the older sister type. She\'s there for counseling mostly, as well as some comic relief. She and Kyousuke end up marshaling the fights between Kuroneko and Kirino. Kuroneko is a more interesting character. She is stubborn like Kirino, and can be rude, but she has a softer side. She very rarely shows this side toward Kirino, but it\'s there for people to see. If you like her character, you should check out the OVA\'s or the ""true ending"" of the show. She is featured in it and she manages to do something that no other character in the show ever does: Develop.Ayase is Kirino\'s best friend. She goes pretty psycho when she fiinds out about Kirino\'s hobby, but after having everything fixed up by Kyousuke, she tries to understand her friend\'s obsession. Again, this is another time where Kirino  shows her colors. She never tries to change anything about how she approaches the situation, and it\'s fixed by Kyousuke in the end anyway. After that series of events Ayase pretty much fades into the shadows though.The other characters are mostly stereotypical and/or extras. While I have no real problem with most of the characters, putting Kirino alongside so many good and decent people just doesn\'t feel right sometimes. I know the series wouldn\'t work without that, but I feel like she\'s over the top as far as her rudeness goes, particularly toward her brother, who has done nothing but selflessly throw himself on the tracks for her sake time after time. I\'m giving the characters a 6.5. Kuroneko\'s awesomeness, and the likeable Saori and Kyousuke don\'t make up for Kirino in this case.I am rating the enjoyment of the series an 8 because despite the issues I\'ve laid out above, it is funny at times and generally pretty fun to watch. I am frustrated with Kirino\'s character, but mainly because she really is needed to tie everything together. I like Kuroneko and Saori, but without Kirino, it just wouldn\'t be as enjoyable to watch. I\'m sure I will watch more if another season comes out, but I\'m not sure I\'ll really remember this show in a few months time. If Kyousuke has to end up with one of the girls eventually, I hope it isn\'t his sister. Pretty much any of the other characters would be better.Overall I\'m going to give this a 7.5 or an 8, mostly because it is pretty enjoyable.

There are multiple plot twists in the anime which give it a fresh start every time they occur which drew me in more to the story and characters.Art - 8The Art in Oreimo looks like the standard anime art in other anime which I do like as it is my favourite style but I didn't real much detail on the characters or their clothing which did disappoint me but doesn't ruin the series for you, but that aside I found that the background art was very well detailed and some of characters clothing was quite detailed an example of this being Saori's clothing and Accessories.Sound - 9The opening soundtrack that is used in the anime was very well chosen as it suited the anime as it reflected a slice of life sort of theme that makes you feel more at home with it. The rest of the soundtrack in the anime is a wonderful piece of work that has some addicting songs and has some OSTs that help enhance certain moods especially with the character themes. The voice actors did a wonderful job as they really fit into their character roles and play it very especially when looking at their work a viewing the roles they have done which is a huge variety of characters.Character - 10The characters in Oreimo are a wonderful piece of work that vary in look, personality and style that give of the appearance of a well done slice of life mood so the anime has no out of place characters. The main characters are very different from each other in terms of personality which makes them all the more interesting but I'm not going to go into to much detail as I don't want to spoil it; the supporting characters are also very well fleshed out with it having a completely different personality than the other which makes the anime all the more good.Enjoyment - 8I did enjoy this anime as much as I could as I enjoyed the various character interactions as well as the OST but I did find that story was boring at times and would drag but after seeing it all the way through I can see how I enjoyed it from one side to the other with a plot that is slow but original and fun to watch in the end.Overall - 8In overall I would say that this anime is a much watch for anyone who loves a great slice of life and drama anime that has an original story and characters as well as a awesome soundtrack. her brother but this was not the case as it was completely different which I believe gave it an original style and upbeat personality look to it.

The main protagonist female is a smart (grade wise) and athletic girl, she enjoys, manga, anime, novels and eroge (adult games). Her brother tries to help her out by helping her open up a bit to others, and could lead to possible problems throughout the story. I mainly liked this due to bringing two...family members together helping each other out and trying to defeat their fears. It also brings in the whole ""otaku"" feeling and stereotypes into it. Great overall. Highly recommend! family members together helping each other out and trying to defeat their fears. It also brings in the whole ""otaku"" feeling and stereotypes into it. Great overall. Highly recommend!', 'Overall Grade: B-Why I Picked This Up:  I usually enjoy AIC’s works, and the first episode of this made it seems like this show had some real depth to it, being a show that commented on otaku culture and sibling relationships.Why I Finished It: My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute changed tone around episode 4, and was no longer the same show that it was when I first watching. Still, in the end, it was a fun ride, although a fun ride with some cringe-worthy moments. I’m use to AIC not having the best production values, and was expecting the same here. Instead,...they went all. It wasn’t perfect, but the effort was present. The art was nice, the backgrounds were incredibly detailed, the opening and closing theme changed every episode, and so worth. Part of the fun was the ridiculous number of shout-outs to the other animes and eroges.With the exception of Kirinio, I found myself enjoying the characters and their antics immensely. Ayase, Manami, and Kuroneko especially grew on me. I thought they were honestly funny, and made me laugh. I found it interesting how much better episodes flowed when Kirino wasn’t on the scene.But: There seemed to be two main flaws with ‘My Little Sister’. First, I honestly think the author had no idea what direction to take the series after the Light Novels reached episode 3. He/She had some things he/she wanted to do with the characters, but no idea what to do with the plot. I think originally, it wasn’t supposed to be an incest story but the author changed his/her mind to have more material to write about. My Little Sister goes from a story with depth into a light romantic comedy of sorts—though in my point of view, Kirino definitely has feelings for her brother, and he doesn’t return to them.The second flaw seems to be with Kirino as a character. I was tolerant of Kirino up until episode 8. The problem with Kirino is she starts off as realistic, but over the course of the series turns into a person that can’t exist and is flat out ridiculous. Even when she was already straying into ridiculous category, I thought she was still relatable as a character—she reminded me of an angry insecure middle school girl stuck in the hell of puberty, but she loses even that. She abuses the people around her, and never suffers for it. Furthermore, she ALWAYS gets what she wants. She never hears the world no. Jeez. Thank goodness for Kirino that’s she is an unrealistic human being, if she wasn’t, the degree to which she was spoiled is going to cause her problems later in life, because someone has to tell her no.I guess I have to include a third thing, which goes under the worst thing I have seen in anime to this point. Please, can someone purge the scene where Kyousuke tells her to be quiet due to the fact she’s essentially masturbating at the top of her lungs, and his reaction from my mind forever. Pretty please?Fourth, and finally, thanks to the author indecisiveness, one thing that I liked about the series was retracted. Kirino in the beginning explained that just because she played eroge, that it didn’t reflect her real world self, stating that there’s a difference between a game and reality. Except. She clearly has the hots for her brother, and throws a temper tantrum when her brother doesn’t react the way a player would react in an eroge game, suggesting the opposite. What makes this irksome, is it is a negative image of eroge players in the end. And a positive image is desperately needed, and would be nice.Who Would I Recommend This To: I think this is a fabulous anime for siblings to watch together. Well…whether it is or not, my sister asked to watch this anime with me. And I spoil her rotten.Honestly, I don’t know what to say. If you like cute girls, and aren’t turned off by incest I guess this would be an enjoyable anime. There are parts I’m glad I saw. Yet at the same time, there are parts I wish I didn’t see. I haven’t decided yet if one was worth the other.Art: AIC went all out on this one.Characters: B- The characters weren’t that realistic, but they were fun. Main problem was Kirino, and the fact she was the main character. Kyousuke always spoiling her got old as well.Episodic Value: C  I at least enjoyed somewhat 7 of the 12 episodes.Overall Story: C- The author seemed to have a concept, but no idea what he/she wanted to do with the plot, leaving a jumbled mess.Setting: B they went all.

I got the impression that this was going to be some strange sort of incest story.However, the first episode made me fall in love with this show, if only for a short while, for the great comedic value, and the unique qualities of the plot. It was not just another X’s secret, it had no romantic tendencies, or poor ecchi…Well there was fanservice in the way of shaking ass.

Well, Kyosuke let's see if she really was.Story:It was good enough to keep me interested in what was going on, so kudos for that.  They developed the main characters relationships as the story passed along as well.  The pacing was good, and honestly, I can't wait to see how the second season continues it.  Now there are a few flaws here and there, but it's biggest flaw was that it was kind of predictable, I knew what was going to happen just by watching the first 5 or 6 minutes of almost every...episode. 7/10Art:It was great, I had absolutely no issues with it, other than maybe that the shapes of their heads were a tad bit strange.  The colors were good and the scenery was great too.  8/10Sound:Awesome, no complaints whatsoever.  OP/ED were catchy as well, which is something I always enjoy, gives me something to bob my head to when I start a new episode and finish one. 10/10Characters:Now, the characters are one of my issues with this show.  I don't have a problem with tsundere characters, but there's a fine line between tsundere and douchebag. That being said, Kirino was a douchebag throughout most of the series. Kyosuke putting up with it makes sense for his character, the caring older brother.  Soari and Kuroneko could have been fleshed out a little bit more, I liked them a lot.  The characters were, for the most part, enjoyable, and seeing their relationships develop created a bunch of great moments, 7/10 in this department.Enjoyment:The anime was very enjoyable.  It's funny when it calls for it, and touching when it needs to be.  It will keep you entertained, that's for sure. 7/10Overall:Overall, it's a good show, I'd recommend giving it a watch.  The story is easy to follow, the art is very easy on the eyes, and the music great too.  The characters could be better, but you will still want to see their relationships develop as the story goes on.

There...was a pairing that was almost canon but then they just noped. That was the only thing i hated.But It was an happy end (meaning to the end of the second season)But the characters? Personally Ruri Gokou (Kuroneko) was my favorite character. She had this charm that I loved. As for the others, almost only girls in this anime, they are great characters. They are very lovable and there isn’t many bad things with them. True, some can be annoying but I really don’t mindI would recommend this to anyone who likes cute animes with a touch of seinen.

My sister can't be this cute) is that it's smarter than it looks. It's a show riddled with commentary on the state of anime and the otaku culture. The writing pulls no punches whatsoever: while making several impassionate statements for the right of otakus to love their hobby, the script never shies away from reality. Especially central is the exploration of stigmatization by society and the role of friendship in combating it. Even when providing titillating fan service, the script of Oreimo will hit from the sidelines, referencing the market realities driving the emergent sexualization of anime and the...pandering of fetish groups. Even the opening scene of the first episode is a reference to a worn-out trope; cute little sister waking up his brother. Were this the usual siscon eroge or anime, the brother wouldn't wake up to realize it was only a dream.The strongest point of Oreimo is the cast of characters. Their personalities and backstories are complex and purposeful, serving to explore many themes. The scenes, camera angles and dialogue are set up flawlessly to serve their points, proving that the series is meant as a serious work of animated art. If you pay the slightest attention to the dialogue, you'll recognize it's a stream of two-layered commentary that rarely fails to reap a laugh. Whether you love or hate the current state of the anime industry, Oreimo is an easy show to love.Something I didn't notice on my first watch-through is the show's careful use of camera angles: for example, when characters are arguing, the camera will be tilted to show they're emotionally off-balance. It's the same type of crazy attention to detail you find in movies like Citizen Kane, which is funny, considering the comparison.The comedy alone is reason enough to watch Oreimo. Even without much background knowledge on anime, you should have a good time. Or maybe you'll just be shocked at the endless darkness of the bottomless rabbit hole... pandering of fetish groups.

A mouthful of a title that means “My Little Sister Can’t Be This Cute”. At first, I was wary of touching this anime – precisely because of the incestuous implications of the title. But, when the anime ended, several nice reviews of it popped up, assuring that there was no incest in the show, so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.OreImo, as it is more commonly known, is basically an anime of how a brother and sister grow closer in their relationship, from having...virtually none at all to becoming closer siblings. Seventeen year old Kyousuke, the older brother, is a high school student with absolutely no interest with anything anime or “otaku”-related. Kirino, his fourteen year old sister, however, is a total and utter otaku – specifically for little sister eroge (erotic games). The anime is mostly meant to be a comedy, as Kyousuke is introduced to the “otaku” lifestyle; and it mostly succeeds at what it does. Ultimately, the anime attempts to shed a bright light on the “dark” life of the otaku, both open ones (such as Kuroneko and Saori) and “closet” ones (such as Kirino). Most of the characters are fairly well-developed (as well-developed as you can get with a comedy such as OreImo) and relationships are consistent and well played-out.Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is a good anime. Its main problem is that it is simply not interesting. It is not one of those anime that make you think, “Noo! The episodes are way too short! I have to see what happens next!” It’s one of those anime that make you think, “Oh, it ended” or possibly, even worse, “When is this episode going to end?” The anime lacks a gripping plot. While it is a tad original, and while the situations and characters are easily identifiable to, it is simply not interesting enough to render a rating over five stars. I practically had to push myself to watch all twelve episodes. Sure, it is funny and has some comedic moments, and yes, I did empathize with Kirino a lot (particularly with her obsession for Meruru – ahahah, Nabariii~!), but, and I stress this, it isn’t interesting enough to watch in a mini-marathon. Maybe you can keep up with it for two or three episodes in a row, but after a while you just get bored and look for respite in either a more interesting anime or an entirely different activity.I really don’t understand all the hype this anime received, as I can point out several better anime from the 2010 fall season.

Has an incomplete story.Characters (28/35) Overall pretty decent. Work very well together, but aren\'t anything special on their own.Sound (11/15) Slightly above average.Animation (13/15) Very well done, everything looks very fluid and bright....Overall (79/100) Will break the expectations you had for it, but aside from that there are better things to watch.Admit it, when this show first came out you all thought it was some weird show about a guy trying to get with his sister. Well, you might not be all that wrong depending on how the second season turns out. But this review is only for the first season, and the first season is surprisingly decent. It isn\'t anything amazing, but it was a lot better than I was expecting. I was expecting incest, mixed with a harem, and as we probably know, that doesn\'t make for the best plot. Thankfully, there is neither in season one, and the show is a surprisingly good slice of life about two siblings trying to get along better. There isn\'t much more to it than that. It\'s pretty much about Kyousuke and Kirino and how they have become closer siblings and friends through Kirino\'s eroge addiction, while also helping her hide that from some of her friends (and helping her make new ones). Yeah, it\'s a little weird, but it\'s original and doesn\'t seem all that weird when you are watching it. You should keep in mind a few things though, there are 4 extra OVA episodes, so if the ending in episode 12 seems weird, it\'s because there are 4 more episodes that properly end the show. That ending is actually pretty good, but the REAL ending isn\'t until season two. Sadly, season two is much worse than season one, and the odds that it will turn into incest and the like also increase exponentially. So if you arent into (potential) incest and don\'t like stories with a ""proper"" end, you might want to steer clear of this one. The story wasn\'t anything special, but it gets this moderately high score for completely breaking everyone\'s expectations. (27/35)The characters really shine in this show. Kyousuke is a pretty good main character, especially with his interactions with the rest of the cast. All the other main characters are girls and they are all pretty lovable in some way. Kuroneko is probably everyone\'s favorite girl, Saiori is oddly the most normal of the group, and everyone else has some stuff going for them. But the way they act around eachother is what make them shine. (28/35)The production vales for this show are moderately high. The music is pretty average, maybe a little above average, but have some pretty generic pop songs as an opening and ending. (11/15) The animation on the other hand is very very good. It is really smooth and everything just looks good. No complaints here (13/15)Overall, this show will probably beat the expectations you have for it, even after reading this review. Don\'t get me wrong though, this show isn\'t anything special, and we have yet to see how good the ending is (either way, season two is quite bad as it is), but if you want an example of a show you shouldn\'t judge by it\'s title/cover, this is a good choice. (79/100) Overall (79/100) Will break the expectations you had for it, but aside from that there are better things to watch.Admit it, when this show first came out you all thought it was some weird show about a guy trying to get with his sister. Well, you might not be all that wrong depending on how the second season turns out. But this review is only for the first season, and the first season is surprisingly decent. It isn\'t anything amazing, but it was a lot better than I was expecting. I was expecting incest, mixed with a harem, and as we probably know, that doesn\'t make for the best plot. Thankfully, there is neither in season one, and the show is a surprisingly good slice of life about two siblings trying to get along better. There isn\'t much more to it than that. It\'s pretty much about Kyousuke and Kirino and how they have become closer siblings and friends through Kirino\'s eroge addiction, while also helping her hide that from some of her friends (and helping her make new ones).

(79/100)', 'Oreimo was a bit of a tough sell for me at points special thanks to the interactions between lead characters/ siblings Kirino and Kyosuke. The former proved to be quite the annoying brat on a number of occasions with how she interacted with her brother and the latter was too spineless to at least try correcting his sister\'s behavior while trying to get used to being her cohort in her otaku fandom.Considering this series is trying to go for the slice-of-life approach in exploring the life of an otaku like Genshiken, this series does do some things right in believably exploring life as an otaku....The series does acknowledge that being an otaku is quite frowned upon in Japanese society and the mass media paint misconceptions to the mainstream about otaku becoming criminals with exposure to anime, manga, eroge, etc. Kirino is painfully aware of this at the start of Oreimo and fears others rejecting her because of her otaku interests. The series also does a solid job of exploring life in Akihabara and attending conventions. However, Oreimo usually tries to cover elements to otaku fandom that don\'t come across too naturally with exploring the everyday situations faced by Kirino and other characters. Not to mention with the eroge element to Oreimo being mostly used for comedic situations, the series isn\'t as grounded as Genshiken in believably exploring life as an otaku.The supporting characters to the series also prove to be quite the likeable and diverse bunch with Kirino having both her ""normal"" and otaku friends, as well as Kyosuke having occasional interaction with childhood friend Manami. The series does take some time to focus on many of these characters, particularly Kuroneko in the OAVs, where we get enough sense of the type of people they are beyond their outward facade as anyone ""normal"" or as an otaku.But as I\'ve discussed above, Oreimo\'s two lead characters aren\'t exactly the easiest characters to connect with. Kirino\'s behavior against her brother is a bit extreme and she seems depicted as an archetypal tsundere with how easily jealous she gets of Kyosuke\'s interactions with other girls. I also found it to be a bit absurd that someone of Kirino\'s age could get access to and be interested in playing adult-rated versions of eroge games. As for Kyosuke, I got irritated at points with how easily he accepted his sister\'s short-fused behavior towards him.Presentation-wise, Oreimo is a great-looking series visually with rich color and plenty of details with scenery and character designs. Many female characters are drawn to be cute-looking which helps to enhance the likeability of the supporting characters seen throughout Oreimo. Music wise, Oreimo is notable for featuring plenty of musical tracks throughout its run, notably having a different ED song in each episode. But with many of the songs being energetic J-Pop tracks, there wasn\'t anything that really stuck out for me with the soundtrack.Overall, Oreimo was tough for me to watch at points thanks to Kirino\'s behavior and while the otaku theme has its moments where I could connect with it, it isn\'t as smoothly developed and grounded as Genshiken. Still, the supporting cast for Oreimo were likeable enough and there were enough notable moments where I could care for what developed with the characters. This is a decent show to check out, though I still don\'t believe it knocks off Genshiken from its perch in delivering a quality slice-of-life title that explores life as an otaku.

Love her obsession with imouto and the huge collection she keeps hidden in her closet which reminds me very much of the collection in my closet, impressively disturbing.  A popular heroine with a hobby that is not quite accepted by her peers, reminds me of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu.  The brother, Kyosuke, is a great contrast from Kirino.  Reminds me a lot of Kyon except way more willing to cooperate with the somewhat unreasonable heroine, even going so far as to make himself out to be...a perverted siscon to cover for his sister in front of family and friends.  The other characters were all entertaining to watch; an old school, glasses wearing otaku that is way too friendly, a dark, gothic lolita girl who would be obsessed with series like Rozen Maiden and Loveless (teen complex....oh high school anime fans I don\'t miss you), the normal friend that is borderline yandere, a rabid yaoi fangirl obsessed with homosexual men, they are all fun to watch.  The animation is great and gives a lot of attention to Kirino\'s cute butt....*cough*I love the way they handled the last episode with the whole visual novel choice dialogue.  It applied the main otaku focus of eroge and used it to give us multiple endings.  L.O.V.E. it!~  Kirino no oshiri ha tottemo kawaii deshyo~!  Sisterly Kirino is also cute.The Bad:Normal girl is normal....to the point I can not remember her name and just call her normal girl.  Kirino constantly beats on her brother in the style of ""violent retribution for minor infringement""with little reason a lot of the time just without such cartoony violence like is standard for that.  Would have liked more backstory for the siblings and why they were so distant from each other for so long.The Ugly:Nothing in particular.  I can not really think of anything I hate about this series.A solid series that is emotional in a lot of ways and never too much of a downer.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.

To understand more about my review style be sure to read my profile.', ""Oreimo is something a little... different.  At first glance it appears to be another rehash of the classic brother/sister incest relationship, with some anime obsession on the side.  Oreimo, at least the first season, pulls away and offers something more sincere, with comedy at the forefront and dramatic subplots galore, and plenty of cuteness to keep you satisfied.Story: 5It's not a particularly compelling story.  A brother and a sister who live as polar opposites, one a normal guy who wants things to remain average, the other a model, star student, athletic prodigy, and eventually a notable novelist, act coldly to each other...due to mutual hatred.  One fateful day, the perfect, straight A student Kirino is revealed to her brother Kyousuke as an otaku, obsessed primarily in erotic adult games involving little sisters.  The story of the show revolves around Kyousuke giving Kirino advice on how to deal with making new friends that share her interests and giving her an outlet to talk about her obsession by indulging in it himself.The story isn't handled very tactfully, nor is it particularly interesting.  Removing the potential for humor/jokes, the story itself isn't compelling or particularly unique.  It's a refurbished version of the rekindling of a broken relationship through a common interest, secret, problem, goal etc.  Very little development is made, and episodes eventually drop the story altogether for a more slice of life style show.  The brother-sister relationship rekindling is replaced with a look into the struggles of otaku, who are looked down on by society.  Once again, the story here is rather lackluster, but the humor is prime.  However, comedy doesn't make for a good story, and although OreImo tries its darnedest to remind you that it can be serious every once in a while with a dramatic scene, it fights a losing battle trying to split its time between silly cuteness and otaku culture, and a serious story about siblings who come to understand each other.Art: 8The art style of the show isn't notably deviant or original, but its pleasant nonetheless.  The show offers a very stagnant style of art.  While other shows make use of multiple animation styles to portray a mood or enhance an aspect of a character (cute, serious, dumbfounded, etc.), OreImo consistently uses one style almost all the way through without resorting to the use of alternate styles to make the characters appear cuter or more serious in a scene.  This actually helps with the realistic setting the show tries to create.Similarly, the show doesn't resort to classic animation tropes (or anime tropes), such as bleeding noses, or simplified versions of the characters being used for quicker animations, or a blurred depiction of fast movement.  The characters are drawn to look and act like real people, and don't break from that.  Aside from the classic blushing lines (which are used almost constantly), the show steers clear of most other stereotypical anime art choices.The show also pays a lot of attention to detail, and even offers some different opening animations almost every episode, along with different pictures at the ending of every episode.  Details like this are what push a shows art from good to very good.For those reasons, and simply because the art is pleasant to look at in the first place (and since the characters are adorable), the art gets an 8.Sound: 7The voice actors seemed to match their personalities well, and they did a good job.  The OP is extremely upbeat and catchy, which matches the shows atmosphere, and every episode makes use of an entirely different ending song, which is something very unique.I can't say much about the background music.  While the opening and closing songs were very good, and the voice acting was prime, the background music got old extremely quick.  None of the tracks were notably special and overall they were rather average.  Best I can do is a 7.Character: 7There's a wide spectrum of characters on the show.  If I could rate each one individually they would get everything ranging from a 3 to a 10.The main male lead, a character position that is very rarely done well by romance/comedy anime, follows suit with every other wimpy male lead.  Though he's rather refreshing because he's at least sarcastic and apathetic, he's abused constantly, usually for no good reason, and doesn't retaliate, his character remains rather static for the entire show, he's portrayed as completely average and uninteresting, with no stated goals, hobbies, or interests that could give him the slightest amount of depth.  Like most other male leads, he's romantically oblivious and dense.  And, of course, his only redeeming factor is that he is occasionally kind, and occasionally sticks up for his friends.  If it weren't for the fact that he at least had a little bit of a backbone and was willing to reprimand his sister for her bullshit occasionally, he'd truly be another irredeemable, boring male lead.The main female lead doesn't differ much.  Her personality is split between mega-bitch and super-cute-girl.  When it comes to anything but anime/eroge, she is a classic tsundere character, turned up to 11.  She's extremely annoying, makes no changes to her character regardless of what happens, and is generally difficult to like.  Of course, she's adorable sometimes, so she has that going for her, and at least that helps the title make sense.  There's also a sense of wish-fulfillment going on with her character.  She's a very cliche example of a character who is presented to other characters as perfect/flawless but really has a glaring oddity/flaw that makes her more relatable to people who aren't perfect/flawless.  She complains often, is annoying, and makes little to no development unless the director happens to want some sort of drama to happen.  This personality is critical to the show, since any other personality wouldn't have made the story work, but is extremely dissatisfying to watch.The rest of the cast is mostly enjoyable, with a few gems that really stand apart from the rest of the cast.  I don't have the time or motivation to write an individual analysis of each one to give you a better idea of what the cast of characters in this show is like, but the personalities are varied and there's something for mostly everyone.  Even though the two leads don't always cut it as far as good characters go, characters like Ayase, Manami, and Kuroneko show that the writers do actually know how to write a character that isn't incredibly irritating to watch or unbearably average/boring with questionable motivations that don't always make sense.  The moe is strong with all the characters, however.If it weren't for the strong supporting cast, the show would have flunked as far as characters go.  As the show goes on, Kirino and Kyousuke become more bearable and make a good comedic duo with their sparring personalities.  There is at least some good to come out of their extreme personalities.Enjoyment: 8The show is funny, there's not much else to note here.  Neither the drama nor the romance is particularly enjoyable, other shows do it much better.  The story isn't very interesting or engrossing, but offers situations in which the characters can interact in hilarious ways.At its core, the show takes a bunch of adorably cute characters (and the male lead) and puts them in situations where they have to deal with each others' differing and sometimes clashing personalities as well as with the challenges of being obsessed with something society looks down upon.  Overall, the humor of the show is the best part, and makes the other, lesser aspects of the show bearable.Overall: 7The show almost does a lot of things.  It almost offers an endearing story about how a brother and a sister rekindle their relationship through the odd common factor of erotic adult games involving little sisters.  It almost offers a full cast of interesting, fun characters with believable personalities that interact in realistic ways.  It almost executes jokes without repeating the same ones over and over again.  It almost keeps the characters personalities from going overboard for the sake of quick comedy.  It almost creates realistic situations in which the characters act in accordance to their personality without resorting to dumbing down a character or changing the way they act to make a story work.  It almost offers great comedy without interference of lackluster drama and unneeded plot points.  But it doesn't quite reach there.  The show could have been great, but it makes a lot of mistakes.There's two ways you can go about the show taking into account these mistakes.  You can either get caught up in them and hate the show, or you can ignore them in favor of laughing at the jokes and choking over the adorable characters and overall cuteness.  Personally, I couldn't forgive the mistakes completely, but I easily ignored them in favor of a good laugh while watching.  The show could have been great, but it remains only good because of this.I definitely recommend the show, but your enjoyment of it really depends on you sense of humor (this show deals mostly with character interaction for its source of humor and light quips about otaku culture) and how much you'll get caught up in the poor aspects of the show and its mistakes. due to mutual hatred.

The anime also has a mention of the otaku culture and some other stuff, but the main focus is around the siblings (and otakus.. mostly since his sister is one).Now then. Why is the relationship between siblings is considered taboo in our society? Answer - mainly because of fear of of pregnancy that has a higher...chance to result in a defective child. And that\'s an adult reason. And this anime is not an adult one. See the problem here? So yeah, this anime doesn\'t have the correct platform to deal with the problem it is centered around (not being adult), as well as the guts (as far as i see it) to deal with it. Therefor it DOESN\'T. So basically as i see it, the main focus of the anime, is left unsolved (or solved half heartedly, as far as i see it).Leaving that aside, most the female characters (including the heroine) are horrible (aside from Minami and Ruru).

And this anime is not an adult one. See the problem here? So yeah, this anime doesn\'t have the correct platform to deal with the problem it is centered around (not being adult), as well as the guts (as far as i see it) to deal with it. Therefor it DOESN\'T. So basically as i see it, the main focus of the anime, is left unsolved (or solved half heartedly, as far as i see it).Leaving that aside, most the female characters (including the heroine) are horrible (aside from Minami and Ruru).

By the way, this is my first review, so it might not be that good. ', 'Alright, this review is more or less based on the 8 episodes they released now and seeing how there\'s 4 more left I\'m sure there isn\'t anything drastic that will happen.On we go, so this anime isn\'t action or anything, rather than it\'s an anime based on a brother-sister relationship. Some people consider it ""Tsunderes"" seeing how the brother and sister start from not talking to each other to actually talking and ""hanging"" out more often. BUT, in my opinion, the anime title is a bit misleading. When I started watching it, I thought it would be nice to see a relationship going from bad...to good and ""hopefully"" to best. Unfortunately, it doesn\'t seem that way. Trying to no spoil anything, the sister\'s behavior is outright bad(she treats her ""older"" brother like crap and brags a lot), more like a spoiled brat. Sure I can understand the first 3-4 episodes but the series is already on episode 8 out of 12 and the ""sister"" still treats her brother like crap. The brother who I believe the storytelling revolves around does extreme things to help his sister, and yet she doesn\'t do anything about it(she says thanks in one episode and that\'s it, don\'t expect anymore).Story: The story concept is actually good, a bad relationship between the brother and his sister turning to good progressively. It has the ""tsunderes"" feel to it.Art: The art style is clean and refreshing in my opinion.

It also happens to be a harem romance about incest, but Kousaka Kirino is so wonderful that you will forget that, even if you are the kind to unironically employ the word ""squicky"" in reference to this show. Perhaps about midway through the first season, you may notice Kousaka Kyousuke being gradually encroached upon by numerous attractive young women who are not his unfathomably smart and beautiful sister. If your childish mind cannot appreciate the marvel that is Kousaka Kirino, you might realise it earlier—for example, when fan favorite Kuroneko/Gokou Ruri shows up to...sperg about her chuunibyou Type-Moon-style anime and degrade the true spirit of moe. To those who like her, I happily concede that she is a charming and likeable girl whose very solid characterisation is in line with the surprisingly above-average writing on display throughout Oreimo. Hopefully, she will soon grow out of her chuuni phase and aspire to Kousaka Kirino\'s divine grace.When you\'re not being awed by the outstanding physical and personal qualities of Kousaka Kirino, you may observe that this show manages to straddle the line between playing to archetype and crafting unique and likeable characters. Sadly, few possess the shrewd mind and keen aesthetic awareness of someone like, for instance, Kousaka Kirino, and it\'s all too easy to dismiss this as merely a incest-themed distraction for lonely otaku, ignoring the bright, warm art and animation, not to mention the well written dialogue. The characters are given depth and believable interiority over the course of the show, rather than staying static, as can be the tendency in harem romance—for example, Kuroneko\'s little sister is introduced several episodes in, and we also see her living conditions in the same episode. It\'s refreshing to see her outside of the context of otaku stuff, interacting with someone close to her who isn\'t Kyousuke, or that platonic ideal of homo sapiens sapiens, Kousaka Kirino.Throughout the first season, Kousaka Kirino bestows upon the humble viewer a vision of her noble passion for moe. She draws her brother into her empire of eroge, writes a novel that wows the populace and gets immediately adapted into an anime, and through her generous condescension allows everyone around her to recognise her as the rightful centre of Oreimo\'s world. Those heretics who do not acknowledge Kousaka Kirino as a benevolent goddess of moe come to earth in human form may find the story uninteresting or even irritating as a result, though they ought to be censured for such thoughts.Sadly, the second season doesn\'t have quite the same spark as the first, but those truly appreciative of Kousaka Kirino will still find satisfaction. One way or another, Oreimo is one tasty cookie if you approach it with appropriate expectations.

There\'s only 1 scene in the entire first season that\'s questionable at worst, but hey, you are probably used to it by now. This is anime afterall - it tends to be weird from time to time. Rest assured it does remain a healthy sibling relationship so don\'t worry (at least in the 1st season).However, they are not kidding when they say the main character is 200% tsundere. For the majority of the anime she is outright hateful. It\'s not just...a simple ""It\'s not like I\'m doing this for you, b-b-baka..."" It\'s more like a ""I will punch you in the face until you start bleeding"" (actually happened). I really dislike her. The other main character (her brother) is... well, a really, really, REALLY good older brother. Considerate. Responsible. Caring. Always looking out for his little sister. Endures even the greatest of shame for her. He puts up with an incredible amount of her sh!t (personally, I\'d have taught her ""discipline"" five times over in every episode).I\'ve come to find the rest of the characters much more entertaining. Especially Manami\'s grandparents! They put up quite the show!The story revolves mostly around the tsundere little sister. There\'s not much of a story to begin with though. Just random parts of young people\'s life. Exactly what you would expect from a slice-of-life anime. You watch this because you are bored and you want to stay bored.EDIT: After watching the 2nd season, you might want to just end it right at the end of the 1st season\'s specials. I really don\'t recommend watching more than that. First of all, second season is where the incest is. But that\'s not really the problem, is it? You expected this at some point. We all did. Even if you (like me) didn\'t ship the two siblings.The problem is that it becomes a way too simple. Suddenly all the girls turn into magnets. That\'s right, it becomes a harem anime... just without all the interesting complications of a harem. A harem story is not inherently bad. It can be done well (Haganai comes to mind).*SPOILER*See, the main character turns everyone down. Although questionably noble from the guy, I don\'t even see the place for it in this anime. It was completely unnecessary.*SPOILER END*Save yourself the trouble, stop watching here. These 13-16 episodes are more than enough. You have a nice and healthy brother-sister relationship brewing. It\'s relaxing. Don\'t ruin this for yourself. a simple ""It\'s not like I\'m doing this for you, b-b-baka...""

Just random parts of young people\'s life. Exactly what you would expect from a slice-of-life anime. You watch this because you are bored and you want to stay bored.EDIT: After watching the 2nd season, you might want to just end it right at the end of the 1st season\'s specials. I really don\'t recommend watching more than that. First of all, second season is where the incest is. But that\'s not really the problem, is it? You expected this at some point. We all did. Even if you (like me) didn\'t ship the two siblings.The problem is that it becomes a way too simple. Suddenly all the girls turn into magnets. That\'s right, it becomes a harem anime... just without all the interesting complications of a harem. A harem story is not inherently bad. It can be done well (Haganai comes to mind).*SPOILER*See, the main character turns everyone down. Although questionably noble from the guy, I don\'t even see the place for it in this anime. It was completely unnecessary.*SPOILER END*Save yourself the trouble, stop watching here. These 13-16 episodes are more than enough. You have a nice and healthy brother-sister relationship brewing. It\'s relaxing. Don\'t ruin this for yourself.', 'Somehow this anime ended up in my to-watch list so I watched the first season. I tried to figure out precisely what this anime is supposed to be about but I could not honestly figure it out.Is it a romance? No, since it\'s primarily about a guy and his sister.Is it a comedy? No, it\'s not especially funny in any intentional way.Is it a drama? There\'s some drama but most of it is meaningless fluff.Is it ecchi? There\'s a few scenes that fit that description but honestly it isn\'t....What I do think this anime is: weird, creepy and pointless.Weird and creepy because I get really weird vibes from the MC and his sister. She\'s obsessed with siscon games and the anime heavily hints at this being the case because she secretly has romantic feelings for her brother. Okay, so that makes it a typical siscon fetish series. It gets weirder because there\'s a scene where he grabs her tit and sees her exposed panties. Mind you these are siblings, there\'s no flimsy excuse even like ""my brother was adopted"".The anime toes the line so closely that you could argue that this isn\'t a siscon fetish show though, since it barely dips into that aspect at all. Most of the time the tsundere sister just acts maximum tsun and abuses her brother with no punchline or anything. Just pointless drama and a bitchy younger sister abusing her brother for no good reason.The rest of the cast is so one dimensional they don\'t merit mentioning.If you\'re into incest crap then just go watch a hentai or something, you\'re not going to get anything interesting out of this anime. If you aren\'t into incest crap, then all this anime will give you is a bunch of creepy awkward incest-y moments between a brother and his spoiled brat sister.

Oreimo isn't nearly as bad as what the haters and negative comments suggest it to be. If you want something cute and funny to watch, this is definitely one of the better romances to get into, and I will always recommend it. People are likely only disappointed because of its ending, which I will say right here is an extremely fair and understandable point. I too absolutely hated the ending. But, if you think about it, there really was no way to give it an objectively ideal ending. And to give a...low rating just because of this, is unfair considering all that it delivers.Let me get something out of the way for those who might still be on the fence - the title is extremely misleading. Yes, it's about incest, BUT that's actually an extremely minor point of the story! It's actually more about erotic video games than it is about incest. It becomes very apparent that the sister has a crush on the main character, but because of how one-sided it is, this never becomes an issue. Instead, what you get to watch is the main character's relationship with the other female characters, while he deals with his sister and her (somewhat adorable, often annoying) antics. The story is surprisingly good, considering the original premise, with the female characters and their interactions/relationships coming together extremely well. THIS is what you're here to watch! So don't let the incest element push you away!Also, the sister's character comes off as highly annoying and frustrating at first, but that's there on purpose. Even if you do eventually feel like tossing her out the window, please have a little patience with her, as this does eventually get explained later on. Even if you don't like her, the show definitely redeems itself with its other characters, so just give it a chance. low rating just because of this, is unfair considering all that it delivers.Let me get something out of the way for those who might still be on the fence - the title is extremely misleading.

I mean even though less episodes , lot of things happened. But, they confess each others feelings, go upto even setting up a fake marriage and after they kiss , they suppress their feeling just like that?!. Thats bullshit. Even though I agree that Marriage between brothers and sisters are forbidden. But ,the ending is not correct, how can they even stay together after so many that happened. Kyousuke called of all the date request he got and at the end became a total loser thats all.Totallllly hate the ending....Depression. Disappointment. Hatred.

I admit that some people might find it weird or just plain disgusting but I urge you to renounce all prejudices you may have against the seinen genre, so you are able to enjoy this anime to its full extent.The Story is probably this anime's weakest point, but that is by no means saying it is bad. This anime, I...am glad to say is one which is actually believable, there is no sign of ridiculous superpowers or impossible things happening for no damn reason. its just an interesting, relate-able and hilarious story.Story:8/10The Art is great, and I am usually a super tough critic when it comes to art in anime and manga. I have a sneaking suspicion that this artist and Sword Art Online's are one in the same- but this is totally uninformed...(so no judging)-Art:10/10The Sound?.... good i guess...Sound:9/10Characters in this anime are amazing! i love every single one of them (mostly...) I would have to say that this is the anime that has made me feel every single emotion and love every second of it, and that is owing solely to the characters and their reactions to the situations they find themselves in.Characters:10/10This anime makes me so happy. I can honestly say that I spent most of it with hugely unattractive grin plastered across my face. This anime is hilarious, one of the funniest I've seen and I class among one of the top 5 anime's I have ever watched.Enjoyment:10/10Overall this anime is outstanding. I would recommend it to everyone so long as they are willing to get past all the seinen and ecchi stuff and give it a chance.

This series completely snuck up on me and grabbed my heartstrings.The story is about the icy relationship between 17 year old brother Kyosuke and his younger sister, 15 year old Kirino.  In the beginning, Kyosuke helps her to find a club to talk about her interests in the hopes of helping her develop healthy friendships.The story line is surprising in that you think that Kirino is going to be a polite and appreciative little sister, but instead she\'s pretty short tempered and kind of abusive to her brother. We can\'t quite understand what...makes her tick -- she is totally immersed in anime that revolves around ""little-sister"" eroge, yet her own relationship with her brother is very conflicted. She tests her brother, asking him for one outrageous favor after another, and struggles to show any gratitude at all. The plot becomes more complex and you are rewarded with a lot of humorous drama which leads to a surprising, if not completely satisfying end.I first wrote a review after watching the first season, and gave it 9/10. But after watching the second season, I completely fell in love with the show and now offer my rarely given 10/10 rating with no regrets.First off, I want to say that the animation itself was top notch, and all the characters were very well done. The voice acting was very emotive and the subtitles seemed well matched to the dialog. The girls were unbelievably cute, I can\'t think of another anime that had such deliciously adorable characters.Finally, the music in the shows was great, a different closing theme song for each episode!  The theme song Irony by the duo ClariS is so beautiful and touching, it is just perfect for the story. makes her tick -- she is totally immersed in anime that revolves around ""little-sister"" eroge, yet her own relationship with her brother is very conflicted.

You can love an anime for what it is, but hate a character in the anime for who he/she is.The story is simple. A brother and a sister are too different from each other and they don't get along, until the brother comes across one of his sister's eroge games and since then, his sister becomes a big part of his life. The story may be simple, but it is very entertaining since it explains things about being an otaku and what they usually do. And in...this anime, they used a different approach to make it very fun to watch and to keep your eyes glued to the screen.The art is good. I see no animation error or such, and the appearance of the characters define their overall personality. I don't have problem with the art at all. But it isn't the gem of this anime. The sounds are ok too. I don't actually pay much attention to it, but I did love to OP theme and the many ending themes.The characters. Oh, I love some of them and I hate some of them. Why? Because of the kind of people they are. Kyousuke is one of the two main characters who is your typical average guy. But he isn't plain in a way that it's boring. In fact, I can't help but sympathize with him every time he gets bullied by his sister. Oh, Kirino. As much as she's the titular character, I have to admit she is not a little sister that I would like to have, at all. I'm sure a lot thinks the same. There are a lot of little sisters in anime who are portrayed as tsundere, but she is just too extreme that her personality borders on being more than just bitchy.Her best friend, Ayase is also kind of irritating once you get to know the kind of person she really is. While Ayase may seem very sweet and gentle at first, you come to know that she is the kind of person who has little tolerance for otakus and still holds on the belief that her friend is not one. She couldn't even bring herself to, at the very least, accept that Kirino is an otaku and just put up with it if she really hates otakus that much.The others are good. I love Kuroneko. She is a thousand times, no - a million times better than Kirino. She may be intense in terms of the way she talks and acts, but unlike Kirino, she is not mean. She just likes to tease people for amusement's sake. She is rather, misunderstood at times. But deep down, she is kind and caring and is kind of insecure.To sum it up, OreImo is a very good anime. It's a great of comedy, slice-of-life (otaku-wise), drama, and romance. Even though it may have its share of particularly nerve-grating characters, it can be overlooked by all the other elements of the anime.

It's a cliche of the games that Kirino loves so dearly. What kept me interested was wondering how long could either of one them stand being friends before Kyousuke bitterness gets in the way and/or Kirino's confesses the real reason she's into anime and games with incest themes. The plot would introduce something interesting and then not follow up on it then do it again in the next episode. Kirino modeled the story didn't follow up on how that was affecting her anime hobby or how it...could have affected her self esteem always expecting to be beautiful. Saori hosted those anime parties how come Kirino didn't go back or Saori mention it? It hinted at Manami liking Kyousuke, how come she didn't pursue him? Kirino had a manga published, they didn't want a second series? Was offered her story to be turned into an anime, did it ever go through? How was it received? Saori was really more than she looked, she didn't want to disclose to her new found friends her other side? Yes, she was anime fan but she was someone else when the glasses off, they could have went into that deeper. It would have been nice to show that Kirino wasn't the only one who didn't fit the physical appearance stereotype of an otaku.Since it's a cliche and is about an otaku. It does explore the different aspects of the otaku world. Kirino meets other otakus, goes to an convention, participate in the online world of otaku, writes her on stories, frequent the known otaku spot to buy her some content. There also some cosplaying as well. So it didn't neglect the otaku theme of the story for that I will rate the story 7/10 ( 7 meaning good). Although it didn't present any real drama it did n't neglect Kirino embracing and expanding her anime and eroge interests.Form of Development/Pace: Moved along pretty well however it would leave material they introduced behind. Side stories/Extra Space: No side stories, no fillers. However some of Episode 11 was so lame that it felt like a filler. How is a party 4 people? Please explain this. Believable: Yes. Conclusion: It ended well for what it presented through out the series. It didn't really leave any doors open for a return.Art: 8/10The art was wonderful. It had beautiful and very detailed backgrounds, great color scheme that shaped the anime, hair shine eye details,etc. There isn't really anything to complain about the artwork. There wasn't one episode where I felt it was slacking. It flowed with the music as well. I give the artwork an 8, 8 meaning very good.Sound: 8/10No annoying voices, all were fitting to the their characters (for future reference I watched the subbed version). The beginning theme song is bouncy and cute. The background music was fitting. This anime had theme songs and I didn't listen to all of them so what I did hear it flowed with the anime. I give the sound an 8, 8 meaning very good.Character: 6/10Kyousuke changes for the better. He actually compromises his bitterness to be there for Kirino. Kirino on the other hand is a different story. No significant progress for her. She was nice at Kyousuke at times but was it really to be nice or was it for her not to push him over the edge to where he would retreat to being distant? I give the artwork an 6, 6 meaning fine.Enjoyment: 8/10I enjoyed it. It had it's funny moments and I enjoyed watching Kirino embrace her dorky side.Overall: 7/10It averages to 7.4 out of 10 so I'm going to drop it down to 7.Although Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai didn't really delve deep into the drama aspect, it displayed an anime fan embracing the otaku world in a funny and enjoyable way.Would I recommend to someone else?I would recommend this to someone who is a sucker for cute anime and can handle the awkwardness of Kirino liking her brother...and eroge. could have affected her self esteem always expecting to be beautiful.

I give the artwork an 8, 8 meaning very good.Sound: 8/10No annoying voices, all were fitting to the their characters (for future reference I watched the subbed version). The beginning theme song is bouncy and cute. The background music was fitting. This anime had theme songs and I didn't listen to all of them so what I did hear it flowed with the anime. I give the sound an 8, 8 meaning very good.Character: 6/10Kyousuke changes for the better. He actually compromises his bitterness to be there for Kirino. Kirino on the other hand is a different story. No significant progress for her. She was nice at Kyousuke at times but was it really to be nice or was it for her not to push him over the edge to where he would retreat to being distant? I give the artwork an 6, 6 meaning fine.Enjoyment: 8/10I enjoyed it. It had it's funny moments and I enjoyed watching Kirino embrace her dorky side.Overall: 7/10It averages to 7.4 out of 10 so I'm going to drop it down to 7.Although Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai didn't really delve deep into the drama aspect, it displayed an anime fan embracing the otaku world in a funny and enjoyable way.Would I recommend to someone else?I would recommend this to someone who is a sucker for cute anime and can handle the awkwardness of Kirino liking her brother...and eroge."", '-Project Zakuro Reviews: OreImo-Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (or OreImo for short) is a rather intriguing slice-of-life anime released to date. Rather than tackle the generic tropes of the slice-of-life genre, it instead tackles the inside story of otaku culture in hopes of promoting otaku acceptance in Japan, if not, worldwide. So does this anime help to enforce the theme it is trying to convey? Well then, let\'s find out.The story is mainly about Kyousuke: an average high school student, and his sister Kirino: a middle school model, who basically live their lives with little regard for one another. That is...until Kyousuke discovers an anime left behind in the house and after some investigation, finds out that the owner of the anime is none other than his sister Kirino. The discovery prompted Kirino to enact ""life counseling"" and brings Kyousuke to her room to show him her stache of anime collections hidden in her closet, revealing to her brother that Kirino loves anime as well as eroge PC games. However seeing that otaku are frowned upon society, Kyousuke agrees to help keep her hobby a secret and in the process gets involved in Kirino\'s otaku-related errands throughout the rest of the anime. The story in terms is very basic and seems to develop ways of engaging the viewers in unexpected ways. Although nothing impressive like you would find in other genres, the story is well built and actually helps to convey the reality of otaku culture rather than stereotype it frequently to the point of humor. There\'s enough good content within the story to keep the viewers entertained from the beginning to the end.I\'ll be bluntly honest here. The art designs of the characters didn\'t really appeal to me that much. Not that Hiro Kanzaki is a bad artist, in fact far from it. I actually find him a decent artist but it\'s just that the art style of the anime is nothing too impressive either. The art style (despite being moe in nature) seems to rely heavily on being as reality-based as it could get. Because of this, any pizzazz like you would see in other genres is almost completely absent. Luckily though, OreImo doesn\'t rely on one style alone. I have seen various and eye-catchy character designs for the in-anime anime such as Stardust Witch Meruru. The wide variety of art styles found in this anime is enough to make up for the lack of impression of the main style. As for animation, pretty much basic and average but everything still runs smoothly to the frame rate. The in-anime shown in the background is actually a very impressive touch done by the animators so kudos to them. My issue with the animation though is that some scenes will show background characters with hardly any movements at all, failing to portray an actual public situation. It is a problem that I find common in almost every anime I watched so far. Despite this, the art and animation are decent but still good.The music that plays in OreImo is again nothing too impressive. I\'m starting to notice a pattern of just how realistic this anime is actually trying to be. As far as background music goes, the only excitement I felt from it was during the Meruru song but that\'s pretty much it. Overall the background music is basic but it does fit their scenarios quite well. The opening theme by ClariS is one of the best themes I heard so far and so I was really impressed by the effort put into it. And the wide variety of ending themes is a brilliant idea to break away from the usual tropes of them having to be replayed after every episode so it\'s nice to see a change. The ending themes are very well done. The voice acting is also superb and each actor portrays their character personalities very well. So far, no mess ups for this category but I haven\'t watched the dubbed version yet so there\'s little I can say for the voice acting at this point.Now for the characters. With all do respect, the majority of characters are likable but there are some instances where these characters can sometimes become annoying. I\'m specifically talking about Kirino. I understand that she\'s supposed to be the centerpiece of otaku acceptance but some times, she shows her ""annoying Imouto"" trait and that\'s when I can\'t stand her sometimes. Especially when confronting her brother about eroge. Even Kyousuke himself shows a display of annoyance whenever he overreacts about something related to eroge. So far I have mixed feelings of the main protagonists but the rest of the characters are good and likable. My personal favorite is Kuroneko for her nonchalant personality. With that said, the characters are likable only with a few exceptions but that doesn\'t stop this anime from having a good decent cast.OreImo may be basic but because it is trying to convey otaku culture into slice-of-life, the entertainment factor is enough to keep any viewer enjoyed all the way to the end. With its fair share of comedy, drama, and entertaining flow, this anime has done a good job trying to convey the main message it was trying to bring out. If you\'re an anime fan and you\'re proud of it, I recommend you give this a try.Final Evaluation: Worth the watch. until Kyousuke discovers an anime left behind in the house and after some investigation, finds out that the owner of the anime is none other than his sister Kirino.

It was widely popular In japan with It’s focus on Otaku culture & what not. It was then later adapted Into a manga & more recently an Anime which Is produced AIC.With a title such as “My little sister” You’d assume an Incesty fanservice filled Moe show with nothing but panty shots & SUPER KAWAII SUGOI DESU ~ but suprisingly enough you’d be wrong. For the most part anyway…Story:As this site already holds synopsises, I won't explain the premise. Simply scroll up.At...first It seems like a run of the mill Echii setup by including Eroge and Otaku pandering. But oddly enough “Ore Imoto” manages to keep it’s story engaging with various scenarios that many Otaku’s would go through as well as general teenage issues, having to deal with school and friends. Especially the first few episodes which were exceptionally well at creating these situations. Later there are a few more far fetched ideas thrown in such as Kirino getting her own Anime series which was underplayed and completely unrealistic. Theres another section when they completely unresolved an issue that was initially brought up In the first place. Another negative note Is while the shows not *EXTREMLY* Incest heavy, toneing It down from the original source material theres still certain moments In this Anime that make you go “NO, stop making these little jokes & hints at Incest. It’s getting out of hand.” Honestly some parts can make you *cringe* at how the Incest undertones are handled, It didn’t ruin the show but It did dampen the experience for me personally.Despite this It’s emulation on Otaku lifestyle Is accurate for the most part and easy for most Otaku’s to get involved In.Characters:As far as characters go Kyosuke can come off as a little bit of a smart ass. But he’s very likable, he’s less obnoxious and more sarcastic If anything. He doesn’t really care If his comments come off as brash or rude but just kinda says them without being a Inconsiderate Jerk. His personalities best compared to Kyon from Haruhi Suzimiya as while he constantly around harebrained nonsense he still manages to react to the situation In a mature and helpful manner. He can seem Generic and void of a personality at times, but he still comes of as more *Independent* than boring.Kirino on the other hand burdens the fatal flaw of alot of leads of this archetype. Which Is the overplayed Tsundere act. At first It seemed her character was while pompous, arrogant and a pain was still grateful for what her brother does for her. Sadly while the episodes progress her character doesn’t as she keeps herself One dimensional for most of the series showing only a little sign of good character near the end. Granted she can be funny and show some sincerity at times but there simply too few & far inbetween. It seems rather than thanking Kyosuke for helping her she punishes him, taking advantage of the characters forgiving & mature nature. Kirino doesn’t ruin the entire Anime, but If you have issues watching characters like Haruhi then proceed with caution.Despite Kirino’s over acting being more “Tsun” than “dere”, the supporting cast manages to help out alot. There vibrant, likable, and funny. Unfortunately most of the screen time Is consumed by Haruhi-2.0 when the side characters really should have gotten more of it as they were far more enjoyable. Making for some Comedic scenarios had me laughing out loud.Animation/Music:Animation wise this show Is extremely colorful. AIC handle the Art direction oh so well ~ Characters are vibrant and well detailed with a wonderfully colorful art style without being overly Moe. Backgrounds, character expressions, are all drawn In a fashionable way. AIC really made no flaws In the animation department. The music Is another well done aspect. The Opening theme Irony Is extremely catchy, I still can’t get that song out of my head. Ending themes are changed episodically with a new track fitting the theme of the episode. Not many memorable one’s but still sounded pretty good & gave a nice change in variety. Background music can also be catchy If not a little generic but thats not to say It’s a bad thing It fits the Otaku’est atmosphere of the show. Theres also a few J-pop insert songs like the “Meruru theme song” which are more of a personal guilty leasure to listen too. Typical and childish as It may be.Epilogue:In the end My little sister has It’s ups & downs. While Its view on Otaku Is well done the central character It focuses on Is flawed In various ways. It could have handled certain situations much better as I felt some issues touched upon were done sub-parley. And while It’s focus Is on Otaku Its for a more Eroge/Moe type looking at Adult oriented Visual novels, Doujinshi & Magical girl anime and less on Different types of genres. Granted you could say It was made In Japan so It would have more of a look on most Japanese Otaku but It can still throw off some people watching It. Aside the flaws it still manages to be an entertaining and enjoyable series with a colorful cast of characters for the most part, along with a kind story about an Brother helping out his younger sister and her struggles with everyday teen life and secret Otaku lifestyle.This Is Otakuman saying Goodbye & Sionara ~ first It seems like a run of the mill Echii setup by including Eroge and Otaku pandering.

But i gave it a chance since it seemed pretty popular.The story of a little sister and an older brother, the imouto is the typical high grades kawaii athletic and popular model chan and the bro being a looser who will never get a girlfriend. Bro discovering her hidden passion for Eroge (japanese dating games made for the interest of males). She decides to console her love for her hobby to him - no one must find...out about cause it could turn her into an out cast and ruin her image. Forcing him to go to anime conventions and such with her. Ill admit the last few episodes and the OVA's are highly fan service based and involve hinting that their relationship took a turn towards incest love. But overall the anime was enjoyable. It should be more enjoyable if your an Otaku lol. They include all the typical maid cafe, anime cons and such.I recommend it so long as you dont mind the hinting of incest throughout the series. Also they DO NOT actually have any incest at any point. Basicaly laugh at the comical fun and dont watch it with your brother or sister. :)Thank You. Yume Tang out about cause it could turn her into an out cast and ruin her image. Forcing him to go to anime conventions and such with her.

Yume Tang"", 'Ore no Imouta ga konnani Kawii Wake ga Nai, or Oreimo is basically about a normal guy who want\'s to live as normally as possible finds out that his little sister is actually a in the closet otaku. Now, I know this sounds like a really generic anime, (it kinda is, but also isn\'t) but this show actually goes into various ways otaku-ism (I think?) can effect relationships, and people\'s lives. Something most anime with otaku protaginists totally ignore.Now to go further into the actual plot it\'s basically Kyousuke (protaginist) figuring out how to help a bunch of middle school girls. Suprisingly it\'s interesting...since they bring up a lot of good points are how otakus are looked down upon. I can actually relate to most of them since my family always call me otaku, and weaboo.This show itself it one big, ball of irony also. Since Kyousuke\'s phylospy is that living a normal life is best, and gets stuck with a bunch of otaku (They are considered bad in Japan.) He states that people who are siscons are crazy, and only like them since they don\'t have little sisters while the title is translated as ""My Little Sister Can\'t be This Cute."" They also mention that watching anime will make you like incest, or become a sex offender. Kirino (the little sister) makes Kyousuke play eroge and watch anime, and again refer to the title.Now the art really kinda sucked. Now I know every illustator has their own art style, but it didn\'t really stand out all that mention. The only thing that really stood out was the backgrounds. They had a lot of detail like at the whole comicon thingy it had cosplayers, and a bunch of people. This is probably the only thing that was really good since it\'s school life, and doesn\'t have like any service shots.Sound was all right. I couldn\'t find many translations for the actual opening, or ending but from the little I could actually translate, and what I did find they were pretty catchy, but they didn\'t really fit the show. Since the first one was basically about Kirino just being tsundere.BGM was nice too. Each character\'s theme was original, and didn\'t sound like a ripe off from another cheap anime.Now character\'s is a major issue for me. Mainly Kirino she is a total b***** like seriously. She goes and treats Kyousuke like he was some kind of infectious disease for years, and then when he finds out her secret and realizes she can use him she becomes a total slave driver! Yeah, she\'s tsundere, but she\'s has like no dere! All I saw was just her picking on her brother, she wasn\'t even that cute about it, or anything. Also everything she does she\'s good at. She the star of the track team, great grades, a model, popular, writes a novel that instantly gets serialized. She\'s another Shiina that\'s how much talent she has! Character\'s like that really annoy me! And she\'s the main chick too! (I\'m going by the title of the show.) Ugh, when I see her I kinda want to break something! She\'s not even strong idependent women, she\'s just a major b*****. Now this are words I don\'t throw around a lot but their is no other way to describe her.Kyousuke is an interesting character as well. He was the main reason I continued to watch this show (I originally watched it since it had tsundere, but after I saw her I was like ""Hell no!"") He beliefs that normal life is the best. He want\'s to get a plain job, a plain wife, and live as plainly as possible. The whole house, wife, two kids, and a dog plan. It makes you wonder why does he think this? When I was a kid I always wanted to be a hero of some kind. I never wanted to live a plain life so why did he? Like what Keima always say ""Reality is s***"" so why did he want to submit to reality? And why did he always work so hard for everyone elses sake? He never really got anything out of it so why do it? And I don\'t want to hear the whole ""well he\'s the protaginist."" If he wants a normal life why do this stuff? He\'s basically the most interesting person in the show, and one of the few reason I actually watched it.There\'s also Kuroneko, and Ayase who are both Kirino\'s best friends, and total oppisites. Kuroneko is tsundere done right along with chuunbiyou (kinda) otaku, while Ayase is a yandere, model. This developed a very interesting dinamic between the group since Kirino wants to be able to talk about how she enjoys anime, and stuff while Ayase has a prejudice. (Otaku are often mentioned when people talk about sex offender, and various other crimes. People also mention that otaku-ism leads to crime so I don\'t think it\'s alright to hate her for that.)[Spoilers] Kinda? You\'ve been warned.Now before anything else I suggest you have alteast some knowledge of the ending.[Actual Spoiler]The ending is something that\'s really awful since I was rooting for Ayase, or Kuroneko the show and the show went and pulled the incest card. Now I don\'t hate incest (Some of my favorite manga have implied incest, and have cousin marrieds. Now i know that\'s not siblings but still) but it kinda half baked it since it was only a temporary relationship. Personally I think if your gonna do go all out. Like I can\'t see me commiting incest then dating someone else. It would really awkward to mention, and if it was a harem I wouldn\'t be suprised if it destroyed all the other girls affection for me. So when they did that it was kinda like what the hell. Of course I also was rooting for Kuroneko, and Ayase and really hated Kirino.Now this show is probably for Otaku\'s, School Life lovers, Rom-com lovers, Incest lovers, harem lovers, and Protaginist lovers (that\'s me. I think Kyousukes a good one since he manages to be intersting like Kyon, and Hachiman while also helping everyone.) Or maybe if you just want to see a bunch of innocent girls suffer. since they bring up a lot of good points are how otakus are looked down upon.

However, there were many unaddressed issues which caused this anime to be a letdown. However, a disclaimer would be that this show is very subjective, and many people have contrasting opinions on this series.Story 4/10The story in itself was decent, with an exaggerated but accurate portrayal of the ups and downs of having a sibling. The depiction of ""otakus"" and how the public viewed them was interesting and thought-provoking. However, using the same rinse and repeat formula throughout the 12 episodes was a mistake. It led...to repetitiveness and predictable outcomes. The general pace was rather slow, causing the closing episode to feel terribly rushed.Art 8/10No complaints about the art, it was smooth and clean.Sound 8/10The OP was alright, but the fact that every episode had a different ED was laudable.Character 4/10This section is quite lengthy and thus will be broken down into 1) Main characters and their development 2) Inter-character relationships 3) Supporting cast and their development.1) There are 2 main characters, the male lead Kyousuke and his younger sister Kirino.Kyousuke is a rather bland character at first glance but progresses to be a caring brother. He would make the finest of doormats but is surprisingly self-sacrificial.Kirino fulfils and goes beyond the ""tsundere"" archetype, with an extra serving of attitude. She fails to obtain proper development as she shies away from any responsibility in the face of adversity, having her brother as a neat tool to sweep up the mess. The outcome is an ambitiously complex character with no growth whatsoever.2) The relationship between brother and sister still develops, despite Kirino\'s tsundere personality hindering it. The other characters failed to have any depth in their relationships with the main characters.3) The supporting cast were all interesting characters, but the anime did not draw out their full potential.Enjoyment 3/10Being brutally honest, the repetitiveness and overbearing personalities made OreImo painful to watch for me.Overall 5/10OreImo had tonnes of potential but failed to capitalise.

This is a story about coming to terms with what you like and finding the inner strength to be who you are regardless of what other people think. Concerning the characters I'd say that my favourite was definitely Kuroneko, her calm and intellectual personality was a nice contrast to Kirino's ridiculously feisty and bossy one.For me this series would've been better if there had been more character development, I felt like even though Shiori is a prominent...character in the series very little is known about her. Moreover, it seemed as if Kirino just enjoyed being an arrogant brat all the time, which at times was just way too much considering how the whole anime is about her asking her brother to go out of his way on her account whenever she felt like it. character in the series very little is known about her.

GO WATCH IT NOW.Everybody have different tastes in anime . This type of anime really just suits me . Many people disliked this anime because they find it gross , disgusting and find it hard to watch because its about relationship between the sister and her brother . But from my perspective , this anime tells me the true meaning of ""love"" . True love can happens anywhere . It does not have to be childhood friend , schoolmate , classmate , teacher , whatever . It can even be your loved...ones like your ""sister"" . True , it can be disturbing and people think it will not happen in real life . Once again , Who knows ? This anime is really really good because the voice actors , the song tracks bring all the feelings in certain scenes out in the anime . But after all , its still your choice whether you want to watch this anime . Like i say in the beginning , everyone have different tastes in anime . Just give it a try till episode 4 or 6 , if cannot take it , just drop it then :( (NOT RECOMMEND THOUGH) This anime is best watched during weekends to finish straight away ^^ Thanks me later after you finished this season and the 2nd season of OreImo :) ones like your ""sister"" .

When I first saw it on Sword Art Online, I was completely confused and wondered why such a story archetype even existed! Yet, OreImo, isn\'t about incestuous love. It\'s really about two siblings bonding together over their problems and worries.I\'ll save the plot line and generic review comments, and tell you this: this anime was enjoyable to watch. It has a lighthearted tone throughout the anime and its comedy sure made me crack up every episode. The art is standard and doesn\'t pose...any problems, and the story itself it interesting. The character interactions between Kirino and Kyousuke really drives the story forward with otaku-esque themes being the facilitator. There are a lot of ""easter egg"" like comedy in the anime, mainly through comedic allusions of existing anime (sort of like Lucky Star\'s Haruhi Suzumiya references, although the references in OreImo are not as obvious); thus, if you watch Oreimo after watching a lot of other anime, you\'ll enjoy the series even more.Yet, this anime is not without its problems. Kyousuke\'s constant ""save the day"" moments with Kirino\'s problems become slowly annoying over time because Kirino acts so pretentious and rude despite her brother\'s acts of kindness. I question Kyousuke, ""Why do you help your sister so much despite her terrible treatment of you?""

However for that to be one of the main reasons why Oreimo is criticized isn't right. Oriemo was actually to my surprise a pretty good anime.Story:8The story Oreimo follows a brother and sister who are pretty distant from each other. The sister is a perfect student and athlete who is also a model. However there is one thing she likes alot, her eroge and anime. The brother finds this out and the story rolls from there on out. The story is pretty consistent with the plot and theme. But in the later episode...does a ballzy move that later on kinda works out, and i give props to them for it.Art:7It is your basic art with fluid animationSound:9The opening and endings were up beat and sounded great.

The songs were very catchy and remeberable.Characters: 7The characters in Oreimo weren't as unique as other anime bot still held their grounds. Kiniro and gokou or kuroneko's interactions were new and fresh. The rest of the cast were ok and did do their part in the story quite well.Enjoyment:9I really enjoyed watching Oreimo. It was fresh, fun, and had me laugh the whole time. The comedy in this anime was top notch, even besting konosuba in comedy for me. The story had me lured in, and when they dropped an unsuspected wrench in the story, i was on the edge of my seat. If you like comedy or slice of life anime, this definitely is the show for you. If you want more romance, Oreimo can still deliver  what you need. does a ballzy move that later on kinda works out, and i give props to them for it.Art:7It is your basic art with fluid animationSound:9The opening and endings were up beat and sounded great.

Simply put, it\'s (story) not a bad idea, but somehow it still feels off and doesn\'t deliver the full satisfaction. Of course, I understand that there is also a second season and I have always watched it. Without spoiling anything much, let\'s go in depth about Oreimo.Story: Perhaps, the weakest link here that draw the rating below. The story is simply about two sibling a big brother and a little sister ""hating"" on each other until the big brother realizes that his little sister isn\'t exactly what he thought she was; hence, the...title (he didn\'t expect her to be this cute). The reason why I placed quotation on ""hating"" because they actually don\'t hate each other. In fact, the little sister actually  likes the big brother very much, it just that, things have change when they\'ve grown up, but that feeling has never disappear since then. Instead, we have this awkward, a bit cliches, cheesy, but can be lovable relationship between siblings that may borderlines incest. Overall, for the story portion, it\'s alright, because there isn\'t much story to it. It\'s not like a hero must defeat evil cliches kind of plot, but it\'s simply about you watching how these siblings interact each other and with other characters interfering them and whatnot. If there is an antagonist, it would probably be society itself for forbidding incest. That being said, there is no ""sex scene"" in this anime, obviously nor is there some kind of incest scene. It\'s just a thought between the sibling that rises that question.Art: Quite frankly, I am never strict about art work and animation, if they did a good job, then they did a good job. I would rate this 8 star, but since I\'m a little bias, I\'m going with 7 stars because it\'s not my type of art, but it doesn\'t mean that it is bad. I fine the art just fine. It didn\'t bother me when I was watching the show. Ecchi scenes or ""fanservice"" is actually very little to none if I could remember correctly. Surprisingly, I would thought that they would have a lot of that kind of thing. There is harem though.Sound: Again, I am quite bias when it comes to art and sound, but it was too cutesy for my liking. background music and other effects are fine though, it just opening and ending that I\'m not good with.Character: I felt characters were real and not fake like one-dimensional, which is a good thing. But unfortunately, I liked other characters more than the two main which is the brother and sister. While, they are not terrible when it comes to personality and character traits, I felt there were more other interesting characters in the show.Enjoyment: While, not necessarily a comedy, it was fun and it has some hilarious moment between the siblings that gave me a nice smile and laughter. Not a bad watch for those that just want to watch something a bit casual the serious plot.Overall: It\'s alright. Not necessarily bad, but could have been better. The manga or light novel is probably better than the anime is what I think. Usually, it is since anime tends to leave out small details that could have added to be important later on in the story. title (he didn\'t expect her to be this cute).

Thus, my review is limited to Season 1 (though I’ve heard rumors of Season 2's uncomfortable, unsatisfying conclusion, making me glad I spared myself from another 12+ episodes of barely repressed rage).I don’t really remember how I came across Oreimo.  I think I saw a clip of it on YouTube, thought it looked interesting, and decided to check it out.  Boy, was that a mistake.  There aren’t many shows I hate, but I genuinely despise Oreimo.  I could spend many, many...paragraphs breaking down why I hate it so much, but the primary reason is that the main female character, Kirino, is horrible.  I don’t mean that she’s badly written; rather, that she’s a terrible person, one of the most unlikeable characters I’ve ever come across in a fictional work.I stopped watching the show after Season 1, so her backstory—namely, her upbringing with her brother, Kyosuke—is still largely a mystery to me.  However, regardless of what happened in her past, no matter how tragic or traumatic it might have been, the obscene level of physical and verbal abuse she heaps on Kyosuke throughout Season 1 is completely unjustifiable.  Her kicks, punches, and headbutts aren’t mere slapstick played for laughs (for an example of effective physical comedy in an anime, check out Baka and Test).  To the contrary, it is full-blown domestic violence, leaving lasting bruises and scars all over Kyosuke’s body.  Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t find domestic violence “cute” in the slightest.Kirino’s actions are made even more intolerable by the fact that throughout Season 1 Kyosuke is trying his best to help Kirino at every turn, putting his time, money, and reputation on the line to rebuild their relationship.  And how does Kirino greet his efforts?  With indifference and cruelty, of course!  Kirino—along with her two Mean Girls-esque middle-school friends—made Oreimo so unpleasant for me to watch that I eventually gave up on the show entirely and started watching Spice and Wolf instead (a much, MUCH better show, btw).The problem with Kirino is that she’s positioned as the protagonist of the series; the audience is supposed to like her, relate with her, and root for her to succeed.  However, her abusive and selfish behavior, combined with her being a Mary Sue otaku with a brother complex, leaves me hating her more than most villains I’ve come across in anime.  At the very least, it would have been nice to see her suffer some consequence for her brutish actions that leads to introspection and growth (and no, her half-hearted attempt at a thank-you party in episode 11 doesn’t count, especially since episode 12 contains her biggest beatdown of Kyosuke in the series up to that point).However, as much as I hate this show—and I truly, truly hate it—I can’t in good conscience give Oreimo a 1/10.  To deserve a 1/10, a show must lack any artistic merit whatsoever; basically, that the creators shouldn’t have bothered to make the show in the first place, and the world might actually be better off if they had made such a decision.  It is the ultimate condemnation, to say that “not existing” is preferable to “existing.”  And I can’t in good faith argue that Oreimo is so vile or worthless that it doesn’t deserve to exist.  For whatever inexplicable reason, Oreimo has a head-scratchingly high number of fans (a fact that continues to baffle me to this day).  Not to say I wouldn’t give 1/10 to a show because of its popularity; rather, I honestly believe Oreimo has some artistic value.There are elements of the show I like, particularly Kyosuke’s “girlfriend” and her family (honestly, the show would’ve been so much better if it had centered on them instead).  Unfortunately, these positive elements are completely overshadowed by Kirino, in all her ingloriousness.  Still, Oreimo has been a surprising source of inspiration and introspection for me; my disdain of the show has helped hone my analytic prowess, leading to greater self-awareness as to why I like what I like and why I dislike what I dislike.  To appreciate the good, you need to experience and learn from the bad. And what have I learned from Oreimo?  That I hate watching jerks be mean to each other for 12 episodes.Would I recommend the show?  Well, I gave it a 3/10, so that should tell you something.  Unless any of what I’ve just described intrigues you, avoid this show at all costs. paragraphs breaking down why I hate it so much, but the primary reason is that the main female character, Kirino, is horrible.

The problem is that everything of this anime is pointing out that it’s gonna be awful and there’s no single decent thing there. It have very poorly made ending ahead that anyone with some sense in mind know what gonna happen without even need to watch next season.It also have bad supporting character.

This is a review for all the seasons and specials of Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake Ga NaiSome similar anime I have seen with scores:  Toradora!(10)  Nana(10)  Lovely Complex(8)  Baka and Test(10)   Seto no Hanayome(6) not a style of comedy I like.Story:  8\t        The story progressed quite quickly. The main brother sister relationship with Kirino (sister) and Kyousuke (brother) grows and progresses through many incidents, and you feel them getting closer and closer, and that Kyousuke really tries to be a good brother. I really enjoyed their...relationship and felt it was endearing. There are also a few twists and turns that keep the story fresh and interesting.Characters:  9\tThe main protagonists (Kirino and Kyousuke), and Kuroneko get developed quite well, and they feel interesting and understandable. Kuroneko\'s character I fell in love with, she is such a great character, and so adorable for the first time I understand moe, a pure innocent little sister you want to care for and protect. She is now one of my top 5 favorite characters in anime (I\'ve watched 100\'s). As for Ayase and Kanako they needed to be developed more for their actions to make more sense. Also a little additional background to Kyousuke would have helped make him more multi-dimensional, and Kirino is a little over the top with her tsun side (hitting, angry, and denying) making her character less believable.Enjoyment:  9\tThis anime was a joy to watch. Most of the episodes had at least a few jokes in there that made me laugh quite a bit. The jokes are great and well thought out, and are not slapstick. This is one of the funniest anime I have seen in a long time. There is also great fun poking at, commenting on anime, and the examining of Otaku culture. Also I remember feeling the tension once or twice thinking ""no way."" The comedy combined with developed characters and interesting relationships made it addicting to watch.Overall:  8\t         It would be nice to read some of the light novel first to get a little extra background for Kyousuke and for Ayase and Kanako, and see a softer Kirino not so tsun (hitting, angry, and denying), as in the light novels. Those and the ending are the main negatives to the anime. Overall the plot, characters, comedy, and relationships were great. I think I would maybe even re-watch some episodes for the laughs and Kuroneko, and I almost never re-watch anything.Ending:  6\t          The ending is okay till the last 3 minutes of the ending, which outraged pretty much everyone, including myself. There is a reason, the publisher wouldn\'t let the author write the ending he wanted, which is in the link. Many say the real ending is in the Tsuzuku PSP game, look on YouTube and look for dizzy ziddy\'s play through. If you watch the play through of the last chapter(s) and read the interview, you should come away feeling okay about the ending, but not thrilled either.Interview with the author about the ending restrictions and what he tried to convey.

This is one of the funniest anime I have seen in a long time. There is also great fun poking at, commenting on anime, and the examining of Otaku culture. Also I remember feeling the tension once or twice thinking ""no way."" The comedy combined with developed characters and interesting relationships made it addicting to watch.Overall:  8\t         It would be nice to read some of the light novel first to get a little extra background for Kyousuke and for Ayase and Kanako, and see a softer Kirino not so tsun (hitting, angry, and denying), as in the light novels. Those and the ending are the main negatives to the anime. Overall the plot, characters, comedy, and relationships were great. I think I would maybe even re-watch some episodes for the laughs and Kuroneko, and I almost never re-watch anything.Ending:  6\t          The ending is okay till the last 3 minutes of the ending, which outraged pretty much everyone, including myself. There is a reason, the publisher wouldn\'t let the author write the ending he wanted, which is in the link. Many say the real ending is in the Tsuzuku PSP game, look on YouTube and look for dizzy ziddy\'s play through. If you watch the play through of the last chapter(s) and read the interview, you should come away feeling okay about the ending, but not thrilled either.Interview with the author about the ending restrictions and what he tried to convey. Link has SPOILERS!!!!http://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/4901/why-did-the-until-we-graduate-provision-enter-into-the-ending-of-oreimo', 'Otaku culture can be strange indeed, though of course, as is the case with everything, the extremists give otaku’s a bad name. Take for instance Kirino Kousaka, a middle school girl who is obsessed with erotic video gaming and a little girl anime that Ore no Imouto even admits is something guys seem to love for all the wrong reasons. Then again, that’s probably some sort of complex paradox because I’m sure some people who watch this classic tale of a brother and sister in trouble who build their relationship through their trials and tribulations aren’t paying attention to the story. They are more so...paying attention to the slutty girls who are being photographed by creepy men with pedo-staches. Either that or Kuroneko who is perhaps the greatest thing since pastrami on rye.Ore no Imouto replicates real life in some strange ways that I wish weren’t real, but the internet has shown otherwise. Kirino has a million erotic games hidden in her closet with a bunch of statues of Meruru, some generic magical girl.Kirino’s brother, Kyousuke Kousaka, finds out about her dirty hobby and decides he will help her hide it from her parents, who will probably disown her for owning explicit games. How does she get all this stuff? Well, she has a job as a model with her friends, a little feisty girl and a big feisty girl who aren’t important enough to care about. What really makes this weird is that Kirino has an obsession with little sister games. This makes for a lot of awkwardness between Kirino and Kyousuke that could be misconstrued as some sort of romance developing, which we all know is quite possible but we don’t want to happen. At least, I hope you’re not all for this brocon siscon stuff. It’s weird.Through Kyousuke’s help, Kirino meets some new friends, one of whom is Kuroneko, and together they do otaku stuff. Since Kirino has been hiding her fandom for so long, it gives her an outlet with which to show her love. And that’s pretty much the whole plot. With the exception of a later section dedicated to Kirino writing a light novel, there’s not a ton of plot or anything too memorable. But it is an entertaining plot nonetheless.The animation is pretty standard. It looks decent, but is nothing jaw dropping. Characters blush a lot and I don’t understand why Kirino’s hair is brown as a kid but orange-y as a teen. I mean, she could have dyed it or it could be the light, but it just struck me as odd.The sound is…meh. The voices are good. But otherwise, the opening is very basic and dull. Upbeat pop song? Sounds like a plan! I must commend the series for having a lot of ending themes. Now, this isn’t exactly a good thing. You can take twenty poops on the side of the road and they’ll all stink. And that’s kind of the same for the ending themes here. Quantity does not equal quality. Music during the show is generic piano compositions that are about six keys being played in some sort of order that sounds somewhat like dramatic music. You know why Mozart didn’t do music for anime? Because he had talent. And anime hadn’t been invented yet, but that’s beside the point.What’s there to say about the characters? A LOT! Kirino is a freaking fantastic little sister and I wish my little sister were like her! Instead I have to deal with my little sister complaining because Clannad is too mushy and Vampire Knight is the greatest anime ever made because it is like Twilight and Twilight is the greatest book ever written! Why can’t all girls be like Kirino? A model, a pervert, and an otaku? One of the funniest scenes is when she gets her body pillow of Meruru and starts rolling all over it. IT’S FUNNY BECAUSE SHE’S JUST LIKE US! SHE’S AN OTAKU! SHE LIKES BODY PILLOWS! HAHAHAHA! EXCEPT SHE’S CUTE AND ADORABLE AND POPULAR AND WE AREN’T!“Who’s this we and us?” You ask from atop the highest apartment in the neighborhood, preparing to throw a tomato at me as if I were Dane Cook doing a comedy routine.“SHUT UP!” I cry in an attempt at a retort that goes horribly south as your tomato sticks to my shirt. “I WANT TO FEEL INCLUDED!”Now back to this. Kyousuke is a pretty solid character. He’s fairly generic, “I want to help people” and “Go with the flow” and “TAKE A FREAKING KICK TO THE BALLS FROM YOUR SISTER AND DON’T GIVE THAT BITCH A BACKHAND!”. His niceness is actually pretty funny. At one point he gets punched in the face by his dad, some sort of cop who doesn’t approve of anime or erotic games. All Kyousuke does is protect his sister and what she loves and you kind of grow to like him for being so selfless, even when he doesn’t get much in return. Plus, his conversion into a erogamer is pretty funny.Another character of note is Kuroneko, who I bring up a lot because she’s just too damn adorable. She’s hilariously dark; the complete opposite of Kirino (which is, of course, a means for comedy gold occasionally) and I personally found her to be the best character. She cares about Kirino while simultaneously hating her guts, she’s a closet otaku who makes her own cosplays, and she’s also a sweet girl outside of being an otaku and pretty shy. While I loved Kirino and Kyousuke’s characters, I loved hers more.Otherwise, the characters aren’t that impressive. Kyousuke has this girl who likes him and is a childhood friend, but she’s flatter than Minami’s chest (Baka and Test reference!)(My English teacher always told me that comparing media was the highest level of thinking). Her grandpa, on the other hand, is the greatest grandpa ever. He just wants his granddaughter and Kyousuke to bang. And he hides under the table like all good grandpas and tells them to do it. If he had his own anime, I’d watch it.Ore no Imouto, in all seriousness, is not a bad anime. It’s a look at Japanese otaku culture (which is so impressive, I wish I could go to Japan through a portal and buy all that anime stuff) and also a decent character building adventure. The brother and sister thing does become kind of creepy at points, but a lot of the time it is pretty heartwarming and cheerful. You root on the characters and you grow to like them, not only for their subtle love for each other or because you can make parallels between themselves and you, but because you really want to see them do what’s best for themselves. They’re not totally realistic and barely take a life of their own, but the characters are still fun to be around. They’re like friends you want to hang out with all the time. paying attention to the slutty girls who are being photographed by creepy men with pedo-staches.

The OVA\'s that are frequently tacked onto this season are often found labled as ""Episodes 14, 15, and 16"", but they are just not. The season ended solidly on its own, but it didn\'t include the One-dimensional ending that the Light Novel had. So they decided to tack the novel ending on with these OVAs. The original Author wanted a Full-Incest relationship between...Kirino and Kyousuke, but the publishers made him tone it down because the fear of societal backlash hence they don\'t specifically do anything in the series.You can thoroughly enjoy the Series up until these OVAs and leave happy and satisfied.Once you start the OVAs, you will ""leave the theatre"" so to speak, wanting your money back like a large portion of the internet who has universally called them ""One of the worst endings in anime history"". Long story short, he tells all of the girls except the one he likes that like him that he is not interested. Their reactions vary from mouth-foaming rage to utter acceptance as they already saw it coming and only through their emotions in there to see what would happen. The girl he likes is at first emotionally reluctant, but ultimately realizes her true feelings agrees to be with him.Then within an hour later ""In-Anime-Time"" they apparently decide that they should already give up on their relationship because it\'s simply not ""accepted"" in their society, throwing away all their feelings towards another, but stay together for a short time(1/2 year) so they can forge good memories. They admit they enjoyed it greatly and did not regret it, but that is why they must end it.The OVAs are such a bad ending because the main character Kyousuke is left with nothing but his Otaku-Eroge-Sister-complex sister, Kirino. Then it suddenly ends with him gaining absolutely nothing over the Original Ending of the anime, and leaving him with virtually nothing other than his sister and a loose set of now-poor friendships that could falter at a firm breeze because of the previously mentioned ""Telling everyone but his love interest that he\'s not interested"" moments.Art and Sound: Both are at acceptable levels, unlike Higurashi which decided that their funding should go towards cocaine and cocaine accessories.Characters 8/10: Character development was strong and well done for a series with only 11 and 13 episodes in their season not counting OVAs. The OVA\'s if anything reversed development and decided to make things worse than before they started for unapparent reasons.Enjoyment 8/10: It was thoroughly enjoying watching the second season right up until the end as it tried to explore different options and feelings between the characters.That is, up until the OVAs that do-away with virtually all the characters but the main character and his love interest of which he notifies all the other possible interests he is not interested beforehand. Which means he thoroughly burned all his bridges before moving forward, leaving no room for error. And guess what, there\'s an error. They may be repairable bridges though, but nowhere near as sturdy.Overall Enjoyment 8/10: The series up until the end of the second season is thoroughly satisfying to watch. I stayed up for 16+ hours running a marathon of it and was unanimously happy that I decided to watch it. Then I saw the OVAs latched on to season 2 to serve as a more ""concise"" ending rather than leaving the viewer in their happy bliss. Needless to say as mentioned above, I literally couldn\'t sleep after staying up all night to watch the entire series including the OVAs. They were that bad it left me sleeplessly wondering ""Why did they go and ruin this amazing ending with this sheer level of poor writing that needlessly went further than it should have"".

Terribly mistaken in fact.Story: 5I didn\'t have high hopes before watching this series. However, the first three episodes made me think that maybe this anime could turn the ""little sister"" anime trope on it\'s head. Would it portray a interesting and meaningful story about two siblings who don\'t see eye to eye? That\'s what I thought. Needless to say, it went downhill...While the first three episodes were very good, like 8/10 good, they still kept a few of...the cliches that this kind of genre often has. That should\'ve have signaled what was to come. After the first three episodes, the show eventually stopped trying. It became less about a brother trying to help his little sister while still trying to consider her point of view into a big brother doing literally anything his sister asks. What makes it even worse? The ending throws all of it out of the window. Any remaining hope must have taken a flight to a foreign land and never returned. Literally.All in all, the story could have ended after the first three episodes, and I would have enjoyed it a fair amount.Art: 6As this series came out in 2010, it resembles a 2000\'s anime much more than a more recent series. Nevertheless, it\'s bland and lacks creativity. All of the characters look stiff and literally every female character has a blush. Always. Literally.Sound: 5Once again, bland. The opening and ending didn\'t stick with me. Normally, I\'ll watch the opening to a series for every episode, but if I did that with this one, I\'d feel like I was wasting my time. Same thing for the ending.Character: 3As much as I\'d like to rant about this, I\'ll keep it short.Kirino - For the first half of the series, she was tolerable. After that, however, she became ridiculous. I get what the creator was going for, but there\'s a difference between ""little sister who\'s ungrateful and needy"" and ""tsundere"". In this case, both were thrown together and it was called a day.Kyousuke - The only ""good"" thing about this series. At the very least, he\'s somewhat funny and is easy to sympathize with due to the absurd things he\'s put through. Even if you don\'t like his character, he is involved in a few funny gags.Kirino\'s two friends are mostly harmless. Her modeling friend is decent, albeit one-note. Manami is easily the worst. She serves little to no purpose, is even more irritating than the little sister, and is only used when the show has to fill time.In conclusion, the characters completely deplete this show of any chance at redeeming itself.Enjoyment: 5Like I said, I really liked the first few episodes. After that, I only watched it since I was trying to fill my ""completed"" section on my anime list. Otherwise, I would have dropped it. To be fair, every episode probably has one or maybe two funny gags, but that\'s pushing it. The show also attempts fan service, but fails every single time.Overall: 5In order to like this series, you have to be of a rare kind. To bother watching it in the first place, you have to be desperate. At best, it\'s a distraction. I\'d say that you could watch the first three episodes, leave, and be satisfied.

I hated it at first, I thought Kirino was a brat, Kyousuke being a weird obsessive sister freak, and I viewed the otaku culture around it as unpleasant. The only characters I liked were the main MC\'s friends (Ruri, Kanako, Manami, etc etc) but even that wouldn\'t...convince me to change my mind.It was a weird otaku incest bait for me, and I had that thought for a few years. That was not until I decided to give Oreimo a rewatch this year.I don\'t know what prompted me, I guess It was just a simple ""Rewatch it since you haven\'t seen it in a while"" kind of mentality.So, I rewatched it,And I didn\'t just love it, I ADORED IT!Screw what I thought about it when a young lad, this anime was extremely eye-opening for me! Before I didn\'t understand Kirino\'s struggles with having a niche hobby, I just thought she was exaggerating about how society would treat her as a disgusting pervert. now, as I type with a full manga & figure collection right beside my bed, I slowly start to relate.People view the Weeb culture as a weird group of individuals, which becomes more prominent when Kirino almost loses her best friend after discovering her weird fantasy of being a sis-con.

Sure it\'s weird to most eyes, but that\'s the point.Kirino knows her hobby isn\'t considered ""normal"" by an outsider, and yet she doesn\'t care.

Oh, the incest? Ya I find that based lol', ""the story for this anime is ok but nothing special and the music is also ok but the only thing wrong for this series is the characters specifically the 2 main ones.first you have the main male protagonist Kyousuke who sticks up for his sister constantly. There is nothing wrong about this, but you sometimes have to question his motives and why he is doing this for his sister. Also sometimes he is just always a downer and is never positive witch gets anoying because he's constantly bitching.the other character that i have wrong is Kirino who is a little bitch and never gives thanks...to his brother and always thinks down on him. She also gets anoying sometimes because she is such a horrible character.overall i give this anime a 6/10 because it is a little above average and would be better if the characters weren't bad. to his brother and always thinks down on him.

Sorry for being so vague but I must avoid spoilers, after all. I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I did!The story itself for this anime is great. The protagonist and his tsundere-like little sister have a relationship that makes the viewers love them both and at other times feel so sorry for the MC for how...he some times gets treated. I myself couldn't help myself at certain scenes of romance from tearing up and sobbing from how great the delivery was.The ART work as well was quite special as each character really had their own unique kind of appearance. That goes for almost any anime, but this one in particular was really enjoyable to watch, as each character's facial expression and animation was truly pleasant at almost all times.Along with the Story, the SOUND is what I'll remember the most in this anime. The voice acting is great of course, but what really had me was the music. Occasionally, the sad themed music would play and it was so well timed that it's as if that music became a trigger for the watter works! And when the MC would be with various girls, of course including his sister, very happy, fun music will play that I absolutely loved listnening to. Whoever produced the sound for this anime, if they're not widely recognised already I definitely think they should be!!As far as characters go, I think I've said enough about that so far. However, one thing I need to point out is that I watched Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sakunai BEFORE watching this. And that anime left me with a void that I could NOT fill at all. However, Ore no Imouto filled that void with its loveable storyline, music and characters. It was also great to find similar characters, which I'm sure you'll see what I mean once you've watched both series!If you've read this whole review, I thank you very much! I rarely write reviews on MyAnimeList because it takes a fair bit of time due to MAL's post length demands. But... OreImo is worth writing a review for and I'm probably gonna rewatch it! he some times gets treated.

I shall not say too much, but they\'re blood related.Now, back to the review.-This, honestly, is my favorite anime besides ""Toradora!""The characters, of course, are the normal generic tsundere, derederes and kuuderes. Let me enlighten you, however. As the story progresses, you\'ll see that the protagonist thinks like an actual human being in certain situations. (Looking at you, *Subaru.)Base of the story, Kyousuke and his sister, Kirino never got along. *Sound familiar?Kyousuke was minding his own business when he eyed an anime CD case on the ground.He held onto it until...he could find out who owned it, only to find out his sister, Kirino, not only owned that, but a whole secret closetof nothing but otaku goods. The otaku goods were all related to little sisters. They\'ve kept it a secret because their parents hate otakus.Story wise, I love it. Like I said, I don\'t wanna spoil anything. It\'s more feel good than it is serious.If you\'re looking for serious story, you\'ve come to the wrong anime.Art wise, okay. Surprisingly simplistic. Extremely simplistic.

You get to see how Kirino slowly opens up to being a otaku and how she meets new friends. The anime really does well on introducing new characters. I absolutely love tsundere characters and Kirino is a perfect tsundere its so cute i absolutely love her since the beginning of the anime! "", ""I had heard about this anime everywhere on the Internet, and finally got around to watching it. Now this review won't revolve around the second season, that is for another day. This is mainly for the first season.Oreimo is a 2010 anime that aired from October 3rd to December 19th. It's based on the light novel series by Tsukasa Fushimi and has twelve episodes for this season. It's from the studio AIC Build and is romantic-comedy/harem.It revolves around Kyosuke Kosaka, a normal 17-year-old high school student living in Chiba and has not gotten along with his younger sister Kirino in years. It seemed as...if the relationship between Kyōsuke and his sister, now fourteen, would continue this way forever. One day however, Kyosuke finds a DVD case of a magical girl anime which had fallen in his house's entrance way. To Kyosuke's surprise, he finds a hidden eroge inside the case and he soon learns that both the DVD and the game belong to Kirino. That night, Kirino brings Kyosuke to her room and reveals herself to be an otaku with an extensive collection of moe anime and younger sister-themed eroge she has been collecting in secret.The storyline I thought was very interesting. It revolved around Kirino and Kyosuke's relationship as brother and sister while seeing the everyday life of Kirino's otaku side. It was a different type of romantic-comedy/harem and I got a few good laughs out of it.There were some characters I didn't like, like Kyosuke for he was just pretty bland to me. Kirino was very annoying at times but other times she made me laugh, and I thought she was a pretty good main character. The one character I truly liked out of this was Kuroneko/Ruri. She was most defiantly my favourite character and possibly one of my favourite female anime characters of all time. She was entertaining to watch, for when we met her she came off as this gothic otaku who didn't really talk much to this girl that was adorable in every single way possible. Saori was another good character, for the episode about her backstory didn't leave me feeling bored.The animation was your average anime style but sometimes there were ways the camera was angled that caught my attention. How it showed Kirino the first time in the series, along with the last. It was most definalty beautiful animation in of itself.The sound was nice to hear. The opening theme was catchy and I thought that ClariS was the perfect ones for the job. The song was upbeat and got you ready for what was in this show. The voice actors did an amazing job portraying their characters, most definalty Ayana Taketatsu as Kirino, Hitomi Nabatame as Saori and Saori Hayami as Ayase, Kirino's best friend.Overall Oreimo was really fun to watch. I had lots of laughs and lots of surprised moments, for the show did take serious turns once in a while, which I was shocked about. I recommend it, at least the first season, to anyone who's interested.I rate Oreimo 8/10 and give it 4/5 stars. if the relationship between Kyōsuke and his sister, now fourteen, would continue this way forever.

Their gradual transition from pretty much hating each other to , still hating each other but in a cute way is the entirety of the story. The characters, setting and even the activities are just a vehicle for the Brother/Sister interactions.That is all...there is to the story, however this is not an anime that relies on story for engagement and I will elaborate in the next point.CHARACTERS:This is where both, the best part of the series and the worst part of the series comes into play. I am going to make a strange comparison but please bare with me I am going somewhere with this;There is an anime called Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) and it is one of the most clichéd, stock-character, stock-plot, stock-action anime I have ever seen. It rips off from other media wholesale (Ex: A survival tournament held by an inscrutable entity, engaged by slightly superpowered characters face off to the death until there can be only one  , in order to get a prize... sound familiar? it\'s highlander, though lots of media rips off highlander (COUGH Rozen Maiden COUGH)) and the action is very plodding, many of the action scenes are perfunctory at best (Ex: Wolf ""fight"" is a prime example of a lame action scene with almost zero suspense involved).Almost all of the cast is completely forgettable given how terribly underdeveloped they are, they have poor interactions at the best of times and what little they have consistents of simple anime stereotypes (Hey, here\'s the jock character saying something Jock-esque, here\'s the Tsundere character saying something Tsundere ish, here is the older badass businessman pulling strings, etc.). The main character is unforgivably stupid and poorly written (Goes from a complete pansy to gunning down people in almost no time flat). But, the plot and almost all of the lacklusters characters were bolstered greatly by a single uniting thread; Gasai Yuno.Gasai Yuno is the original \'Queen of Yandere\' , her presence, her actions and her backstory (Mystery) form the only unique and engaging thread in the entire anime. She singlehandedly makes this anime go from pure trash to , pure trash thats entertaining. But is a single character enough to make it a good anime? in my opinion, no.And this is where the parallel begins;In Oreimo; The main character Kyousuke is actually pretty well written (For the most part), the supporting cast is extremely well written as well, with surprisingly complex motivations and development... especially for this genre, making them both deep and  endearing (In my opinion). The setting is mundane but belies the reality of societal pressures and isolation of Japan, again, in my opinion it does this very well, showing the difficulty that the Japanese have when it comes to relating to each other.If I had to grade only the main character and the supporting cast (Goth loli, crazy otaku girl, insecure model type, hilariously inappropriate grandparents, etc.) I would not hesitate to give this a 9 or maybe even a 10, but it has the REVERSE problem that Mirai Nikki had. One single character drags down the entire show... Kirino, the Imouto, is one of the worst characters, I have ever seen in any media. She absolutely anchors any scene she\'s in with her ultra tsun-tsun behavior and just completely intolerable, unjustified hostility.Her character is nearly a black hole of entertainment. Where a little bit (Or even a lot) of tsun tsun (Cold, aggressive, hostile behavior) for a tsundere character is acceptable, this character goes so far beyond tsun tsun that she\'s just completely unreasonable and for me, draws away from the rest of the excellent cast. She is not tsundere, she\'s just a psychotic teenage girl with a major princess complex.She becomes violent very quickly and unjustifiably so.She treats her friends and family like trashShe acts very entitled to everyone\'s attention and even worship.The worst part about this is, she gradually infects the other characters to tolerate and even worship her abuse. This is not endearing, this is not charming, this is disappointing because she actively sucks the ""good"" out of the rest of the cast.But as I said, everything else, literally everything else worked wonderfully, in my opinion. One of my favorite episodes was an episode where the main character stays away from the Kirino Imouto and it was the best written, funniest and balanced episode, with touches of romance, slap-stick and situational comedy. It worked really well which is tremendously disappointing because it showed what could have been.I know that I did not talk about the Art or the Sound, but that is because the female lead Kirino completely eclipses almost every other aspect of the show. Again, it is the reverse effect of Gasai Yuno; Gasai Yuno carried Mirai Nikki from bad to mediocre. Kousaka Kirino anchors Oreimo down from excellent to average at best. I can honestly say, I have never wanted to love an anime more than this one, but the cancer that is Kirino made it impossible for me to enjoy it on any level beyond ""I can tolerate this"".I find very little to recommend here;If you like romance, this is not for you.If you like ecchi, this is not for you, despite the subject matter (You\'ll know what I mean) there is actually very little real ecchi here. There are doses here and there but few and far between.If you like comedy... what can I tell you, I found the supporting cast funny but Kirino scenes overshadow the fantastic supporting cast.That is all. there is to the story, however this is not an anime that relies on story for engagement and I will elaborate in the next point.CHARACTERS:This is where both, the best part of the series and the worst part of the series comes into play.

As an older sibling to a younger sister, it was incredibly awkward for me personally to ""get over"" the vibes and sexual tension between the brother and his sister, though the show makes you want to believe it doesn\'t exist, but it does. I could go on a rant about this, but for sake of tolerance and overall enjoyment, I will leave this part of my opinion out of my review besides the fact that it was generally odd for me. Now that\'s done and finished, Oreimo was...great. I loved the gamer role that Kirino played as not only a gamer but Otaku. Its funny how easily I relate to this fear she has of her being ""found out"" for liking Eroge, and something that I can empathize with a lot, being almost identical in personality to her when I was younger. In fact, Kirino is my favorite part of the show, though she has some of the least desirable character traits ever (whiny, easily aggravated and prideful) yet she still was fun to watch and understand. Kyosuke was a bit more interesting, but not in such a bad way. He assists Kirino in her way of making it into a Otaku group of friends, and helps her along as a person. But again, he gives that odd incest esc vibe on occasion that makes that whole respect and understanding just die off (for me anyhow). All in all, a great watch for what I would think is the broad majority of Otaku, gamers and uneasy Otaku. Though be warned, ""incestual"" vibes run all around, and make some uncomfortable, but i\'m sure it won\'t faze a lot of you, and I may just be part of a minority. great.

Nowadays, I wouldn\'t be able to stomach this show, but back when I was a dumb 16 year old, I did.Oreimo also has strong themes that the show likes to dip into occasionally, like a cheese dip made of good writing. It does have some strong emotional moments, with these scenes that I actually enjoyed.... as long as you ignore all the incest. Especially the scenes where everybody thinks HIS 14 YEAR OLD SISTER is his girlfriend.One of the most interesting episodes I thought was when Little Sister-Chan wrote a Light Novel and it was published, making Gothic Best Girl (Ruri Gokou) jealous. It\'s kinda strange how Gothic Best Girl struggled for years to make it, but as soon as Little Sister-Chan writes a book, it becomes popular enough to get a fucking anime.I don\'t remember if the anime explains this.A the end, we finally get to see more of Gothic Best Girl\'s homelife, and really, all I wanted at that point was for Likeable Character-San just to marry one of the other girls, and not his fucking sister.Speaking of characters, Little Sister-Chan is a fucking bitch.You may or may not agree, but holy shit, she beats her older brother, she whines and complains all the fucking time, she contently makes Likeable Character-San to do embarrassing shit, and she put his porn out on his bed and on his computer for Deredere Childhood Friend-Chan (Manami Tamura) to see out of pure spite.Really, I just wish we could have seen more of the other characters instead of Little Sister-Chan. Like I wanted to know more about Deredere Childhood Friend-Chan and Tsundere Loli Number 652 (Kanako Kurusu).Personally, I felt like the two\'s personalities and backstories needed to be more explored in this,  I\'m hoping when I get around to the second season (??? That\'s real..??) makes this possible, and we don\'t just focus on Little Sister-Chan, instead getting to know who Tsundere Loli Number 652 is. Who is she? Where did she come from? Who\'s her family, are they a piece of shit?One thing I did really enjoy about this anime was both the animation in some shots, and Tsundere Loli Number 652 having the same voice actress as Pink Haired Magical Girl Number 19,345. The fact the character development between Little Sister-Chan and Likeable Character-San was really fun in a lot of scenes (when they weren\'t doing disgusting bullshit).Like I love seeing them talk about things Little Sister-Chan likes, when Likeable Character-San is playing her Ecchi games she recommended, or the scene where Little Sister-Chan is playing the Tsundere route of a Little Sister game, and is so happy finding Tsundere Loli Number 764\'s soft dere shell, she starts rolling all over the ground.I would rather see Little Sister-Chan go along her everyday life, loving Otaku shit with her big brother out there to protect her, than him falling on her tiddie and her going ""Oh no, Onii-Sama!! >////<"" or some shit like that.TL;DR: I think it\'s an eh show. Like it\'s got its problems, and those problems really ruined the experience. If you can\'t ignore disgusting bullshit, don\'t watch it.Also, this anime desperately makes me want to read something, where someone examines the character of someone like Little Sister-Chan, where a little sister plays ecchi games and is a massive Otaku. that she beats him up and then headbutts him, leaving him bleeding.I went into this looking for cringe with a friend of mine, knowing this was a disgusting show where a guy marries his sister. Nowadays, I wouldn\'t be able to stomach this show, but back when I was a dumb 16 year old, I did.Oreimo also has strong themes that the show likes to dip into occasionally, like a cheese dip made of good writing. It does have some strong emotional moments, with these scenes that I actually enjoyed.... as long as you ignore all the incest. Especially the scenes where everybody thinks HIS 14 YEAR OLD SISTER is his girlfriend.One of the most interesting episodes I thought was when Little Sister-Chan wrote a Light Novel and it was published, making Gothic Best Girl (Ruri Gokou) jealous. It\'s kinda strange how Gothic Best Girl struggled for years to make it, but as soon as Little Sister-Chan writes a book, it becomes popular enough to get a fucking anime.I don\'t remember if the anime explains this.A the end, we finally get to see more of Gothic Best Girl\'s homelife, and really, all I wanted at that point was for Likeable Character-San just to marry one of the other girls, and not his fucking sister.Speaking of characters, Little Sister-Chan is a fucking bitch.You may or may not agree, but holy shit, she beats her older brother, she whines and complains all the fucking time, she contently makes Likeable Character-San to do embarrassing shit, and she put his porn out on his bed and on his computer for Deredere Childhood Friend-Chan (Manami Tamura) to see out of pure spite.Really, I just wish we could have seen more of the other characters instead of Little Sister-Chan. Like I wanted to know more about Deredere Childhood Friend-Chan and Tsundere Loli Number 652 (Kanako Kurusu).Personally, I felt like the two\'s personalities and backstories needed to be more explored in this,  I\'m hoping when I get around to the second season (??? That\'s real..??) makes this possible, and we don\'t just focus on Little Sister-Chan, instead getting to know who Tsundere Loli Number 652 is. Who is she? Where did she come from? Who\'s her family, are they a piece of shit?One thing I did really enjoy about this anime was both the animation in some shots, and Tsundere Loli Number 652 having the same voice actress as Pink Haired Magical Girl Number 19,345.

Thankfully, it isn\'t, but I almost wonder if the creators themselves tried too hard to avoid that.Oreimo\'s opening episode starts out the series with promise. We start by seeing that Kyousuke and his little sister Kirino, aren\'t in the best of sibling relationships. Kyousuke is annoyed at the way Kirino ignores him and is nasty to him. It\'s clear he wants to be on better terms with her. The...door to that is opened too, when Kirino confesses her secret hobby to him: she\'s obsessed with Meruru and, in particular, the little sister eroge games from it. Oreimo handles this well, as such a thing could easily serve as the preface to a hentai scene. Instead, we see only some very subtle and slight sexual tension. Because we don\'t see Kirino\'s thoughts, and only brief bits of Kyousuke\'s, it\'s unclear if either is actually attracted to the other. This simply lurks underneath the bigger focus of the episode: Kirino\'s shame in her hobby, Kyousuke\'s acceptance of it, and the ensuing bond that comes from it. At the end, Kirino tells Kyousuke to play one of the games, and there\'s even a rather funny bit where he begins.So it sounds promising right? Based on this pilot I fully expected Oreimo to tackle the brother-sister dynamic in an interesting way. It looked like Kyousuke was going to join into Kirino\'s hobby out of a desire to get closer to his sister, but that maybe some sexual tension would lead to huge problems.But nope, nope, nope. Instead Kyousuke just kind of plays the game a few times without any consequence. He finds Kirino other otaku friends to help her out, and I\'m honestly not sure what they contribute to the plot. Granted, they both work somewhat as characters, but for the most part they hardly even interact with Kirino and do little to nothing to develop her character.Oreimo is one of many animes that also seems to believe in doing soft resets at the beginning of each episode. Conflicts introduced in one episode very rarely are addressed in later episodes, either because they have already been ""solved"" in a rushed fashion, or because the show apparently just forgot about them. This further compounds Oreimo\'s central weakness: IT DOESN\'T MOVE ANYWHERE. Basically every episode is just a weekly example of how Kyousuke can help out his little sister. The only exception is a hodge-podge addition where he hangs out at a childhood friend\'s house, which is honestly worse as there is no clear reason why it\'s important to see. In the end the result is largely the stale story of a white knight male helping out a tsundere female, with the only notable distinguishing feature being that it\'s brother and sister.The incestous aspect of this show could have made it interesting, but that wasn\'t the case. Occasionally the show attempts to use it for slight of hand tricks, but in such cases it\'s always executed poorly. For the most part, it\'s just a running joke that doesn\'t lead to any actual consequences for the characters, which leads into another point I\'d like to make: Oreimo pretty much sucks at making good on the conflicts it teases. For example, in the very first episode Kyousuke finds the little sister eroge DVD and suddenly realizes, ""This is the one thing I really shouldn\'t own!"" and expresses fear for what would happen if his parents found out. Later, his dad finds out and doesn\'t give a shit, nor does anyone else who discovers this ""hobby"".Furthermore, a frequent annoyance I had was how often the characters didn\'t behave honestly as human beings. Kyousuke\'s confrontation of his father was simply a bizarre interaction. Very often it felt that people simply behaved in dishonest ways to move the story how the creators wanted it to be moved.The only thing more dishonest than the characters are the creators of this show. It sets viewers up with the expectation that it\'ll largely be about a brother-sister relationship, with the eroge/anime simply being a catalyst of sorts. Instead, it spends most of its time being an apologist for otaku culture. I don\'t hate otaku\'s or anything, but it\'s disappointing that Oreimo more or less just tries to shout at us to accept them. The point could\'ve been brought across in a much better way. Furthermore, they spend way too much time on it. As a result the show basically ends up being about Kirino\'s hobby and Kyousuke finding ways to help her with it, which trust me, somehow manages to be even more bland than it sounds.Perhaps I should move on to the positive things about this show. It is beautifully animated. The visual aspects of it look very good, there\'s some cool variation in what we see in it\'s OP, even. It\'s no masterpiece; there are many times when little sets it apart from a typical slice of life anime. But it\'s mostly very, very good.Additionally, for all its flaws, Oreimo manages to be a mildly sweet story about how a brother comes to love his little sister (no, not that way). The final episode is well-done and does leave the viewer with some sense of feeling and closure. It\'s just that such feelings would have resonated much more strongly if their delivery mechanism hadn\'t been so predominantly generic.Overall, I\'d probably be lying if I said I\'m not going to check out Season 2. Why? Because Oreimo does have potential. That much was clear to me. It just committed a slew of errors in execution that couldn\'t be ignored. I\'m going to be optimistic and hope that things were better strung together in S2. I\'ll probably be wrong but that\'s fine I guess. door to that is opened too, when Kirino confesses her secret hobby to him: she\'s obsessed with Meruru and, in particular, the little sister eroge games from it.

Anyways this one is interesting enough, but is missing some really important elements.The story is very simple, it's about a guy who's in high school who has a sister who's in middle school. The sister excels in almost everything and has a really strange addiction with anime and more specifically, eroge. The sister is blatantly a Tsundere.Art and Sound are both great, and the op is pretty good.Since I basically already went over the characters and the story, it's very...few and far between now.

Just... don\'t.I was worried that, as i know where everything is going, that I would have trouble simply enjoying this first season. Well, I didn\'t. It delivers everything it did the first time, and so, if you have...a moment to waste, here are my full and honest impressions.In this first season, we are told the story of how Kyousuke, a peace loving, easygoing 17 year old, renews bonds with his sister, although no reason is ever given as to why those bonds were missing in the first place. The twist is, his sister, Kirino, star pupil, part time model, Track star-athlete, popular at school, and apparently perfect in every way, is a huge Otaku.For those who don\'t know, an otaku is what people who are into anime are called in Japan. But when I say ""into"", I don\'t mean they follow a show they like, or read manga here and there. i mean they practically dedicate all of their free time to anime, manga, graphic novels, galge, eroge, anything like that to an absolutely destructive excess. They are often considered disgusting by their fellow members of society.So obviously, Kyousuke is taken completely by surprise when he learns of his sister\'s secret. But he decides to float with it, and he provides her with support through various situations and difficulties that the young Kirino goes through.Although i will say that there is very little feeling of progression throughout the series, this is a fun show. As I said, it\'s light-hearted and easy going. Plenty of laughs to be found here, and some endearing moments too. That\'s what makes any romcom a romcom anyway, right? Although, I guess the ""Rom"" side doesn\'t appear much till later, there are already some underlying tones of possible romance, especially between the Kyousuke and his childhood friend.The show works, even though little happens, there is ambient development in the characters relationships, and not just between the two siblings. Kirino makes other Otaku friends, and the way each person in this show interacts with each other has a natural ""meant to be"" kind of feeling. Although sometimes, a character (one in particular) will kind of *click and go slightly out of their role for a moment, these events often help show the viewer that maybe not everything is as it seems in this world that is clearly just getting ready for the main act.Yes, the fact of the matter is this: Season one feels like little more than a set up for the next one, and that\'s normal, since that\'s exactly what it is. The characters are being set up, we\'re learning to like these people and understand how they work. Which is why the final episode kind of drops out of nowhere, since it branches away from the original story to put things under wraps.Which is why the ""True arc ending"" exists.I\'m not sure what they were thinking, but apparently this show was far more successful than the creators had first anticipated, so they needed some way to bring the whole thing back to be able to make a second season without looking foolish. The last episode is underwhelming, and if by the end you\'re thinking, ""well, that was fun, but nothing really happened"" you better get your ass in gear for the true arc ending and the second season, since that\'s where everything is gonna happen, and it\'s gonna be damn awesome!Quick mention for the opening song, which I think is damn fucking catchy. That\'s it.Also, when i first watched it, I knew nothing about the whole ""otaku"" culture that exists in japan, and if this show does one thing, it\'s give a good insight into what that otaku culture is. Although I\'m sure it hardly even scratched the surface of the whole thing, it still taught me exactly how anime is seen by most Japanese people.So, in conclusion, this isn\'t a bad show in any way. It\'s a fun and enjoyable story, which in the end deserved a better ending than what it got, and got it in the end anyway. a moment to waste, here are my full and honest impressions.In this first season, we are told the story of how Kyousuke, a peace loving, easygoing 17 year old, renews bonds with his sister, although no reason is ever given as to why those bonds were missing in the first place.

These episodes have a slightly more ""not-safe for airing"" dialogue one which again almost caused my death and introduce a number of new characters including Akagi\'s sister causing some amazing moments to this extension of such a great show. I feel the extension episodes may have been better that the aired ones but I should take into account they built up on the events of those previous ones.Apart from the show almost killing me....twice, It feels like they poured the last of their budget into the Bluray.

"", ""I have heard of this anime and took a little bit of time for me to watch. I watched the whole series on Crunchyroll. The anime is about a little sister who is one of the popular girls in school while at home she's an anime fan(otaku) with an obsession with eroge. To my knowledge extent an eroge is like a dating sim game about tabuu relationships like brother x sister, and teacher x student.  Well back to the story the little sister needs to learn to deal with telling her family and friends about her hobby and making new friends with her same...hobby. Also her big brother who she has a strained relationship starts to bond with her as he helps her deal with her troubles. This anime is funny at certain points and can be dramatic when it needs too. Personally i find the main character Kirino(the little sister) a brat. She is very mean to her brother even if he's being nice. I personally like the side characters more then Kirino and her brother. I know some people will like Kirino with her tsundere attitude, but i find it annoying (its not a cute tsundere because she can be very mean only to him and one of her new anime friends. The anime is short and didn't take too long to finish. I found the brother (forgot his name sorry) interacting with the side characters more interesting the Kirino interacting with anyone.

I'm ok with the anime it's just one of my favorites ."", 'I\'ll be honest; I enjoyed watching this anime. It certainly was outside my expectations. It was generally cute, humorous, and relate-able to some extent (myself being an older brother). However, the anime was obviously made for the demographic of people who play H-games, particularly little sister ones. Myself not being one of them, I couldn\'t help but feel uncomfortable whenever the topic came up in the anime, which was all the time. It was like ""I don\'t get off to this stuff, but I know somebody else out there does, and that freaks me out"". But I digress.The art is good. I find it adorable...when female characters are drawn with the single fang, and it looks great on Kirino. The other female characters were good eye candy as well. The main character is the standard harem male character, reminding me greatly of Okazaki Tomoya or Maebara Keiichi. The sound was good, with a great opening song and a different ending song every episode. Some BGM was excellent, being reminiscent of BGM from Suzumiya Haruhi.The characters were all quite good. Kirino, outside of her hobby, which I really doubt actually exists (a little sister who digs little sister hentai? You wish Japan) is quite like a little sister, much more than the standard little sisters in anime. Kuroneko, Ayame, and the rest are all good \'real\' girls. Some characters take questionable actions during the course of the anime, but I haven\'t a need to complain as plenty of plot elements are questionable in this anime.The plot was probably the weakest element of the anime. I for one, am not a fan of anime that focuses on the lives of people who are fans of anime. Stuff like Nogisaka Haruka no Himitsu bores me to death. This had something extra that was different though. It was more about just the brother/sister relationship. Though estranged here, it still focuses just on that, which I enjoyed.Though I disliked the first four-five episodes or so, the later episodes were all generally humorous and enjoyable. I don\'t think I would recommend it, however, unless you fit within that demographic I mentioned earlier, and if thats the case, you\'ve probably already seen this anime by now. when female characters are drawn with the single fang, and it looks great on Kirino.

It is unique, but quite typical at the same time, which makes it somewhat unique, right? Well the story revolves around Kyousuke and his tsundere, all tsun (urban dictionary tsundere if you don't know it), and barely any dere younger sister, Kirino. Kyousuke has had a rough relationship with his sister for the longest, until he finds her little dirty secret of being an otaku. Now he has to give her life counselling, sounds somewhat normal, right? Well it really isn't, the sister is a major, major, major otaku (crazy about anime and games) and for some...odd and illogical reason likes little sisters......Story (7):The summary will suffice and it's nice seeing how Kirino's obsession and hobby develops and the brother and sister relationship changes throughout the series, but be warned it's still an anime. So expect awkward moments and impossible situations to occur (bro-con, sis-con, etc.). The most interesting part of the plot is seeing how the main characters develop, especially Kirino, but I'm not going to spoil anything.Art (7):Very nice, the animation is quite smooth and the characters don't look awkward or anything. They actually look quite nice and help depict the characters personalities quite well. An example would by Kyousuke himself, looking at him and you can easily get an easy-going and plain vibe from him. Another would be his own sister Kirino, look at her and you get the feeling that you're looking at a princess (take it however you like, this is not a compliment in my opinion).Sound (8):It's actually quite nice, the OP is quite nice depending on your taste in music. It's typical and catchy J-pop kind of feel, I personally did not love it, but I admit it was catchy. The ED was changed every few episodes to highlight the main topic of the episode or arc, it was an interesting change of pace and everyone will have a favourite, as the EDs range from J-pop, soft, and J-rock. Voice acting is quite nice, it fits each character quite well as none of them feel out of place (VA of Kyousuke, voiced Tomoya from Clannad).Character (9):Characters are by far the best of the entire show, they're all so unique. Ranging from the easy-going and nice-guy Kyousuke to the eccentric and hilarious Saori. The conversations between all the characters are always quite hilarious, from sarcastic comments and immature banter, loving remarks, and kinds works between each other.In conclusion, I didn't enjoy the serious as much as I have some others, but I saw high value in it. It's an enjoyable show, but it's filled with awkward, eccentric anime moments. Believe me the portrayal of otaku in this show can be taken as hilarious, insulting, or just plain embarrassing.Enjoyment: 6Overall: 7 odd and illogical reason likes little sisters......Story (7):The summary will suffice and it's nice seeing how Kirino's obsession and hobby develops and the brother and sister relationship changes throughout the series, but be warned it's still an anime.

All of these are my own beliefs and I do not expect anyone to completely agree with them or agree with them at all. But as a person who have watched almost all genre of anime, and countless number of shows (I do not really feel like adding all to my profile), I believe my opinion may help someone who has trouble deciding ""Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga nai!"" is worth their time or not.Enjoyment:Unlike other reviews, I will tell you this. I predict that 90% of the...viewers will enjoy the show and never no why. There is not much in the show, but it manages to hook its viewers with its mysterious aura. It presents itself as another generic anime with  small twists. That\'s it. Nothing out of the ordinary. Some twists are even predictable. And yet every time I ask have you enjoyed the show, they reply with a solid yes.Story / Various aspects of the story:Story is nothing spectacular. Small stories that lead to a predictable ending is all i can really say. The basis of the show however, talks a lot about the anime culture and can be relate-able to viewers. It is nice to see another anime that talks about why criticism against people with different hobbies is wrong. This particular message was nice but the other message wasn\'t. I wouldn\'t say it was necessarily promoting incest, but it was indirectly doing it. If I understood it correctly, it would say ""Love has no barrier"" or ""Love can beat everything"". The only problem with this is that society has such a negative perspective on incest, that the first time watching the show, it felt wrong. Of course the producers weren\'t going for this completely, but every time you snap out an realize the show is about incest, you will think to yourself why you are watching it.*Another genre that I did not expect from the show was comedy. Every episode there was at least one scene that made me laugh.Characters:Characters are quite bland in the beginning, but begins to develop towards the end of the season getting prepared for the second season. Though they are bland, they are believable than most anime characters. The way they act is human and less of a fictional character.Do I recommend it?I would definitely recommend the show. If you ask me, I would have a hard time answering. But if you want a show that will lift you up and make you laugh, this is the show for you. viewers will enjoy the show and never no why.

I didn\'t expect much from this anime. The concept didn\'t sound that great, the characters looked like your generic harem cast, and the title was almost laughable. Not only was it ridiculously long, but when you hear the translation of it for the first time, you\'re guaranteed to crack up. So, after watching the show, did I change my mind? Let\'s take a look at \'My Little Sister Can\'t Be This Cute\'. ...Pfffft-Story (5/10):OreImo is quite obviously a bit of an otaku fantasy. ""A tsundere little sister who is extremely pretty, but also enjoys anime, and adult video games? Sign me...up!"" Of course, there\'s nothing wrong with that, but as a result, you shouldn\'t expect a masterpiece. The concept is just kind of lame.There are some positive things to it though. Although the concept might not be that great, the execution is pretty decent. The comedy is well written, especially during certain character interactions. It even had me laughing a bit, which is rare, since I\'m not really a fan of the Japanese style of humor.The writers of the series also do a pretty good job with the dramatic moments as well, and actually create some memorable scenes. I wouldn\'t call them tearjerkers, but they definitely pack a punch.There\'s also something that OreImo does that I didn\'t quit expect. It\'s not a harem. In fact, there\'s almost no romance in here too, which is quite surprising, considering it does look like it at first. One male character surrounded by pretty girls spells out romance, and harem to me. Saying that though, there are some romantic moments at the end, but for the most part, it\'s more of a character driven comedy.There is one big flaw with the story though. There are a few arcs, where it doesn\'t just jump the shark. It builds a trampoline, harpoons 10 sharks, stacks them up on top of each other, and MAKES A SALTO OVER THEM THAT CAN REACH THE HEAVENS. Yeah, the plot can get pretty crazy. Most notably is the arc where Kirino, the little sister, makes a light novel. Well, good for her right? She found a hobby, and learns to write! Maybe one day, she\'ll- oh. It got published. Well, she must really have a talent, especially since this is novel seems to have been made in a few week- oh. It got an anime. Wow, she must be incredible! Maybe the story will evolve with her becoming active in the industry? What\'s that? It never gets mentioned again after the arc? ...Seriously?!Art (8/10):The art of OreImo is definitely one of the highlights. The colours look very nice indeed, giving a very upbeat tone to the series.The character designs also look quite good. While Kyousuke might look kind of generic, the other female characters all have their unique designs, which reflect their personality. Also, I have to give props to the designers, who gave a lot of the characters different outfits for them to wear, which is a really nice touch. All in all, the art is pretty damn good.Sound (6/10):The soundtrack though, is nothing special. Really, it\'s just your generic slice-of-life OST, and there are no tracks that I could memorize on the top of my head. It\'s forgettable to say the least.I don\'t really care for openings, and endings, but I do have to give a special note that each episode has a different ending theme, which is kind of refreshing. Each ending is accompanied by a picture that reflects the episode, either being the picture of the character that the episode focused on, or a picture of a certain moment in the episode. This adds some points in an otherwise forgettable OST.Characters (7/10):Let\'s start with the male lead, Kyousuke. I have to say, Kyousuke is probably one of the best characters in the show, which is surprising, since the male leads in these types of shows are pretty bland most of the time. While Kyousuke is your typical \'nice guy\', he does show some unique traits, and twists. He\'s lazy, sarcastic, and has a surprisingly fun relationship with most of the girls, especially Ayase, who he teases in an incredibly funny way. The most important quality though, is the twist on his \'nice guy\' attitude. Sure, he helps almost all the girls he comes across in your typical male-lead fashion, but he also has his own needs, and desires, and only does the things he does because he wants to. Yeah, he sacrifices his reputation on more than one occasion for the sake of the girls, but the way he does it is actually quite brave, ballsy, and feels surprisingly natural.The female lead, Kirino however, leaves much to be desired. She\'s a typical tsundere, with the only unique quality of her is being a bit more of a bitch to her brother. Also, she\'s an otaku, which is a fun quirk, but nothing that changes my opinion of her character. However, she improves at the end of the series, showing a bit more respect to her brother, and also becomes more open to her otaku interests, which makes her a lot more entertaining.Otherwise, you have the typical cast. The childhood friend Manami, the yandere Ayase, and the weird, extreme otaku girl Saori. While all of them entertaining (excluding Manami, who is just a very boring, and uninteresting character), they don\'t really have any backstory, or depth.The last character I\'ll talk about is Kuroneko, arguably the best character in the series. Kuroneko is basically that elitist anime fan. You know those people who claim that ""back in their day the anime industry was a lot better"". Yeah, those people.However, they actually didn\'t make her a completely annoying character, and she turned out very interesting indeed. She has several fun quirks, roleplaying that she is in an anime, giving her a lot of funny moments. She\'s also the character with the most development, turning from an ice-queen to a nice, and relatable girl. Plus, she\'s the only character that can be entertaining on her own, without the need of Kyousuke, which is the biggest compliment I can give for a character in this show. All in all, a pretty damn good character.Overall (6/10):While the characters are generally good, and entertaining, the downfall of this series is definitely it\'s story. The story arcs aren\'t that interesting, and when they are, it\'s for the wrong reasons. The dialogue, and characters however, do save this anime from being completely generic. So, would I recommend this anime? Well, it depends. You do have to look at the title, and realize that, yes, this is an anime with incest-themes. If you are completely against this, then no, I\'d recommend you skip it. If not, then I will recommend this anime if you are into romantic comedies. And hey! If you don\'t like the anime, then the creators actually give you a bailout card! You see, they actually made two endings for this series. The true-ending, which continues the story for the upcoming installments, and the good-ending, which concludes this series, so you won\'t have to watch the next season, and specials, giving you a decent conclusion to the show.""Better than the title, but that wasn\'t a hard bar to reach."" up!""

This show. Even a while after finishing it, I can\'t decide whether I enjoyed it or not--as well as if it was worth the time spent.

I find it enjoyable because this is the quintessential example of the kind of entertainment that shouldn't...have been green-lit for production, but was anyway, because there are enough adults in the world with little enough social skills to fill in the blanks of the degeneracy clearly present here. have been green-lit for production, but was anyway, because there are enough adults in the world with little enough social skills to fill in the blanks of the degeneracy clearly present here."", ""What's more fun than an anime about things you like? And being on this website you are probably into anime, games and such. Am I right? Then you should totally watch Oreimo!My expectationsOne of the newest anime, and already one of my favorites is Ore no imouto ga konnani kawaii wake ga nai, wich means My little sister can't be this cute. For short the term Oreimo is often used to describe this anime. When I first read the title I thought that it would be a very ecchi and incesty anime. Oreimo is in fact ecchi sometimes, and there is a bit of sexual...tension between the main characters, but not in an incesty kind of way. The relationship between brother and sister Kyosuke and Kirino is in my opinion a natural relationship between siblings.PlotKyosuke never really got along with his younger sister Kirino. One day he accidentally discovers his sister is into anime and especially likes playing eroge (erotic video games). Kirino begs Kyosuke to keep her secret since their dad is against anime and thinks Otaku are dangerous and crazy. Also Kirino is a model and is ashamed of her hobby, so none of her friends at school know about her secret. Kyosuke agrees to keep his sister's secret, but that's just the the first episode of the series... Kirino starts to love the fact that she can now talk about eroge with her brother and forces him to play them. One thing leads to another and soon Kyosuke is soon dragged into Kirino's little otaku world, and forced to do all kinds of embarrassing stuff while trying to keep it all secret.ReviewThe visual effects of this anime are very good seeing as it is a quite new series, released in 2010. I don't have any flaws I want to point out. The character designs are very up to date and cute too. The plot is kind of predictable and the anime is almost exactly what I imagined it to be. In my opinion that is not a bad thing though. The strongest point of this anime for me is that I could very easily relate to Kirino because she is an otaku. So if you'd like to see a very funny and recognizable anime with some slightly ecchi scenes, that is exactly what you'll get from Oreimo. tension between the main characters, but not in an incesty kind of way. The relationship between brother and sister Kyosuke and Kirino is in my opinion a natural relationship between siblings.PlotKyosuke never really got along with his younger sister Kirino. One day he accidentally discovers his sister is into anime and especially likes playing eroge (erotic video games). Kirino begs Kyosuke to keep her secret since their dad is against anime and thinks Otaku are dangerous and crazy. Also Kirino is a model and is ashamed of her hobby, so none of her friends at school know about her secret. Kyosuke agrees to keep his sister's secret, but that's just the the first episode of the series... Kirino starts to love the fact that she can now talk about eroge with her brother and forces him to play them. One thing leads to another and soon Kyosuke is soon dragged into Kirino's little otaku world, and forced to do all kinds of embarrassing stuff while trying to keep it all secret.ReviewThe visual effects of this anime are very good seeing as it is a quite new series, released in 2010. I don't have any flaws I want to point out. The character designs are very up to date and cute too. The plot is kind of predictable and the anime is almost exactly what I imagined it to be. In my opinion that is not a bad thing though. The strongest point of this anime for me is that I could very easily relate to Kirino because she is an otaku.

Although I didn't expect it when starting out, it did manage to strike some of the 'feels', something which is never a bad thing. The story has this wonderful tendency to jump between light-hearted and serious, and it does it in a mature way, which...doesn't feel forced.The characters are also intriguing. Although I wouldn't say that our main character is particularly 'special', the supporting cast have varying personalities which all contribute to progressing the story in a meaningful way.Overall I would say that you should give this one a shot if you enjoy drama, romance, or just something a little 'different'.

I really didn\'t go into it with any expectations, but it was pretty entertaining. It was just laid-back, and I found it to be well-worth my time. I\'ll be honest in saying that it is not a masterpiece, not in the slightest.

It is what I call, what revolutionized the ""little sister"" stereotype in anime, it was not the first, but it was probably one of the biggest influencers. Looking at all the reviews for this show, it is widely excepted that this is not a masterpiece, certainly not, so why I have not started bashing this work. Let me explain, this show is basically a slice-of-life romance comedy, with some drama, harem, and ""incest"" mixed into one. I personally found that this show had some good and bad...points. Not certainly deserving of the hatred it has received, but isn\'t as good from the praise. Lets analyze every aspect of this show, and than I will explain my opinion.Story: 5 - This is a 5, which means that the story was mediocre. Watching this show made me realize, this has very inconsistent writing. The themes and subject matter that each episode tries to touch on have a varying effect on me. From finding it interesting because of character development, or complete boredom from the waste of time. The plot isn\'t complicated or hard to understand. It is just not deeply layered or well though out enough to make it deserve a higher score.Art: 6 - This show has solid art, nothing like Kyoto or P.A Works. But it\'s visually pleasing, and isn\'t really anything to complain about.Sound: 5 - The music is fine, it fits with the show, nothing more and nothing less.Character: 7 - The characters were actually very decent, with pretty great backstories to help develop most of the cast of characters. Some were done better than others, but it helps you to understand the motivations and actions of the characters. The characters were also one of the best parts of this show. It made me laugh a lot! Which is hard to say for newer shows today. It also liked to comment on otaku culture and referenced akihabara. Which was something I didn\'t see as much during that time.Enjoyment: 8 - I personally found this show really funny and hilarious. I get it, some jokes get really old. But the character interactions are actually really great. I watched this show personally because it was hated on so much. I was curious, and while I understand the severe criticisms. I believe that it is overused and people just like to ride on it. I didn\'t watch this show for the romance. If you did, than you might be disappointed as it the progression of the relationship is a bit forced. Nonetheless, it\'s a funny show.Overall: 6 - This is a fairly mediocre show, with controversy and its polarizing topic bringing it to the spotlight. It revolutionized the ""little sister"" genre of anime. Bringing incest in as a focal point of the show, which was actually unusual for its time. People shouldn\'t really watch this show because of the romance. The relationship progression is quite forced and unnatural, which can disappoint people. The great points of this show are the character interactions, which are really funny. This is mostly a comedy with some weird things happening once in awhile.

Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai, aka Oreimo was honestly quite a difficult anime for me to write a review on. There were a number of things that I really disliked about the show, namely many of the characters. However, there are alot of very interesting themes and elements presented in the plot which made the show very enjoyable: the brother-sister relationship, otakus, and the friendship that can arise from people sharing common...interests.STORY: 8On the surface, Oreimo appears to be a slice of life anime about the two brothers and sisters, Kyousuke and Kirino who became closer to each other after Kyousuke discovers his sister\'s obsession for animes and eroge, and he begins to develop a common interest for them. The thing that I think makes the story in Oreimo interesting is that while the format of the show appears to be a standard episodic slice-of-life anime with random events happening in each episode, there are always common elements present throughout these episodes that together are very coherent and enjoyable to watch.Contrary to many other reviews, I think the show does present the brother-sister relationship in a very realistic way. As an older brother myself, Kyousuke does behave in a way that I think an ideal older brother should. He gives advice to Kirino, helps her out with all of her problems, tries to share her interests (yes, despite the fact that its eroge), and does genuinely show love, affection and protectiveness as most older brothers do. While I think Kirino\'s character is certainly exaggerated, she does to a certain degree act in a way that most younger sisters do. Yes they can be spoiled, loud, constantly demand for attention, and act in a very unreasonable way, but sometimes that\'s just how the relationship is, and their own way of showing their love for their older siblings.While I agree that there are certain \'siscon\' tendencies in this anime, nothing is ever blatant and there\'s never any romantic or sexual interactions between them. There are no romantic elements in this show (at least in the 1st season) so if that\'s what you\'re looking for then I suggest you should look elsewhere.There are a number of other elements that are explored throughout the 12 episodes, such as the world of otakus and how they\'re perceived by others in society, and different types and forms of friendship between people who share common interests. These interesting elements are what really drives the plot in each episode and kept me going till the last episode.ART: 9The art is great, and one of the best aspect of this show. Every element is drawn to a great level of detail, especially the character designs which are all beautiful and very well done.SOUND: 8Music is generally good and goes well with the anime. I especially like all the voice acting in this show, very well done, and fits well with all the characters.CHARACTERS: 6This is easily one of the worst aspects of the show.Kyousuke was one of the few characters that I actually liked. He is kind, reliable, helpful and dependable. Yes he does appear like a generic male MC at times, but he was one of the only character that I could relate to. I understood his actions, way of thinking and even the way that he treated Kirino. He was simply a kind and helpful older brother who often spoiled his little sister too much.Kirino is very spoiled, cold and demanding to Kyousuke and most of the time behaves in the most unreasonable ways - in other words a standard tsundere character. She only behaves in this way with Kyousuke - seemingly putting on another personality when around her other friends. However, while Kirino\'s character is certainly exaggerated, this is at least relatable and somewhat realistic to the way that younger siblings sometimes behave.Kuroneko is your typical cynical gothic character. I liked her character in the first season, she was smart and knew how to stand up for herself. She was proud of her interests in anime and who she really was, and while she appears to be harsh to her friends at times, she\'s also proven to be kind and caring. However, during the OVA it appears she begins to fall in love with Kyousuke and her character regresses into a generic tsundere character. Her behaviour becomes unreasonable towards Kyousuke, she continuously refuses his help but at the same time secretly craves for his attention - in other words she became another replica of Kirino in her absence.Ayase is Kirino\'s best friend, and appears to be a kind and gentle character, however she becomes very angry and violent, especially to Kyousuke. She clearly expresses her dislike for him, but yet continuously asks him for help with ""Kirino issues"" - in other words, another tsundere character. At times it seems like she may have feelings for Kyousuke, however this remains unclear as of season 1.This is one of the main problems that I have with this anime, the three female characters mentioned so far are all generic tsunderes, which eventually became boring and irritating to watch. They are all unreasonably hostile and violent towards Kyousuke but yet appears to have some feelings for him. Meanwhile, other more interesting characters never seem to get enough screen time.On a more positive note, Saori is a very interesting character. She is kind, dependable and is the only voice of reason in the trio of friends. While she appears like a geeky otaku, it is clear that there is more to her character than it seems. Sadly she never gets enough screen time or development to become anymore important to the show.Manami is another very interesting character, and one which I really liked. She is kind, reliable, caring and determined. She appears to have feelings for Kyousuke, however he is largely oblivious to this. In my opinion Kyousuke doesn\'t deserve her feelings and she can certainly do much better.ENJOYMENT: 8Surprisingly, I found this anime quite enjoyable to watch. While some of the characters are rather boring and irritating to watch, the slice of life plot on the daily life of otakus and anime lovers, the struggles in the daily life of siblings and the stories of friendship is what kept me going till the end.In summary, Oreimo is not a bad show - it has alot of very interesting elements and together they make up a very interesting slice of life anime. If you\'re easily annoyed by generic and unreasonable tsundere characters then this might not be the best show for you, but otherwise it might be worth giving it a go. interests.STORY: 8On the surface, Oreimo appears to be a slice of life anime about the two brothers and sisters, Kyousuke and Kirino who became closer to each other after Kyousuke discovers his sister\'s obsession for animes and eroge, and he begins to develop a common interest for them.

I heard about it, and decided to give it a go. And man did I not regret it... first.Oreimo has 2 seasons, and if season 1 did everything right, season 2 was a huge mess that destroyed everything the series had built.STORYThis story is about a brother and a sister who can\'t stand each other. They\'re in a cold war, literally, as they don\'t talk with each other at all. The big brother is an average guy, who doesn\'t aspire to anything big. The little sister, on the other hand, is perfect in everything : perfect in school,...perfect in sport, perfect in job, ...Everything changes when the big brother discovers his perfect little sister\'s secret : she loves erogames, particularly those that include brothers and sisters. Since he discovered this secret, the little sister decides to let her brother in. From then, they become closer and closer.This pitch is absolutely great. It\'s sweet, it\'s deep (this story is about tolerance, it\'s a critic of the societal pressure and etiquettes), and it\'s funny as the situation is embarrassing and quite absurd sometimes.Now, the story has one major problem : they change a perfect brother-sister relationship into a boring love relationship. Yes, love : those two brother and sister fall in love, literally.Now, I\'m not against forbidden love, I couldn\'t care less about something like that. What I don\'t like about this is :- it makes this anime a love story, which is incredibly boring because there\'s a ton of them. I like originality, and a story about a brother and sister is much more rare than a love story.- that brotherhood was pure gold! As a big brother myself, I respected the MC a lot, because of the way he protects and helps his little sister. But in season 2 (well, in the end of season 1, to be honest), that guy loses any interest. Instead of being a big bro, he becomes a cheesy boy in love.ARTFrom this side, nothing to say. The design is clean, in the good average of what could be done back then. Note that they change the opening in each episode (like they wanted to say ""hey, you see, this is not impossible!"").SOUNDSongs were made by ClariS. So they can give you a good mood.As for the OST, I don\'t remember at all. It was nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either.As for the voice actors, they\'re the best. Everyone knows Kirino and her brother\'s voice actors, so there\'s no need to introduce them.CHARACTERAs I said earlier, I love the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke, in season 1. I also love each of those characters apart. Sure, Kirino as a real person would be really annoying. Let\'s be honest, she\'s a b*tch. But as a character from a comedy show, she\'s really cool. I like her fights with Kuroneko.Kyousuke is a great big brother, ready to do anything for his beloved sister. That\'s in season 1. Then he becomes Kirino\'s loyal dog and deserves no respect whatsoever.As for the supporting cast, they\'re funny as well. My favourite has to be Kuroneko, Kirino\'s gothic friend ; or is it the yandere Ayase? I don\'t know, really. Each character has a unique personality, and most of them do bring something to the story.ENJOYMENTI loved season 1, hated season 2. The story and the characters were great in the beginning, then I don\'t know what happened, but all this became crap. The story turned into a basic love story, whereas the characters become absolute clichés, and not just for comedy purpose.As a conclusion, I really recommend the first season. Then, no need to go further, really. If you stop at episode 12 of season 1, the story doesn\'t feel incomplete. perfect in sport, perfect in job, ...Everything changes when the big brother discovers his perfect little sister\'s secret : she loves erogames, particularly those that include brothers and sisters.

Basically, he happens to find out his little sister\'s secret: she likes little sister Incest Hentai/Eroge, so for some unknown reason reason he keeps her secret and completely loses all his credibility and pride as a high class all A\'s student in order to...keep his sister out of trouble. She still hates him BTW, and everyone continuously treats him like shit. Even when her secret gets out, he covers for her and her best friend thinks the brother is influencing his little sister into watching anime, so she hates him with a passion. She still slap, punches or kicks him every episode. You get my point. Basically the brother is the scapegoat who gets treated like shit by everyone even though he\'s like the nicest guy there could possibly ever be. When the brother talks to someone even a little the response is almost sure to be: ""Die, pervert."" I just don\'t find the appeal in being slapped in the face every day for helping someone, so count me out.I despise the characters in this anime to no end and I especially hate that little creature/sister.The art on the focused people is decent, but the background needs a bit more consistency.I constantly hear that slapping sound effect, so I can\'t really grade it high.I CAN\'T STAND HOW POORLY THE MC IS TREATED, *slap* ...sorry, that was a bit much. I mean\'t to say that the main character gets slapped more times than I find any comedy in this entire anime.Overall, I can\'t stand how the main character are treated to the point that I couldn\'t continue watching.Now if you could excuse me, I have some better anime to talk about.

So, I was a bit sketched out at first when deciding to watch Oreimo, quite frankly the sister stuff kinda freaking bugs me in anime, but after watching another series a little bit that had a similar premise I found myself going into the daily life of the Kousaka siblings and the other weird and eccentric characters in the show.As you know this series IS about a relationship between a brother and a sister, I actually jumped to conclusions that this would be trash but I actually found myself rather enjoying it.I rate the story...as a 6 mainly because its not really something new, and it wasn't like it was really that great of a story anyways, it was more like a slice of life harem romcom to me just with the sister/brother stuff going on and the eroge.As for art I must say that the art is quite frankly one of my favorite parts about the show, the art is actually pretty well done, and it fits the theme of the story and the scenes when it needs to overall making my enjoyment level a bit higher then it would have been.The sound in the show I would rate highly because of the OP not being complete trash like most harems/romcoms. I actually thought the OP wasnt really garbage but I even more so liked how when I listened to the characters the voice actors really did fit them and didn't make my ears bleed like other animes that I have watched.The characters in the show aren't actually really THAT bad, the main character, yes he is your typical normal character but overall I do like how he goes out of his way from time to time for his sister, and even then he changed throughout the show which is ANOTHER thing I must say I liked, both of the Kousakas were stuck right up there ass but somehow managed to fix that shitty relationship of a brother and sister.My enjoyment level of the series is basically a 6 primarily because again its nothing you HAVEN'T seen before, its just actually not so bad as to its execution and quite frankly even if its not entirely different I like the direction its heading into the second season and will probably watch it.My only complaint with the show is some of the cringey scenes that make otaku culture go over the top, it gets to be a bit much at times. Plus people can easily take this as a normal brother+sister problem relationship at their age and hows its normal. I frankly ended up liking the fact that it was like that, but I know it wouldnt be other peoples cup of tea.Overall I think Oreimo isn't a bad series at all, I think its much more of a comedy about 2 dumb siblings currently then the romance, I kinda see it coming in a second season but I must say that this might be an anime that if you judge it by its cover or title you might be missing a possibly enjoyable series, and this is coming from someone who didn't want to step foot into the world of Oreimo for 3 years. as a 6 mainly because its not really something new, and it wasn't like it was really that great of a story anyways, it was more like a slice of life harem romcom to me just with the sister/brother stuff going on and the eroge.As for art I must say that the art is quite frankly one of my favorite parts about the show, the art is actually pretty well done, and it fits the theme of the story and the scenes when it needs to overall making my enjoyment level a bit higher then it would have been.The sound in the show I would rate highly because of the OP not being complete trash like most harems/romcoms.

Is it wrong to watch a series about sibling relationships? The answer: no. Is it okay, If I don't enjoy a guy bending over backwards for a duration of 12 episodes for an irredeemable, asshat girl? Yes.God, I want to say I at least enjoyed the animation, and the sentiment to make this kind of dynamic mainstream, but the show is just straight up trash, and for all the wrong reasons! Throwing fits and acting all tsundere is fine once in a while, but this girl is reeeally something else!

For anyone else: STAY AWAY!"", 'OreImo was interesting as a show due to the fact that I initially began watching it thinking that it was going to be about a certain theme, and then ultimately ended up being about a whole different twist that sort of snuck up on me in season 2.  That said, this review is on the first season, so I will review it as its own quantity without taking the sequel into account.Before getting into my thoughts on the story, let\'s discuss the technical aspects of the show.The artwork and animation is pleasant and well above par for these slice of life comedies....The characters are drawn very well and while the characters do suffer from a bit of similar face style and such, the anime is pleasant to look at and doesn\'t run into too many instances of bizarre animation.The sounds and voice acting are done pretty well also.  The voice actors do a good job establishing character personality and emotions come out well.  The music is also catchy and appropriate for what\'s going on, I had no real complaints.With regards to the story, I may go into some slight spoilers here but I\'ll try to avoid anything major.  As I\'m reviewing the first season here, I can say that the story was a little bizarre to me at first, but I ultimately liked what I thought the author was trying to do.  Taken on its own, the major theme of the first season had a lot to do with fitting into society and making friends when you end up with a hobby that isn\'t socially acceptable.  As someone who in the past has gamed, table top board gamed, and takes an interest in fantasy and science fiction, while working in a non-nerdy field surrounded by people who do not really care for these things and look down on them, I could relate to the struggle of the main character and her hobby.Granted, the main character, Kirino in this case\'s, hobby has to do with something far more questionable than playing World of Warcraft on the weekends.  While Japanese otaku culture is somewhat different than American nerd culture (though there is obviously some overlap), Kirino\'s hobby is very socially unacceptable, and definitely raises interesting questions about what\'s going on in her head (much of which comes to be explained in season 2, which I have additional thoughts on, but this isn\'t the place).The series then progresses from Kirino\'s brother Kyousuke\'s unwitting discovery of his sister\'s hobby, and his ""life counseling"" sessions where he (*against his better judgment) tries to help his sister deal with the ramifications of her ""unacceptable"" otaku habits, from getting their conservative dad to accept her hobby, towards finding other otakus that she can share her hobby with and fit in.On its face, the struggle of dealing with two faces, where one has the ""public"" side and the ""private"" side is dealt with on this show.  On the one hand, Kirino has one life as a popular girl in school with many ""normal"" friends and hobbies.  On the other hand, she spends all her money on otaku merchandise that horrifies her best friend and family. and maintains a second circle of friends sharing these hobbies as well.  Season one deals with the balance of these double lives and the relationship with her friends and brother.Kyousuke, Kirino\'s brother and the other main lead in the story, ends up going through quite a bit in order to help his sister, who he originally doesn\'t seem to care too much about.  He also learns a lot about this other world of otakus that he didn\'t have anything to do with, and actually interacts with Kirino\'s new friends as well, which adds a lot of comedic interactions.  Watching his development and attitude shifts is one of the high points of season one.This is all well and good.  There is a subtext with her brother than needs to be addressed, but I will save that for a season two review.  For those that only watch season one, it won\'t come into play too much, but for those who ultimately watch the sequel, it\'s going to come into play.It\'s hard to discuss this series too much more without majorly spoiling everything so I will stop.With regards to the characters in the show, they are for the most part entertaining, but a little shallow.  There is definitely a bit of the harem problem that many of these slice of life shows like to dive into, which is unfortunate.  Many of the otherwise potentially interesting female characters end up rotating far too much around Kyousuke to develop strongly.  There should have been more male members to play off of to help this along, but as per usual, there don\'t tend to be any that play more than a bit role.There is additional character development in season 2 for many of the characters, so it\'s not totally fair to write them off as shallow.  But anyone that only watches season one could definitely make the case that many of the characters only play to tropes and archetype.  Season one Kyousuke lacks a strong personality for the most part, and Kirino is a over the top example of a overly bitchy personality as well, which is a little unfortunate as these two are the main characters.  There are worse offenders out there in the shallow character department however.So is the anime actually worth a watch?  Is it enjoyable?Season one I would say is a competent show.  It didn\'t do a lot to wow me, but I found the theme of having to live a quiet life with your hobbies interesting even if I didn\'t specifically enjoy the hobby that they were trying to hide.  Had I stopped at the end of season one, I think I would have said this is a slightly better than average slice of life, comedy, relationship story.  Season two changed my opinion of the show quite a bit (not in a positive way) but as I\'ve mentioned, taking season one on its own merits, it\'s probably worth a watch if you would like to watch an interesting twist on slice of life that explores otaku culture a bit.

Although I found the style throughout cute and I thought that the intros and outros having differing details every time made them...interesting and kept me from skipping past them.Sound [8/10]:Pretty good intro, pretty good outro. There are also songs within the anime such as the theme song for Meruru which has been stuck in my head for a few days and something I have sung quietly out loud to myself. The nice little tunes that establish an atmosphere are also positives that I liked about this anime.Character [9/10]:Kirino is a cute character but also extremely annoying, however the growth of all the characters throughout the anime are interesting to see develop despite the fractured story. I think that the incestual undertone is kind of odd although that is kind of the whole point of the anime. Seeing the brother sister duo grow and have their relationship develop is really what this anime is about and without these two differing personalities the show wouldn't be as interesting as it is.Enjoyment [9/10]:Although starting this show very long ago on Crunchyroll and only watching the first three episodes I am glad that I came back to finish this anime. It wasn't as interesting or captivating as others I have watched but it was still extremely enjoyable and a fun watch that I am glad I came back to finish.

All this changes when he finds an eroge belonging to none other...than his oh-so-perfect little sister. He then goes onto helping his little sister with her otaku hobbies. However, what I found really interesting is that the main character isn't an otaku at all, and originally believed the bad stories on the news surrounding the culture. While the story is mainly about the brother and sister starting to get along and fixing their broken relationship, it also focuses on the male lead learning about otaku culture, and even defending it at times.Art 8/10 - The art in the anime is really nice. The character design is good, but if I had one complaint it would be that a few of the female characters look alike, such as Ayase and Kirino looking like the same person with different hair colour and personality.Sound 6.5/10 - The voice acting is average; there isn't anything overly amazing about it, and the OSTs are decent. The opening is the best of the soundtracks. The others are decent.Character 7.25/10 - The characters are average, but done pretty well, creating an interesting setting for the anime. The female lead is your average tsundere, but there aren't many weird incidents surrounding her, which is relieving. The male lead is really bland, but he certainly acts like a high school student, and cares for and helps his sister, despite how annoying she is. Then for the other characters you have a goth loli, weird otaku, self-conscious model and a shy childhood friend as the love interest.Enjoyment 9.5/10 - I really liked the anime. Every time I finish an episode I want to know what happens next. There are no real cliff-hangers, but I genuinely want to know what is going to happen next in the characters' world. It's a really interesting show.Overall 8.25/10 (8/10 for MAL Scores)I know the show aired 10 years ago, but I thought it was a really interesting subject, and wanted to express that in this review.I would highly recommend you watch 'Ore no Imouto Ga Konnani Kawaii Wake Ga Nai' or read the manga/light novel, as it is a great slice of life comedy with an intriguing plot and great character development. than his oh-so-perfect little sister.

I enjoyed the characters and the art, but Kirino's age and the show's ending ruined it all for me. I wanted to see this show as a sweet, comedic story of siblings becoming friends, but I was very disappointed.SPOILERS AHEAD:I'm grateful Kirino and her friends weren't directly sexualized, but having the siblings fall for each other at the end was gross to watch. I will never forget that disappointing scene...with Kirino in a wedding dress. The characters are charming and I was excited to see them grow, there was potential in the story but the ending truly destroyed any positive feelings I had for the show. with Kirino in a wedding dress.

This sister does not have anything I like about her. At all.She comes off as a gaslighting, abusive, spoilt brat who constantly gets her own way by manipulating her older brother time and time again. I understand that 12 episodes does not make for a long time...to fully flesh out character development but her 'apology' (if you can even call it one) felt extremely manipulative -- especially when in the following episode she gets her brother to do a massive favour for her, yet again. Timing couldn't be any better could it?Speaking of the brother, he is an absolute doormat. He uses the excuse 'but she's my sister' for the reason he's constantly bending over backwards to her every demand and frankly that is nothing but toxic to me. The amount of times he's getting physically abused by his sister is horrifying to say the least. Big yikes, was cringing each time.This is meant to be a comedy but I guess it passed over me as most jokes fell flat. Slice of life, eh I guess it is?The only thing that made the show watchable was the supporting cast, the sisters new otaku friends. Every time they were on screen I found myself resisting the urge to drop the anime and continuing to watch. My favourite moments are all when they are a big aspect of the plot.I can also appreciate how the intro and outro theme songs of this anime is constantly changing, so at least effort was put in there.Overall, you will either like this anime or despise it. I don't think there's any in between, especially based on looking at prior reviews for this anime. to fully flesh out character development but her 'apology' (if you can even call it one) felt extremely manipulative -- especially when in the following episode she gets her brother to do a massive favour for her, yet again.

The characters are made as annoying and their actions are as illogical as possible, while each having a contrasting personality and character development. Contrary to what the title would make the viewer believe, there was little romance between the sibling main characters and throughout the anime the characters were having vocal prejudices against otakus. This anime is a mockery to the usual target audience of the genre and watching it without a few layers of irony is gonna make you miss the point of the brilliant writing. ', 'This is not a review of the anime persay but a review of how it has affected me.This anime has been my favorite since 2013, and it has completely changed my outlook when it comes to anime. Prior to watching this anime I kept getting drawn towards it by fanart and how cute the little sister, Kirino is. As ironic as that is given the title of the show, that\'s what eventually forced me into watching the series and the title is what kept me away.See, at the time I was but a normie anime fan, only having watched a few anime and all of...them were well within the bounds of normality. So seeing the title, ""My Little Sister Can\'t Be This Cute"" had some major alarms ringing. I\'m normal, I said. Incest is gross, I concluded. I  could never watch something so immoral. Looking back, I was already watching plenty of shows without thought that could be considered immoral based on the content. That is excessive violence, especially against minors. Things like Naruto and the like. We don\'t view it as weird or immoral because it\'s been normalized in today\'s society, however the question of violent media\'s morality has been questioned at one point in recent history. But I\'m not here to criticize violent media, and instead here to praise taboo topics media.And yes, all of this is important, as this anime has made me realize that applying real world morality to anime is an extremely bad idea, as if you do that you\'ll simply miss out on such a grand masterpiece as this. That said, the first season is actually pretty tame, in fact it\'s pretty normal of an otaku-premise anime. It\'s only until the second season where the title really shines through.I wouldn\'t recommend this anime for newcomers, even if the first season is normal enough to do so, though I would argue that any otaku-premise anime would not be good for newcomers as they wouldn\'t be able to understand the characters like an anime fan would, but with season two going the incest route (which as a Kirino simp I am definitely not contested to) and people would likely watch the following seasons if they already liked the first, it doesn\'t make for a great impression. After all even I refused to watch it for months before caving, just because of the title of the show, how can I expected a total normie to not start hating anime after this show being among their first?If you have watched a fair amount, even about 20+, I think you could gain from watching this, it\'s a fun anime with a nice soundtrack and great, fun characters and you should learn to avoid the ""I\'m morally above that"" mindset on your anime journey, it\'s not a good look even if you and your normie friends think it is. If you\'ve watched over 100 anime and have not watched this masterpiece, I don\'t know what you\'re doing with your life, even if you ended up hating it, it\'s still an experience to be had. them were well within the bounds of normality.
