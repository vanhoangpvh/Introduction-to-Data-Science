Ginga e Kickoff!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12875/Ginga_e_Kickoff,"['Esta review también está en español.Football Chronicles, Chapter 3: Ginga e Kickoff!!Note: some football animes will be named in this review for the sake of comparison. This is, mostly, to see how the game is faced in each series. Of course, no spoilers.Also, football as the real, english one (aka soccer), not the American one.Ginga e Kickoff!! (GeK!) is the latest football bet offered in 2012. Gek! was a really pleasant surprise, not only for the release itself, but because there was already another football anime airing at the time: Area no Kishi (technically three, with Inazuma Eleven Go 2... but IE is... special). Maybe...the Japanese are starting to realize why people call it the ""beautiful game""...Now, let\'s see what this new product has to offer...GeK! story focuses on Shou Oota, a sixth-grade kid that loves football with a passion only possible in protagonists of sports anime. Sadly, he\'s in the same situation of Mamoru Endo in the beginning of Inazuma Eleven: the team lacks people. Actually, the situation is so serious that the team disintegrates, leaving Shou alone... Yet, far from giving up, he starts looking for players to resurrect the team and enter in the regional tournament. His first target is Erika Takato, a transfer student from Osaka. Erika has great skills and speed, but she\'s not very thrilled with Shou\'s offer... He\'s a nice guy, and has a noble dream and all, but he\'s terrible at football. Still, with willpower, determination, self humiliation and various negotiations, Shou manages to recruit not only her, but various other remarkable players... and that way, the Momoyama Predators are back. Their objective is not being the best of the city, nor the country or the world, no: they aim to be the best in the whole galaxy! (really).So, who are the Momoyama Predators? As I mentioned, Shou is the soul of the team. Cheerful, loud, persistent and optimistic, Shou loves football, even if football doesn\'t love him. Unlike other famous protagonist such as Tsubasa (Captain Tsubasa), which basically was the earthly personification of the Football God, or Kyosuke (Hungry Heart), Toshihiko (Aoki Densetsu Shoot!) and Kakeru (Area no Kishi), which had issues, but from the very start you just knew that they were prodigies, Shou has no abilities. However, talent has many forms, and although he\'s not a great player with his feet, he has a great vision and understanding of the game, and is able to order the whole team from his position (number 2, or last defender if you prefer). Basically, the team works through him. Of course, with hard work, his going to polish his skills to become a respectable player, and not only an organizer.The next one is Erika. Cheerful, nice, direct, and strong, she take\'s shit from nobody, especially those that underestimate her cause she\'s a girl (maybe nobody take her seriously for her K-On! look...). She has an excellent ball control, and a great speed, which make her a very effective forward. Oh, she\'s also a Cristiano Ronaldo fangirl (really).The following are the main power of the team. The Furuya triplets (aka the triplet demons) are the personification of force and skills: powerful, athletic and talented, they\'re the key to victory. Despite having a somewhat rebellious nature, they\'re quite reasonable and pleasant (when they want to), and are always willing to help their teammates whenever they can. They can play in any line, that\'s how good they are.The last player that worth mentioning is Reika Saionji. She\'s Erika best friend since she came to town, and is thanks to her that she discovers football. She start playing as a form of dieting (even if the Furuyas\'s feel offended by her motive, she really needs to lose some weight), and to help the team to complete the number of players. Of course, she will love the game, and play it even if her family oppose (cause, apparently, is way too dangerous...). Although her technical and physical limitations are huge, she tries her very best to be somewhat useful in the last line.Visually, GeK! is excellent (especially when compared with his contemporary buddy, Area no Kishi). The animation is fluid, showing fast and dynamic games, and portraying very well the beautiful game. The character design is very nice, varied, and are pretty detailed. Everything is colorful and pretty, which goes in hand with the cheerful and relaxed atmosphere of the series n_n.Sound is on par with the animation. All the seiyuus put a lot of effort, and pull great performances. Yuu Kobayashi is Shou (and Kyousuke Tsurugi in Inazuma Eleven Go 2, Setsuna Sakurazaki in Mahou Sensei Negima and Kanon in Umineko no Naku Koro Ni), Shinnosuke Tachibana is Ryuuji Furuya (Tachimukai in Inazuma Eleven, Soma in Kuroshitsuji), Kenn is Kota Furuya (Jil in Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk, Judai Yuki in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX and Phinks in Hunter x Hunter 2011). This series is also one of the first works of Mariko Nakatsu (Erika), and the official debut of Riiko Takazawa (Reika), both showing great skills and a promising future. As for the music... is amazing. The background music is good and all, but both opening and ending are beyond. Both songs have... how should I put it... the spirit of football (the ending even has actual pictures of real kids playing, in the same vein of Captain Tsubasa J). Very impressive.And as I usually do in my football reviews, I leave the most important thing for the (almost) end: how\'s the game in Ginga e Kickoff!!? Is close to Captain Tsubasa, with endless fields and shots that can destroy nets/fences/walls? It\'s like Inazuma Eleven, where super powers, time space manipulation and theme fields are the norm? Is like Giant Killing, where everything is hyper-realist, not only the game, but the people and the results too? In GeK! they play football, that\'s for sure. There are no such thing like super powers, special techniques or ridiculous shoots, the field used by elementary kids is quite crude (no beautiful green grass that looks like a carpet), and the stands are pretty empty (except for some family and friends). Some shoots are visually exaggerated, but the outcome is pretty normal (I mean, there can be wind or dust, but the goalkeeper is not going to die trying to grab the ball). So, this is like Giant Killing? God, no (can you imagine a GK with sixth-graders? It would be insanely boring! xD). While there\'s nothing ""supernatural"", you don\'t need to be a genius to figure out that skills are vastly exaggerated (although, technically, physically possible). In GeK! we see children who train hitting the ball on the crossbar with 100% effectiveness (the character that do it admits that is based on a training method by Maradona!), others are able to lower the rival moral kicking the ball with enough effect, that it hit a player and the rebound will be an own goal, feints and dodges worthy of professionals (or legends)… well, this kids can play ;). Everything for the sake of the show. Nevertheless, the games pass consistently and fairly attached to reality (and sometimes, remembering that they\'re kids, they play ""dango football"", an ugly and unorganized mess, pretty common in normal children games). Another factor that I think deserves mention is that the ridiculous and disproportionate honor presented in sport animes is not present here. I\'m not saying that GeK! encourages dirty playing or cheating, but if you can lower the morale of an opponent by playing clean (not very ethical, though)... why not? This last thing was a very pleasant surprise, especially since this is a children program (and dumb aesops are pretty common).As a closure, Ginga e Kickoff!! is a great series. Interesting and dynamic matches, lovable and charismatic characters, a very relaxed and cheerful mood (with, of course, doses of problems and emotions) and an impressive audiovisual level make GeK! a highly recommended option for football fans, and also a good anime for those who want to see a sports series with children and no silly drama.--------Crónicas futbolísticas, capitulo 3: Ginga e Kickoff!!Nota: varios animes de futbol van a ser nombrados en esta review, para comparar varias cosas. Más que nada, es para ver como encara el juego cada una. No hay ningún tipo de spoilers, y de paso aprenden un poco sobre otras series n_n.Ginga e Kickoff!! (GeK!) Es la más reciente apuesta futbolística que nos ofrece el 2012. GeK! Fue una de las sorpresas más gratas, dado que en paralelo se está emitiendo otro anime de futbol: Area no Kishi. Sera que los japoneses se están empezando a dar cuenta de por qué llaman al futbol el “más hermoso de los deportes” o “el deporte rey”? Que es lo que tiene este nuevo producto para ofrecer? Veamos…La historia de GeK! se enfoca en Shou Oota, un chico de sexto grado que ama el futbol con una pasión solo posible en un protagonista de shonens deportivos. Por desgracia, está en la misma situación de Mamoru Endo en Inazuma Eleven: a su equipo le falta gente. De hecho, por la falta absoluta de miembros, el equipo se desintegro… Lejos de darse por vencido, Shou empieza a buscar gente para rearmar al plantel y poder anotarse en el torneo anual. Su primer objetivo es Erika Takato, una chica recientemente llegada a la ciudad, que cuenta con una gran habilidad y velocidad. Al principio no está muy convencida de unirse a la cruzada de Shou, dado que, a pesar de ser un chico agradable con muy buenas intenciones, juega terriblemente mal. Así y todo, con fuerza de voluntad, empeño y negociaciones, los Depredadores de Momoyama reviven, y sus flamantes miembros se ponen como meta no ser los mejores del distrito, del país o del mundo: su objetivo es ser los mejores de la galaxia (a la mierrrrda!).Entonces, quienes son los Depredadores de Momoyama? Como ya mencione, Shou es el alma del equipo. Alegre, perseverante y optimista, Shou ama el futbol, aunque el futbol no lo ama a él. A diferencia de otros protagonistas famosos, como Tsubasa  (Captain Tsubasa), que básicamente era la personificación terrenal del Dios del futbol, o Kyosuke (Hungry Heart), Toshihiko (Aoki Densetsu Shoot!) y Kakeru (Area no Kishi), que si bien arrancaron de abajo, desde el momento cero se notaba que eran prodigios, Shou no cuenta con una habilidad que lo haga resaltar. Sin embargo, el talento tiene muchas formas, y aunque no sea un gran jugador con los pies, posee un gran entendimiento del juego, y es capaz de ordenar a todo su equipo desde su posición de último hombre. Básicamente, el equipo funciona a través de él. Por supuesto que no se va a conformar solo con el papel de organizador, sino que a fuerza de entrenamiento, va a pulir sus habilidades hasta convertirse en alguien respetable.La siguiente es Erika. Oriunda de Osaka, es una chica alegre y bastante bien llevada, pero con un carácter bastante fuerte, y que no acepta mierda de nadie, siendo lo que más la irrita que la subestimen por ser mujer (tal vez no la toman en serio por su look K-On!...). Posee un control del balón excelente, y una gran velocidad, lo que la convierte en una delantera muy eficaz. Ah, también es una gran fan de Cristiano Ronaldo (en serio).Los que siguen son el principal poder del equipo. Los trillizos Furuya son la fuerza en sí misma. Potentes, talentosos, hábiles, los Furuya son la clave de la victoria. A pesar de tener un carácter un tanto rebelde (y una fama nefasta), son muy razonables y agradables, y están dispuestos a ayudar a sus compañeros siempre que puedan… y que no afecte su estilo. Pueden pararse en cualquier línea, así de buenos son.La ultima jugadora digna de mención (por que los otros son relleno… son buenos chicos, llenos de espíritu y buenas intenciones, pero relleno al fin xD) es Reika Saionji. Es la mejor amiga de Erika desde que llego a la ciudad, y es por ella que descubre el futbol. Empieza a jugar primero como una forma de hacer dieta (cosa que no le causa gracia a los Furuya… aunque es obvio que necesita una dieta, porque es muuuuy gorda) y para ayudar al equipo a completar el número de jugadores, para luego ir tomándole cariño al más hermoso de los deportes. Aunque sus limitaciones técnicas y físicas son más que obvias, le mete ganas y mucho empeño.A nivel visual, GeK! es excelente (especialmente cuando se lo compara con su contemporáneo, Area no Kishi). La animación es fluida, mostrando jugadas rápidas, y retratando muy bien al deporte rey (algo que, increíblemente, no se ve muy bien en la presentación, donde los protagonistas se mueven de forma bastante extraña…). El diseño de personajes es muy variado, y todos son detallados y diferentes. Todo es colorido y muy bonito, lo que va de la mano con la atmosfera alegre y relajada de la serie n_n.El sonido esta en el mismo nivel que la animación. Todos los seiyuus le meten una ganas barbarás y hacen un trabajo notable. Yuu Kobayashi es Shou (y Kyousuke Tsurugi en Inazuma Eleven Go 2, Setsuna Sakurazaki en Mahou Sensei Negima y Kanon en Umineko, entre otros), Shinnosuke Tachibana es Ryuuji Furuya (Tachimukai en Inazuma Eleven, Soma en Kuroshitsuji), Kenn es Kota Furuya (también es Jil en Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk, Judai Yuki en Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX y Phinks en Hunter x Hunter 2011). Esta serie también es uno de los primeros trabajos de Mariko Nakatsu (Erika), y el debut deRiiko Takazawa (Reika), ambas demostrando grandes aptitudes y un futuro prometedor. En cuanto a la música… es increíble. La música de fondo es buena y todo eso, pero tanto opening como ending están mas allá. Realmente… tienen el espíritu del futbol (el ending hasta tiene imágenes reales de chicos jugando y tribunas, al mejor estilo Captain Tsubasa J). Todo un lujo.Y como suelo hacer en mis reviews futbolísticas, deje lo más importante para él (casi) final. Como es el futbol en Ginga e Kickoff!? Es cercano a Captain Tsubasa, con sus canchas interminables y sus tiros destructores de redes/alambrados/paredes? Se parece a Inazuma Eleven, donde lisa y llanamente hay súper poderes, manipulación tiempo espacio y canchas temáticas? Es como Giant Killing, donde todo es híper real? En GeK se juega al futbol, de eso no hay dudas. Acá no hay súper poderes, ni tiros dementes o técnicas ridículas,  las canchas donde juegan los chicos de primaria son, la verdad, una porquería (nada de pasto que parece una alfombra), y las tribunas están bastante vacías (excepto por algunos familiares y amigos). Algunos tiros están exagerados a nivel visual, pero no son descabellados en su resultado (o sea, podrá salir humo, polvo, o lo que sea, pero el arquero no va a salir volando por intentar agarrar la pelota). Entonces, esto es como Giant Killing? Por Dios, no (o sea, se imaginan un GK con chicos de sexto grado? Sería un bodrio! xD). Si bien no hay nada “sobrenatural”,  no hay que ser un genio para imaginar que las habilidades están exageradas hasta el extremo (aunque, técnicamente, físicamente posible). En GeK! vemos a niños que entrenan estrellando la pelota en el palo con un 100% de efectividad (el mismo personaje que lo hace admite que se basa en un método de entrenamiento realizado por Maradona!), otros que son capaces de bajar la moral pateando con un efecto suficiente como para que rebote en un rival y sea gol en contra, hay fintas y regates dignos de profesionales… en fin, estos chicos sí que juegan. Todo sea en nombre del espectáculo. Así y todo, los partidos transcurren de forma coherente y bastante apegada a la realidad. Otro factor que me parece que merece mención es que se rompe un poco con ese honor desproporcionado que abunda en los animes de deportes. No digo que en GeK se aliente al juego sucio, pero si se tiene la capacidad de bajar la moral de un rival mediante el juego limpio (aunque no muy ético)… ¿Por qué no hacerlo? Esto último fue una sorpresa muy agradable.Entonces, a modo de cierre, Ginga e Kickoff! es una gran opción dentro del género deportivo. Partidos interesantes y muy dinámicos, personajes muy queribles y carismáticos, un ambiente muy relajado y alegre, pero con su dosis de emociones y pequeños problemas, y un nivel audiovisual superlativo convierten a GeK! en un anime muy recomendable para los fans del futbol, y también una buena opción para los que quieran ver un anime deportivo con chicos y sin drama. the Japanese are starting to realize why people call it the ""beautiful game""...Now, let\'s see what this new product has to offer...GeK! story focuses on Shou Oota, a sixth-grade kid that loves football with a passion only possible in protagonists of sports anime.

From asking her to play with him and then miraculously meeting a female professional soccer player, Shou then strives on to bring back the Moroyama soccer team with its old and new members and a better coach that can accepts all of the players, both in personality and skills.Story wise it is (9/10), the team does not just strives to win a competition, but to become the...number one in the galaxy. Very exaggerated and impossible to achieve, but the team put fire and determination behind that dream that makes us cheer for them as they grow, skill wise and also in teamwork as some of the characters are not the easiest to get along to.Characters (9/10):This anime is played with two team, half with 11 players and the other half with 8 players. All are determined but distinct from each other, they mesh very well. Shou, our main character, loud and brash but given a flaw that makes him just what he is, a child, but he grows to be better and the most notable characters are the triplets for the are, in my opinion, the most complex characters.

Very exaggerated and impossible to achieve, but the team put fire and determination behind that dream that makes us cheer for them as they grow, skill wise and also in teamwork as some of the characters are not the easiest to get along to.Characters (9/10):This anime is played with two team, half with 11 players and the other half with 8 players. All are determined but distinct from each other, they mesh very well. Shou, our main character, loud and brash but given a flaw that makes him just what he is, a child, but he grows to be better and the most notable characters are the triplets for the are, in my opinion, the most complex characters.

Even if one isn't the biggest fan of sports anime (neither I nor my sister are, but we were swept up in this story and finished it very quickly!). It boasts no amazing, out of this world moves, the characters play pure soccer and it's a story grounded in reality with one or two amazing events that wouldn't be out of place in children's movie. After all, it IS aimed at children and it has a soothing atmosphere, a gentle score, and plenty of idealism.But it's...also excellent and truly enjoyable for an adult to watch too. Why? Because the character writing is fantastic. It is as much a show about being a child as it is aimed at children. The kids are in their last year of elementary, they're scared of being torn apart when they all go off to different middle schools based on their exams, they're scared of having no more time to play with the higher strains of education, this is their last chance and they want to make it count.And do they ever! It ends, just like a beautiful dream, but with hope for the future.The cast is diverse in many ways, the main team (Momoyama Predators) is a mixed team with two girls along with the boys. Shou himself is inspired by a professional female soccer player who trains him and Erika for a day and her lessons to them remain important for the rest of the series! Tagi is half-Arab, although this isn't explicitly stated in the anime version, it's clear in his design, with his darker skin and thick, curly brown hair!Blind soccer is featured respectfully and legitimately, not as a pity party at all, and by practicing with blind soccer players using the same training methods, the kids hone their senses and polish their skills.The characters deal with problems children do both on and off the field, like Erika deals with casual sexism and the ways growing up affects boys and girls differently. Tagi deals with hitting a growth spurt early, winding up gangly and tall for his age, losing confidence in his ability to play because his mind hasn't caught up with his new height. Reika deals with the stuffy expectations of being the heir to a rich family which expects her to live her life protected and ladylike at all times.Coach Hanashima is a rather useless, shameless drunk when they first meet him and piece by piece, it's revealed he used to be a great player and even coached other kids before a tragic incident made him deathly afraid of robbing more children of their futures with his risk-taking. His story and character development is beautifully cathartic and ultimately uplifting.The art style suits the wide-eyed, naive, enthusiasm of the main character and the youthful story, the animation is smooth and although there's some rough patches in the first few episodes (some anatomical hiccups here and there that look really strange and funny if you notice them), overall, it looks really good and crisp as you go along. The art style veers towards moe levels of cuteness about the face, but the kids' bodies are well drawn to portray the action.There is some poignant drama too, so it's not all sunshine and butterflies, it's a balanced show, although it's certainly more on the optimistic side-- but in a good way, certainly not saccharine. Even the most painful stories that end well, never feel sugarcoated or cheap, because they're handled respectfully and fairly, there's no solutions that are magical band-aids-- instead, the happy endings are most often a case of everyone expecting the worse and being surprised by the beauty born out of persevering despite the difficulties.Matches rarely take more than two episodes ( unless it's a tournament! ), the pacing is believable and the matches exciting even if one knows little about soccer. It really makes you want to get up and cheer them or move around or play yourself!Overall, this is a very sweet, encouraging show with surprisingly well-written characters (both child and adult) and an engaging plotline, that should be enjoyable to both boys or girl, adults or children! also excellent and truly enjoyable for an adult to watch too.

I haven't done too many reviews so spare with me here. A football anime that's unique from others would be a way to describe Ginga e Kickoff. It actually had the potential to be a 8 or even a 9 but why is it a 7? Well, read ahead. The story is indeed quite unique and the main character isn't overpowered like in other soccer animes but guess what? Other players are overpowered twice as much to make up for it. I wouldn't mind just strong kids but we have a kid here who can force other...kids to make Own goals and a 9-10 year old with PERFECT accuracy near the goal post, in elementary school. The characters aren't exactly the most likable either. There is at least one mention of being the Best in the galaxy every episode and i thought of quitting it several times, because frankly, it gets annoying. The beauty of this show would be that it's not just for kids. It's a show ABOUT kids becoming the best but people of all ages can enjoy it. All in all, it could have been better if they made the 10 year old kids less overpowered or if they didn't try to use the sympathy card in an innocent anime near the end, (can't spoil it) but it was worth the time. The growth of the MC is good, and if they actually focused on him a little more it would have been a lot better but I still would recommend it to others. kids to make Own goals and a 9-10 year old with PERFECT accuracy near the goal post, in elementary school.

Usually, in a sports anime, it is about winning against other school teams in the regional, national etc. This anime aimed steps higher, and eventually had a match against pros. While this is a pro, I also believe this is a con. The characters are all elementary school, probably all around the age of 10. The story seems way too unrealistic, and that is where it lost 1 point. The other is how slow the start and how rushed the very end was. From the start, the OP focused on the 8 man team....However, for the first almost half, it was about the 11 team. In the very end, everything just seemed to go way too fast. Their finals was not exciting at all, and the whole Aoto\'s father just seems crammed in.Art: 7/10 The art is nowhere near good for 2017. However, for an anime made 5 years ago, it isn\'t bad. One thing I found most ""buggy"" is the ball, because it seems just white when moving.Sound: 8/10 Most voice actors fit, especially our MC Shou. The OP and OSTs are also amazing.Character: 6/10 The characters are unbalanced. We have Kota, that managed to recreate a pro\'s shot after seeing it a couple times. There is Ryuuji, that can perfectly create own goals. And of course, we have our Aoto, words can\'t describe how ridiculous his skill is. Then comes Shou. Shou isn\'t, or at least wasn\'t bad. However, it seems like they forgot about his ""time-freeze and analyse skill"". Eventually, he just became a speaker for the strategies. Erika started off being this speed demon and cannot be matched. Eventually, it was forgotten as well.Enjoyment: 9/10 Surprisingly, even with all of my complains, I geniunely enjoyed this anime.Overall: 8/10 However, for the first almost half, it was about the 11 team.

The first one´s speed rivals several of the boys. And the second one, while being the weakest link at first, ultimately became a remarkable member of the team, mainly because of her stamina.Fourth, while seeming annoying and judgemental at first, the triplets are without a doubt the most charismatic characters in the anime. Initially, it appears that the three are just thugs who think lowly of the rest. But they certainly have a soft spot for their teammates, which is more visible during the middle part, and are also the ones who help the MC when he needs support.My only complaint rest on the soundtrack, mainly in the opening, which could have been stronger. The endings, on the other hand, are a little better.In conclusion, this anime is a hidden game that deserves a chance.

If you are a Real Madrid fan, at the end of the anime - specifically ep 38 & 39, you will just wanna kill the mangaka for sure. He absolutely 100% a Barca fan (I DON'T have any problem with that) and he never fails to downplay Real.NOW THE REVIEW :(Note : I am pissed of at the end of the series because of BAD Barca fan-service)Story :\t\t\t6/10Basically if you want to watch a binge worth fun anime, this one is...a very good one. Story is kinda straight forward and not that much on footballing term.

I am agree with them on 40% basis. The Mal score should be around 7.4-7.5 for this anime.

Gundam Build Fighters Try,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24625/Gundam_Build_Fighters_Try,"['I’m sure at one point in our childhood lives, we were fascinated with toys. Toys can do cool things like move around, make noises, and even do a bit of action. But what about Gundams? Piloting one would be impossible with our current technology in the modern world. However, we do have these cool little gadgets called Gunpla that resembles the big bad mecha you see in the franchise. Gundam Build Fighters Try returns for another season where Gunpla takes the skies and our characters steps into the driving seat.As a direct sequel, you may be asking if it’s imperative to watch the first season...known as ‘Gundam Build Fighters’. While it’s not entirely necessarily, it is very much recommended as there are cameos from important characters and interconnections to the main story. This season is directed by Shinya Watada and we have three main protagonists - Sekai Kamiki, Yuuma Kousaka, and Fumina Hoshino. They come from a school known as Seiho Academy where they form a team known as ‘Try Fighters’. The story tells of their journey revolving with Gunpla and how the sport revolutionized in their worldIf you’re new to the concept of Gundam, be sure to freshen your mind a bit from the first season. Set 7 years after the events of the first season but in the same universe, the sequel doesn’t go into info dumps; although it does revisit concepts on some breather episodes. Instead, the series focuses on Try Fighters and what I call a journey for them to make a name of themselves. But for starters, they debut as underdogs. Because let’s face it, almost everyone starts off as a newbie when it comes to sports. For team Try Fighters, they experiment with Gunpla battles and what it’s like to work together as a team. This is especially true for Sekai as he had virtually no experience involving Gunpla. What’s fascinating about Sekai isn’t just his skill in the martial arts but his great enthusiasm.  From his early debut, it’s easy to tell that he shows interest in Gunpla by the style he plays. His adaptation is almost surreal at times when we see how focused he is. On the other hand, we have Yuuma Kousaka who shows little interest at Gunpla. There’s actually a reason for this because of an event from his past although he later regains the confidence to fight again. His relationship with Sekai also has a rocky start as the two constantly gets into arguments. But later on, the show resolves their issues and unites them with the team. That actually brings up the final member of the team, Fumina Hoshino. As the leader, she enlists the help of Sekai and her childhood friend Yuuma to participate in Gunpla battles. For what this is worth, the show is pretty standard when it comes to its ideas. Yet with this basic setup, the show has this unanimous momentum from the beginning.The first episode clearly illustrates the intensity of Gunpla battles. No less than a minute into the sequel, we have all out battles between Gunpla piloted by skilled players. It’s also noticeable that the show introduces variety with many type of battles throughout the season. Gundam Build Fighters Try isn’t shy to stir up unique twists throughout its story whether it’d be creative battle fields or astonishing tactics to wow the audience. The sequel isn’t a stranger to diversity either with all types of mobile suite appearing from the other Gundam series. This is what will inspire fans to stay in touch with the show especially for those who wants to see them in action again. Not to also mention, the show evolves with both new style of battle and rivals. This revolves with Team Build Try’s journey and the experience they gain by facing against powerful adversaries. The show adds texture to their growth by presenting both wins and losses. By losing, they also learn from their mistakes and it’s what makes them evolve. For what is worth, the show is like an experience for these rising stars.With a show like this, it also depends on acceptance. If you’re looking for a series involving intergalactic wars or tragic storytelling, then you may be in the wrong place. Gundam Build Try is more of a fun show with interesting concepts involving Gunpla. It has some ambiguous way of storytelling with characters’ roles that all connects with the story. Then, there are the straightforward parts with conventional fashion involving Gunpla.  I dare say that the series is also thoughtful when it comes to characters. All of them have some sort of unique personality that makes them stand out on their own. When they are put together as a team, it brings the best out of them individually and collectively. The series also adapts solid action with consistency when it comes to pacing. Every battle (regardless win, loss, or draw) has some sort of meaning that further expands the story’s purposes. If you’re a fan of Gundam and the first season, you may be more surprised by what this season can do.Despite with all the fun style of the series and its highly entertaining doses, it does suffer some problems. Pacing sometimes become an issue when some episodes feeling a bit sluggish while other times may resolve issue in quick fashions. The show also has a more amateur feeling with the characters looking goofy. In essence, the show doesn’t adapt a serious or mature style like Gundam 00 or Gundam Seed. After all, the show is treated more as a sport for fans united for their passion to compete. The downside of this is that it may sway fans who are looking beyond more than that. Although the series’ story does go beyond Gunpla battles on occasions, it’s still the main focus and patience will be a key to adapt with the season’s style. Sometimes though, the series seems to try a bit too hard with itself. Comedy becomes part of this mix with cheesy lines and interactions. The show’s performance with its overall story tone also feels repetitive and can also be predictable at times. Tossing this aside, there are also moments when the show just feels too goofy for its own good when it comes to themes such as romance.Similar to the first season, Gundam Build Fighters Try adapts the animation quality with a platform of creativity. Every single Gunpla in the show is unique whether it’s Sekai’s Build Burning Gundam, Fumina’s SD mobile suits, or even Bearguy used by Sekai’s elder sister. Speaking of which, the show also has a colorful sense with its character casts. Mirai Kamiki is designed with elegance and beauty while other characters such as Fumina has a more tomboyish outlook. Sekai may remind people of Reiji from the first season (hey even Ral mentions that he could be his second coming) with his character design. Still, the majority of the creativity comes with the Gunpla models and unique battles they participate in. It also seizes every opportunity to bring out the best of them with its intense battle scenarios. Although many of the battles are team-play, single one-on-one battles are also adapted well with full throttle action. You may sometimes have to catch a break or two after watching.Soundtrack remains top notch if you are familiar with the first season. The OST exceeded my expectations and will leave you a strong impression if you are a fan for action. As for the main characters, each of them has a good note for their voice. Sekai is a prime example for the energy he brings into this show. Not only that but every character seems to have a life with their voice mannerisms. They also reflect the personalities in battle too when the opportunities come to give them their time to shine. Finally, OP and ED songs are decent with BACK-ON returning for the first theme. The ED songs also have a decorative sequence as a way of motivation.Gundam Build Fighters Try is a show that I recommend to not just for those who enjoyed the first season but also if you’re interested in something different from the usual mecha wars. The series undertakes the task to adapt this unique sport with a very colorful cast of characters. Throw those in with a variety of Gunpla along the way and you’ll get entertainment. It also has a story of course with a sense of purpose and it never loses track of what it’s trying to do. And although it may lose focus on occasions with its pacing, the show ultimately connects together as a way to celebrate the Gundam franchise. known as ‘Gundam Build Fighters’.

Then, there are the straightforward parts with conventional fashion involving Gunpla.  I dare say that the series is also thoughtful when it comes to characters. All of them have some sort of unique personality that makes them stand out on their own. When they are put together as a team, it brings the best out of them individually and collectively. The series also adapts solid action with consistency when it comes to pacing. Every battle (regardless win, loss, or draw) has some sort of meaning that further expands the story’s purposes. If you’re a fan of Gundam and the first season, you may be more surprised by what this season can do.Despite with all the fun style of the series and its highly entertaining doses, it does suffer some problems. Pacing sometimes become an issue when some episodes feeling a bit sluggish while other times may resolve issue in quick fashions. The show also has a more amateur feeling with the characters looking goofy. In essence, the show doesn’t adapt a serious or mature style like Gundam 00 or Gundam Seed. After all, the show is treated more as a sport for fans united for their passion to compete. The downside of this is that it may sway fans who are looking beyond more than that. Although the series’ story does go beyond Gunpla battles on occasions, it’s still the main focus and patience will be a key to adapt with the season’s style. Sometimes though, the series seems to try a bit too hard with itself. Comedy becomes part of this mix with cheesy lines and interactions. The show’s performance with its overall story tone also feels repetitive and can also be predictable at times. Tossing this aside, there are also moments when the show just feels too goofy for its own good when it comes to themes such as romance.Similar to the first season, Gundam Build Fighters Try adapts the animation quality with a platform of creativity. Every single Gunpla in the show is unique whether it’s Sekai’s Build Burning Gundam, Fumina’s SD mobile suits, or even Bearguy used by Sekai’s elder sister. Speaking of which, the show also has a colorful sense with its character casts. Mirai Kamiki is designed with elegance and beauty while other characters such as Fumina has a more tomboyish outlook. Sekai may remind people of Reiji from the first season (hey even Ral mentions that he could be his second coming) with his character design. Still, the majority of the creativity comes with the Gunpla models and unique battles they participate in. It also seizes every opportunity to bring out the best of them with its intense battle scenarios. Although many of the battles are team-play, single one-on-one battles are also adapted well with full throttle action. You may sometimes have to catch a break or two after watching.Soundtrack remains top notch if you are familiar with the first season. The OST exceeded my expectations and will leave you a strong impression if you are a fan for action. As for the main characters, each of them has a good note for their voice. Sekai is a prime example for the energy he brings into this show. Not only that but every character seems to have a life with their voice mannerisms. They also reflect the personalities in battle too when the opportunities come to give them their time to shine. Finally, OP and ED songs are decent with BACK-ON returning for the first theme. The ED songs also have a decorative sequence as a way of motivation.Gundam Build Fighters Try is a show that I recommend to not just for those who enjoyed the first season but also if you’re interested in something different from the usual mecha wars. The series undertakes the task to adapt this unique sport with a very colorful cast of characters. Throw those in with a variety of Gunpla along the way and you’ll get entertainment. It also has a story of course with a sense of purpose and it never loses track of what it’s trying to do. And although it may lose focus on occasions with its pacing, the show ultimately connects together as a way to celebrate the Gundam franchise.', ""Gundam build fighters Try is the Sequel to the Gundam build fighters, it takes place 7 years after and introduces us to a whole new range of characters and Gundams which are pitted against each other in battle.Despite being a sequel, you don't need to have seen the first season to understand what is going on. Its essentially a standalone, and as a standalone its a decent anime. It has an interesting premise, some half decent characters, and a good deal of action to entertain you. It wont be the best thing you watch, nor the worst. HOWEVER, in comparison to the original this...is an absolute disappointment. If you're considering watching this after seeing the original, I highly recommend avoiding it.Story: 3The Story of GBFT revolves around 3 main characters and their journey to win the National gunpla battle tournament. Its very simplistic, without any real plot twists or depth, but that said it has some cool side story moments such as the hospital scene, but that doesn't make up for a generally lackluster plot.Art: 5The art in GBFT is decent, the Gundams are nicely drawn with good variety between the models. The beams and explosions look aesthetically pleasing, especially the flames of the Build Burning Gundam. There's also nice texturing on the Gundams when they take damage.Where it loses points is in the animation. It's really not very special. Many of the fights consist of the same attack animations just be re-used. Especially for the Build Burning. It makes the fights rather lackluster to watch, seeing as how it doesnt really deviate a great deal. The only fight that was really animated well that comes to mind was the exhibition fight in the 25th episode.Sound: 8If there is something I love about this series as a whole its the sound. The OST for both series's. The soundtracks are all well done and can standalone as individual songs, the second opening song for Try Fighters were also very nice and is one of my Favorite anime intro's to date.The sound effects for the fights are also nicely done, the beams sound powerful, and when the gundams break, or hit each other, it sounds like they're actually mecha's and not just plastic models.Characters: 4I Mentioned before that in comparison to the original that Try fighters is a disappointment, and it is mostly in the characters. In Build Fighters, Sei and Reiji felt like real people. They didn't act all pretentious, their dialogue was well scripted and sounded like real life conversation (they also didn't feel the need to scream out their attack names EVERY SINGLE TIME).Try Fighters main characters are somewhat lackluster and one dimensional.Not to mention pretentious. Sekai is a generic headstrong protag who rushes in without thinking, Yuuma is some 15yr old kid who is depressed cos someone beat him and his character development consists of going from not thinking he's good at Gunpla to having some confidence in himself. That's it.Fumina starts off being cool, she's the glue of the group and the team leader. She co-ordinates the other 2 and is a strong participant in the battles. Her character changes midway through the series however, after 3rd or 4th battle, she suddenly becomes a supporting character with a crush on Sekai, and begins to take on the generic role of the girl who constantly gets jealous of the main character interacting with other females. Her strength disappears and she ceases to really co-ordinate the team, acting as a support instead.Outside of the mains, there are some half decent side characters. Some are from the original series, a lot of the new ones conform to generic stereotypes however making them rather boring to watch. (Boxer kid was great tho)Overall: 5Really, this is just another generic anime about Gundams. It doesn't have any of the charm of the original series. The characters arent as likable or real, the fights are boring and repetitive. And the dialogue is so cringey at times that I pulled out my phone to distract myself from it.Not really worth watching, the First season was far, far better. is an absolute disappointment.

Are this show worth the watch let's find out.Story.The story are almost literally the same as the first season expect it  feels more dumped down this time.Why you make ask?Well for starters the writing in this season are clearly not that good because remember the amazing humour that the first season had. Well the first season type of humour are gone and it's replace with meh humour at best too,, cringe-worthy humour at worst.Secondly this season feels more like a battle shounen more than a hobby that  people can enjoy equally because the rivals in the season behave more like a generic villains that just wants power for they own deeds.That's alone hurts the characterisation for this cast and it's really a shame that writers went for a shounen route this time. The first season had its shounen moments but it was less notable due too,, the great character interactions and strategies that happens in the first season.Also the battles are all predictable and boring because in S1 theyre was a lot of strategies in the fight and also the battles were almost non predictable. In Try however fights are boring, unexciting and too,, add insult too,, injury they are a bunch of Deus Ex Machina now meaning whenever team try fighters are in a hopeless situation Sekai Gunpla will magically get stronger just too,, advance the plot.I have admit that some of the fights were hype but the hype factor was negated due to god awful plot armour and Deus Ex Machinas that the Team Try Fighters have.Lastly the whole theme of enjoying the hobby gets thrown out of the freaking window due to a certain character who literally has no passion or interest of the hobby gunpla.Overall the story of Build Fighters Try was terrible.3/10Characters.If I have to describe the character cast in a nutshell it would be wasted potential and very poorly written.Sekai is a terrible main lead who is basically a bootleg Reiji with hardly any reddening values whatsoever.I will admit he was kinda tolerable in the first few episodes but as the show progressed and once we got to the tournament arc of Try. He devolves into a hot headed Gary Sue. Not gonna a lie.One thing that I hated about Sekai is how he didn't care about the hobby of gunpla.All he wants to do is get in the battlefield and spam he's Jigen Haoh School moved towards his opponents without giving a second thought about his teammates as well as his own gunpla.Overall I really hate Sekai.Next we have Fumina...What the hell did you do to this character Sunrise?Fumina starts off being a potential great female lead because she are a team leader and she was a strong combatant for the first couple of fights.As the series however literally becomes a supporting character because reasons?What really pissed me of about this Fumina are ever since she became a supporting character she started doing retarded shit like being a half ass tsundere, joins Sekai 's harem and the final nail of the coffin for Fumina are she literally got nerfed  too,, death meaning she are more weak than any supporting characters in the first season. That are just sad.In general Fumina are just perfect example of a wasted potential character.You thought Fumina was missed potential Yuuma are literally a badly written character.He's boring, pretentious, uninteresting and he’s are really a poor man’s Sei, Not too,, mention Yumma sup plot are just terrible because you won’t believe this wonderful writing The main reason why he's depressed and stop playing altogether Gunpla because somebody beat him in a Gunpla battle.Let's say that again. The main reason why he's depressed and stopped playing Gunpla altogether because somebody beat him in a Gunpla battle.What’s even worst about this he's stopped playing Gunpla because of humiliation not because of an illness or family issues and by the way those are perfect sup plot sets for this character but no we get a poorly written revenge story instead because we haven't got enough of those stories right.Overall Yuuma are a terrible character.The rest of the characters are also not that good.In fact the side characters in TRY hurt the anime more than the story and the main characters because the side characters here are just really bad.Don't get me started how comical the rivals here because they don't have any passion for the gunpla battle whatsoever and most of them are doing it for the money, some school pride or some business shit.Don't get me started with the whole harem thing with Sekai with the three girls.Also the character interactions were just bad and at times cringe-worthy.Overall the characters in Gundam Build Fighters Try were really bad and the show biggest fault by a long shot.2/10VisualsThe first season of Build Fighters has great looking visuals as well as great animation that hardly has any stock footage. I cannot say the same about Build Fighters Try.The visuals have stayed the same from season 1 however I feel the character can go a bit too off model at times not to mention some of the character reactions are just downright cringe-worthy.As for actual animation I honestly thought the animation for Try is a massive step down as half of the fights were choppy as hell as well as having a lot of stock footage especially in the tournament arc where the stock footage became almost as bad as Seed Destiny's Stock Footage. Am not even joking when I say that.Almost all of Sekai moves are just recycled stock footage from previous fights.The only good thing about the visuals are the mecha designs which I found most of the them to be pretty cool lookingOverall the visuals of Try were a big step down from season 1 and it has some of the worst animation that I have experience in a Gundam show.4/10Sound.The OST itself are good for what it was but compare too,, the first season its not that great and it times it can be forgettable.I can hardly remember a single track from the ost at all and this really sad because the first season ost are one of my favourite ost in anime.The first opening Cerulean by BACK-ON are a good song and it really fits into the show really well and it's also one best parts of Gundam Build Fighters Try. It's catchy as hell and its a good listen.The second opening Just Fly Away by EDGE of LIFE are also a good song but compare too,, the first opening its just okay and its feels more like a ending theme in my opinion.Even tho Gundam Build Fighters Try has 2 good openings its simply can't complete with the first season opening 2 wimp ft. Lil’Fang (from FAKY) by BACK-ON because one the song had its own charm and secondly it was catchy and lastly the song was pure hype.The first ending theme Amazing The World  by SCREEN mode are a great song and its easily the best ending theme from the Gundam Build Fighters series.The second ending theme Mayomayo Compass wa Iranai by StylipS are a okay ending theme. Nothing more nothing less.At this time of the Gundam Build Fighters Try has a dub and too,, be honest with you. The dub are decent nothing in more nothing lessIf you had a choice of sub or dub I would say stick with the sub unless you like watching dubbed anime such as myself.7/10Final Thoughts.Wasted Potential are easily the best way to describe Gundam Build Fighters Try as a whole.It's has terrible characterisation, pretentious sub plots, weak story, very predictable fights that have contains lots of plot armour and deus ex machina, a borderline forgettable ost, stupid harem and its ultimately unsatisfying at the end.On its own its a bad Gundam title but if you compare it to the well written first season its a train-wreck.It takes away the fun of the first season and actually takes away a lot of the charm of the first season and it’s really a shame. If you’re planning to watch this only watch it for the mecha battles.I honestly rather watch Seed Destiny and Gundam Wing than touch this piece of shit again because least Gundam Wing and Seed Destiny had some good things in it. Try has nothing and because of this its now my third worst Gundam show I have ever seen only losing to F91 and Gundam AGE.Final Score 3.5/10 I will be reviewing the squeal to the sleeper hit Gundam Build Fighters Gundam Build Fighters Try.

As to be expected, this sequel is similar to the original Gundam Build Fighters, but they are not as naturally talented and the characters must fight together and grow together to achieve a joint goal. If you haven't seen...the original, you don't need to watch it to understand this one but it's also very good and you should check it out.

As a sequel of Gundam Build Fighters, it is inevitable that a comparison will be made between the two. With that said, I will to the best of my ability to write this review in both objective and subjective manner.Story (5/10)The story of Gundam Build Fighters Try is awfully similar to its prequel. That is, a tournament style story where our main characters are aiming to win the National championship with the use of their gunpla. In that sense, Try’s story is also similar to any other tournament...style stories.The pacing of Try is somewhat slow until around more than half of the episodes. It is understandable as the first half is used as a buildup and setup for the main character’s personalities, motivation and also for introducing their future opponents. The comedies present in Try are to an extent comedic and funny.The problem that lies in Try is neither because of its settings nor its story. Rather, it’s due the way it presents the story to us viewers. The way it presents itself follow a simple basic formula that is the opponents are there to fulfill their role as punching bag until the main characters fight final opponent. Granted, this is not always the case, but most of the time it is like this. Hence, making the plot utterly predictable right when a certain opponent appears. But that is not all, I find that the story’s execution is rather dull due to other reasons unrelated to how the story goes, which I will explain in other section.Characters (4/10)Now, this is the part where the prequel executes better than its sequel, which, I believe serves as the downfall of Try. Because of its focus in battle, there’s almost no character development….for most of the opponents that is. I mean, they are just there, to be beaten so that our main characters can proceed in the tournament, nothing else. Main characters do get developed, but not all of them are developed fully. If I have to say so only Yuuma Kousaka gets developed fully and Fumina Hoshino comes second.Other than the lack of character development, Try also suffers in character interaction. Unlike the friendly rivalry that’s going on with all the opponents in the prequel, the only thing that we can call interaction in Try is between the main rivals.  Like I have written before, most of the opponents are just there so that the main characters can climb to their main rivals, which is the reason why it gives the story a dull taste.Animation (7/10)I’ve got to say Animation in Try is well done. The animation for the battles is smooth even for the minor battles. While there are some low qualities here and there, it is forgivable. Though in term of choreography, I feel that GBF wins over Try in this category. I’m not saying the choreography is bad per say, but it just felt pale in comparison to its prequel, and some of them are overly exaggerated.Sound (9/10)To me, this is the strongest point of Try. The music is really good, memorable and well placed. The voice acting is good just like any other anime standard. While the voice acting is good even with the change of voice actor (Mr. Ral), there’s one character whose voice irks me, which  that I also find not suitable in shouting, the said name of the character is Lady Kawaguchi.If there’s anything I can truly in Try is in the music, it helps to liven up the atmosphere. And a lot of the tracks are memorable. What comes as a surprise is the addition of sound effects in the second opening, which is the first time I’ve encountered in my anime watching pilgrimage.Enjoyment (6/10)I did enjoy around the first 10 episodes of Try. But, because of the lackluster character development and interaction in later episodes, my enjoyment level went down a bit, and I adaptively lower my expectation for the anime. I hereby declare that the prequel still shines over the once hyped sequel.Total Score: 31/50All in all, if you want to watch Gundam Build Fighter Try, watch it for the battle and the comedies. style stories.The pacing of Try is somewhat slow until around more than half of the episodes.

While the voice acting is good even with the change of voice actor (Mr. Ral), there’s one character whose voice irks me, which  that I also find not suitable in shouting, the said name of the character is Lady Kawaguchi.If there’s anything I can truly in Try is in the music, it helps to liven up the atmosphere. And a lot of the tracks are memorable. What comes as a surprise is the addition of sound effects in the second opening, which is the first time I’ve encountered in my anime watching pilgrimage.Enjoyment (6/10)I did enjoy around the first 10 episodes of Try. But, because of the lackluster character development and interaction in later episodes, my enjoyment level went down a bit, and I adaptively lower my expectation for the anime. I hereby declare that the prequel still shines over the once hyped sequel.Total Score: 31/50All in all, if you want to watch Gundam Build Fighter Try, watch it for the battle and the comedies.', '{Note: This is the sequel to the series ""Gundam Build Fighters."" I recommend one to watch and possibly finish that one first. Not required to understand this but will aid in doing so.}Sunrise has released the second season of the GBF series this Winter season, Gundam Build Fighters Try! Now, my first impression was the word ""Try."" Was it a variation of ""Tri,"" meaning ""three?"" At first that seems weird and out-of-place, but it proves to not be and it is not a variation! That only leads to the awesomeness and the mystery encased inside this anime series.Story: 7/10The story revolves around three students, Sekai...Kamiki, Fumina Hoshino, and Yuma Kousaka to go after the Gunpla Under-19 Championship, and well, be champions! Along the way, they make worthy rivals and supportive allies that trigger the plethora of sub-plots. From relationships to simple events, this anime has got a whole lot of fun and feels to it! Although that, it still earned an 8 due to the lack of originality, but that is expected. A bit fast-paced, but it\'s still good nevertheless.Art: 9/10As a model builder myself, it would not be an understatement to say that Gunpla is mostly about the quality and how it\'d do in battle. The art is very nice here and shows its true nature during the intense battles and/or showcasing. In-battle effects like explosions and beams are very well-detailed and it brings the match to life really. Everything else is average. The Gunpla themselves? With new designs and a whole new world of arsenal and art, GBFT is a door to what a builder might look for!Sound: 9/10I can\'t say much for sound. The OSTs and music during battle or even during the emotional parts were perfect and blended in nicely with the atmosphere; emphasizing the aura of that moment. Made it all the more epic or sad. The 2 openings were awesome really and super catchy. ED1 was nice too. Very upbeat and nicely introduces each episode.Character: 9/10The cast for GBFT is a pretty big one despite our three main heroes. They come in a lot of different roles in respect to the three mains. From rivals to onlookers to mentors or even siblings, GBFt manages to get them all into the picture and get them to contribute to the plot. With a whole new spectrum of personalities and quirkiness, GBFT\'s cast of charas will not fail to make your day brighter at new characters coming in everytime!Enjoyment: 9/10Let\'s face it. What is Gundam? Big robot battles that fight in the midst of space! Alright so what\'s Gunpla? Building big robots that will then fight battles in the midst of space! Haha maybe big is an over-exaggeration here, but I do enjoy and look forward to every episode. Especially during the tournaments, one episode leaves you hanging for the next! It draws you in and keeps you wanting more!Verdict: 9/10GBFT started out alright and when I first saw it, I had high hopes that it\'d do as well if not better than its predecessor! At the end, I am proud to say that this anime did quite well and slight surpassed (or just stayed in par) with GBF. I personally recommend this to ANY gundam/gunpla fan out there as it perfectly incorporates the kind of people you meet in any world of a hobby. You have the nice ones, the rivals, and the ones who need more learning! GBFT is the highlight of this season and I look forward to a third season!

It provides comedy with combat and teaches some moral lessons.art: Characters and gunplas looked amazing. The animations were done perfectly.Sound: This anime definitely has the best OSTs. Almost every BGM were worth listening over and over again and still finds them amazing.Character: Love the character portraits. They have different personalities and roles in the game. You can see the main characters all have their very own background and they develop as the story goes.This anime has all the essence to make a top tier anime.

Overall, if you enjoyed the original, you'll be satisfied.I would argue that Sekai aside, Fumina and Yuuma are both far more interesting than either of the original leads. They both have rivalries built into their back stories, rivalries that are established early and resolved in a satisfying if predictable way.  This is done by having the protagonists often interact with their rivals well before they meet in battle, something that wasn't usually the case in the original.Story wise, this follows the typical anime tournament structure like the original. The...obligatory training episodes were a lot more engrossing then in other shows, especially with the Meijins around. There really isn't an antagonist (unlike the original), so the story does lean on personal rivalries to add weight to the battles, which I believe was a good decision.Battle animation hasn't missed a beat, though like the original, but the over-reliance on Sekai using some new DBZ-esque attack gets rather tiresome. I guess if you liked G Gundam, this might be a positive.Overall, a solid series that maintains the quality of the original, while providing protagonists with more interesting back stories. obligatory training episodes were a lot more engrossing then in other shows, especially with the Meijins around.

But most people here in the reviews are going on about how the original is better, and yes I will have to agree too, but you know what? I still enjoyed this. Reading the reviews of this anime made me realize that I\'m still quite like an anime newb watcher (not really though) Because I enjoyed the anime thoroughly and only noticed the flaws...afterwords reading the other reviews, yes this series does make me feel like a kid again, even though I still am.Anyway,The story is almost the same as Gundam Build Fighters, except on a smaller scale, and to be honest I liked it better that it was on a lesser scale, it really gives off the feeling how the next generation is carrying on the hopes and dreams of the previous generation through their love of Gundam. Just like the original GBF it has a more light hearted approach on Gundam.Since this is the more recent installment of the GBF series, it obviously has better art and animation, I personally think it\'s fine, the Gunpla look nice and move well, the art with the characters may look plain but they look fine too. But hey, I think GBFT would be completely fine to show to kids, and if you compare this to whatever American ""action"" toons are, they will find it freakin amazing.One of my favorite parts is the music, which I think is better than the original (except for the EDs the GBF EDs were so catchy!) I always think an OP is supposed to get you excited/ready to start the show and enjoy it and that\'s exactly what it did.Now, here is where I, and everyone else starts talking about the meh points of this anime.The…CHARACTERS!Everyone here is right when they say the characters are really nothing special. I do think they started out well (some of them at least) but in the end just..nothing new, they were just..done before. The only thing I really enjoyed about the anime was appearances of characters from the original, (But I like Shia tho)And one more thing about the characters, it couldn\'t have been only me that thought this, and It does kinda seem dumb, but 2 of the main characters look pretty similar in some sense to the previous GBF MCs. Sekai looks like Reiji, and Yuuma looks like Sei.But I still enjoyed it for the most part. Which is pretty interesting this series has caught my eye since it kinda takes genres and my sub-genres I don\'t really care much for (Tournaments, and Gundams)But probably the things that make me enjoy this anime is just it makes me feel like a kid again.And, that I really like seeing people passionate about things they love, (unless it\'s really cringey)So overall, it\'s a nice watch casually, but the first season is still way more superior.Story (6)Art (8)Sound (8)Character (5)Enjoyment (7)OVERALL: 7Thank you for reading! afterwords reading the other reviews, yes this series does make me feel like a kid again, even though I still am.Anyway,The story is almost the same as Gundam Build Fighters, except on a smaller scale, and to be honest I liked it better that it was on a lesser scale, it really gives off the feeling how the next generation is carrying on the hopes and dreams of the previous generation through their love of Gundam.

The hype was pretty high, I'd say, and Sunrise definitely delivered - just not in the way a lot of us expected to. The series is still good, and that's what matters.Note: This review contains small spoilers, including small spoilers about the story and the characters. Also, the designs. (This review also assumes you've seen the first Build Fighters, which you definitely should before watching Try.)Story: 6/10Not a good start already, is it? Try takes place seven years after the first season of Build Fighters, with...an entirely new cast of main characters, including some cameos from the first season - such as Mr. Ral (or Ramba Ral, really) and Meijin Kawaguchi. The story is practically the same like in the first season, albeit with a few changes.Sei Iori already left the school years ago, and since then, the Mobile Suit Club deteriorated, and hard, considering one of the main characters, Fumina Hoshino, is it's last member. All of that changes after the arrival of Sekai Kamiki, who at first shows ignorance towards Gunpla, but then shows some form of interest into it. They're then joined by Yuuma Kousaka, China's brother.What annoys me the most about the story is how there are little changes to the story compared to the original - the goal of the plot is to win the Gunpla Tournament. There's less originality in the plot, and far less drama, and when the drama finally appears, it doesn't last for long - although I got to admit, one of the episodes sets this drama rather well and makes for an amazing fight. Despite all of these setbacks, the story still isn't bad, and it's still fairly good. There's definitely more comedic relief than in the first season, too.Art: 9/10Build Fighters is one of the few series where Sunrise fully realized its' potential with artwork and designs, due to the creativity that is the main drive of the series. All of the custom designs look great, and they have effects to boot. I wish I could talk more about the designs, since they all look so great, but I can't say much without spoiling everything. I can say one thing, however, and that's that you'll be surprised by the amount of unique design and performance choices of every Gunpla.Sound: 9/10Just like the first season, Try definitely delivers in the terms of sound. A lot of the effects and moves have their own set of sounds to follow them, especially Sekai's fighting style. The music is a bit forgettable, in my opinion, but it's great and fits all of the scenes well. Some of the tracks are also taken from the first season, which doesn't hurt much, considering how good the tracks were. The openings are also good, and the reappearance of the band BACK-ON is welcome.Characters: 6/10This is where the series falls a bit again, just not by a huge amount. Sekai feels like a boulder in his character development, and he doesn't develop much, unlike Yuuma or Fumina. His incompetence in certain episodes is either funny or hurts a bit to watch. There's no real villains in the second season, there's only opponents. Some of them are still very well made, but most of them only think about victory. I'd expect most of them to enjoy the fights, and not to be driven by personal gains or vendetta in a tournament with models out of plastic.Enjoyment: 9/10Still, that isn't near enough to ruin my enjoyment of the series. All of the fighting scenes are great and show just how much can Sunrise do, given the right situation. I still wish the scenes could be longer though, but that's just a pipe dream.Overall: 7/10Overall, the series definitely isn't as good as the first season, but it's still very enjoyable and good. I had a lot of issues thinking about the points I would bring out the most - most of them don't matter if you just want to enjoy the series, which you definitely can.Would I recommend the series? Yes. Although it's debatable if you enjoy it or not, it's a series I'll remember for a long, long time.Points:+Great designs.+Amazing soundtrack and sound overall.+Great enjoyment value.-The story is practically a rehash of the first season.-Characters tend to be forgettable and their development is mostly small.(Thanks for reading this review, if you ever got to this point. If you're confused reading this, don't worry, I was as well. I had a hard time trying to make the review understandable and to the point, but in the end, I think I didn't do that well.

Hetalia: The World Twinkle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28607/Hetalia__The_World_Twinkle,"[""The fangirl favorite of yesteryear has come back in its sixth season and it showcased a competent season of Hetalia. I found it as one of the decent shows of Summer season. Here's my review.Story: 5/10Hetalia always excels when it does not tame itself. Historical parodies and racist remarks have been always its forte which can range from hilarious to WTF effect. However, the jokes this time can forge a smile at best and indifference at worst. I cannot remember many moments which caused me to chuckle save Russia's episode and the Micronations which I think are the series' highlights. These are the only situations...where their quirks work favorably in their favor.We get some fairly entertaining historical episodes (the snippets of WW2 in Africa, a story from Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Canada's episode and how Germany came to be) but these pale in comparison with Gakuen Hetalia and Hetalia of the Dead (The Beautiful World) and with Prussia's mistake for Hungary's gender and Japan's tour with Italy (The World Series). With the segments gone, the humor which emphasizes on cultural quirks has gone stale due to its usage too many times before. The World Twinkle also ended in a very strange way that is totally random and devoid of humor.Even when it tries to be heartwarming ( a story from Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Iceland's birthday party and Davie), the result is inferior with its predecessor probably because of the episode order the staff decided on.  The whole series felt like a diluted sequel that is reminiscent of the weaker parts of Hetalia: The World Series in the end.Art: 6/10While the artwork is still a notch above from the first four seasons of Hetalia, it is a step down from the visually pretty The Beautiful World. It retained the character designs last season but it seemed like the animation feels rigid probably because of the tight budget. The characters get deformed at times when they move and their designs have less details than the last season.Sound: 7/10The minimalist score is still continued to be used and the voice actors still give their best in bringing these characters to life.  By the way, Hetalian Jet is a fairly catchy ending song.My only main beef with this season as regards to this matter is it does not know how to put the right background music at the right moment. The World Twinkle's serious episode (Davie) was supposed to be sad but was misdirected by giving it a puzzling score which destroyed the mood of the episode.Characters: 6/10With fifteen episodes running at five minutes each, it is impossible to give every character the exposure for the audience to fully grasp the humor they present. The staff was left in a pinch to take the risk of showing them all or to play it safe to focus with the main characters. They chose the former with mixed results.Russia's straightforward insanity never gets old whenever he switches his personality gentle to yandere. The Micronations are one heck of an entertaining batch. They were able to humor the audience with their personality in a span of two episodes  (Molossia takes the cake, I guess).The Nordics are interesting but their presence in the series is pretty much introductory. We also get to be introduced with Canada but his 'Who-is-he' joke has long overstayed its welcome even before that episode. The main trio (Japan, Italy and Germany) and the Allied were mostly relegated to the sidelines. Prussia never gets out of his pompous behavior which is likable but makes the viewers wish that he gets more than that role.Hetalia has never been known with serious character development but The World Twinkle's manner of showing its characters is so scatterbrained that I even forgot to root in anyone of them.Enjoyment: 5/10I am a long time Hetalia fan so I can safely say that The World Twinkle is its weakest season. Will it gather new fans? No. This is solely for those who are already acquainted with the series. If the staff wants to regain its old glory, they gotta adapt some seriously better episodes. where their quirks work favorably in their favor.We get some fairly entertaining historical episodes (the snippets of WW2 in Africa, a story from Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Canada's episode and how Germany came to be) but these pale in comparison with Gakuen Hetalia and Hetalia of the Dead (The Beautiful World) and with Prussia's mistake for Hungary's gender and Japan's tour with Italy (The World Series).

It's not as beautiful as Hetalia: The Beautiful World, but it's a refreshing change of art style.Sound: 7/10A lot of brass instruments are used, since many of the sketches takes place during WW2. The voice actors do their job well and nothing significantly has changed since the last season.Characters 8/10The characters and their interactions with each other is the core of Hetalia. A lot of new countries is introduced (such as the micronations in episode 9 and 10) and the Scandinavian countries get a lot more screen time (As a Dane, i like that) It's refreshing to see new countries and their interactions with each other, instead of the usual Italy-Germany-Japan gang.Enjoyment: 7/10I already knew what i went into when starting this show. It's Hetalia.The only thing that really caught me of guard was episode 11. It's nice to see Hetalia change, even if it's just for 1 episode.Overall: 7/10If you have watched Hetalia before, you'll definitely like this.If you haven't watched Hetalia before, you'll probably still enjoy this. It has some funny moment, good characters and you'll (maybe) even learn a few things about world history. Ep 5: Germany and Prussia bro it out over a beer.Ep 6: Germany goes full SS on Italy during the war in Africa.Ep 7: England and America talk about what to drink during the war in Africa.Ep 8: The war between Denmark and Sweden in 1657 explained.Ep 9: Sealand, Wy and Seborga tries to find some friends.Ep 10: Sealand, Wy and Seborga tries to find some friends.Ep 11: Melancholy, sad and totally unexpected from Hetalia.Ep 12: England and France discuss how to defeat the Axis powers.Ep 13: Russia tries to make friends, but comes of as creepy.Ep 14: Canada is ignored The Episode.Ep 15: Germany almost kills Italy and chibitalia returns.Art: 7/10The art for the opening and ending are really colorful and each character has a very distinct color pattern. It's not as beautiful as Hetalia: The Beautiful World, but it's a refreshing change of art style.Sound: 7/10A lot of brass instruments are used, since many of the sketches takes place during WW2. The voice actors do their job well and nothing significantly has changed since the last season.Characters 8/10The characters and their interactions with each other is the core of Hetalia. A lot of new countries is introduced (such as the micronations in episode 9 and 10) and the Scandinavian countries get a lot more screen time (As a Dane, i like that) It's refreshing to see new countries and their interactions with each other, instead of the usual Italy-Germany-Japan gang.Enjoyment: 7/10I already knew what i went into when starting this show. It's Hetalia.The only thing that really caught me of guard was episode 11. It's nice to see Hetalia change, even if it's just for 1 episode.Overall: 7/10If you have watched Hetalia before, you'll definitely like this.If you haven't watched Hetalia before, you'll probably still enjoy this. It has some funny moment, good characters and you'll (maybe) even learn a few things about world history."", ""I'm a fan, not a fangirl, let me get that clear. Forgive me as this will be my first review.Story: 7/10Story wise, it's all over the place. But that's Hetalia. Each episode being only five minutes long gives you very little time to put anything good together, yet somehow Hetalia has managed to not only put on one, not two, but even three strips all into a five minute long episode. That's saying only to the later half and previous seasons of the series. You can tell both pacing wise, and angle wise the first half has less of an impact from the first episode...or so to the episode which should have been an epic and hilarious fell flat as the cold setting it took place in.Art: 8/10Yes, it's a huge bump from season 1-4 like it's predecessor, but unlike it's predecessor, somehow the characters themselves were more like an imitation. But only for the first half. All artists have their own styles, and not everyone can draw the same way as others, however as an animator, the ability to copy is a necessity, yet somehow they managed to botch that up. It's especially clear when seen in the Nordics! But that was only visible in the first half.Music: 9/10The music is fine. It's the same as usual.Character: 8/10Characters are all over the place, raging from the super powers of the modern world, to the unacknowledged representations of micronations, and still more to be revealed. And like the show so are the personalities. If it sticks to the source material there's rarely anything you can complain about, other than the characters themselves.Enjoyment: 7/10Rather than a six, I'll give it a passing 7. The first half wasn't great, that's obvious. But it wasn't completely terrible, scene arrangement and pacing could have been better. If only that can be fixed for the dvd release, that would totally awesome but I doubt it. Other than that, the second half and pretty colors is enough to boost it up to a seven.Overall: 7/10Overall, kinda obvious, the first half needs some work, if it weren't 15 episodes long and the mess up episodes don't equal to half the season then I would have given a better score. But if DVD don't make sales a season seven may not be possible. And now waiting on the english release, I don't usually watch it english, but here's to finding a new Britain. or so to the episode which should have been an epic and hilarious fell flat as the cold setting it took place in.Art: 8/10Yes, it's a huge bump from season 1-4 like it's predecessor, but unlike it's predecessor, somehow the characters themselves were more like an imitation.

Hakushaku to Yousei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4551/Hakushaku_to_Yousei,"[""The one thing that always impresses me about anime and manga is the attention to detail that the japanese creators of individual stories have, especially when they utilise culture, history, folklore, etc, from other parts of the world as integral parts of their tales.Hakushaku to Yousei (or Earl and Fairy in english), began life as a series of light novels written by Tani Mizue, which were serialised in Cobalt magazine. The novels proved to be popular given the japanese love of western folklore and mythology, allowing the novels to be adapted for two drama CDs and a manga which is currently serialised in The...Margaret magazine.Before I go any further, I should point out that the story is most definitely unfinished, so expect a second, and maybe a third season at some point. That said, this initial series was rather well done on the whole.The story is set in Victorian England and follow the adventures of 17 year old Lydia Carlton, a &quot;Fairy Doctor&quot;. She has the ability to see and communicate with supernatural creatures like fairies, pixies, brownies, and other members of the Seelie Court, and for this reason she is chosen to help one Edgar J. C. Ashenbert in his quest to become the legendary Blue Knight Earl, the human ruler of the fairy nation. He is accompanied by his servant, a boy of around Lydia's age simply known as Raven, whilst Lydia is accompanied by a talking cat called Nico.The story doesn't follow a straightforward path though, as Edgar's quest is borne from a desire for vengeance, and he has some extremely deadly enemies to contend with, as well as dealing with fey creatures who can twist the meaning of words and promises to suit their needs. It's for this reason that he desperately requires Lydia's help, especially as he can neither see nor talk to fairies.The art and animation for this series is very well done, especially if you like bishies. The animation is generally very smooth, however my one gripe with the character designs was that Victorian England had a lot more plain looking people than the anime portrays (it would have been nice to see this, but it doesn't really affect the story). The characters that are in the show are all well designed though, especially Tomkins, whose features hint at his ancestry as one of the Merrow (merfolk). The fairy creatures are also well designed on the whole, and the members of the Unseelie Court all possess a suitably ominous appearance.The music throughout the series is actually rather well done, and generally matches the time period. However, there are moments when the music definitely spoils the mood of the scene, especially with the more tension filled moments where a more ominous piece of something classical would have served better than the J-rock/pop track from the OP. The VAs are generally very good, however there is sometimes a slightly one dimesnional note to the main characters because of a lack of emotion being projected through the voice.On the whole the characters were fairly solid. I found Lydia to be quite likeable, although this may be because she reminded me of Kou Shuurei from Saiunkoku Monogatari. Edgar was also quite likeable, however I found the supposed lack of emotion to be odd, especially given his feelings for Lydia. This is something that, unfortunately, carries over to many of the other characters, especially the males. For some reason they all seem to be protrayed as cool, icy, bishounens, when it would have served the story better if they let loose once in a while. It could be argued that this is in keeping with the Victorian setting, but it's more likely to be because this is most definitely a shoujo anime.I found this to be surprisingly enjoyable though, especially given it's flaws. I think that my enjoyment though, mainly comes from the fact that folklore is a hobby of mine, and I found that the numerous fey creatures and references were more closely related to what is in folklore than most people would believe (in other words, the old fairy tales where there's lots of blood, as opposed to the more modern version - the bedtime story). It shows that Tani Mizue actually referenced a fair amount of material during the writing of the light novels, and has used the information to good effect.This isn't really a series that will appeal to everyone. It's not complete enough to be a true shoujo anime, however it does highlight the fact that fey creatures aren't nice on the whole. It won't appeal to action or sports junkies, and probabaly won't be liked by mecha and combat fans. Horror buffs may like it for it's portrayal of fairies and the like, but the ones who will probably enjoy watching it the most are fans of Angelique, Saiunkoku Monogatari, Gakuen Alice, etc, especially given the romance aspect between Edgar and Lydia.If you do happen to like this because of the fairies though, then you may want to check out the following books:&quot;Faerie Tale&quot; by Raymond E Feist&quot;Lords &amp; Ladies&quot; and &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; by Terry Pratchett.

However, for one to enjoy it, expectations have to be set. The 12-episode anime is based only on a few volumes of the light novel series. Therefore, do not be surprised that at the end of the anime, there are still a lot of questions left unanswered. It is because the story still continues in the novels. Perhaps the producers are still planning or are leaving the door open for a second season.The characters are beautifully drawn and the designs, in fact, are slightly better than in the manga. The music, on the other hand,...is average. The opening theme is an upbeat rock song that is tolerable enough to listen to, but not very appropriate to the Victorian theme. The closing soundtrack is a sentimental love song that fits the mawkish ending sequence well. This gratuitous scene that features the male characters lying in bed half-naked is likely conceived in an effort to pander to young female audiences. They even made Edgar’s seiyuu sing it, even though his singing voice isn't as pleasant to hear as his speaking voice. (I may sound so negative, but I'm not exactly complaining).The two main characters of this anime are quite endearing. Lydia isn't exactly an extraordinary character but she is enchanting, graceful and kind-hearted, unlike the stereotypical shoujo heroines who are plain looking, dumb, clumsy, shameless, and whose only merit is their genkiness. She is a female protagonist who has self-respect and will not immediately throw herself to the guy she likes.Edgar is an intriguing character. While his bearing is not mysterious because of his rather pompous personality, everything about him is a mystery: his past and identity. But despite his shadiness, he is a sympathetic character. The others (including the villains), unfortunately, are somewhat boring and forgettable. They are incredibly generic and we get to know very little about them.If the other guys weren’t so flat, the romance would have been a lot more exciting and complex. Unfortunately, it is so obvious who Lydia will end up with even though she is surrounded by hot guys who are all interested in her. Raven is too loyal to Edgar to be his rival. Paul is such a dull character and too passive to challenge Edgar. Kelpie, on the other hand, though handsome, is rather charmless. But it seems the question this story is trying to answer isn’t who Lydia is going to choose, but how Edgar is going to gain her trust and love.Although this is definitely not one of the best anime I’ve seen, I truly enjoyed watching this series. It is a good romance anime: charming and entertaining enough to engage shoujo fans.If you are already a fan of the anime, I suggest that you read the light novels (the translations), so you'll know what happens after episode 12. They are also detailed and therefore more satisfying. The supporting characters are also more fleshed out and not dull as in the anime. I also recommend reading the manga since it is a more faithful adaptation (than the anime which is so condensed). It's also darker, whereas the anime is a little too girly. is average.

I was expecting much more from the plot and the characters, but to my misfortune I had only ended up disappointed. Once I finished viewing the entire series, I was not satisfied with the overall outcome of the characters' journey.Story: [6]There is still so many questions the anime has left unanswered. The viewer knows little of the Blue Knight Earl. The plot itself is mainly concentrated on Edgar's need to bear a name with a powerful presence, as well as to fight for his love for Lydia whilst others are after her. There was...still much to be told of the fairy world, but due to the focused romance between Lydia and Edgar, all other information of the anime becomes lost. Hence the reason why the anime became more choppy rather than bearing the fluent motion that other wonderful animes had.Art: [7]The art could've been done better. A fairy world is meant to be magical and enthralling. Matter of fact, if the creators had done their art in an inconspicuous way as to make the viewer imagine they are in a fairy world indirectly [similar artistic appeal to EF - Tale Of Memories and 5 Centimetres Per Second], then they would've received a higher grade. I do praise the art done in O'Neill's paintings though. It almost suits the time setting of the story.Sound: [7]I bestow a 7 upon the sound because not only does some music pieces relate to the specific time period of the story, but even the suspense scenes can allow the viewer to understand that there is critical observation involved between characters [e.g. Nico helping Paul search for Banshee, Lydia and Edgar figuring out Ulysses' motive, etc]. Thus, the sound was not too bad. Allow me to point out, if you will, how the theme song sounded like a Japanese version of Yellowcard?Character: [4]Indeed a 4 does seem pretty low, but I do have my reasons. Firstly, Edgar. The ash mauve eyes gave him a mysterious appeal. Yet his eyes implied nothing extravagant about his persona. Throughout the progression of the series, it felt to me that Edgar was a phony. The sincerity of his character was questionable. Was he a killer? Is he playing Lydia? What's going on? He didn't seem truthful enough. I had assumed he was only playing smooth as to win Lydia's trust in order to help him obtain the marrow sword. But as the plot proceeded, I wasn't too sure. Furthermore, his reactions are downright dull.   When he saw Ermine for the first time, it was as though he either kept on the smooth facade or was expecting her. What? Wasn't she dead? Wasn't he mourning her absence of some sort? It was ridiculous. Not to mention the cheesy romantic remarks made towards Lydia that further aggravated his reputation.I did take interest in Raven's mysterious, composed aura. Though I was left dissatisfied when he only mentioned his personal character in less than 2 episodes. I was craving for answers to the truth behind his sprite species, like what they were like and how it could be more of a disadvantage aside from the fact that possessing a sprite spirit caused him to kill on impulse. It's too bad though. Especially when he and Lydia shared their similarities, I was expecting the similarities to be elaborated. Oh well.As for Lydia, we know more of her profession than we do of her personal character. It's understandable on how she is a fairy doctor, which is good for the series. But how do we know how she was able to become a fairy doctor aside from the fact that she inherited the gift through her mother's genes? What did she have to go through? Was it difficult to be a fairy doctor at first aside from others believing you have crossed the brink of insanity? And what was the mother like in order to win the heart of a human professor? Her emotions are also puzzling. We understand that her heart was meddled with by mischievous boys as a child. Still, is she insecure? Is she afraid? Even Edgar asks those questions and yet she has failed to answer them. But overall, Lydia is rather cute [more in nature than in appearance] and has great knowledge of different worlds. But that is only one slice of the cake. If she were to show her personal side a little more, the viewer would have the whole cake and eat it too.Enjoyment: [5]I am not much of a fan of Shoujo animation. Nonetheless, I have encountered with Shoujo material that has caught my interest. Unfortunately for Hakushaku to Yousei, it failed to do justice. The corny romantic remarks made me laugh to a point where I questioned the seriousness. I am still sitting here questioning about over matters the series has not covered. The only thing good about the anime was its comedic nature. Truth be told, there isn't really anything unique about this anime. We've seen young, cute, silly girls attracting the attention of the dashing higherups. We've already seen supernatural matters that have brought two people together in holy matrimony. We've seen talking animals and non-human creatures causing trouble. At first glance, an Earl and a Fairy Doctor does sound different amongst the array of stereotypical Shoujo animes. But once peering through the depths, there isn't as much difference as I had initially perceived.Overall: [6]Keep in mind, if you will, how I am not bashing the series at all. I have seen worst. But I can admit that this anime wasn't as good as I had expected. I am giving the series a &quot;fair&quot; 6. It did leave me wondering, as most animes should.

The heroine is a &quot;fairy doctor,&quot; and throughout the show she demonstrates a touch of folklore, plus the useful ability to see fairies that are invisible to ordinary people.However, the folklore and mythology references, which could have carried the show, are under-used.  They are sprinkled over the top of a story which plainly is trying to drag itself out into the maximum number of episodes.  Unlike better stories (such as, say, Tweeny Witches, or Magical Shopping District Abenobashi) the mythology and folklore doesn't seem...internally consistent.  Thus the setting seems painfully generic.The character designs are decent;  the scenery has a lot of eye candy for folks who like the visual trappings of Victorian mansions.The animation is painfully sparse;  pan-and-scan tricks are over-used.  I give it a 6/10 for design but a 4/10 for animation, thus a 5/10 for overall art.

Direction is done by a...nobody who has produced nothing but passable titles.So our shoujo heroine TM Lydia is a doctor, something that can fool you to think she cures diseases and treats wounds. That would make her a heck of a dynamic female instead of a clueless dumb broad. But NAAAAH she is actually a FAIRY doctor, akin to a witch doctor or a shaman, able to see and communicate with the unseen world of mythological creatures. And that is all she is doing, so the whole inborn talent she has is just there to flavour the story with sparkles of magic. So instead of having rose petals and stars as nothing more than visual effects in the background, those are literally stuff that happen in real life… but only to her, because she is the only one who can see all that, so everybody else just thinks she is a nutjob. So much for superpowers if you can use them to do jack in your every day life and be sent to an asylum for no real reason.The problem with her is that she is penniless, since nobody would give a job to a 19th century girl, much less to a girl who claims she can see monsters in an age such things are considered nothing but fairy tales. Here is where the mysterious hunk TM Edgar enters the story and with his royal lineage and hairless chest asks her to help him find a sword to prove he is indeed an earl. Because finding that sword is apparently all it takes to prove to everyone you are who you claim to be; let’s hope some random peasant doesn’t get to it first because he will magically turn to a noble or something.Each of them has their own mascot pet to boot. Lydia has a talking fluffy cat that acts like a spoiled noble and Edgar has a butler bodyguard who kicks ass and is of course also a hunk. And thus the four of them go on a journey where she constantly is helpless, he is constantly mysterious, and their pets do all the comic relief and action scenes. That pretty much means that the protagonists have less appeal than their lackeys. YAWN!So here you are waiting to be excited with an adventure full of action and suspense. You get close to nothing because everything remains quite basic and blunt to the most part. The artwork is so weak and the antagonists so dull, you just don’t give a damn even if they accomplish whatever they want. And by the way, they don’t because the story is left incomplete. You also hope for some spicy romance to take place between them but NAAAAH not even that happens as everything remains on first base at best. There are many moments where they could have done much more than just holding hands but she keeps flipping and he just doesn’t try to force himself on her. How nice of him; too bad we don’t get a single interesting scene for the same reason.And that is pretty much all you get from this anime. Run down visuals, dull music, stereotypical shoujo characters who don’t do anything, piss poor action and adventure and an open ending showing you its middle finger. You might as well not bother watching this unless you so much want to be disappointed or have a heck of a lot free time to waste.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 5/10General Artwork 0/2 (run down)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (Victorian era and fairy tale feeling)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (average)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 3/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 1/2 (dull)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 0/2 (doesn’t exist)CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (none)Catharsis 0/2 (none)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to bother watching again such a dull and incomplete show)Memorability 1/4 (nothing much to bother remembering it)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 0/1 (looks lazy)Sound 0/2 (sounds dull)Story 1/3 (generic and heads nowhere)Characters 0/4 (stereotypes)VERDICT: 3.5/10 nobody who has produced nothing but passable titles.So our shoujo heroine TM Lydia is a doctor, something that can fool you to think she cures diseases and treats wounds.

Romance, Victorian-like style, and yes, a cat wearing what looked like butler attire. All those factors and the overall feeling the promotional images and the trailer gave off got me attracted to this charming fairy tale.-STORY- 8/10My only big disappointment was the ending. The story itself was quite exciting and adventurous, and was building up nicely toward its grand conclusion. Except that conclusion never came. The viewers were left with more questions than answers, and the issue that seemed to be the main focus of the plot, was never resolved....The relationship between Edgar and Lydia also stopped progressing in the second half. Nearly every potentially romantic moment was interrupted either by outside influence or by the characters' indecisiveness. Which is fine once or twice, but it is definitely not the method I would recommend overusing in a romantic storyline.-CHARACTERS- 8/10The story managed to introduce a very large range of characters in such a short time, which was both a success and a downfall. If I was judging solely on the characters' diversity, I would have given it full marks. I don't think there was a single character toward whom I was indifferent, nor were they your usual shoujo stereotypes. However, the development of characters is just as important as making them appeal to the public. Due to such a small number of episodes, the same problem as the one discussed in the previous section occurred. Some characters did not move farther than their point of introduction. And the so-called main villain appeared so close to the end that the audience hardly had a chance to find out anything other than his name.-ART/ANIMATION- 9/10The artwork is beautiful and suits the given genre very nicely. Pretty girls and handsome boys, flower gardens, starry skies, everything you would expect in a romantic fairy tale. It's quite colorful, but not overly bright, so it doesn't get in the way of enjoyment. I especially loved how the eyes were drawn. The animation quality could use some improvement though, and the characters on the background are not very detailed in comparison to close-ups.-SOUND- 10/10This is the aspect of Hakushaku to Yosei for which I don't have a single complaint. Both the background music and the sound effects were perfectly tied in with all the other elements. The opening and ending songs were also very nice. The ending song, My Fairy by Midorikawa Hikaru (Edgar's seiyuu), was especially charming and captured the overall feel of the story.---Since there was no real ending to the anime and there is no second season in sight, you might have to look for manga and/or light novels to know the complete story.

Many rely on the overused character personas, sigh-worthy romance, and drop-dead gorgous men to sell the show. And let me tell you, Hakushaku to Yousei (aka, Earl and Fairy) does have these things. But at the same time, there\'s something really stand-out about this show that made me watch it in one sitting.Plot/Story: This is the anime\'s strongest point. The plot follows a teenage fairy doctor named Lydia, who suddenly finds herself employed by a mysterious earl, who is in search of a mystical sword that is held by the ruler...of the merrow.The story is left incomplete and mostly unexplained. I mean, with only twelve episodes, it\'s not possible for them to wrap this plot up. But, what they do cover is done very well; there\'s a fair balance of romance, and well as action. The ""Victorian Era"" element is nicely handled as well (but then, I am a sucker for Victorian and steampunk anime). Overall, I was pleased!Sound/Music: This varied with me. The voicework was perfect; every characters\' voice suited them greatly and the actors did a fabulous job.The music, on the other hand, is odd. Sometimes it\'s worked into the scene wonderfully, but other times it feels out of place (this happens a lot in fight scenes). Same thing goes with the OP and ED; they kinda fit, but it\'s an odd fit.But if you\'re paying attention to the voicework, the music becomes ignorable.Characters: This is another strong-suit of Earl and Fairy. Though somewhat clichéd, its characters are cleverly-written and quite easy to fall in love with.Lydia is by far, my favorite character. Her kind but strong personality shines as you watch her grow over the twelve episodes, and I really came to like her. She\'s the first ""typical shojo"" girl to win for full approval!Edgar is so much (almost too much) like Ouran High School Host Club\'s Tamaki Souh, that it\'s scary. But I think that\'s what I liked about him. His quirky playboy additude, mixed with his darker, more criminal acts, serious past, and attempts to redeem himself of this past, make him the show\'s most interesting character. I just couldn\'t get enough of him!The other main characters (Raven, Kelpie, Paul, etc.) all prove to be wonderfully interesting characters as well! Their roles are not overshadowed by Edgar too seriously, so you are given time to get to know them. No complaints with the characters.Animation: This could be considered the show\'s weak point. The animation in the show isn\'t very impressive; it lacks a lot of detail and relies a little heavily on pan-shots. The fight scenes are actually quite good though, so that makes up for some things.Overall:Though a very typical shojo, the magical elements and fasinating plot make up for any clichés they may play to. Heck, the clichés are enjoyable too! Here\'s hoping there\'s a second season on the horizon.It\'s a short, sweet, and worth giving a chance!

I\'m glad I did!', 'Animation- As though it were a portrait of the countryside(to me), it has such soft nostalgic feeling. Yet, there are times in the episode where Raven\'s eye/fairies/hounds have an opposite effect with  its glowing effects and vivid colors- bringing out enthusiasm from the viewer. Animation and artwork are beautiful and in detail. It does give the feel of a ""fairy tale"" story.Storyline- The series was rather quick (but quickly addictive), but it didn\'t confuse me with the current plot the characters were facing. Although, it did leave a few questions, and the last episode was open-ended. The series has some good humorous scenes -I...love that part about Edgar teasing Lydia about her wanting a french kiss- they had quite a few moments like that =) The romance in the story keeps you wanting and hoping that by the end it was what you were looking for.Characters- Lydia and Edgar were the most developed out the series (but even they weren\'t completely developed -Lydia\'s past experience with the fairies, as well as Edgar\'s relation to the Blue Knight Earl. ). The rest of the characters, unfortunately, were a little two dimensional. You know there is something deeper with Raven and Ermine, but that is yet to be revealed. The main antagonist, Prince, is yet to make his appearance- we don\'t know anything important about him. I would have liked to know more about Kelpie, and why he is so infatuated with Lydia. The reason I rate this category higher is because even though we may not ""know"" the character\'s past/experience, by the end of the series, we almost ""know"" them as far as personality. I have an idea of what they could have been like and how their personality could have moved them though life.Music - At first I was expecting something soothing to fit the mood but as the same theme came in during a few fight scenes, I thought, this definitely works. I think overall, the music was fine.Overall-Throughout the series there were two things that I kept saying to myself-1. Don\'t people knock before coming through the doors?! *Slaps Raven* ""Damn his perfect timing.""2. ""Someone is going to explain Ermine soon, just calm down.""Since it\'s suggested to try not to write any spoilers, I will write my rant on the blog portion of my profile- if anyone is interested in reading that =)This series was very addictive, and it left me in a good mood despite how it ended.**Seeing as there is a special recap episode that is coming out, there is a possibility we can expect a second season. -This is just speculation of course.Help support this show for more episodes in order to answer questions! love that part about Edgar teasing Lydia about her wanting a french kiss- they had quite a few moments like that =) The romance in the story keeps you wanting and hoping that by the end it was what you were looking for.Characters- Lydia and Edgar were the most developed out the series (but even they weren\'t completely developed -Lydia\'s past experience with the fairies, as well as Edgar\'s relation to the Blue Knight Earl. ).

There was a lot of time and effort being put into the art. All of the characters were absolutely hypnotizing.Each character did not resemble others, they were their own, that was what made this anime series very unique.I enjoyed watching this anime series SO much. I didn't want it to end. 12 episodes were pretty short. Time flys by when you're watching a good anime. As you watch this anime, you can tell right off the bat that this isn't an anime like any other.I give Hakushaku...to Yousei a 10 in all areas.I seriously recommend Hakushaku to Yousei.

I really like how you can tell the characters apart from their personalities.Sometimes, I feel confused by male lead's feelings towards the female lead's feelings, and wonder - How did it even end up like this? XD. Sure, i like a lot of chemistry and romance but I feel like it was slowly progressing but then it was just rushed at the end. I like to see the progression but not that slow and I get confused when things get rushed.The story plot, art, voice characters and characters were great. I just wish that there...was more progression and no rush when they made the anime, because I really don't know how they ended up like that. was more progression and no rush when they made the anime, because I really don't know how they ended up like that."", 'I came in with expectations before watching this because I had finished reading the two-volume manga a week before. Both the anime and manga are based on the light novel, but it seems the anime took things a little further and didn’t include what was in the second volume of the manga.Anyway, I know this anime was probably quite popular back in the day with young girls. There’s a beautiful young lady who’s misunderstood and finds comfort in a mysterious and devilishly handsome man who is in need of her fairy services. She can see fairies! He sparkles so much when he saves her life!...I think if I were years younger this show would have been the ultimate source of my fangirling.The setting for this anime is charming and quaint. Historical anime, especially set in the Victorian era, is always quite interesting due to how well the writers pay attention to clothing, speech, and other little details that make the time period credible. If you like seeing people in dashing coats and open collars, long dresses with petticoats and ruffled sleeves, top hats and canes, then this will definitely be appealing to you.There’s that fairy lore aspect as well. Even though I’m a grown adult, I’m still quite fascinated by magical fairy tales, having grown up in a time where Disney made my childhood. This show doesn’t shove information down your throat, either. Lydia doesn’t act like some kind of dictionary when she helps the earl with his fairy business. She feeds him tidbits of information when he asks or when it’s necessary. There’s no time to talk all about the fairy world. All there is to know is that it’s there and there are some rules to follow, which aids in keeping one’s imagination vibrant.Adventure-wise, though it keeps moving and engages the viewer, I think a little bit of it was muddled and confusing. While having legends to follow and read about is interesting, when they became more convoluted it was harder to follow what the characters had to do in order to accomplish their goals.The earl’s true origins also brought the show to a new level. All I can say is that he’s not the perfect prince that he initially appears to be; he’s got a lot of dirt and it complicates the entire plot, especially the romance.Even though MAL doesn’t give this anime a romance tag, I think it definitely should have one. Anyone looking at the cover of the anime, manga, or light novel would know that there is a gigantic shipping between the fairy doctor Lydia and the earl Edgar. It would be a little too perfect if their feelings for each other were clear from the beginning, so there’s the problem of Edgar’s womanizing personality and Lydia’s difficulty in believing his declarations of love. It can get pretty frustrating, though it was much more annoying in the manga. The anime does better by giving an additional reason for Lydia spurning his advances, making the question of their relationship credible.There’s something a little different about the way this romance is portrayed, though. I’m not sure if it’s customary in the Victorian era, but both characters are very earnest about their feelings. Though Edgar’s personality is a little bit murky, he’s still dead set on making Lydia his and showers her with compliments of love, especially those three little words. Lydia tells him honestly that she doesn’t believe him and even gives him the reasons why she doesn’t think so. It’s a constant battle of wills and reminds me a lot of Asian dramas.While one would expect Lydia to be quite a headstrong protagonist, a lot of the times she’s put in the position as a damsel in distress because she can’t fight against strong men with guns and knives. Her strengths as a character, therefore, are in her knowledge of fairy lore and her belief in herself. She’s a strong-willed person due to how long she’s had to endure people’s ridicule towards her profession. She trusts her instincts above all else, and she’s hardly wrong because of her fairy instincts.Though I wish she were nicer to Edward, she’s very much a friendly girl and is the kind of person I’d want to know. She’s smart and her desire to do a good job as a fairy doctor drives the show successfully. A lot of this show has to do with her becoming a new person because of Edgar and because of the trials she goes through which put her experience to the test. I think it’s wonderful to see a heroine bloom like this.Edgar is a whole different story. While I’m a sucker for attractive gentlemen, I’m annoyed when they almost never change their cool expression. It also may be the strange color of his eyes which makes it seem that way. His emotions are hard to read and at times I felt that Lydia may have been right to say he was bluffing. Additionally, his uncovered dark past is pretty bad and contrasts greatly with his current status, so it feels unreal and a bit over dramatic.You have to like his suaveness, though. If you can sympathize with his history, his transformation into the earl he is now reflects the great strength he has inside of him. He’s a courageous person and stops at nothing to obtain what he desires. Of course, his aims change the longer he spends time with Lydia. He never fails to be the prince-like character that every girl dreams of.As much as I hated how perfect Edgar seemed sometimes, he looked gorgeous, as did Lydia. The character designs imitated the delightful light and lovely look from the manga and light novel. While they do have the same large-eyed girls and smaller-eyed men that are frequent in shoujo, they’re still lovely. They even carry the important colors over: the long and springy hair of Lydia’s that people often call “rust-colored”, Edgar’s unique ash mauve eyes, Lydia’s peridot green ones that see everything of the world, and Edgar’s noticeable blond hair.The fight scenes in here were hard to understand. The people moved too fast and it was difficult to comprehend who did what. I suppose part of that is due to the incredible speed of fairy world creatures, but it’s really quite a shame. I think otherwise the animation for this show was fine, though, given it was aired in 2008.I can’t say that the soundtrack was that spectacular. There were the light and quirky tracks for mischievous moments in which brownies stole cookies, little classical string pieces when the earl and his fairy doctor went out on walks, and so on. The soundtrack worked for most of the show.What I had an issue with was the OP. I didn’t think that poppy piece with electric guitars and violins suited the anime setting. I would have preferred a quieter piece to go with the seriousness of the story and ancient fairy lore. I suppose this type of OP would be appealing to the young folk it was geared toward, though.The first episode left me quite skeptical, but I do have to say I enjoyed watching this anime. Though I’m irritated by how love in Asian dramas can turn out, I still like watching it, so the similar romance in The Earl and the Fairy gave me the same experience. It was also quite nice to see two lovely people in love. The touches of magical history and encounters with mythical creatures were interesting and kept the story going. If you’d really like to enjoy this story to the fullest, though, I’d encourage you to read the light novel.

While having legends to follow and read about is interesting, when they became more convoluted it was harder to follow what the characters had to do in order to accomplish their goals.The earl’s true origins also brought the show to a new level. All I can say is that he’s not the perfect prince that he initially appears to be; he’s got a lot of dirt and it complicates the entire plot, especially the romance.Even though MAL doesn’t give this anime a romance tag, I think it definitely should have one. Anyone looking at the cover of the anime, manga, or light novel would know that there is a gigantic shipping between the fairy doctor Lydia and the earl Edgar. It would be a little too perfect if their feelings for each other were clear from the beginning, so there’s the problem of Edgar’s womanizing personality and Lydia’s difficulty in believing his declarations of love. It can get pretty frustrating, though it was much more annoying in the manga. The anime does better by giving an additional reason for Lydia spurning his advances, making the question of their relationship credible.There’s something a little different about the way this romance is portrayed, though. I’m not sure if it’s customary in the Victorian era, but both characters are very earnest about their feelings. Though Edgar’s personality is a little bit murky, he’s still dead set on making Lydia his and showers her with compliments of love, especially those three little words. Lydia tells him honestly that she doesn’t believe him and even gives him the reasons why she doesn’t think so. It’s a constant battle of wills and reminds me a lot of Asian dramas.While one would expect Lydia to be quite a headstrong protagonist, a lot of the times she’s put in the position as a damsel in distress because she can’t fight against strong men with guns and knives. Her strengths as a character, therefore, are in her knowledge of fairy lore and her belief in herself. She’s a strong-willed person due to how long she’s had to endure people’s ridicule towards her profession. She trusts her instincts above all else, and she’s hardly wrong because of her fairy instincts.Though I wish she were nicer to Edward, she’s very much a friendly girl and is the kind of person I’d want to know. She’s smart and her desire to do a good job as a fairy doctor drives the show successfully. A lot of this show has to do with her becoming a new person because of Edgar and because of the trials she goes through which put her experience to the test. I think it’s wonderful to see a heroine bloom like this.Edgar is a whole different story. While I’m a sucker for attractive gentlemen, I’m annoyed when they almost never change their cool expression. It also may be the strange color of his eyes which makes it seem that way. His emotions are hard to read and at times I felt that Lydia may have been right to say he was bluffing. Additionally, his uncovered dark past is pretty bad and contrasts greatly with his current status, so it feels unreal and a bit over dramatic.You have to like his suaveness, though. If you can sympathize with his history, his transformation into the earl he is now reflects the great strength he has inside of him. He’s a courageous person and stops at nothing to obtain what he desires. Of course, his aims change the longer he spends time with Lydia. He never fails to be the prince-like character that every girl dreams of.As much as I hated how perfect Edgar seemed sometimes, he looked gorgeous, as did Lydia. The character designs imitated the delightful light and lovely look from the manga and light novel. While they do have the same large-eyed girls and smaller-eyed men that are frequent in shoujo, they’re still lovely. They even carry the important colors over: the long and springy hair of Lydia’s that people often call “rust-colored”, Edgar’s unique ash mauve eyes, Lydia’s peridot green ones that see everything of the world, and Edgar’s noticeable blond hair.The fight scenes in here were hard to understand. The people moved too fast and it was difficult to comprehend who did what. I suppose part of that is due to the incredible speed of fairy world creatures, but it’s really quite a shame. I think otherwise the animation for this show was fine, though, given it was aired in 2008.I can’t say that the soundtrack was that spectacular. There were the light and quirky tracks for mischievous moments in which brownies stole cookies, little classical string pieces when the earl and his fairy doctor went out on walks, and so on. The soundtrack worked for most of the show.What I had an issue with was the OP. I didn’t think that poppy piece with electric guitars and violins suited the anime setting. I would have preferred a quieter piece to go with the seriousness of the story and ancient fairy lore. I suppose this type of OP would be appealing to the young folk it was geared toward, though.The first episode left me quite skeptical, but I do have to say I enjoyed watching this anime. Though I’m irritated by how love in Asian dramas can turn out, I still like watching it, so the similar romance in The Earl and the Fairy gave me the same experience. It was also quite nice to see two lovely people in love. The touches of magical history and encounters with mythical creatures were interesting and kept the story going. If you’d really like to enjoy this story to the fullest, though, I’d encourage you to read the light novel.', 'Short review:Having read the first volume of the manga, I was very excited to find out there was an anime adaptation of this. However, the story was paced a little too quickly, and often times felt disjointed. I also found it a bit difficult to get attached to the characters. Art and animation are kept to a minimum, like with most shojo anime. The voice acting was okay, and the music didn\'t really stand out to me. Overall, I don\'t think this anime can stand alone, meaning you wold have to get the original source material to fully enjoy this anime.Loooooooong review:Story and Characters:Now,...I\'ve read the manga, but not the light novels. And I will be making comparisons between the manga and anime. So, let me try to put the story into a satirical form (minor spoilers):Edgar: Help me become the Blue Knight Earl. Lydia: Why do I have to?Edgar. I can kill you. But I also think I love you. Lydia: Uhhh...Raven: I am Edgar\'s loyal servant. Nico: MORE SHRIMP!!!Edgar: Mr. Carlton, please let me marry your daughter. Lydia and her father: ?!?!?!?!Edgar: You know, I was once in love with someone named Ermine. Kelpie: I want to mate with you, Lydia.And then there\'s Huxley, who I really don\'t remember much about him.I give the story creativity points. But looking at the story as a whole, it only vaguely made sense to me. The transition from different plot points is sometimes sudden and/or doesn\'t make sense. This is the kind of story that needs to marathoned in order to remember everything and to remember all the mysteries and ""clues"" in the anime. It\'s also not very enjoyable, either. But that may just be me, because I was waiting for some real chemistry between Lydia and Edgar.I am not afraid to say I was struck with bishi fever when watching this anime. Obviously, there\'s Edgar, but then there\'s Kelpie, the water spirit in love Lydia and kind of looks like Kaname from Vampire Knight (CURSE YOU). And there\'s (another) character every other fangirl seems to love but I didn\'t, Raven. All these bishis did have some sort of a (back)story, but was either applied too lightly (Paul, Kelpie), or too heavily (Raven, Edgar). The character relationships, especially the ones involving Ermine, seemed a bit confusing, and would be more confusing had I not read the manga. Okay, let\'s talk about Lydia. I have mixed feeling about her. I appreciate that she\'s not entirely helpless and she isn\'t stupid, either. But she\'s stubborn, although with good reason. She doesn\'t develop much, except for her (reluctant) feelings towards Edgar. And like Lydia, I also had mixed feelings about Edgar. He\'s manipulative, a charmer, and not afraid to get what he wants by any means necessary. But at least he didn\'t treat Lydia like trash. I think this ""split"" was a good idea, though, because it offers a bit of darkness and ""reality"" to a main male character in a fantasy anime. It\'s even better if that kind of guy is your thing, if you get what I\'m saying. He isn\'t clueless, like Tamaki Suoh, or very abrasive, like Kyo Sohma. But I think Edgar is fine as he is, because he\'s a different type of male love interest in shojo anime.Art and Animation:The Earl and The Fairy was produced by studio Artland, who also made the anime Mushi-shi. The art style isn\'t that different between the two, but it didn\'t suit The Earl and The Fairy very well. I thought the art was too flat and the colors were a little too pale. But I also thought they put more work into drawing Edgar than anyone else in the anime. Because this is a 2008 anime, I expected this to be a very beautiful looking shojo anime. Honestly, I expect shojo/romance anime to look nice (Ouran, Clannad). Cardcaptor Sakura, an anime that\'s 10 years older than The Earl and The Fairy looks better, in my opinion. Which is a shame, because the artwork in the light novels and the manga is VERY beautiful. And is it just me, or were all of Lydia\'s formal dresses really ugly? However, I can understand why they didn\'t want to put a lot of effort into drawing or the art.The animation is about average as well. What comes to mind when thinking about the animation is whenever Raven fights. I just thought the flash of green and then seeing all the enemies go down was kind of cheap and cheesy. The opening animation also looks kind of cheap. But this is a shojo anime, and I think animation isn\'t supposed to be one of it\'s focuses.Music:Before I talk about the music, I would just like to say there is no voice category for this review because this anime has never been dubbed. Yeah, after my Attack on Titan review, I realized I can\'t judge the original voices in an anime very well.I don\'t think there was at least one memorable OST track. I think it ""set the mood"" of the anime, but just wasn\'t exceptional in any way. The opening theme was okay, but it wasn\'t that great. It really didn\'t fit a historical, shojo anime, either. And I\'m pretty sure the ending (well, this is mostly the animation we\'re talking about here) caused almost as many ovaries to explode as did the trailer for the Free! anime.Execution and My Enjoyment:Kind of how I said a high school slice-of-life comedy should not be super-long, a shojo anime should not be only 12-13 episodes. I don\'t think that\'s enough time for true, satisfying romantic development. The story was just too much to be compressed into 12 episodes. Normally, one volume of manga = 4-5 anime episodes. The first volume of the manga became the first 2 episodes of the anime. Yeah, I think you get the idea what the pacing of this show is like. This anime had far too much (somewhat disjointed) story elements crammed into 12 episodes. I don\'t mind when an anime tries to do a lot of things, like in Angel Beats, but that balanced many different genres, while The Earl and The Fairy had too many plot points condensed and overlapping.Overall, this anime had nothing really special about it, and had a story that was too complicated (for me) in 12 episodes. The production quality is a bit low, in my opinion, and from episode 3 onward, I kept trying to remember what had happened and who was doing what. Along with the changes made from the manga, things got confusing fast, and watching this anime almost felt like a chore towards the end. But, like I\'ve said many times before, I partially watched this to catch bishi fever. Enjoyment may vary between person to person depending if they prefer a complete retell of the original story or a different one.If you liked this review, please check out my anime review blog!

I have a...feeling the manga probably tells the story better.Egar the main characters is using Lydia at first to get this powerful sword to prove his status in the world as since losing his parents, he has lost that. Eventually he falls in love with her. It sounds like a cool transitional romantic story line that many anime use as a base - you know, began with no feelings, progressed into love because one of the characters is just so kind they can't help it? Well! The problem is, Edgar is so flirtatious in the beginning that it isn't easy to see when his feeling become genuine. His flirting is borderline creepy too and slightly abusive. Although he never forces her to do something she doesn't want to, he looks as though it's a huge effort to make that decision.Lydia also only progresses the tiniest bit towards falling for Edgar and it's kind of frustrating.There is little character development for the others also.I really could go on.

I don't remember which magezine it was nor do I know where it has disappeared to XD But it had been quite a while since I last saw this title. It was by chance that I found it again.I had only thought it was a manga but it turned out to be an anime as well, so that was a delight. And so, I have watched it and I have finished it, so on to a review of...it. ^^Story - Well, I've always loved fairies and I even am a firm believer that they truely exist, so this anime and story is quite in my area of interest. The story is indept and always keeps you wanting to know more. I've finished it and I still want to watch more XD But the story is a little difficult to comprehend at times and at times seems to be seen at a broader mindset. But it is rather easy to keep up and understand what is going on at the present moment.Art - I thorughly like the style of the art, it has a uniuqe yet familiar look to it. It's not overly detailed but also detailed enough that it keeps your eyes trained on it. The backgrounds are lush and always a beauty to look at. I love seeing paintings in this cause it just takes my breath away to see the lushness of the art within the art. Though, this is just a little thing that bugs me, don't know if it will anyone else, but I hate being able to see the eyes through the hair, it just drives me insane. But that's just me I think.Sound - The sound is very simple yet exotic at the same time, it has a gentle sound to it at times and at others a lovely mood and feel. The music goes very well with the anime and it builds up, always letting know when something interesting or important is about to happen. I love that. The voice actors also have a certian quality to them, if you imagine that voice to go with that person, it is bound to be close to what you expect. I also loved hearing familiar voices and coming back here to look them up, realizing that they are in many other animes I have watched subbed. I have to say that the choice of actors for this was very well thought out.Character - I adore all the characters, they each have a certain role and none are unimportant, even if you think they mind. I thought Paul was just a random extra, but turned out he appeared in later episodes after his debut appearence. There are no random extras in this and that makes it rather interesting, that everyone has a part to play this grand story. And the good characters (even though some of them MIGHT seem bad) have a certain quality to them that makes you find them interesting and enjoy watching them. All in all, the characters ar well thought out and put together in this tale splendidly.Enjoyment - As I stated before, I may be a little biased with my enjoyment, since I have an interest in the fairy world and like. But keeping it unbiased, it was enjoyable. There are moments where you just can't help but laugh but others that keep you on the edge of your seat. The anime pulls you in and keeps you watching even if you have to stop to do something. I was reluctent to stop when it was time for bed. But right when I got up the next morning, I continued it. It calls up a thrill when watching and keeps you intriged with every little event that happens. But granted, it is a little fast-paced and confusing at the beginning. But as it continues on, it makes sense.Overall - So overall, I give it a 10 out of 10, it was just so enjoyable and a thrill to watch at even now that it's over, I'm rather disappointed that it is. But it leaves room for more enjoyment with reading the manga ^^ For that has a lot more story, background and little bits that didn't appear in the manga. I will be going to go read that soon.That is my review of this grand anime that has caught my attention for quite some time. I should also mention that it only took me two days to watch it, for it was THAT addicting. Though, that might just be me ^^ For I love watching anime that much. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I have.

I did enjoy the romance during the series, though, and I think it was quite cute.I liked how the manipulated all this myths and legends to fit the story. They really made them look quite different from what I imagined. Of course, it has something to do with anime's superficial nature. Some of the creatures they mentioned I never expected to have human form,...and if they did most stories always add that they were but deformed representations of what they once were.The music was cool. I really liked listening to it, but like any theme music, after watching a show continuously you sort of grow bored of it.Again, I must bring up the point of it only had 12 episodes. For this reason I understand that the characters weren't meant to have really changed. It's not a fault, because they really handled it quite nicely. The characters were three dimensional, even though they didn't changed. It's not as if they had some stagnant personality. You see a couple sides of them as the series progresses.Over all it was short and simple and cute, and I think that made all the difference. and if they did most stories always add that they were but deformed representations of what they once were.The music was cool.

My enjoyment was much more character driven. The art was pretty good, I thought the style fit the characters and the story well. Lydia's hair was a bit out of hand, though. I'm not sure she brushed it very much :)  The characters were fun. Edgar was undoubtedly my favorite, but Kelpie and Raven were fun, too....Overall, I think this show is definitely worth watching.

You would be confused otherwise.-Through my understandings of this anime, Earl and Fairy is about a girl, named Lydia Carlton, who is a Fairy Doctor. Like her mother, Fairy Doctors can see what others can't.One day Lydia received an invite to go to London to visit her father, then her whole world changed.Pros-- It has mythical creatures in it, like fairies, selkies, and merrows.- I believe the anime is longer than the manga, which is always good I guess....Cons-- It didn't explain the things that you wanted to be explained. Like, for example, what selkies and merrows are. You either have to look it up or read the manga to understand.- It doesn't really tell about the people's past. It tells you just a little bit about the past but not a lot.- The ending wasn't what I had in mind; I was expecting something with more action.Overall-This was a good anime but has some flaws here and there. I personally liked the manga more.I would recommend this anime to people who like European myths. And also to people who have read the manga.

The story is set in Victorian Britain, and includes action/adventure, romance and fantasy-a strong starting point.The main reason I enjoyed this anime was due to the fact it was relatively original, fast-paced, and has an interesting story-line. One of my favorite elements of this anime is the fairy doctor the story follows: Lydia. In most animes I watch the female protagonist is either sweet, week and does not do much or on the other hand, arrogant, loud and annoying. Thankfully Lydia is neither. Though she is feminine and...has a kind heart, she stands up for herself and is rather amusing doing so.Her relationship with Edgar is an engaging one, though if you are hoping for lots of hot romance you will not find it, the story focuses on the two coming to trust one another etc. Her fairy 'cat' Nico is also an invaluable addition to the cast, along with Cain, a Kelpie who is fighting for Lydias hand.Overall this anime is an interesting one, with good visuals, an engaging plot and characters who truly come to life. has a kind heart, she stands up for herself and is rather amusing doing so.Her relationship with Edgar is an engaging one, though if you are hoping for lots of hot romance you will not find it, the story focuses on the two coming to trust one another etc. Her fairy 'cat' Nico is also an invaluable addition to the cast, along with Cain, a Kelpie who is fighting for Lydias hand.Overall this anime is an interesting one, with good visuals, an engaging plot and characters who truly come to life."", ""Well, This anime series was amazing so i will start with what i dident like first.I enjoy more of heavy romance anime's and this anime had romance but not heavy enough but thats my only complaint. The characters were all different and all amazing. The adventure parts were cute and intresting and the outfits that each character wore were for the best of words outstanding! The dresses had alot of detail and made since for the time period and the place they were. The whole series was very well thought out and very accurate for what that time period would have looked like and how...people may have talked and dressed. Though the series is manely romance,adventure and fantasy there are afew action scenes in the series and though they arent amazing action scenes they were not bad for a romance/adventure anime so i would reccomend this anime for romance fans 8/10Thanks and i hope you enjoy Hakushaku to Yousei!!!! people may have talked and dressed.

I'm a HUGE fan of British drama and Victorian Era stories, so I had high hopes for this anime.I have to admit after the first episode I wasn't very impressed. The art wasn't fantastic and it was kind of sloppy. However I decided to give it another chance, and fell in love with Lydia and the story line. The character development through this series is excellent, especially with Edgar, and I was really impressed by episode 12. I also loved the music, it was similar to...the soundtrack of a movie.I think this would probably be one of my favorites if it weren't for the romantically odd ending. The plot was somewhat resolved, but I felt like the relationship between Edgar and Lydia wasn't completed. It really ruined how I felt about the anime overall. I'm a big romantic, so others might not mind so much.The show could easily have gotten another season with it's excellent story, but due to the artwork those possibilities were snuffed pretty quickly. the soundtrack of a movie.I think this would probably be one of my favorites if it weren't for the romantically odd ending.

Because I don\'t see it."" - Joseline Hernandez from The Real Daytime Talk ShowThat pretty much sums up my feelings to this show and the reviews and forum around it.  It seems like everyone just talked it up, but I honestly couldn\'t see the appeal.  I even had a trusted source on animanga highly recommend this to me, so I tried to power through it.  Though I just couldn\'t.  I don\'t understand why they liked this anime so much, and this also includes the fans who kept talking it up.It was like...I was watching a different show or something.  It was very bizarre.  Even then, barely anyone rates it lower than a 6, which is very bizarre.  Like, are we watching the same show???Okay, so let\'s get with the plot: The plot is that Lydia is a fairy doctor in a time where people can\'t see fairies and they don\'t believe in them.  This guy, named Edgar, wants to hire her so he can get a sword and become the Earl and blah blah blah blah.Yeah, I care nothing for these characters.  None of them were appealing.  Some of the fans tried to talk up the Kelpie and Raven, but I feel nothing for their characters.  The Kelpie is pathetic AF and Raven\'s entire character revolves around Edgar.  I care nothing for these two characters!I care even less for Lydia and Edgar.  Edgar is a creepy narcissist, and he\'s annoying.  Lydia has no backbone at all and is the most pathetic character ever.  I think even Kishimoto and Gege can write better characters than Lydia.  Like, I\'m not under the illusion that every Shoujo will have well written women.  No matter the demographics or the author, good writing is good writing and bad writing is bad writing.  Yet, I didn\'t think that a Shoujo would have writing this bad for their female characters.  Like, wtf???  If you\'re worse than Gege and Kishimoto, then I just don\'t know what to say.The ultimate issue is that they tease little ideas that catch your interest, but then it\'s back to the actual unlikable plot.  Like the actual fairies, the merfolks, etc., are actually intriguing.  The anime could\'ve been built around them.  Yet they decide to focus on boring Lydia and Edgar.Though on that note, I got interrupted from writing this review to watch the fire works with my family members.

There are several scenes that seemed to have been omitted, perhaps for the benefit of time constraints or budgetary reasons, but their absence harms the experience overall severely. A lot of context and lore are also not there, so the world building ends up being a huge confusing mess, can't even be inferred. A lot of scenes start out of nowhere, skipping important parts and choosing to summarize them in a few words or just...expecting us to invent something happening to connect them with what came before. Also, they cut the episode near the end, play the credits, and then finish the episode which is very annoying and I hated that so much.Characters:Let me preface this by saying I hate age gap relationships, but even ignoring that the chemistry between the leads is... annoying. The main character suffers a lot from a lack of agency the plot chooses to pretend isn't there. She has the illusion of choice, but is forced to go along with whatever everyone around her wants or tells her to do, and even when refusing and protesting this doesn't change. The back story of the male lead is also a big mess, never clear, and they keep mentioning this burn scar on his tongue but never once show it. I imagine animating a tongue scar wouldn't be that hard, but they just didn't. The supporting cast is also underdeveloped, with details sometimes mentioned, but never explored.Plot:The plot isn't bad, it's just badly executed. This is why I imagine the books are better. The world seems to hold a lot of promise, but its mechanics are never clarified or are very inconsistent.The animation:Lowest budget and no talent. I've been watching anime since the year this show was released, so I understand the industry standards have increased, but even then it's bad. I don't think Lydia's face was ever drawn correctly, she never gets to look cute. It features some action scenes, but they're also lackluster.

Jiyi Guanli Ju,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50462/Jiyi_Guanli_Ju,"['I believe it was during the Bilibili donghua 2021 (not really sure) lineup was how I found this hidden title. It didn\'t have the most astounding presentation for a thumbnail back when I saw the PV of it, but I came across a short with quality that doesn\'t come every so often, and I have to admit, even today, I am invested in seeing the future for this series and where it will go to in the future.False Memory is a short about a boy whose memories are obscured due to creating a BUG man, named Shi Yan, who is basically messing around with...his memory. Fang Tang here is basically the boss of the recycling place and Bai Zhong is the intern learning how to do this job.Everything narrative-wise only exists to say a message, since most of the anime revolves around cool fight scenes. That message is something along the lines of fighting for yourself instead of obscuring your reality by removing the unwanted with something more comfortable for you. You see, the kid here lives a terrible life with people bullying him and what have you, but instead of standing up for himself, creating a BUG man was the alt route he took. He ran away from the harsh reality or more fittingly used fake memories to create a false utopia. I suppose the understanding here is that fighting for yourself is the better route to take rather than having everything done for you, considering how his life would have gone well off the rails having stuck to his false hopes. This isn\'t explicitly stated, however, more of an interpretation I had. I would say that this kid makes for a pretty good character, even in the small amount of time he was present. He had simple distastes, his false memories got the best of him, and he wasn\'t exactly this overdramatic guy. Whenever he\'d get beat, it would just be a case of ""Shi Yan is here to back it"". His reactions to situations are pleasant too and come across as very honest. At the end of things, instead of breaking down, he actually takes a stand against his enemies. I say this is honest because BUG man and BUG source have this connection with one other—said to be through strong emotion, although not something known to be eternally linked. Shi Yan doesn\'t come across as a rabid beast of a BUG man, but rather someone there for his friend. This kid took Shi Yan\'s implicit advice once the ending happens (you should just watch it for yourself to understand instead of me saying everything), and it just comes across as something that would make a ton of sense. The kid accepted reality and went out to improve himself, going back on the right lines. It\'s pretty good stuff honestly for a character like himself.Fang Tang and Bai Zhong don\'t really have too much meaning to them other than their jobs in this world. As they say ""For us, good or bad, true or false, it is meaningless."" which I am not gonna lie, sounds like pseudo-philosophy considering how their job is literally about recycling memories and BUG man (who cause trouble). Maybe they just don\'t care about what they do in particular? I honestly don\'t know.As for the visuals, it is so very good here. The animation was one of the reasons I ended up watching this, but in itself, it is so fluid and the techniques used to emphasise each fight genuinely had an effect on the scenes present. It comes across as an actual intense masterful fight between two combat warriors. Studio Flint Sugar really pulled a crazy one here. Great fight choreography, camera motion, everything, I don\'t think there was anything flawed about this. The character design is something to speak of too, it is like a sketch with its basic detail but still has all the features required to be able to praise. I am not sure what the technique/style/word for it is, but you should see what I mean upon looking at it yourself. It is simple, but it comes with a lot to offer. There wasn\'t too much OST here, but all was pretty good from what I remember; it doesn\'t impact, however, at least, most don\'t. The only notable thing is the voice acting assuming you aren\'t too familiar with Chinese donghua. In this short at least, it is pretty good stuff and suffices well enough for everyone. A good job in the audio category.When all is said and done, False Memory is this good idea that potentially has a lot going for itself. Considering how it is going to get a sequel featuring god knows what, I am willing to stay the whole journey to see what more is to come.

Jormungand: Perfect Order Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15735/Jormungand__Perfect_Order_Recap,[]
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16700/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Kaku__Outbreak,"[""So I watched the first and probably also the last episode and I decided to make this short review for those who are not sure about this OVA.Basically you can think of it as another world where things went bad but this time you will see how everything continued until the end I guess. Who knows how will it end. We can meditate about it.The style is similar to the previous Higurashi series but different from OVAs that were more like parodies. Kaku is very serious and you can see again everyone (yeah especially Rena and her insane face) covered in blood. You will meet...all the already known characters and see the good old Hinamizawa again. Hmm yea, not good at all but you know what I mean... :DThe OVA is about 50 minutes long so it's like two anime episodes in one. I actually didn't believe in the end that it is already over. It really got me so I forgot about time etc. Don't wanna say that it's the best anime OVA ever, some scenes and moments in the plot are a bit childish and naive I would say and could have been done better. (don't wanna spoil much) However, I got caught by this OVA and I am sure that every fan of Higurashi will feel the same way. The plot is very fast (of course, just 50 mins for all the stuff in there) thus it's not boring and it ends in the best. In other words there is no time for boring scenes.This OVA also helped me a bit to understand more about the whole mysterious plot. Especially Hanyuu and Rika's short dialogue is very interesting. To tell the truth, we never saw any of the paralel world coming that far as this one.Btw, you know the song called “Dear You” from the Higurashi game? I remember tons of comments on the Internet that this song should be used also in the anime. Well, some dreams that may seem impossible sometimes come true. Thanks Oyashiro-sama.The result? If you liked previous Higurashi series (and felt that you need more of Hinamizawa), definitely watch this OVA. No more to say. Even if you ignored the rest of the OVAs that were just weird parodies made for fun, this one is different. all the already known characters and see the good old Hinamizawa again. Hmm yea, not good at all but you know what I mean... :DThe OVA is about 50 minutes long so it's like two anime episodes in one. I actually didn't believe in the end that it is already over. It really got me so I forgot about time etc. Don't wanna say that it's the best anime OVA ever, some scenes and moments in the plot are a bit childish and naive I would say and could have been done better. (don't wanna spoil much) However, I got caught by this OVA and I am sure that every fan of Higurashi will feel the same way. The plot is very fast (of course, just 50 mins for all the stuff in there) thus it's not boring and it ends in the best. In other words there is no time for boring scenes.This OVA also helped me a bit to understand more about the whole mysterious plot. Especially Hanyuu and Rika's short dialogue is very interesting. To tell the truth, we never saw any of the paralel world coming that far as this one.Btw, you know the song called “Dear You” from the Higurashi game? I remember tons of comments on the Internet that this song should be used also in the anime. Well, some dreams that may seem impossible sometimes come true. Thanks Oyashiro-sama.The result? If you liked previous Higurashi series (and felt that you need more of Hinamizawa), definitely watch this OVA. No more to say. Even if you ignored the rest of the OVAs that were just weird parodies made for fun, this one is different."", 'I was actually very excited when I heard about a new Higurashi. I have been a die hard Higurashi fan since I watch the first series and have now almost read and watched everything that even sllghtly related to Higurashi.Considering how disappointed I was with a large proportion of Kira, I was trying my best not to get my hopes up for this OVA but upon seeing the trailer, I found it difficult not to. It looked serious, it looked exciting; Rena had her cleaver and Keiichi is armed with the bat. What\'s not to instantly get excited about?In general, it was an interesting...episode and longer than your typical episodes so that it is about the length of a double episode.

It was without... \'love\'. Both Rena and Keiichi in particular seemed to do things that had very little emotion attached to them - unlike in the previous series, their violence seemed a little... like a spree rather than for any particular reason.Actually Rika, despite her small part in the episode as a whole, gets me applause. Everything from her expressions and her \'Bern-esque\' voice got me. I\'m pretty sure there may have been some gentle underlying suggestions about the links to Umineko.Overall: Overall I enjoyed it despite the little character flaws, it made a nice change from Kira and the \'happy-happy-love-love\' Higurashi to something just that little bit darker. There seems to be doubt as to whether this is the last episode or whether there will be more.

Lets recup: What did the audiences like in the Higurashi series?-Staff 1: I know, I know! The  mystery and never really knowing what\'s going on.-Staff 2: How human and full of flows the characters were. Even the killers had times when they were afraid, confused and in complete disarray about their emotions.-Staff 3: How the community was a quiet, eerie place on the surface, full of dark secrets and people who moved in the shadows in the background. Also how cut it was from the outside world!-Staff 4: How the characters are slowly slipping into insanity, starting...to doubt if what they\'re seeing is real?- Director: Excellant! Excellant! You pointed out everything that we will NOT do in the movie!- Staff1: But wouldn\'t that just piss off all our viewers and send our ratings skydiving without a parachute? I mean we already fucked up with the OVAs...- Director: Exactly! Now on to create a zombie apocalypse movie!Yes,  yes, it\'s not EXACTLY a zombie apocalypse but, come on! The similarities are waaaay too obvious. The madness that covers the whole village takes the form of a plague that the world goverment is afraid of, there are killers walking around the streets missing a lot of brain cells and our protagonists go all Rambo on said killers. Oh and I do mean ""all Rambo""Supposedly EVERYONE in the world already had parasites living inside them which were the cause people became divided in religions, countries etc, depending on the parasite type. (Really movie? We\'re going there?)  And suddenly these become actively hostile towards the different variations of parasites meaning people go into a mindless manslaughter against people with different parasites. Well, that\'s towards the middle part of the movie and the end. The movie actually begins with the world goverment putting the whole village our protagonists live in under quarantine. Yes, with tanks, soldiers, etc etc. Don\'t you remember how you just loved seeing the world outside the village interract with the people in the village blowing away all the eerie atmosphere?Anyway the people of the village consider Satoko the source of the evil curse that has befallen them and prepare to sacrifice her to the local deity. So the club members decide to rescue her! Aka Mion gets K.O.ed in an instant and is effortlessly moved around as a package by the protagonist\'s family, while Keiichi and Rena singehandedly rescue Satoko. And oh, my God! There are over 100 people wondering around with guns and other weapons looking to kill them! How will the Keiichi and Rena manage to sneak past them? (Since... You know, they\'re humans. With no super powers whatsoever. And they\'re not Batman.)...Sneak past them? Man up you cowards! As Keiichi brilliantly puts it before grabbing his baseball bat : ""A hundrend? Only a hundrend?""Yes, I\'m dead serious. Keiichi and Rena easily slaughter 100 people on their own while being cocky as f$""% about it. Are you starting to see the problems of the movie? It\'s NOT HIGURASHI. Hell, even the OVAs were closer to the original Higurashi than this. It\'s like making Sadako from Ringu a news reporter. The fact that she has something to do with TV doesn\'t mean she fits there!. Same goes with the Higurashi cast. The fact that zombie apocalypse is a type of horror and Higurashi also belongs in the horror genre doesn\'t mean that the Higurashi cast fits in a zombie apocalypse!In the end they manage to rescue Satoko, escape the city through one of Mion\'s family secret passages and Rika decides to stay behind and wait for civilization to begin again... Directors, if you can\'t axe-off a cast member DON\'T invent some stupid reason to get them seperated from the rest. I mean, there are writers who can pull that off, but clearly you\'re not among them. If you can\'t kill them let them stay. Anyway... Our protagonist go outside the village, into a world destroyed by the sudden mania the parasites have caused (boy we sure skipped fast through that one).To sum up: It\'s not Higurashi! Not even a fun spin-off. Stupid, uninspired, terribly written and doesn\'t have anything that made you like the original series. to doubt if what they\'re seeing is real?- Director: Excellant!

I really loved the whole Higurashi series, and I was very happy, when I heard that Higurashi didn't end yet, and there will be a new OVA soon. I looked forward to watching it. But now, after I finished it, the movie seems to be a trailer for something bigger. It just simply seemed short. I couldn't find the curve of the story. There was no beginning. It jumped right into the middle of the story. There was no problem to develop, because it jumped right into a...problem that had already developed. And there was no conclusion. No happy ending, no bad ending. There was nothing in the whole movie.About the art, it was like the rest of the series' : great. Well I have to say one very important thing: there is no lazy 3D animation in it. And that is very important. That describes how high quality it is.I don't really have anything to say about the sound. Maybe that the OST is pretty good, and sometimes the girls' voices can be annoying, but that is how it is usually in the anime these days.There were no new characters in the series, or no important new characters. There were the parents of Keiichi, Rena, Satoko, Irie, Rika, Keiichi, Mion and Mion's grandma. Some of my favorite characters were left out of the OVA. For example, I really missed Takano Mio. She was my very favorite in the series. And I also missed Shion, and her bodyguard. Some of the main characters' personalities were screwed up. For example, Irie acted so strange... In a way he would never act.I definitely did not enjoy this OVA. I was waiting for a good story the whole time. And the fighting scenes were disappointing too. Not even close to the level of the rest of the series.All in all, do not hope for some good Higurashi quality OVA when you are watching this. problem that had already developed.

It was a great addition to the first two original Higurashi seasons. Not a continuation, but it gives you the same vibe.However, there are key things that need to be pointed out. Just note that some of these points might only apply to the unknown fact of this OVA being the only one to come, or if it will have more episodes following it.The story moved very fast (if it's a single OVA, then that's more understandable) and the mystery vibe of the Oyashiro's...curse seems to be non-existent; which I thought was one of Higurashi's greatest elements.The villagers were also a bit more insane than usual, but they definitely added to the tension.Above all, the soundtrack was definitely amazing. It was, might I say it, one of the higher ones in many animes. I'm not good with words describing music (that's for someone else whose talent is there to do) so I'll just leave it at: watch it and find out.To be general, this was interesting to watch, but I personally couldn't say it was that close to the feel of the original two series' episodes. curse seems to be non-existent; which I thought was one of Higurashi's greatest elements.The villagers were also a bit more insane than usual, but they definitely added to the tension.Above all, the soundtrack was definitely amazing.

Been waiting for this.Well, you could say I've been waiting to review it. This OVA has been out for like two years or something.Set in 1983 (like every other Higurashi) an unknown virus has spread around Hinamizawa, and Keiichi and Rena go kill mother fuckers everywhere to try and escape. That's pretty much the story. But, the funny thing being that while killing people they don't even give a shit. They keep a straight face while doing it. Well, not straight face... Not like that buff parasite in Parasyte -the maxim- who was smiling while killing an entire group of people.That...may be a spoiler. But not for this anime. So, I don't know if it matters. Most of you, are probably new to horror anime, well... that's a little far-fetched to say. I'm new to anime myself, I've only watched 9 of them. But, from the ones I've watched included this, I'm going to continue my journey.Enough of that. The story for this OVA is pretty legit, considering it kind of sounds dumb. It sound really weird, but I was really excited for this OVA back when it came out. Higurashi was the only anime I watched at the time, and in fact, I've watched it ever since 2006. I was very young, I think I was only 7 years old back then, but I liked it. The gore was incredible. I enjoyed all the psychological scenes. I was a fucked up little kid. But, I'm turning 16. So, it doesn't matter. All that is in my past (not really, I still remember it).The animation is pretty basic. It's pretty much Kira but, with some psychological beating the shit out of everyone scenes. If you've seen Kira or Rei, that's pretty much the animation summed up. But, that's actually a pretty good animation, I think. I can never tell what animation is good or not anymore.The soundtrack actually... it's incredible. The songs used in this particular OVA are awesome. Especially the ending song, Dear You, the only time I ever listened to the ending credits of an anime. I did listen to the season end credits of SAO, only because it was the end of the season. And, you got to listen to the first opening again, which that opening was fockin' epic.I intended to spell that wrong.Characters. Pretty much the exact same from the previous two OVAs. All the good characters, Hanyuu, Rika, Keiichi, Rena... name em' all. But, you never see the parents faces in the anime, rather than the manga. I haven't read much of the manga, which is why I haven't put it in my list. But, on other terms, the characters are really awesome. Which is what you should expect, if you've seen previous Higurashi seasons.I quite enjoyed this OVA. Didn't think I would, since Kira was actually kind of bad. But, I did enjoy Kira, because I think I rated it 6 or something. But, this was actually quite good to see some psychological shit back in Higurashi. Hopefully, they will deliver more in the near future. Or not. It's their choice.But, I rate this an 8/10. Only considering the fact that some of the scenes didn't make sense. Blocks shotgun bullets with metal baseball bat. Waht? Anyway, be gone!~ D.M may be a spoiler. But not for this anime. So, I don't know if it matters.

Story has been forward, like its a story where you understand what is the Parallel World should be, and try to get the ideas how this happens. In short form, how the ""virus"" effects the person, rampaging and kill anyone.

Sound and voice acting still good.Characters/themes are less introduce since you already get the facts from the previous Higurashi series, and from what I didn`t understand is what Hanyuu short conversation with Rika conversation.Overall, its for a Die-Hard fans of Higurashi, if you are new who stumbled into this ova, I suggest not to watch this first.7/10 follow any of the arc, its a new story and theme.But enough said, not exploiting the whole story.Suprisingly the animation and the art is hundred times better than previous Kai episode, and its a major improvement + its less censored content than previous main series.

""Hey, guys! Let\'s make a Higurashi story that is filled with action!!!!"" probably.Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak is an apocalypse movie. Somehow an experiment goes wrong, then the Hinamizawa Syndrome happens globally, and, of course, it starts in Hinamizawa first. And we watch how Keichii, Mion, and Rena try to escape from Hinamizawa while saving Satoko from the infected villagers who blame outsiders (Rena and Keichii\'s families) and Satoko for this virus. Villagers kidnap Satoko for sacrificing her to Oyashiro-sama and try to kill Rena and Keichii\'s families to stop the virus. How do they do this? Of course, with action!Rena takes her hatchet, Keichii grabs Satoshii\'s bat, and they beat the shit out of 20+ villagers for saving Satoko with banger action music in the background! Just kidding, this OVA doesn\'t have any banger music. And I couldn\'t know if it had one because you can\'t hear the music as its volume is too low. Action scenes are boring, and the subpar animations make things even worse.It\'s just your Higurashi characters in boring action. There\'s no mystery, no suspense, no horror, no lots of gore, no lots of gore, no psychological themes, and also no Shion. The only thing this OVA executed right was the friendship between the main cast, and even it\'s not anything above mediocre. Mion almost sacrifices herself to save Rena, and Keichii & Rena throw themselves into the middle of danger to rescue Satoko. Oh, how can I forget! Also, Rika makes a pseudo-deep speech in front of her friends through the end because Higurashi isn\'t Higurashi if Rika starts to talk like an adult and her friends don\'t suspect anything!I watched every Higurashi title in the anime medium except for Ura☆Higu, and this Outbreak OVA was the worst one out of all, without leaving room to doubt. Yes, it\'s even worse than Gou and Sotsu. Although having a terrible script, even those two captured the essence of Higurashi until a point. So, if you watched all TV seasons of Higurashi and want more of it, don\'t watch this OVA—it isn\'t worth it. I recommend you to watch Nekogoroshi-hen. It\'s not anything stellar, but at least I can look at it and say, ""Yes! This story is Higurashi."" But this OVA is just a pile of garbage filled with terrible action. I have no idea why they did something like this back in the 2010s. It could be an understandable project if they were making something like a gacha game about this OVA, but that\'s not the case, as far as I know. The only thing that comes to my mind is that they wanted to milk Higurashi even more, so someone said, ""Let\'s make a spin-off story!"" and Outbreak came to life. However, I can\'t understand how someone thought a Higurashi story that has nothing to do about Higurashi except for Hinamizawa and the characters would sell. Maybe I\'m the stupid one here, and OVA made them a good profit by selling well. The only thing I know is it\'s awful. - PsychologyWhat did producers say while deciding to make Outbreak? ""Hey, guys!

Also, there\'ll be some spoilers for those two seasons in this review.When I first watched this OVA, I was pleasantly surprised! I had just been watching Rei and Kira, so I was naturally skeptical of anything beyond the first two seasons. Rei and Kira were the ""nasty shit"" mentioned in the quote above, by the way.This OVA is an interesting take on Hinamizawa Syndrome. It shows how...the government would actually respond to such a bug; they send the military in to quarantine the area. It was very fun to watch. I also really enjoyed seeing all Hinamizawa descending into insanity and chaos. I really enjoyed watching Keiichi and Rena take down crazed townsfolk.Studio Deen really brought their A-game with the visuals. I especially praise the action scenes for their fluidity. Rena slicing through people with her nata has never looked so great!I definitely praise the music! My favourite piece of Higurashi music ever is the ending music, You –Visionen im Spiegel by Yuzuki. The music during the action scenes is epic too!The story is very much self-contained. However, I personally believe that this OVA is something you MUST watch after finishing the first two seasons of Higurashi. Rei and Kira can go eff of in a corner.I give this a 9/10. For a worst recommendation (I can\'t think of any horror OVA\'s that are better than Outbreak), I suggest the Corpse Party OVA\'s- ACTUALLY, NO! Pick up the game from Steam or whatever. The Corpse Party OVA\'s sucked! the government would actually respond to such a bug; they send the military in to quarantine the area. It was very fun to watch. I also really enjoyed seeing all Hinamizawa descending into insanity and chaos. I really enjoyed watching Keiichi and Rena take down crazed townsfolk.Studio Deen really brought their A-game with the visuals. I especially praise the action scenes for their fluidity. Rena slicing through people with her nata has never looked so great!I definitely praise the music! My favourite piece of Higurashi music ever is the ending music, You –Visionen im Spiegel by Yuzuki. The music during the action scenes is epic too!The story is very much self-contained.

It's set in a parallel Hinamizawa where things took a turn for the worst.I think this OVA hits home more the vibe of the first Higurashi season the n the second, because of the the fact that Kai didn't hit home with me as being horror the way the first season did. Also we see Rena in her creepy mode again.A pleasant surprise for me, that I didn't notice before was the length of the OVA. The fact that it's twice as long as a...typical episode lessens the con that this is, as of writing this review, the only episode in the Kaku OVAs. Furthermore, the pacing of the story is very fast, covering story that would normally fit into 4-5 standard episodes.As a conclusion I want to say, that this is a very good OVA and I recommend it to everyone that enjoyed Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, especially the first season. typical episode lessens the con that this is, as of writing this review, the only episode in the Kaku OVAs.

The characters do make some pretty reckless/insane choices, but it's entertaining and kinda needed for the story, so I guess that's okay. The story was good, but it really needs to continue on longer. If they make more after this OVA, then everything about it will be more awesome, but right now it gets you excited and wanting more, and then it stops.Art/Sound:The art and sound were fine, and stayed familiar to most of the rest...of Higurashi stuff.Characters:They are the same characters that you like/love. Sometimes Keiichi and Rena do act unrealistically reckless and commit some pretty emotionless violence toward other people, but it's fun to watch and you'll still probably like it.Overall Enjoyment:It's definitely worth watching if you've seen and liked other Higurashi.

I love them all and am probably biased toward them, but I don\'t care. Little did I expect to one day come across something related to it that would be this horrifying. Because under this pretty design mimicking the Anime, this is very far away from the original material, in an awfully negative way.Story :Did you ever come across an original fiction that seemed like a fanfiction to you ? I did : The Knights of Emerald, Akame ga Kill,  Zenbu...Choudai, The Witcher (novels), Fire Tripper (OVA), etc. Oh, I stop you there, just because something is ""fanfictionish"" doesn\'t make it remotely bad, Knights of Emerald for example remained entertaining despite that. After all, some fanfictions are really well done. When it comes to this OVA, though, we\'re among the bad fanfictions.To me, it looks like the product of a fan : he/she took his favourite elements of the show/manga/visual novels and tried to bring to life some of his/her phantasms. Even if it doesn\'t fit the Higurashi universe.Do we have the implication of the virus ? Yes, right from the start it\'s thrown into our face without any type of introduction, which, I would have accepted if there had been a counterpart for making it right retroactively, but, nope, cross that. This OVA may be long, but it didn\'t have the time for that, instead, it took plenty of time showing us how absurdly epic Keiichi and Rena are. The others you ask ? Who cares !? Let\'s find an excuse to have them as little as possible on-screen. Show the build-up insanity from the villagers ? (because this time around it\'s their turn to become mad) Who cares ? Keiichi\'s parents are present....even if they aren\'t really important in the end, considering the lack of care Keiichi shows overall of their....disappearance.... Er....what happened during that ellipse ? (oh and they are very, very understanding parents, or incredbily irresponsible...I hesitate....) which matches Rena\'s reaction perfectly when it comes to her own loss.I could rant and piss about this story for ages, make a fuss about close to every elements, but I should cool down a bit, so I won\'t. Let\'s just say it focuses on everything that matters the least and avoids sharing with us, viewers, the most important information ON-SCREEN. It could also pull the various elements in better ways. All in all, even though the story is easily understandable, it has many pieces missing to bring a decent continuity to the plot, you just have various fragments brought together with poorly done transitions.I would like to add a word about the end however.... Is it me....or is it suggesting Mion, Keiichi, Rena and Satoko (and Rika) are the only surviving beings ? Or are living in a post-apocalyptic world with ""zombies"" killing each other and only them as ""normal"" humans ? .....Well, Adam will have three wives this time, how lucky !To say a word about the dialogues....they mainly sound off or forced, like they weren\'t put in appropriately.Characters :Aside from the story, the characters are also very fanfictionish.... They look like the one of Higurashi, they share traits with the one of Higurashi, but everything feels off or incomplete.Irie kills himself ? Ok, why not ? But you have to develop it, not throw it into our face.Keiichi and Rena are perfectly ok from a second to another to kill people and have thorough FUN with it. Isn\'t there some middle path first ? Usually, between point A and point B there\'s something to develop. Oh and also, they are....ninjas ? Don\'t know, but they are really good at killing many opponents on their own, and yes, they tend to show these types of qualities in the ""every day"" life, but in case you didn\'t notice, these absurdly awesome moments are purposefully restricted to the ""fun days"", while the more psychologically hard moments make them more human....again for a reason. Something this OVA seems to have completely forgotten.Mion ? Useless....with her weak self being specifically worked out so you\'re sure to get she won\'t be of any (real) use.Satoko ? Damsel in distress, we know close to nothing about her, because telling us how this virus is behind every religions and everywhere in the world is much more important.Hanyu ? She turned evil. Because it was decided so !And to come back to Keiichi\'s parents, for once that they had a minimum of role to play, I do not understand the choice of avoiding to show us their face, it just increases the lack of empathy for them.The only one I could praise, to some extent, is Rika, even if during the last part of it, she was also of.All in all, none of them react as they would normally, even their ""insane"" self.

The story is good, and i was glad it was different. And don't worry, you're gonna see Rena kill some people. "", 'Throughout Higurashi Outbreak\'s lean 50 minute runtime, one thought kept coming to mind.This... this is stupid, right? It\'s stupid. I\'m pretty sure it\'s stupid.So like, this gets praise because it\'s an edgy and dark OVA unlike the other Higu spinoffs which leaned more towards comedic sexy moe shenanigans. I say no, this is neither dark nor edgy. If anything it\'s the most sanitized and dull Higurashi has ever been. It\'s all haha violence go brrrr with none of the suspense and intrigue the series is known for.Putting aside random developments like the idea of humanity\'s different cultures being a product of different strains of a...brain parasite (????? this is brought up out of nowhere and is never elaborated on) none of the characters seem to know what story they\'re in. This is supposedly like an apocalypse scenario AU but everyone is acting like it\'s Monday at a boring desk job. For example, early on one of the main teenage characters very flatly states that their family was just moments ago lynched by a crazed mob. No one reacts to it and it\'s never brought up again. It\'s not even treated as a mild inconvenience, it\'s more like ""well that happened, anyway let\'s move on"". For a series so prone to high melodrama as Higurashi it\'s very jarring to see characters shrug off what should be major traumatic events.Keiichi and Rena are reimagined here as hypercompetent action heroes who fire off quips and talk about the virtues of friendship while gleefully murdering several armed men like it\'s nothing. An actual CHILD is kidnapped and is about to be offered as a human sacrifice to appease the gods and she\'s just like cool with it. No biggie, happens all the time. Even Keiichi\'s parents barely blink an eye at a bloodsoaked Rena hacking away at a bunch of dudes right outside their door while Keiichi seems to be real casual about murder in this timeline. Everyone kind of is.This tone of bizarre emotional disconnect continues onto the ending, which ends not on a dark nor hopeful note but one of total indifference.

What an...interesting note to end on.Well, the story isn't BAD, but it's nothing great. Basically, it's a zombie apocalypse in the Higurashi universe, kind of reminds me of Resident Evil 4 weirdly with the evil villagers and parasites and all that. It's ok for what it is...I guess, but they could've done SO MUCH more with it.The art looks nice, a bit of a step up from the last...stuff we saw ('Rei' & 'Kira').

Higurashi that lets you reconnect with everything important.', ""Warning possible SpoilersThe final piece of the When They Cry is a nice throwback to the usual situations we knew and loved or terrified of from the first two series and what I really liked about this 1 hour OVA is that it could make way for a new story in the future.The story is set in another one of Rika's worlds where she is trying to break the cycle except this time the village has been quarantined and our group of characters must find a way to escape the village.I really liked the way this OVA went because it felt like the usual situations...that happened in the first two series probably more season 1 than 2 and it definitely went back to being more of a horror thriller than a mystery thriller because you definitely see our main characters killing people again luckily it was all in self defence this time.It was fairly action heavy and despite the main characters killing the village occupants it still showed the teamwork they could pull of together and it was pretty tense with some moments that happened like Keiichi almost getting shot by someone with a rifle so if you're looking for some intense action then you've come to the right place.What I also like about this OVA is the way it ended as our main characters do survive yet Rika had to stay behind because of her connection to the village and along with the fact that the whole country has pretty much turned into hell like a new apocalypse has begun which makes me think this could lead to a new story for the franchise and it would be pretty cool seeing our main characters trying to survive in a destroyed world.Now at this point we pretty much know what the characters are like, but this OVA does continue to show the teamwork they pull off together, but the difference is that in season 2 during the final battle they weren't killing the soldiers whereas in this they are which is kinda surprising since they don't go crazy or at least don't go crazy on each other, plus it was strange how Shion was nowhere to be seen in this OVA which begs the question what is she doing during all this?The artstyle was definitely good at making this look pretty gorey since some of the attacks Rena on the village occupants looked nasty as hell I'm pretty sure she almost sliced a dude's head in half at some point which was pretty sick, but that seems to be the only that stands out with something different in the artstyle which is just new ways for When They Cry to look even more gorey than usual.This OVA definitely concentrates on action because we get to see Keiichi and Rena kick some ass during the second half, but it still has that mystery element like why the Government has arrived to quarantine the village which gives the impression that they have discovered the virus that inhabits the village so they have cut if off from the rest of the world, it also continues to show the psychological aspect to great effect because when the situation gets pretty drastic in the village we see everyone going insane and picking sides as they lose trust in each other whereas the main characters continue to trust each other much like they do in the final battle from season 2.Overall I thought this was a very tense, action packed and interesting OVA because from the way things end it feels like there'll be a sequel to this someday though that may never happen I still hope they might make a series for an aftermath of this which could be very interesting seeing how the characters adapt to a dead world. that happened in the first

other level of immersion.I know, maybe this isnt the scary Higurashi we know, but I think this doesnt make this one any less good. But I have to admit that it felt more like an action anime more than a thriller one...So...my recommendation. If you really like Higurashi as a horror anime and only for the tension it brings in the original.... then dont watch this one. But if you watch Higurashi because you are a ""friendship power"" b*tch like I am, then , check it out. And the...song at the end was soooo goood. I have been listening to that song from so long ago, and I didnt know it came from here. It was a nice surprise song at the end was soooo goood. I have been listening to that song from so long ago, and I didnt know it came from here. It was a nice surprise', ""After two seasons of the complete Higurashi story, we got nothing but short OVAs filled with silly comedy and shameless fanservice, and only one interesting yet pointless sequel; Dice Killing Chapter, we finally got the fifth anime instalment of the Higurashi franchise. Surprisingly, it is a serious side story that takes place in the second season, though the exact timeline was not specified. It's not a pointless sequel like Dice Killing Chapter, because it has little plot exposition like any other alternate world in the two seasons, but the new information you get is very little and trivial for someone who has already seen Kai.It's...an alternate timeline where you see an outbreak in action and the mystery surrounding Hinamizawa is revealed internationally in the news, but the OVA failed to focus on the media frenzy and instead focused on the violent outbreak within Hinamizawa; because who cares about political conspiracies or diplomatic relations caused by the outbreak in Higurashi? Who cares about the mystery and inter-organizational conflict within the 'Tokyo' organisation? Allocate the majority of the screentime to depicting the violent outbreak in action and people being brutally murdered, and that's more like it. Wrong.AnimationDespite the fact that the OVA was released in 2013, it was never released on Bluray, so we are stuck with the crappy 480p DVD resolution. However, it's definitely better than the shoddy early BDs of the first two seasons, if you truly care about the visual quality and details, get the SD Blu-ray discs for seasons 1 and 2.The animation is slightly improved in terms of fluidity; this is Studio Deen's final Higurashi title, and they clearly put their best effort for the series in terms of animation here, and I believe it deserves this treatment for an action gore heavy OVA episode. I also like the fact that they kept the same old artstyle and character designs from 2006, which was good and suitable for the genre and setting, and I am sure nostalgia fans will enjoy it.SoundWhile there was no animated opening or ending, which was unnecessary, the credit song (You: Visionen im Spiegel) was really beautifully done for a big good-bye of the Higurashi anime series; yes, a good-bye because this is the last watchable Higurashi title up to now; I dropped the series after only a few episodes of Gou, and I recommend you do the same after this OVA. All of the other soundtracks are the same as in previous titles, so it will feel like you're watching a missing episode of Kai; the music was fitting for the atmosphere, which is a big plus.StoryThe premise itself was intriguing, because, unlike most other chapters which had similar structure, Outbreak plays out a 'what if' scenario in which almost everyone in Hinamizawa goes insane, and the reason for the villagers' violent actions was justified by the unethical lockdown, not just the spread of a virus. However, there is no plot progression because the events are crammed into a prequel, and it doesn't work as a flashback because it's just another usual time reset, there is no theme exploration, nor was there any retrospectively interesting information, it would have been better to experience this chapter before Kai, but it was meant to be watched after Kai because it spoils some of it. So, to those who have already seen Kai, it appears to be nothing more than a storyless mindless action OVA with an excuse plot that adds nothing to the overall story.'My father was murdered not long ago; let us murder those bastards for harming my friends.'While there is death on-screen for gore and shock purpose, the script fails to create impact for characters who are supposed to be important to the protagonist; Higurashi was appealing because of its mystery rather than its action, which is why the fight scene in the final episode of the first season was embarrassing to watch, and now we have this OVA, which feels more like a low-budget B film action survival horror than a psychological horror mystery. The action itself was hilariously bad and unbelievable, akin to a battle between two school kids wielding a bat and cleaver murdering a hundred adult hunters wielding firearms. What is this, a battle shonen?CharacterThere is no character development and no introduction of new characters. I was hoping to learn more about the 'big bad,' Nomura. They could have shown or hinted at how she intended to spread the virus and profit from it, or why she had personal conflict with Tokyo members like Koizumi, and where the hell is Takano, and what happened to Satoshi? Rather than showing me Rena murdering villagers, educate me on the Tokyo organisation. Instead of using Satoko as a damsel in distress plot device for mindless action, show me how Nomura started the outbreak without killing Rika.ValueWhile Higurashi is not an action-heavy series in general, nor does it focus on gore, some fans enjoyed it for its violent scenes and eccentricity. For those who enjoyed the aforementioned elements, this OVA could serve as blood fanservice. It's also a good thing that Studio Deen didn't leave viewers with a bad taste in their mouths with their awful Kira instalment. This work also balances the bad comedy and ecchi that occurred after Kai; even though it has ridiculous action scenes and a bad plot, this OVA has zero comedy and ecchi; the story includes serious elements such as murder, abduction, hazardous virus lockdown, and crazy brutal religion sacrifice rituals, so this OVA reminds you that Higurashi can become serious when it wishes to.EnjoymentAgain, the premise of the outbreak and the lockdown was interesting; I liked the military elements and the opening scene in which helicopters, military trucks, and armed soldiers roam Hinamizawa. You also get to see the heroes' dark side, not because of a virus, but because they have to make life decisions that result in the deaths of many people. Unlike the implausible Kai conclusion, which shows that no damage or death occurs despite the outbreak of a lethal firearms war, this one demonstrates that it is impossible to save everyone in war. an alternate timeline where you see an outbreak in action and the mystery surrounding Hinamizawa is revealed internationally in the news, but the OVA failed to focus on the media frenzy and instead focused on the violent outbreak within Hinamizawa; because who cares about political conspiracies or diplomatic relations caused by the outbreak in Higurashi? Who cares about the mystery and inter-organizational conflict within the 'Tokyo' organisation? Allocate the majority of the screentime to depicting the violent outbreak in action and people being brutally murdered, and that's more like it. Wrong.AnimationDespite the fact that the OVA was released in 2013, it was never released on Bluray, so we are stuck with the crappy 480p DVD resolution. However, it's definitely better than the shoddy early BDs of the first two seasons, if you truly care about the visual quality and details, get the SD Blu-ray discs for seasons 1 and 2.The animation is slightly improved in terms of fluidity; this is Studio Deen's final Higurashi title, and they clearly put their best effort for the series in terms of animation here, and I believe it deserves this treatment for an action gore heavy OVA episode. I also like the fact that they kept the same old artstyle and character designs from 2006, which was good and suitable for the genre and setting, and I am sure nostalgia fans will enjoy it.SoundWhile there was no animated opening or ending, which was unnecessary, the credit song (You: Visionen im Spiegel) was really beautifully done for a big good-bye of the Higurashi anime series; yes, a good-bye because this is the last watchable Higurashi title up to now; I dropped the series after only a few episodes of Gou, and I recommend you do the same after this OVA. All of the other soundtracks are the same as in previous titles, so it will feel like you're watching a missing episode of Kai; the music was fitting for the atmosphere, which is a big plus.StoryThe premise itself was intriguing, because, unlike most other chapters which had similar structure, Outbreak plays out a 'what if' scenario in which almost everyone in Hinamizawa goes insane, and the reason for the villagers' violent actions was justified by the unethical lockdown, not just the spread of a virus. However, there is no plot progression because the events are crammed into a prequel, and it doesn't work as a flashback because it's just another usual time reset, there is no theme exploration, nor was there any retrospectively interesting information, it would have been better to experience this chapter before Kai, but it was meant to be watched after Kai because it spoils some of it. So, to those who have already seen Kai, it appears to be nothing more than a storyless mindless action OVA with an excuse plot that adds nothing to the overall story.'My father was murdered not long ago; let us murder those bastards for harming my friends.'While there is death on-screen for gore and shock purpose, the script fails to create impact for characters who are supposed to be important to the protagonist; Higurashi was appealing because of its mystery rather than its action, which is why the fight scene in the final episode of the first season was embarrassing to watch, and now we have this OVA, which feels more like a low-budget B film action survival horror than a psychological horror mystery. The action itself was hilariously bad and unbelievable, akin to a battle between two school kids wielding a bat and cleaver murdering a hundred adult hunters wielding firearms. What is this, a battle shonen?CharacterThere is no character development and no introduction of new characters. I was hoping to learn more about the 'big bad,' Nomura. They could have shown or hinted at how she intended to spread the virus and profit from it, or why she had personal conflict with Tokyo members like Koizumi, and where the hell is Takano, and what happened to Satoshi? Rather than showing me Rena murdering villagers, educate me on the Tokyo organisation. Instead of using Satoko as a damsel in distress plot device for mindless action, show me how Nomura started the outbreak without killing Rika.ValueWhile Higurashi is not an action-heavy series in general, nor does it focus on gore, some fans enjoyed it for its violent scenes and eccentricity. For those who enjoyed the aforementioned elements, this OVA could serve as blood fanservice. It's also a good thing that Studio Deen didn't leave viewers with a bad taste in their mouths with their awful Kira instalment. This work also balances the bad comedy and ecchi that occurred after Kai; even though it has ridiculous action scenes and a bad plot, this OVA has zero comedy and ecchi; the story includes serious elements such as murder, abduction, hazardous virus lockdown, and crazy brutal religion sacrifice rituals, so this OVA reminds you that Higurashi can become serious when it wishes to.EnjoymentAgain, the premise of the outbreak and the lockdown was interesting; I liked the military elements and the opening scene in which helicopters, military trucks, and armed soldiers roam Hinamizawa. You also get to see the heroes' dark side, not because of a virus, but because they have to make life decisions that result in the deaths of many people. Unlike the implausible Kai conclusion, which shows that no damage or death occurs despite the outbreak of a lethal firearms war, this one demonstrates that it is impossible to save everyone in war."", 'tl;dr: A pretty great introduction that just kind of leaves you hanging.Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku: Outbreak is an OVA that lasts about an hour. It differs tremendously from the previous OVA series, Rei and Kira, in that instead of being light hearted and comedy focused, tone wise this OVA is much closer to the original two seasons in that the focus is on the serious portions. The central plot goes back to being centered around people being effected by the parasite. However it’s still a pretty major departure from the main seasons because unlike the main seasons where the parasite only effected a...select individual from the main cast per arc here the parasites essentially break free and begin effecting everyone. In the main seasons the infected individual would fall under paranoia and begin attacking the other main cast members. Here it seems that while everyone else in the village falls into paranoia, the main cast seem to be effected to a lesser extent and stay united against the common foe of pretty much everyone else. though they still do seem to be infected in that they become as violent as they were arcs where they were affected by the parasite.As such, it’s a very different dynamic compared to the main seasons. It’s much less psychological horror as it is just straight up action horror. There is still some level of psychological horror I suppose in that the village all target members of the main cast due to rumors and grudges, which is somewhat like the oppression Satoko faced jacked up to maximum, but the atmosphere is very different from how it was in the main seasons. Instead of there being a few murders of key individuals that are heavily focused on or dealing with enemies through careful and meticulous planning here it’s much more straight forward in just straight up fighting and killing enemies in order to reach objectives. There is some basic strategy to things, but it takes a back seat to the physical violence aspect. This feels somewhat inconsistent on some points, wherein while Rena was shown even in the main series to be blatantly overpowered as a fighter for some reason, Keiichi being at that level feels kind of off, even taking into account how the first season ended. Still, while it is very different, it is a pretty enjoyable thrill ride and seeing the cast in their violent forms was quite a refreshing change after all the comedic slice of life in the previous OVAs.The biggest issue with this though is that it basically felt like a pilot episode for a series that at this point it is clear will never happen. It shows a dramatically different direction the narrative of Higurashi could go while still staying true to the overall themes and shows how the cast would fit into such a story. It also sets up a few plot lines in the background that could be fleshed out later in an interesting manner, with the plot line developed at the absolute end of the episode feeling like it would be the core of the overarching plot going forward. It’s a string of interesting concepts that if carried forward for a full season that delivered on the checks it was writing could be pretty amazing. However, none of that will come to pass and thus an and of itself it’s far less impressive, especially considering the visual novel that continues this story hasn’t been translated into English and probably never will be.While the art style and designs are the same as all the previous entries in the franchise and it should be clear where you stand on them, the art quality and animation actually felt like somewhat of a step back compared to the previous OVAs and more so at the level of the two main seasons. I suppose that indicates that what I attributed to a quality enhancement in the OVAs may instead have been a change in stylistic choice that is being reverted in this due to going overall back to the style of the main seasons, though I’m not completely sure. The soundtrack fit well enough but wasn’t overall particularly memorable. The ED is like the ED for a film in terms of visuals in that it’s just text on a black screen mostly. The song is also very soft and somewhat bittersweetly hopeful. Even after spending some time thinking about it, I can’t tell if either of these, visuals or audio, fit incredibly well or didn’t fit at all, so I’m going to give them points for doing something interesting at least. select individual from the main cast per arc here the parasites essentially break free and begin effecting everyone.

It does not offer much in the manner of psychological thriller, but it does expand on the greater lore of the setting and throws at you a scenario widely different from the others: one involving the military, a strange virus, and how that leads the village as a whole to fall into a violent paranoia rather than just the main cast.Because the scope is a lot more expanded, less focus is placed on the intra-personal conflicts of the main characters so...they can have a place in that greater scope.I think I enjoyed my time with this movie, even if it went to places that I thought maybe deviated a bit from the core of what I believe Higurashi is, and I would recommend watching it. they can have a place in that greater scope.I think I enjoyed my time with this movie, even if it went to places that I thought maybe deviated a bit from the core of what I believe Higurashi is, and I would recommend watching it.""]"

And above all, a potential of a show that has limitless ways to...go around of, other than being a good time-waster and one of the best Winter 2020 shows of its lineup. And unsurprisingly 3 years later, we get the sequel...which was honest to goodness: a massive letdown of a disappointment. Couple that up with the scathing sequel effect of shows like Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta Otoko a.k.a By the Grace of the Gods and Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha a.k.a The Misfit of Demon King Academy as some of the worst follow-ups from their previous interesting premiere seasons, not to mention that both shows also started in Fall and Summer 2020 respectively, what has 2-3 years of development have been for the effort back then that warranted the sequel that is worse off than what came before?To be fair, Maple and her Maple Tree guild of veteran character stays like Sally and Co., it\'s great to see them back for more ""Players vs. Devs"" kind of online game where the OP-ness knows no bounds, especially with all that has been established with Maple\'s exponential growth in Season 1 3 years ago. And all that time has culminated in Maple Tree being New World Online\'s biggest and most famous (and infamous) guild due to their limitless leader of potential. The other guilds of Mii\'s Flame Emperor and the Order of the Holy Sword under Payne are keeping up their status quos together to make sure that they at least match Maple\'s level, or else not to lag behind like the rest of the players in the game. Of course, since this is Season 2, it\'s Round 2 of a literate game against the developers, pushing their creativity and powers to their limits, ensuring that while the difficulty is amped up but not too much for the most of casual players, there is just no beating Maple at her own game because she feels like she is always 100 steps ahead of the pack, tiring the developers out of way against her every move and targeting the others instead. Smart move, but nope. In the very end, it feels like this show caters to an audience that is all about fun, and don\'t get me wrong as it truly is, but if the anime and its source material has not known anything of its Achilles\' Heel, it\'s knowing the adage of ""the sky is the limit"". Basically, the TL;DR is this: if you\'ve watched Season 1 (which you\'ve definitely seen somehow), the sequel is more of the same, literally copy-paste.Silver Link still shows their promise in this show by pumping out the usual sakuga moments that are of its signature since Season 1, and it is replicated here to good effect, I\'ll give it this much if the studio\'s in-house directors Mirai Minato and Shin Oonuma (chief) knows what kind of game they are playing with Bofuri\'s adaptation. The one disappointment for me though, would be the OST. Junjou no Afilia\'s 2nd OP for Bofuri just sounds pedestrian when compared to the amazing 1st OP graced for Season 1 that\'s just as iconic and still having that whimsical effect, even 3 years later. The ED, like Season 1 however, is forgettable at best and isn\'t noteworthy.Like Kami-tachi and Maou Gakuin, Bofuri haphazardly joins the list of Winter 2023\'s worst Season 2 sequels of a gleaming potential that could be realized back in the day, only to squander it like nobody\'s business, thinking that 2-3 years\' worth of time in-between that the world would degrade even more (that it didn\'t) and just capitalizing on its past goodness, which sadly isn\'t to be found here. It\'s such a shame this could be just as great as Season 1, but for whatever reason, somebody (or somebodies) didn\'t try hard enough to justify its existence.Not much hopes for a Season 3 going forward, but still, an average pass is what I\'m willing to give for Season 2 here.

A downgrade to subpar average repetitiveness.', ""The first season of Bofuri succeeded because it had a lot of the most important elements in an anime: Likable characters, strong pacing, beautiful fight choreography, and excellent moments of art direction when it really was important (particularly in the second half of season 1). But so far, the second season massively falls short in terms of its ability to build upon the framework that the first season created. The thing that took me out of it more than anything was the MASSIVE drop in quality in terms of the pacing. Seriously, in season one whenever a new level was reached or a new boss...was conquered it was a huge deal, and acquiring new skills on Maple felt like a genuine accomplishment.In season two, they rush frantically from level to level, with level four (the Japanese shinto-themed one) barely lasting for longer than a single episode, with the boss to get to level 5 treated like an absolute joke and defeated off-screen. Despite the huge increase in art and animation quality, the framing and choreography of the fights feels much more plain than what I'd come to expect from season one. If there's one piece of advice I've give for a hypothetical Season 3, it'd be to slow the hell down and let the characters/events breathe in the narrative.The characters, one of the highlights of the first season, feel much more one-dimensional in bland throughout what I've seen of Season 2. Bofuri was one of the highlights of my 2018 anime season largely because of the fun and likable characters, but in season 2 they all feel flanderized down to one or two elements of their characters.The music still bangs, at least, a remnant from the first part of the series that I continued to enjoy in the second season as a really creative way of presenting large gaps in the storyline without feeling like they pass immediately. Oh, and not sure where else to put this, but the ending goes WAY harder than it has any right to.The second season falls short of a lot of the promise established in season 1, with largely forgettable bosses and levels hampered by the shitty pacing which makes everything feel inconsequential.

Starting from status debuff stacks to no end (like Maple\'s poison) to the activating magic preemptively and using it as much as you like later. All sounds unbalanced, but it seems fun. And that\'s, what i think is the main selling point.Its story is just a heartwarming group of friends (especially maple and sally), grinding and exploring together. While Sally is a \'pro gamer\', thinking everything thoroughly, Maple is just a braindead player who think ""This might be cool!"" and do whatever she...wants. 2 opposite sides, having fun together, day in and day out. I think this series is not about heavy action or cool pro gamer moves, and more into slice-of-life type anime where you see them doing whatever they wants.The main downside probably is ""How to understand the mechanics of NWO"", since there\'s a lot of things left unexplained ever since season 1. For example, how does Machine God or that demon-transforming skill actually works? can you use another skill in that form? Does poison damage stacks? Is there a limit, like, anywhere? There\'s a lot of things unexplained that sometimes its frustating.But if you just shut your brain off, ignore everything, and enjoying the Maple Tree Guild interaction, this anime is still fine and you might enjoy it. wants. 2 opposite sides, having fun together, day in and day out.

In my opinion, this show is amazing, and I have been enjoying how Maple finds her own ways to make MMOs entertaining for once. The author\'s creativity in the show made me realize how desperate I want a real fictional game. I am more interested in a game that I can invest time and money in rather than making anime...girls real bro.Regarding the show, season two felt a little off from the shining qualities that were present in season one. The show pacing catalyzed quickly, moving to the new levels every 3-4 episodes, but now it\'s every 2 episodes. I was excited to see what the sky level had for Maple and the gang, but it seems the developers were more focused on adding new content quickly, I guess.Speaking of the devs, while I sympathize with their struggle to deal with Maple\'s unconventional approach to becoming overpowered, it\'s not right for them to rush out new worlds and events so quickly. As HyperlinkBlocked pointed out, they seem to be more focused on adding ""unique skills with each expansion"" rather than balancing the gameplay. While Maple did get ONE SINGULAR nerf, which is just a number limit on her shield absorption. I strongly believe the devs should further nerf more of her abilities. For example, they could restrict the number of firearms Machine God can place on the battlefield or introduce an overheating function that\'s common in many games. They could also give her an ammo pool that slowly recharges or cooldowns, or make enemies drop little ammo, which is a common feature in other games like Warframe. Another suggestion is to impose a limit on the number of defence levels Maple can achieve, like what is done in the Souls games, perhaps setting the max at 99 or having promotion levels or something.Aside from nerfs, the devs should stop using impossibly difficult bosses to prevent Maple from progressing. If I were playing New World Online, I would honestly give up if the bosses were nearly impossible to defeat. This is not a good game design. I also don\'t understand why Maple is allowed to use any ability without any requirements. Aren’t all her stats, aside from defence, at one? It seems foolish for the devs to make a literal tank do more damage than the actual DPS. Have they not watched videos of playing WOW? Another improvement would be to introduce a cooldown when switching abilities simultaneously. It doesn\'t make sense for Maple to turn from a literal Touhou mechanical boss to a demon from hell in a span of a few microseconds. Like holy crap, the amount of constant DPS Maple can produce isn’t fair man. Another thing that doesn\'t make sense is why every single side character has a total max HP of 1. None of them has improved in terms of gear or skills in the past 2 seasons, and they all seem like glass cannons in clans that we as viewers don’t know how many there are besides for the big three.Guilds, man. I was really expecting the show to add a new major guild or a new set of characters that are either rivals or new members of Maple Tree. I guess, in some way, the introduction of the new pet system is an attempt to reintroduce some of the characters in the show, but honestly speaking, the devs just forgot to balance it properly. Although getting better pets requires completing a series of tasks or completing a hard dungeon on your own, which I especially like, it isn\'t fair that the only drawback of being slow as a tank can easily be removed by hopping on your pet or even asking somebody to carry you. It avoids the consequences of being the tank, which I 100% hate.Aside from balancing issues, why isn\'t this game allowed for players outside of Japan? If I were living in Maple\'s world, I would be crying myself to sleep because I cannot play one of the most popular VRMMORPG games of all time due to region lock. The devs could make an international version of the game, and they would be making so much money if they did this, but no, they are more focused on ""balancing"" Maple over actual profits. However, I am glad that the devs did not add any sort of loot boxes or other gambling alternatives to the game. I would combust if I could buy crates to get OP skills or level up a goddamn battle pass; I really don’t want this game to turn into Fortnite.Now onto the actual review of the show:The pacing of S2 of Bofuri can feel fast-paced at times, especially at the beginning when the show switches to a new level within a short span of two episodes or less. Despite this, the show remains engaging and entertaining throughout. Although the season can become repetitive in the challenges that the characters face, the show\'s unique and unconventional approach to problem-solving keeps it fresh and interesting. Additionally, the animation quality improves significantly as the season progresses, although the early episodes suffer from poor CGI usage that can be distracting.Despite these shortcomings, the plot of Bofuri is simple but effective, with Maple and her friends taking on new challenges and exploring the world of ""New World Online."" The characters are well-developed and likable, with Maple standing out as a protagonist who uses her unorthodox strategies and high defensive capabilities to overcome obstacles.The sound and animation in the show are top-notch, with the soundtrack being catchy and fitting for the show\'s light-hearted tone. The fight scenes are well-executed and visually impressive, and the same goes along with the designs of the bosses and characters which are all unique and imaginative.Another strength of the show is the development of the characters, particularly Maple and her close friends, and the heart-warming way they interact and support one with one another. The show also explores the different strategies and abilities of the various guilds and players, which is fascinating to see. I also appreciate how the show explores the different strategies and abilities of the various guilds and players, and how they adapt to new challenges throughout the eps.In conclusion, Bofuri season two is a wholesome and entertaining anime that will appeal to fans of the first season and anyone looking for a light-hearted and enjoyable anime with engaging characters and exciting action scenes. Although it may suffer from some pacing issues and repetitive elements, the show\'s unique approach to problem-solving and likable characters more than makeup for any shortcomings.Note:I am just saying, but it would be interesting to see the developers of ""New World Online"" explore the origins and purpose of the Machine God. It could add a new layer of depth and complexity to the world-building of the game and provide a fresh and exciting plotline for the characters to follow.It would also be fascinating to see how Maple\'s ability to acquire new skills and upgrades is linked to the Machine God\'s existence. Perhaps there could be some sort of connection between the two, with the Machine God providing Maple with a power boost or unlocking new abilities for her to use in battle.Furthermore, delving deeper into the lore and backstory of the Machine God could provide opportunities to introduce new characters and expand the world of the game. It could also open up new avenues for exploration and discovery within the game, with Maple and her friends venturing into uncharted territory to uncover the secrets of the Machine God and its purpose within the game. While that’s the end of my review, and I hope that the author reads this review and considers my ideas in later seasons.Thanks for reading. girls real bro.Regarding the show, season two felt a little off from the shining qualities that were present in season one.

Just used to fill a episode.Fights have no impact and aren’t interesting as they are over quickly have no build up and nothing of risk is on the line.The overpowerdness of characters becomes boring as they are never challenged and the quirkiness and uniqness of new skills has...lost its impact and are overdone.All clan rivalries are squashed and they all become friends working together.Half way through it becomes Pokémon as now all character battle with pets.It just seems overall lazy with nothing of value entertainment wise to enjoy.The last episode was the best out of a bad bunch and sets up what seems to be a slightly more interesting s3 with finally some sort of challenge to maple tree. lost its impact and are overdone.All clan rivalries are squashed and they all become friends working together.Half way through it becomes Pokémon as now all character battle with pets.It just seems overall lazy with nothing of value entertainment wise to enjoy.The last episode was the best out of a bad bunch and sets up what seems to be a slightly more interesting s3 with finally some sort of challenge to maple tree.', ""For better or for worse, S2 of BoFuri doesn't bring much of anything new to the table. That is to say that if you enjoyed the first season, you will enjoy this one, too. They're pretty much the exact same thing. Simultaneously, if you thought S1 was not for you, this installment will not redeem shit. Be at peace and move on.The only tangible change I could detect was that of my own deteriorating enjoyment of the series. S2 reveals an unintended consequence of releasing anime in a seasonal format, rather than continuously, as scores of old anime used to. Because it is released separately,...rather than a simple continuation, which is what it actually is, the new installment ends up feeling like more of a sequel. This represents an important difference in nuance that cannot be dismissed out of hand.There is a fundamentally different set of expectations in play when the show goes from BoFuri episode 12 to BoFuri episode 13, versus when it goes from BoFuri episode 12 to BoFuri season 2 episode 1. Like it or not, when you wait months, maybe even years for a new season, you can't help but build expectations to see something new and exciting, rather than just have the story pick back up where it left off and go on as though nothing happened.Unfortunately, that's exactly what BoFuri does. It just kind of keeps going and nothing really happens, because all of the investigation of the in-universe laws and concepts was already over and done with by the end of the first season. There's nothing left to explore. It's no longer a fantasy adventure show, but rather just slice-of-life – video game slice-of-life of life with no shortage of action, to be sure, but slice-of-life of life nonetheless, because nothing matters anymore. There are no more stakes, because all of the players from the 3 main guilds are friends now. So, you literally get to just sit there and watch them honest-to-God play a terribly designed video game and hang out for 4 hours. Had this been a 2 cour show with 24 episodes instead of 2 seasons of 12, I'm sure I wouldn’t have felt as disappointed.Granted, you might say that vydja slice-of-life is the whole point of this show. I’ve no argument with you there. Correct, that is indubitably the whole point. I'm just saying what I'm saying to set expectations accordingly.Mind you, I am also not suggesting that I have a solution for the inadvertent repercussion of the seasonal release format. This is just me pointing out that the problem exists – simply consider it food for thought. I'm certainly not advocating going back to the perpetual weekly broadcast paradigm, especially not when considering the pacing of modern One Piece and Black Clover – and I would rather get waterboarded than see another Naruto filler episode.What I will say in defense of BoFuri’s second installment is that it's not a cocktease in terms of Maple’s power-ups and abilities. The show won't surreptitiously forget that she can do all that OP bullshit in order to nerf her and introduce tension, as so many other shows are known to do. “Oh, no! I have no idea how to balance this overpowered ability I've given this character and I can't write around it. Never mind, just pretend it never happened!” And you're left there wondering, hold on a minute, why is this character struggling here? Why doesn't he just use that super powerful ability again? No, in the case of Maple, you will get to see it all again as much and as many times as you like, Predator, Loving Sacrifice, Atrocity, Hydra, Machine God, the whole 9 yards.If anything, for the first couple of episodes, I felt as though the show was being too liberal in showcasing her abilities, but then I remembered, nothing that's happening matters. It's just cutesy moeshit that’s not meant to be serious or go anywhere. It's just supposed to make you feel good about yourself for a little while. Sure enough, she will gain additional broken skills and abilities during this season, as well, but none of them really felt as memorable to me as the aforementioned ones from S1.Far and away the best thing about it were some of the new zones and vistas. In a select few scenes, the background art gave birth to some environments that I couldn't help but wonder how much cooler and more fascinating they would have been in a story with an actual narrative that was capable of putting them to good use.As such, I can say I had a decently good time with it, and if you thought the previous installment was nice, then why not give this one the good ol’ college try? Though I must admit, I certainly had to make a conscious effort to stay engaged and watch the next episode every time, rather than let myself get distracted by other, ostensibly more interesting things.

There really just wasn't that much to this sequel."", 'Season 2 of Bofuri is disappointingly mediocre, with it feeling like it was more fun for the writer to imagine and write it out than for the audience to watch. Bofuri essentially discards, or perhaps more accurately does not develop, a core part of its premise of being an MMO. Instead, it favours only dealing with aspects within the game itself, making it feel dangerously close to a banal isekai. While the first season barely factored in happenings in Maple\'s real life affecting her gaming, Season 2 somehow omits this even further. Instead of expanding on elements that would help genuinely differentiate it from an...isekai, Bofuri attempts to match the genre blow for blow. It creates a disappointingly trite experience that oscillates between boredom at the shallowness of the characters and the lack of meaning in its action scenes.The primary issue with Bofuri is that it sets up the implicit promise of being a story about playing an MMO instead of being transported into the world of one. Admittedly, season 1 did not focus heavily on this element but had a few things working in its favour. The most important was that Bofuri was still fresh for the audience. There was a steady escalation of scale and absurdity, with the viewer and the characters simultaneously discovering the video game setting. This kept viewers engaged through a combination of novelty and the understanding that this laid the necessary framework for exploring stories about playing an MMO. In a way, season 1 of Bofuri excellently captured the experience of a new player being drawn into the world of a game, with how wonderous and engrossing it can be in that honeymoon phase. Despite lacking substantial interaction between the real world and the world of the video game, it still kept the MMO player section of the audience engaged since the experience felt genuine. This was combined with how fresh Bofuri felt then compared to its peers. Most of its direct competitors were straight-up isekais that ranged from trite to completely vapid, allowing Bofuri to stand out by not being directly in their genre.With season 2, we get functionally more of the status quo, which was already wearing thin by the end of season 1. The finale already long overstayed its welcome, spanning over a quarter of the season. Yet the guild-on-guild clash was still passable as a climax to the growing escalation of power then. The problem that is now glaringly obvious is that there is almost nowhere to go from there in terms of spectacle. A core part of Bofuri\'s identity and its central joke is Maple breaking the game, albeit unintentionally. To the point where scenarios meant to be gripping, edge-of-your-seat battles are reduced to either comedic encounters or overpowered in hilariously over-the-top ways. This means that Bofuri does not have the option of drawing on the outcome of its battles for its dramatic tension. The core narrative of season 2 opting to be nothing but continued combat encounters makes its entire run feel meaningless. With how incoherent, poorly explained, and frankly broken the game\'s systems are, there is no way to make battles feel like they are following a sense of internal logic. It is all reduced to feeling arbitrary or adhering to what the writer thought would be the most entertaining conclusion. This being a video game does not help things since failure, or even success, is largely a trivial matter without inherent stakes.This is not to say the audience cannot be invested in something lower stakes than the trite ""you die in the game, you die in real life"" setting for other series. But the problem is that battles have a distinct lack of meaning as just showpieces with the characters bumbling into them or being an arbitrary prerequisite for some event. This comes back to the problem of all the characters being paper thin, even moving into the second season. It was passable in season 1 as a consequence of choosing to develop the premise and world first. But aside from increasing the number of fights without Maple present, extremely little has been done to develop them. The Maple Tree guild is still this amorphous group of people trading pleasantries instead of feeling like a genuine group of friends. As a result, there is little understanding of their motivations for participating in events other than ""it\'s a fun video game"" and, by extension, little emotional consequence for failing to perform. A primary concern regarding MMOs is that they are time-consuming and can feel like a second job. A strong community is a significant part of what keeps players involved and something Bofuri seemed poised to dig into. If the stakes, conflict and motivation cannot come from the game world, then the obvious option would be to have it stem from managing the relationships between players. Sadly, this season only adds to the chaotic bloat by giving everyone pets but doing nothing to deepen their characterisation.There is still some entertainment to be had from the sheer spectacle alone, but frankly, Bofuri\'s animation has never been anything outstanding. Moreover, with some distractingly poorly composited CGI this season, it is hard to argue that the main draw of Bofuri is in watching things play out. It all creates the distinct feeling that the original author was getting carried away. Everything in Bofuri seems like it is something cool to imagine but gets drawn out too far in a combination of lacklustre animation and shallow investment of characters in its outcome. The aesthetic incoherence of the game world starts to seem less like a deliberate choice to set up joke scenarios and more like the author throwing everything into the blender. Instead of parodying some JRPGs that lose control over their internal coherence due to adding in too many different genres, it becomes it. Of course, none of this is an indictment against the author. It is perfectly understandable how someone creative can get carried away. And in a way, it does feel endearing and genuine since the combination seems too chaotic to be a cynical attempt to appeal to a mass audience. However, it is objectively true that indulgence in this instead of focusing on coherence or character has made for a worse narrative.That is not to say that season 2 did not show some moments of potential. The most interesting parts that kept me watching early on were the mention of Maple being sick and Sally\'s inability to stomach horror. These were interesting because the problem was not tied to power level within the game. It created a distinct opportunity to develop their characters further. How does Maple deal with missing out on an event? And by extension, how does she deal with having to dedicate so much time to an MMO? In the first season, it is mentioned that she is already having difficulties with her studies. In Sally\'s case, how does she balance her fear with her desire to be a power gamer? And how does this affect her image in the guild? Do the more junior members start relying on her less? While the joke scenarios about Sally getting around the horror level are entertaining, they have little utility beyond the first initial laughs. That is not to say the show should do away with them, but there needs to be something more substantial to back it up. The characters are already endearing, but that is just on the surface and cannot carry the show through the long term. It is suitable for a few chuckles and smiles but lacks that connection or understanding that keeps invested in characters.After 24 episodes, most of the secondary cast is still nothing but tropes and caricatures. Much of their time to shine is dedicated to advancing their vaguely defined powers instead of giving them depth. In fact, developing characters would be the solution to many issues. How other shows like A Certain Scientific Railgun limit the agency of powerful characters like Misaka and build tension is through social constraints. They cannot act as they please, not because they lack the raw power but because it would be inappropriate and conflict with their interpersonal goals. This is not to say Bofuri should turn into a show that revolves around heavy character conflicts since that would drastically change its tone. However, having some element of opposing desires within the guild would make things infinitely more interesting and limit the only outcome being Maple coming in to end the problem. Even on the comedy side, it would allow more of the laughs to come from characters playing off each other than being limited to the scenario. Right now, most of Bofuri\'s jokes come from arbitrary outcomes that happen to the characters instead of a difference in response to the situation or a clash of their personalities. In the end, the intra-guild relationships are a big part of what makes an MMO special, and the lack of emphasis on it feels both like a missed opportunity and a significant limitation of where the story can go.Overall, season 2 of Bofuri is disappointingly mediocre, with little to get a viewer invested in the characters. I deliberately used the term scenario instead of the plot since there is no real coherent story, and it is still just moving from event to event. While this is fine for action comedies, it then means that things hinge more on the currently sorely lacking characters. It is also true that Bofuri made no explicit promise to explore being an MMO player and how real life intersects or even competes with gaming. However, it was also the only thing that set Bofuri apart and gave it the potential to surpass its peers. With its focus squarely on its fictional world and having nothing but absurd battle after battle, it starts to feel incredibly hollow, with little to differentiate it from an isekai. The season still got the occasional smile or chuckle out of me, and it is not distastefully trying to glorify its protagonist as an author/viewer insert like most isekai. Yet achieving minimum expectations cannot be said to make something good.Sadly, Bofuri is at most a 5 out of 10. It has even made me reconsider how much my praise for season 1 was for its potential instead of concrete merits. Maybe this was the direction Bofuri had always intended to go in, but in that case, it cannot really be said to appeal to MMO players despite being about one. Perhaps the season 1 finale should have tempered my expectations since it was emblematic of the series\' trajectory. Nevertheless, I still cannot help but wish that we got a more character-driven Bofuri that focused on guild shenanigans and managing the game with their real-life responsibilities instead of constant over-the-top battles. With season 3 looking to only add to the character bloat and focus even more on battling, I think I will be dropping the series at this juncture. isekai, Bofuri attempts to match the genre blow for blow. It creates a disappointingly trite experience that oscillates between boredom at the shallowness of the characters and the lack of meaning in its action scenes.The primary issue with Bofuri is that it sets up the implicit promise of being a story about playing an MMO instead of being transported into the world of one. Admittedly, season 1 did not focus heavily on this element but had a few things working in its favour. The most important was that Bofuri was still fresh for the audience. There was a steady escalation of scale and absurdity, with the viewer and the characters simultaneously discovering the video game setting. This kept viewers engaged through a combination of novelty and the understanding that this laid the necessary framework for exploring stories about playing an MMO. In a way, season 1 of Bofuri excellently captured the experience of a new player being drawn into the world of a game, with how wonderous and engrossing it can be in that honeymoon phase. Despite lacking substantial interaction between the real world and the world of the video game, it still kept the MMO player section of the audience engaged since the experience felt genuine. This was combined with how fresh Bofuri felt then compared to its peers. Most of its direct competitors were straight-up isekais that ranged from trite to completely vapid, allowing Bofuri to stand out by not being directly in their genre.With season 2, we get functionally more of the status quo, which was already wearing thin by the end of season 1. The finale already long overstayed its welcome, spanning over a quarter of the season. Yet the guild-on-guild clash was still passable as a climax to the growing escalation of power then. The problem that is now glaringly obvious is that there is almost nowhere to go from there in terms of spectacle. A core part of Bofuri\'s identity and its central joke is Maple breaking the game, albeit unintentionally. To the point where scenarios meant to be gripping, edge-of-your-seat battles are reduced to either comedic encounters or overpowered in hilariously over-the-top ways. This means that Bofuri does not have the option of drawing on the outcome of its battles for its dramatic tension. The core narrative of season 2 opting to be nothing but continued combat encounters makes its entire run feel meaningless. With how incoherent, poorly explained, and frankly broken the game\'s systems are, there is no way to make battles feel like they are following a sense of internal logic. It is all reduced to feeling arbitrary or adhering to what the writer thought would be the most entertaining conclusion. This being a video game does not help things since failure, or even success, is largely a trivial matter without inherent stakes.This is not to say the audience cannot be invested in something lower stakes than the trite ""you die in the game, you die in real life"" setting for other series. But the problem is that battles have a distinct lack of meaning as just showpieces with the characters bumbling into them or being an arbitrary prerequisite for some event. This comes back to the problem of all the characters being paper thin, even moving into the second season. It was passable in season 1 as a consequence of choosing to develop the premise and world first. But aside from increasing the number of fights without Maple present, extremely little has been done to develop them. The Maple Tree guild is still this amorphous group of people trading pleasantries instead of feeling like a genuine group of friends. As a result, there is little understanding of their motivations for participating in events other than ""it\'s a fun video game"" and, by extension, little emotional consequence for failing to perform. A primary concern regarding MMOs is that they are time-consuming and can feel like a second job. A strong community is a significant part of what keeps players involved and something Bofuri seemed poised to dig into. If the stakes, conflict and motivation cannot come from the game world, then the obvious option would be to have it stem from managing the relationships between players. Sadly, this season only adds to the chaotic bloat by giving everyone pets but doing nothing to deepen their characterisation.There is still some entertainment to be had from the sheer spectacle alone, but frankly, Bofuri\'s animation has never been anything outstanding. Moreover, with some distractingly poorly composited CGI this season, it is hard to argue that the main draw of Bofuri is in watching things play out. It all creates the distinct feeling that the original author was getting carried away. Everything in Bofuri seems like it is something cool to imagine but gets drawn out too far in a combination of lacklustre animation and shallow investment of characters in its outcome. The aesthetic incoherence of the game world starts to seem less like a deliberate choice to set up joke scenarios and more like the author throwing everything into the blender. Instead of parodying some JRPGs that lose control over their internal coherence due to adding in too many different genres, it becomes it. Of course, none of this is an indictment against the author. It is perfectly understandable how someone creative can get carried away. And in a way, it does feel endearing and genuine since the combination seems too chaotic to be a cynical attempt to appeal to a mass audience. However, it is objectively true that indulgence in this instead of focusing on coherence or character has made for a worse narrative.That is not to say that season 2 did not show some moments of potential. The most interesting parts that kept me watching early on were the mention of Maple being sick and Sally\'s inability to stomach horror. These were interesting because the problem was not tied to power level within the game. It created a distinct opportunity to develop their characters further. How does Maple deal with missing out on an event? And by extension, how does she deal with having to dedicate so much time to an MMO? In the first season, it is mentioned that she is already having difficulties with her studies. In Sally\'s case, how does she balance her fear with her desire to be a power gamer? And how does this affect her image in the guild? Do the more junior members start relying on her less? While the joke scenarios about Sally getting around the horror level are entertaining, they have little utility beyond the first initial laughs. That is not to say the show should do away with them, but there needs to be something more substantial to back it up. The characters are already endearing, but that is just on the surface and cannot carry the show through the long term. It is suitable for a few chuckles and smiles but lacks that connection or understanding that keeps invested in characters.After 24 episodes, most of the secondary cast is still nothing but tropes and caricatures. Much of their time to shine is dedicated to advancing their vaguely defined powers instead of giving them depth. In fact, developing characters would be the solution to many issues. How other shows like A Certain Scientific Railgun limit the agency of powerful characters like Misaka and build tension is through social constraints. They cannot act as they please, not because they lack the raw power but because it would be inappropriate and conflict with their interpersonal goals. This is not to say Bofuri should turn into a show that revolves around heavy character conflicts since that would drastically change its tone. However, having some element of opposing desires within the guild would make things infinitely more interesting and limit the only outcome being Maple coming in to end the problem. Even on the comedy side, it would allow more of the laughs to come from characters playing off each other than being limited to the scenario. Right now, most of Bofuri\'s jokes come from arbitrary outcomes that happen to the characters instead of a difference in response to the situation or a clash of their personalities. In the end, the intra-guild relationships are a big part of what makes an MMO special, and the lack of emphasis on it feels both like a missed opportunity and a significant limitation of where the story can go.Overall, season 2 of Bofuri is disappointingly mediocre, with little to get a viewer invested in the characters. I deliberately used the term scenario instead of the plot since there is no real coherent story, and it is still just moving from event to event. While this is fine for action comedies, it then means that things hinge more on the currently sorely lacking characters. It is also true that Bofuri made no explicit promise to explore being an MMO player and how real life intersects or even competes with gaming. However, it was also the only thing that set Bofuri apart and gave it the potential to surpass its peers. With its focus squarely on its fictional world and having nothing but absurd battle after battle, it starts to feel incredibly hollow, with little to differentiate it from an isekai. The season still got the occasional smile or chuckle out of me, and it is not distastefully trying to glorify its protagonist as an author/viewer insert like most isekai. Yet achieving minimum expectations cannot be said to make something good.Sadly, Bofuri is at most a 5 out of 10. It has even made me reconsider how much my praise for season 1 was for its potential instead of concrete merits. Maybe this was the direction Bofuri had always intended to go in, but in that case, it cannot really be said to appeal to MMO players despite being about one. Perhaps the season 1 finale should have tempered my expectations since it was emblematic of the series\' trajectory. Nevertheless, I still cannot help but wish that we got a more character-driven Bofuri that focused on guild shenanigans and managing the game with their real-life responsibilities instead of constant over-the-top battles. With season 3 looking to only add to the character bloat and focus even more on battling, I think I will be dropping the series at this juncture.', ""Bofuri is a bad anime done well, it knows what it is, and it excels in it, it knows its a trash power fantasy SAO clone / parody, and as such it doesn't seek to take itself seriously, instead it seeks to have as much fun with that premise as possible. So it is an entertaining fun ride, as long as you don't look to take it seriously.Season 2 picks up where Season 1 left off,While the first half of S1 was Maple accidentally becoming OP and the comedy that came from that, towards the end it shifted to Maple being considered the true monster...of NWO, and with the Devs despairing over how she kept breaking the game.Series 2 focuses more on Maple Tree as a guild, and them all becoming increasingly OP and their place as one of the top three guilds within NWO, of cause the story has moved away from Maple becoming accidentally OP, as she's already OP at this point, so it is more on her having fun and her interactions with others. Of cause the Devs still despair about Maple and her game breaking antics, but that is only to be expected.For me this was as good as S1, because it is just as much dumb fun as S1 was, it's unapologetically trash, and it is entertaining as a result of NWO, and with the Devs despairing over how she kept breaking the game.Series 2 focuses more on Maple Tree as a guild, and them all becoming increasingly OP and their place as one of the top three guilds within NWO, of cause the story has moved away from Maple becoming accidentally OP, as she's already OP at this point, so it is more on her having fun and her interactions with others.

Why? Because it plays safe.It throws moe elements (uWus, hahas... You know them) and mixes it with your favorite gaming and isekai elements (OP protagonist, stereotypical guild members, lots of gaming bullshit... You know them too) except the harem stuff. The Anime never goes to...do anything big or better, it just plays around.One of the best things about this Anime is that it never treats itself with simplicity. Everything is grander, colorful, and sometimes hilariously weirder, but never spiritless or generic. Maple, our OP cinnamon roll, is just that cute girl who found about the wonders of the gaming world, and fun exploring that world with found friends. But she doesn\'t want to get hurt soo... She wanders around and finds the most demonous & outright unfitting abilities. Like I would be pretty weirded out if I see an Anime girl getting a hand full of tentacles, and that\'s not even the weirdest moment of the Anime. Like once Sally said, we can never predict what Maple is about.The hike in animation quality is worth some praise. I remember watching a few CGI moments from S1, thinking how better it would\'ve been if it was 2D, and the animators did make most things 2D in S2. Not saying it\'s flawless though, there are many blink-&-u-miss shots and also a fair amount of CGI monsters, especially in final episode (probably a result of delay). But the direction during its action sequences keeps things engaging despite the flaws. The music is your generic isekai/fantasy OST. Nothing noteworthy there.As stated before, this Anime is all about having fun with friends that have a common interest. And I agree that is a wonderful thing. But what left me a bit concerned is not showing the characters outside the game. A fun part about gaming comes not only from the game but talking about it outside, making jokes, seeing how that brought small changes in ourselves, whether it\'s healthy or not. This is something S1 did. Maple\'s so much in-game time made her say attack names while playing dodgeball, in real life. Despite being about gaming, S1 made sure that these are not just gamers with no life, but actual students who still have something of interest outside gaming. In S2, we never got to see what happened outside the game.And also, wouldn\'t it be interesting to see these characters, who formed so much of the team, meeting in real life, having a chat in a cafe or something? That might not be the best part, it also might beat the premise, but it\'s definitely important, to show that these characters are true friends and not just online buddies.

That\'s all.', ""Pretty good follow up to season 1. It quite often felt a bit sparse, often not knowing what was going on with the action. Its action was definitely worse than season 1's, however the story was just as good, or even better. With such a large cast, they managed to give everyone a reasonable amount of screen time and found interesting methods of keeping each character important to the plot. If you compare it to season 1 which was just as good as this, but with less flaws. Season 2 is worse than season 1, but that does not mean season 2 is bad, which...is something most people don't understand. There are countless problems in both seasons, namely: having too many people, abilities and places. With a more concise story, it would be much easier to see everything good about this show. The best parts of the show for me are two things which many similar action manga fail at. First is the power scaling. Throughout the show, it never feels like the main character or any other characters are completely out of reach. Yes, it is clear that the main character is undoubtedly the best player, but the show repeatedly poses challenges to the characters which show the main character is not invincible and not much better than everyone else. The primary example of this is in the dynamics with the second main character (voiced by the best VA ima), where the main character is consistently outperforming her, but on many occasions, a threat, battle or challenge is shown to both of them which is only completed because of either the teamwork of each of their strengths or one of (either of) their strengths.The other pitfall other action anime and film fail in is the suddenness of failure. Many good actions of all forms of film understand to have your characters lose to build character and relatability. These however, do a bad job of this. It often feels either inevitable or surprising for these characters to lose. What I mean by this is that main characters will often be shown to be either much stronger or weaker than their contemporaries making it feel either like a robbery for the character to lose, or something you were just waiting for, with no suspense. Bofuri does a good thing called 'weaknesses'. Each character has a flaw which is shown and worked around and when the characters you're rooting for actually lose, or simply not win (not place first or something similar), or even get impeded, it was clear to the audience that these were real threats from the beginning. With each encounter every action which is not intended to be a surprise can be followed by the audience. Furthermore, a not insignificant amount of the non-action plot revolves around managing these flaws and hiding them from potential rivals and enemies, making them feel important.This show isn't perfect and I haven't mentioned the episode where they forget to stop using 3D animation causing it to feel low budget and gross, but its a genuinely good show. For every small error or plot hole they have, they avoid a distinct pitfall plaguing many similar shows.I recommend this anime to anyone who is tired of terrible scaling in anime and is fine with some minor inconsistencies and flaws.

From the beginning, it aimed to be something not serious, its selling point is absurdity giving Maple the strangest...abilities the author could think of to make her far more powerful than the majority of enemies in a similar vein to one punch man but ""cutesy"" (she\'s not actually that strong and does struggle often but the core plot point is similar).~♡~My biggest complaint about this series is simply that it\'s too short, Bofuri being limited to 12 episodes caused many elements from the light novel to be cut out. In the original work, you get a much deeper insight into the mentality and abilities of the side characters like Sally (prime example). In the light novel she feels insecure about her own abilities and strives to improve so she could be of help to Maple (this happened between floors 5 & 6 I believe, the anime is currently on 7) and that helps you understand and care more for her as a character, not just the obligatory lovable best friend. The anime while showing some shadow of that plot doesn\'t really include it at all.~♡~The light novel also explains many of the side quests to show where the characters obtained certain abilities, of course, the anime does include the most important ones such as Sally\'s boots but some slightly minor abilities were simply never explained and they could just use them, or have either not been used yet/were completely removed.

In the first one, they got pets, created a guild, got members, had guild wars, etc. In this second season, the only thing I remember is now everyone has a pet. There was nothing that was exciting as the first season. Because we know that Maple and all the other guilds are super strong and are basically unkillable. At least in the first season, it seemed Maple had a weakness against Pierce attacks. In this season, it felt more of the same, nothing is really different. Maple and friends go on a...new floor and easily wipe with the new event coming up which they win in. I did not really like all of the screen time all the side characters got. They had a moment against a boss and easily wipe onto the next character, repeat, etc.If you just want to watch an OP cast of characters kill everything that's cool. I found this 2nd season to be fine, not bad. new floor and easily wipe with the new event coming up which they win in. I did not really like all of the screen time all the side characters got.

The first time I watched it, I really liked it and I spent a sleepless night devouring season 1. Fight, fun, friendship, magic: it was all there. Sadly, the same can't be said for Season 2. This new season doesn't live up to Season 1. There isn't too much epic combat, and Maple hasn't received a new weapon to match. it's worth it. I was expecting Maple to get a weapon stronger than Mechanical God, but here I am a bit disappointed. If there is a season 3, I hope there will finally be...epic fights and above all, that Maple gets stronger weapons. epic fights and above all, that Maple gets stronger weapons."", '(Note: the following review is written by someone who has read the WN following the first season)To begin with, let’s go over the complaints that some people are making about this season and my responses to them:There’s no real plot this season: To begin with, Bofuri is a slice of life show. As such, there’s no major threat to conquer or goal to reach, with most of the story is basically just a VRMMORPG player and her online pals enjoying the game. Also, with the first season being focused on introducing the show’s world and characters, the second season prefers to take things easy as...it makes its way towards the 8th Event. Third, one thing that viewers should take into consideration is the fact that Bofuri is in a ""down period"" at this point in the light novel as well, with the writer not really finding the ""post-Season 1"" groove until the 7th Layer. Finally, there is some sort of ongoing conflict in the season in the form of ""players vs. developers"", as the developers are trying come up with ways to make the 7th and 8th Events a challenge to the stronger players of the game.The season feels rushed: This is what happens when you only have 12 episodes to cover five volumes worth of material (something that I expected). However, the reality is that only the first third (which covers the 4-6th Layers) has the rushed feel to it, and considering the content in the WN, I can see why this happened. Most of the 4th Layers being covered in one episode? It was basically a bunch of short tales that lasted half a volume in the LN. The 5th Layer not even having an episode to itself? It wasn’t really explored in the LN as well, as the focus instead went towards Maple’s battle with the oni and the 6th Event. Zipping by the 7th event in 1.5 episodes? The event was basically just Maple and Sally (with the 6th Floor itself being basically Maple only for most of it), and outside of some gained skills that the anime cut, it was mostly fluff that could have been tedious if it went an extra episode (with the anime handling it in a manner that gets through it quickly while ensuring that none of the floors get cut). By the time the season reaches the 7th Layer, the pacing returns to that is found in the first season, with each of the remaining volumes covered in the season receiving four episodes each.Maple is OP: That’s part of the fun of Bofuri: the idea of Maple being an OP character who does her own thing. However, keep in mind that not only does Maple have some struggles in some of her battles, but also the anime has to trim some stuff for the sake of time while changing some things around (i.e. Maple\'s Atrocity form not working on the gatekeeper to the 4th Layer in the WN; it was Maple who needed the twins\' help against the 5th Layer mountain god in the WN rather than the other way around in the anime).If there is really any complaints to be made of the season, it’s the following:The occasional lack of its “soul”: To me, Bofuri is at its best when it combines the action, lightheartedness, and ensemble aspect. The better episodes and moments are those that happen to combine all three, while others can be forgettable. For instance, look at the season finale: outside of the final thirty seconds to tease the third season, the only part of the episode that I really got into was the bit where the army of Atrocity Maples, Chrom, and the twins were going all Shadow of the Colossus on the final enemy of the 8th Event. Other than that, I wasn’t really drawn into the fight, and I felt like the closing credits sequence should have involved at least the rest of Maple Tree instead of having it be limited to just the two main characters.The handling of Mai and Yui: To me, it feels like the twins are downplayed when compared to the light novel, as if someone in production has an issue with those two. The “mountain king” battle switched things around so that the twins needed Maple’s help in taking it out instead of the other way around (although I’m guessing it’s the anime’s way of including a nod to a cut 4th Layer incident involving the Minimax Trio). The bear summon quest has it so that they have issues with the boss of the quest, whereas it was relatively easy in the LN and the part they struggled with was getting to it (I did like the other changes that at the episode make though, as it avoided the two having to do the quest twice, prevented them from attacking something cute, and added some scenes featuring them and Kasumi). However, the one that really got on my nerve is how the anime changed their situation in during the party scattering portion of the 8th Event so that they wind up together and needing to be protected by Kanade, screwing over not only older sister Mai, who wasn’t with Yui and Kanade in the LN, but also central character Maple, as she was the one that Mai was paired with, with the most memorable part of the LN’s telling of the party scattering section consisting of what those two did while they wait to reunite with the rest of Maple Tree.As for season itself, as mentioned earlier, the first third has a rushed feel to it as a result of the season having only 12 episodes and it wanting to properly cover the stuff set in the 7th Layer. However, once the season gets to that layer, things begin to slowdown, allowing for some of the charm of the first season to be appreciated without it being told at breakneck speed.Like the first season, part of what makes Bofuri go great is its central character, Maple, and the crazy stuff she gets into. Whether it’s causing a major bug to appear while chasing a pair of twin ghosts, eating an octopus that drags her down to its lair, or taking control of a crocodile and firing lasers out of its mouth, Maple is as crazy as ever. Meanwhile, her skills and gear continue to grow, with new additions including a throne a blocks dark magic and enemies, a pair of hands that can hold additional shields (hoping for a third season, as that item’s full potential is realized there), and the ability to turn her arm into tentacles.Meanwhile, another strength of Bofuri is the ensemble aspect of its cast, especially when it comes to the female characters, and that is seen this season. Like the previous season, Maple’s best friend, Sally, and their proteges, Mai and Yui, have their moments both with and without Maple. Meanwhile, the other female members of Maple Tree get some growth, with Kasumi getting her long-awaited powerup in the form of a cursed sword (at the cost of wearing revealing clothing when using it and turning into a child when using a certain move), while Izu gets a chance to show off both her role as a “team mother” and her expertise in explosives. The ensemble aspect isn’t just limited to Maple Tree, as Flame Emperors leader Mii and Holy Order member Frederica become more active in the series as the friendly rivals of Maple and Sally, respectively (with the penultimate episode of the season featuring the four teaming up).However, the one character element that really got my attention was the main addition that Bofuri had this season: the summon system that Maple and Sally has “early access” to via Syrup and Oboro is fully implemented in the 7th Layer, with the rest of the main cast (and some minor characters) getting their own partners. In terms of the partners, there’s a little something for everyone. For those who want something cool, among the ones that viewers got a kick out of include Chrom’s living suit of armor (with Chrom wearing it, complete with a suit up scene straight out of the Ruby-Spears cartoon Centurions) and Shin’s cowboy hat-wearing hawk. For those who prefer something cute, the Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear inspired summons of Mai and Yui follow in Syrup’s footsteps in terms of maintaining cuteness even in giant form and being able to steal the scene. As for Mii and Payne, the title takes advantage of Maple’s partner being a turtle and develops a “Four Gods” theme through Mii’s phoenix, Ignis, and Payne’s dragon, Ray (while Maple Tree adds to the the concept of representing Genbu via Kasumi’s snake companion). Meanwhile, for those who prefer the original summons of Syrup and Oboro, not only do they still shine in the series (Syrup is still the best summon of the show, with one of the most adorable moments of the season being a scene where he plays with Maple’s tentacles), but they also receive an evolution that results in new abilities and some new looks (props to Silver Link for maintaining for not using the LN designs and instead maintaining the green and white body coloring that is part of Syrup’s cuteness).In terms of recommending the show, it depends on the situation. For those who’ve watched the first season of the show, it will require a little understanding that the season has to rush through its “down period” and doesn’t really start to feel like the previous season until episode 5 (while the exciting elements that people feel are still missing from the season will not be back until the following season, if there is one). However, if you’re just looking for a lighthearted show that will put a smile on your face, then it’s worth checking out (heck, the penultimate episode was something some anime fans needed after the premiere of a certain series). Just be warned that the enjoyment mileage will vary by episode.As for concerns about the quality of a possible Season 3: as a WN, I can ensure the haters that if we do get it, it will be more interesting thanks to the conflict involving the characters that appear at the end of the Season 2 finale (Velvet is going to be a fun character). it makes its way towards the 8th Event.

It also has no big dramas and only have minor character quirks and challenges that needs to be overcome.The characters stay pretty much the same with very minor character development, other then of course getting more weird skills and other ingame items. A few more sides from the different characters are shown but nothing groundbreaking, more like fun extra stuff about them.Plot isn’t something innovative and mostly just a box to see the characters...live in, where their different personalities and skills can create an interesting moment.

By the end, you would have enjoyed the experience but you won't really have much to tell anyone about it.We're all here because we enjoyed the first season.The first season starts with an interesting idea based on video game culture.It intelligently parodies popular media, creating animation sequences with such unique and ridiculous fighting choreography, that you can't help but watch in awe. It's quite simple to understand, the lack of convolution and adherence to its own game mechanics...was a nice touch that rounded out the experience.What did I love about this show?-Watching the overpowered MC obliterate her opponents in a quirky but clever fashion with her crazy abilities and unorthodox but pleasant character.-Watching the abilities and pick-ups be utilized time to time like an actual MMO game, was a joy to watch.-The simple and organic humor that is begotten from the priceless reactions of the characters when they are dazzled by maple and honestly,-I don't know what they are intrigued by more? her brazen and honest character or her overwhelming power it's quite the amusing conundrum.Season 2 is simply more of the same.Pros- Same Exploring and tournament style Arcs- Interesting fights, abilities, upgrades etc.- Generally good animation.- Fun dynamic between MC and side characters. Creating organic humor- Steady and relaxing pacing.Cons- GM's might be the worst and uninteresting part of the show (they seem to be bots themselves, They never seem to actually want to stop Maple. Their characters seem wasted, I'm not a fan of collective nature of the male ones or the single female unit that scolds them. Their methods are just not compelling.- Lack of tension.- Plot doesn't take much of a turn to reinvigorate the viewers interest.- Interpersonal conflict is far too low for my liking, everyone pretty much gets along, which kills any sort of tension borne from strife or the excitement that a good rivalry can spawn.The Lack of development of the GMs is a major reason for why I felt this was a step-down from S1 as the novelty has worn of off.The bosses just felt like walking sponges; taking way too much damage and just existing to be eventually defeated (which is the point) however it just wasn't as interesting or satisfying to watch them go down.The Art and animation are very pretty in this show, the backgrounds are enticing and colorful. It doesn't disappoint this season.Sound does the job. They tried to utilize it a bit more for some scenes, even an entire solo, but it just didn't blossom in my opinion.The other adaptions explain the plot far clearer which would have helped me to appreciate some of the events more, perhaps it was an editorial choice due to the difference in mediums.As a minor nitpick I greatly disliked the lack of structural protection and particularly the openness of her armor/outfit it heavily contradicts the fact that she's supposed to be the toughest defensively.  it's probably an editorial choice for fanservice purposes but you can use her friends or members of her guild for that purpose, it doesn't even fit her character for her armor to be that open.I think after watching so much anime since the first season released, I have become desensitized to some of it's charms.At the end of episode 12 we were left with a glimpse of some rather riveting rookies which may light a spark for Season 3 which will potentially be a major point of conflict/interest in the general plot of this series. In that sense S2 is a connector season, so shouldn't be harshly judged. It parallels the experience of a good MMO where we reminisce of the arduous, but worthwhile grind-sessions in between major Quests. In retrospect this season embodies the aforementioned idea perfectly with a little shift of understanding of the purpose of this season. Nevertheless, I finished it in 2 sittings in contrast to just a single sitting from season 1.Though parts of my review say otherwise, I think a lot of series would benefit from a season like this with more care, slowly building up events like this to steadily pace the story rather than the industry standard of quickly plunging the story into utter mediocrity with explosive but vapid developments in an effort to retain weekly consumers.RatingsAnimation - 7Sound - 6Story - 6Characters 7Enjoyment - 733/50 - 6.6/10 - 7It's a good second season, nothing much stood out.

They tried to utilize it a bit more for some scenes, even an entire solo, but it just didn't blossom in my opinion.The other adaptions explain the plot far clearer which would have helped me to appreciate some of the events more, perhaps it was an editorial choice due to the difference in mediums.As a minor nitpick I greatly disliked the lack of structural protection and particularly the openness of her armor/outfit it heavily contradicts the fact that she's supposed to be the toughest defensively.  it's probably an editorial choice for fanservice purposes but you can use her friends or members of her guild for that purpose, it doesn't even fit her character for her armor to be that open.I think after watching so much anime since the first season released, I have become desensitized to some of it's charms.At the end of episode 12 we were left with a glimpse of some rather riveting rookies which may light a spark for Season 3 which will potentially be a major point of conflict/interest in the general plot of this series. In that sense S2 is a connector season, so shouldn't be harshly judged. It parallels the experience of a good MMO where we reminisce of the arduous, but worthwhile grind-sessions in between major Quests. In retrospect this season embodies the aforementioned idea perfectly with a little shift of understanding of the purpose of this season. Nevertheless, I finished it in 2 sittings in contrast to just a single sitting from season 1.Though parts of my review say otherwise, I think a lot of series would benefit from a season like this with more care, slowly building up events like this to steadily pace the story rather than the industry standard of quickly plunging the story into utter mediocrity with explosive but vapid developments in an effort to retain weekly consumers.RatingsAnimation - 7Sound - 6Story - 6Characters 7Enjoyment - 733/50 - 6.6/10 - 7It's a good second season, nothing much stood out.

This will need some explanation obviously.Story:====The story continues where Season 1 left off, although unlike season 1 this time we get to see multiple short stories in a single episode idea as it clearly isn't treated properly. You switch a lot between teams and really need to focus on what really is going on. I don't blame this on the many characters but more the handling of the whole storyline itself. It would have been better to spread things over double the amount of episodes so the stories can be more flashed...outWhile there are new skills unlocked and other things, you don't see new weapons or armor. You do see some pvp elements only to be nullified because of the event that's running and in the last episode you have suddenly a lot of characters that came out of nowhere only to be cannon fodder for the end boss. To make it more awkward it seems there are people that managed to survive solo. Which would indicate more pvp coming in season 3 so we get to wait to see what that gives us.I did enjoy the story to some extend, but it's a far cry from the original first season that clearly was a lot better storyline wise. Due to the rapid switching between scenes and teams you do need to replay bits over to really understand what's going on which is a huge no-no for casual viewing. Yet still a lot of information is not given or even completely ignored. Even for new skills gained you don't really get to see much as a lot of it is just forgotten the next episode or shown in a slight future episode. Which is again a mixed feelings idea.Graphics:======Good graphics, specially when they show off a new area for the first time as it has lots of details in it (really, this needs to be turned into wallpapers)Characters:=======No new characters until the very end. Pets are introduced for everyone now (if they could capture one) but are in essence more tools and skills. So You can't really call them new characters. In the very end there are 4 ew characters introduced as cliffhangers, but no names as is normal in Anime or what they are.Would I recommend to see this anime?Well that's a question with mixed feelings. For completions reasons, yes. For seeing the art, for sure!

Season 2""Genre- Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Game, Comedy.The 2nd season of Bofuri starts right where it left us. From introducing many new levels to different and much stronger bosses, this 2nd season brings you even more action and thrill in the world of ""New World Online"" and particularly in the ""Maple Tree"" guild.While the main story sticks to its basics and delivers the punches we are looking for, this season lacks the excrement the prologue had in terms of an overpowered MC, a surprise element like the ones we used to see in...PvP battles, and also a top tier animation that could wow the life out of you. With the primary focus, this time being guild competitions and the progress of all the characters and not only the MC, the 2nd season fails massively in comparison to the first season. It has a good storyline if you want to witness only action and a game-type environment, but if you wanted to go back to this anime for OP Maple that made us laugh, jump around in excitement, and hooked on to the chair, I would say it\'s better to skip this season as it has nothing of the sort which can captivate you as it did before.And to add to all of this, the 2nd season also fails us in terms of animation and action sequences as it lowers them by almost 10 folds and you can\'t help but wonder when will all this be over. And while it may have a solid storyline for future seasons, I can say that if this is what\'s getting delivered, it is better to probably skip it.This anime is recommended for every ""ACTION"" anime lover.

Where is the action story etc? Even Non-Non Biyori has more actual action than this anime series. Each fighting scene is predictable. The MC does not need to seek help from her allies or anyone else. Everyone is just...a background character to add some ""comedic"" value to it. If you liked this anime try remembering a name from any character. The story is pointless, the characters are pointless all we have to focus on is the MC. It is just so boring.Action in this anime means a very cheap fight where mc always wins after few strikes without any help or tactic.Lets look at mal-listed tags:Action:Ok so let\'s talk about action, a lot of fighting scenes... but they are boring, one strike second strike enemy down hmm I quess I did beat the enemy by myself but thanks y all for your help *tehe*, tehe me not! What is interesting about that? Yea we got a lot of OP mc characters in other shows but they are actually good shows. The fighting scenes in them are interesting the fight has a reason and I could go on but let me stop here. Lets say its 1/10. A lot of fighting scenes don\'t mean its any good in your show.Adventure:Let\'s venture into a VR world... Let\'s make some interesting locations and buildings and and.... maybe not. If it is not a still image of a very typical isekai thing it will not be on our show --- some producers maybe said.A lot of budget cutting on this one aspect. 3/10 some looked good enough.Comedy:Comedy in this anime is it is hmm how to say it.

Wait it looks better than anything in this show. Yeah even GPT could make this anime. But yeah it is fantasy because I don\'t believe anyone could come up with something like this show. Nah for real now. Yea, its fantasy what else to say *tehe*...theme Video game:Let\'s look at literally any video game theme anime. They are mostly good with interesting elements and technologies. With interesting background around the technology or how the game works with how many normal games work and behave. I don\'t know if the writer of this show never played any game but making one player even with exploits OP is just a bad design and very unrealistic.A huge minus is eye ripping 3d, I get it, not a huge budget but at least some shows cut some details so it does not hurt viewers\' eyes so much but at the very first episode of second I am not sure, we get a 3d character that is so detailed it hurts your eyes when he moves. I don\'t know if I\'ve seen something eye-hurting in any other show.Ok, so the main question is who would quite literally watch this? It has no real value, story or character, action, comedic, slice of life-wise.It just barely scratches any tag and incorporates it a little. Like a first-time team game jam game project.

What I love about season 2 is how  Maple become friends with the other guild member and overall how all 3 main guilds work and play together to have a fun time not drama not back stabbing no bullcrap just people playing an mmo  and having a great time and this is  what makes season 2 so great it invloves more people show how they work...witch each others and not only against one another.   This is what I dream MMO in real life should be.And you also see how all the other members of MapleTree evolves  and how they become stronger and how their personality is even the other guilds you learn what type of people they are and it makes me hopeful we get a season  3 and 4. witch each others and not only against one another.

Housekishou Richard-shi no Nazo Kantei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40230/Housekishou_Richard-shi_no_Nazo_Kantei,"['First of all, this show isn\'t BL, so if you\'re expecting to get that kind of content here, I am already telling you to back away. I\'ll go back to this bit of info later on because I think it\'s kind of important. I actually am pretty much making this review mainly to criticize that issue.Anyways, I\'ll make the review quick, and start off with the characters. Both main characters are very much likable, and one can easily see the the chemistry that builds between them as you watch through the show. The story is decent at best. Having it revolve around mineralogy made it...refreshing to watch. I feel like there are disconnects between some of the episodes, especially the later ones, but still, it was enjoyable. The artstyle is pretty good. Both characters are very pleasing to look at.That ends my short review of the show\'s main elements.=========I thoroughly enjoyed this show, but I do think it has a severe problem of queerbaiting which is the issue I mentioned in the beginning.Multiple times have Seigi and Richard mentioned their ""love"" for each other, and yet barely moved forward in their relationship after saying such remarks. Perhaps the biggest show of affection there was was Seigi\'s heroic deed of traveling overseas to find Richard and free him of his family\'s reins. Consequently, Richard did the same for Seigi in the final episode, although to a much lesser extent.Now, I am telling you, I don\'t think anyone who is merely a ""friend"" would casually travel overseas to find a""friend"", not especially a college student.  If that deed isn\'t an act of love for a significant other, then I don\'t know what else it is. And yet the show denies from its viewers a deeper manifestation of the two main characters\' relationship, limiting it to shallow words of ""I really like you"" and ""I do love you"" while also almost coming to a point where the two could have married each other as husbands, despite it being a fixed one. If you fully paid attention to the show, I\'m pretty sure you\'d agree with me. Seigi and Richard ARE gay.The bare minimum I expected from this show was for the two to at least acknowledge the fact that they have become lovers after all they have gone through, but the show has denied that to its viewers until the end.This queerbaiting, I would think, is the pivotal issue of this show. It didn\'t have to be labeled under the shounen-ai genre to show that two gay men could get explicitly into a relationship. It just really feels weird to me that both would visibly express their love toward each other, all while the show purposefully denies their status as gay lovers. I really think it\'s about time LGBTQ characters have more presence in more slice of life shows like this. They don\'t have to be the main focus of the show obviously, but just be granted the acceptance that they DO exist. All the writer/s had to do for the two main characters was to acknowledge and accept that glaring fact that both were gay. The show kept dropping subtle, verbal hints about their status as lovers throughout the show, but still failed to explicitly disclose it in the end. refreshing to watch.

It's been a long time since I've watched an anime that has such a soothing, aesthetic vibe to it; the last one was probably Tsurune. As far as slice of life goes, it really doesn't get more true to the genre than this.The art and animation is as soothing and calming as the music - the ED is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard lately, and I haven't skipped either the OP or the ED even once. The voice acting is perfectly done, but then I wouldn't...really expect anything less of seiyuus like Uchida Yuuma and Sakurai Takahiro. The story is the highlight of the anime, according to me, and I was really intrigued by Richard's past till the unraveling and final reveal. Seigi's character is easier to understand though, and he is kind of like the perfect foil to Richard's personality.Another thing that I can't help mentioning is how the topic of sexuality is treated - it is approached with the kind of normalcy that you don't really see much in anime. There is no internalized/externalized homophobia, no one freaks out when the topic is brought up; it is refreshing to see this kind of treatment for a topic that is always either brushed off to the side and never brought up or dealt with very badly.This anime is one of the most wholesome shows I've watched in a very long time.

Each episode has a new character with each of them having a new story to tell. Stories about love, gratitude and betrayal. You discover each of them and see our characters grow as they meet different people and how even...the slightest things like a compliment could hurt a person deeply.

The story really is one of the best things in this anime.The characters are great. We have Seigi who just like his name suggests is an ally of justice. From the very start he is an honest and straightforward guy but his problem is that he doesn't understand how his words affect others. His development and him growing as a character that understands and shows more of himself as he gains more confidence is great to watch.We have Richard who is hates how his life was influenced by his looks. His ideology and the way he hates it when people like him just because of his good are just good to see. It's nice to see that he is more than that, he isn't the cliche beauty character and he tries to become a better character who is more than just a guy that uses his good looks to sell his Jewels.The side characters are great with each of them having their own characteristics and the great stories they bring.The art, sounds, voice acting, animation and the overall directing are great.Overall I would give the anime an 8/10.

The foreigner thanked him and gave his card as they parted. Seigi soonly learned that this handsome gentleman 'Richard' is a jeweller, so he consulted him in a certain matter and ended up working in his jewellery store as a part- time job. Those two encountered various people...and helped them in their lives.It is the type of anime you would watch after a long anime who needed a lot of thinking, it's a light-hearted anime that will definitely relax you.  It was the episodic type where you can easily pick up with and understand. Surely original. I loved how each episode had a moral, and on top of that it was educational, as it displayed tons of information about gems and jewelries.The art is just so spirit-lifting, it heals your soul. It brightens my day seeing their faces, totally not exaggerating. I love this style of art with the cheerful colors.The ending and the opening are gold, they make my day and I can't skip them, like never ever!

Their back stories, past and childhood added a spice to the anime, as it gave a background on who we are watching.

It was the episodic type where you can easily pick up with and understand. Surely original. I loved how each episode had a moral, and on top of that it was educational, as it displayed tons of information about gems and jewelries.The art is just so spirit-lifting, it heals your soul. It brightens my day seeing their faces, totally not exaggerating. I love this style of art with the cheerful colors.The ending and the opening are gold, they make my day and I can't skip them, like never ever!

The whole structure reminds me of Bartender where a customer comes in with an emotional problem, and the problem is resolved via gemstones or alcoholic beverages. I can appreciate stories with lots of action, and I can appreciate stories like this where not much happens except for the character interactions. Also like Bartender Jeweler Richard provides a brief history and background on the jewel of the week. I like these educational interludes, but not everyone will.Stellar cast of actors with Sakahiro Takurai as Richard, Uchida Yuuma as Seigi, and Kanazawa Hana...as Seigi's classmate and possible romantic interest.You'll know after episode two if this is for you. as Seigi's classmate and possible romantic interest.You'll know after episode two if this is for you."", '“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”It\'s a sad, sad justice that not very often, we get niche shows like this that break the monotony of seasonal shows, providing stories and insights through objects (in this case, gemstones and their representation on human personality and behaviour), and having character interactions play out the drama in its mysterious shroud whilst keeping the slice-of-life elements intact. These elements when combined together doesn\'t seem promising, but this show made it all good. 2018\'s Holmes of Kyoto did that with the various ""case files"" and things of value, and this premise is no different here.“Justice, like beauty, is...in the eye of the beholder. Some see an innocent victim. Others will see evil incarnate getting exactly what\'s deserved.”The first thing you\'ll start to notice from this show is the strong bishounen (and BL but not much) aspects on the characters, and although love (and like) can be uncertain, it certainty makes for one very interesting pairing. For context, Nakata Seigi is the typical bishounen trait of a good-natured guy, being aloof and caring for anyone he sees, and speaking of his name (Seigi, which means justice in the katakana naming convention), he\'ll not shun at bringing the truth to light, even in his naivety. On the other hand, Richard Ranashinha de Vulpian (just refer to this British bishounen as Richard), more than just being a jewelry appraiser, is like Sherlock Holmes in the sense of figuring out episodic situations that make and break people depending on the gemstone-of-the-week visual cues. Despite the atrocity that is his family\'s prestigious and high-life mechanics that got the worse of him in his young days growing up, he\'s learning contentment through Seigi and compliments him as and when he does fit.These two people are the yin and yang of each other: One having to accommodate for the other\'s actions, going to great lengths for each other so that they don\'t drift apart like a turbulent relationship. Despite that, both Seigi and Richard, no matter how rocky their relationship can get at times, it\'s mostly learning to compromise in the appropriate sense and leading the way forward.“The value is always in the eye of the beholder. What is worthless to one person may be very important to someone else.”The theme of this show being the gemstones and its acquaint relationship with the people who dons it is quite the spectacle. Learning how people\'s lives function by the gemstone they have (e.g. Seigi with his deceased grandmother\'s Pink Sapphire in Episode 1) and learning of their struggles and hardships that surround the toxicity of even the brightest and strongest gems is very relatable and humane, it gives people the reason of their sufferings as is. More than attempting a recourse at life going at it, with the gemstones as a sign of their price to pay for various deeds, the understanding ripens through the shedding of human behaviours. And I\'ve gotta say it feels wholesome with the relaxed, Iyashikei feeling.“Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.”Shuka\'s animation was quite good to say the least, though far from the usual spectacles of Natsume Yuujinchou, and it shows a very good and clean, healthy dose of production. Much care has been taken to this show with the beautiful artwork and visuals (not to mention the gorgeous eye-catching gemstones). The same can be said for the OP/ED which also emits the exact same feelings of shows that are worth the time of relaxation, and both songs are low-key good as well, far from impressive but still good nonetheless.“The quality of beauty lies on how beholder values an object.”Overall, while this show isn\'t the typical ""underrated"" stuff, I can only say that if you love Iyashikei shows like Yuru Camp to exhibit the relaxed and emotional feels whilst keeping the realistic humane stuff possible, then this show is right up your alley. Sure, this show isn\'t gonna be everyone\'s favourite, but try it if you can, it\'s worth the shot examining your very own life akin to gemstones (the same way as horoscopes tend to be). in the eye of the beholder.

And since I\'m a sucker for bishounens, this one got me good. Tbh when I first glanced at the poster I was somehow expecting this to be a shounen-ai of sorts, but other than that, no expectations at all. And I was pleasantly surprised by how much of a good story this series has.I absolutely love these ""story behind the things"" styles, where each episode focuses on one particular object, spirit or creature and how people were involved with it. It reminds me of Natsume Yuujinchou and Mushishi, two of my...favourite anime of all time. The pace is somehow slow, the characters are lovely and you can enjoy it without feeling much tension.The MAL rank score for this series does not make it justice at all. But sure, if you\'re looking for a scandalous soap opera a La Ursupadora, this anime might not be for you (unless you\'re willing to wait until episode 6 hoo boy that final scene got me on the edge of my seat).Looking forward to see the development between Richard\'s and Seigi\'s relationship (so I can fuel my fanfictions yassss) favourite anime of all time.

It's simple, it's about life and emotions.It is not BL, even though they are very close and often express their affection towards each other (I like you, you are very beautiful etc.).It's kind of friendship - platonic love maybe relationship.The character design is so pretty and even the story is about how pretty Richard is in a way.

This review contains my opinion about the first 10 episodes.Story: First 3~ episodes are pretty good for a start, but not so special, probably that's why people dropped the series, BUT i'm really glad i continued the anime, i was sure the anime won't be like that every episode. Beside the jewels cases there is a lot of background story for Richard and development for both of them, but the general idea...of a new jewel in each episode its not dropped and its still there with a meaning. Sadly, some important parts from the novel were not included in the series, but people describe them in the episodes discussion, which is amazing.Art: The art is beautiful and it fits the story, each jewel looks amazing (especially in the opening) and the main character, Richard is designed so good, it fits the story and how he is described as a very beautiful person in the novel.Sound: The sound in the anime is nice, not really my type but it suits the story and moments. I liked the voice actors that were picked for the characters, they did a great job.Character: At first, the main characters looked pretty simple to me, but with each episode you see how their relationship develops, how they interact with the customers and with the other characters that appear along the way. Also, Richard's backstory is very good and that's one of the reasons this anime is so great from my perspective. Seigi may seem a bit annoying at some points, but he changes a lot trough the story.Enjoyment: i like this anime so much, i can't wait for the last 2 episodes and i hope we will get another season.Overall: I recommend to watch this anime and try to get past the first 3 episodes, it's worth. Episodes 9 and 10 are just amazing.

Their personal struggles, determination, suave, kindness, and just their unwavering friendship is one thing that made me appreciate this series.But the main thing that did so was the...stories. We have many themes but I\'ll hit a few. There\'s a queer woman trying to do what\'s right by society by marrying a good man. But she doesn\'t love him, isn\'t attracted to him, and is just torn with herself in if she should fit in or be true to herself. And one thing Richard told Seigi in that particular episode before she appeared was to respect all guests no matter their religion, race, sexuality, etc.   I won\'t go too far in it but I really appreciate them hitting this without having to sexualize it in any way shape or form.There was also an episode where an abusive parent was hassling Seigi and would not stop. This resounded with me greatly and the way it was portrayed was done incredibly well. I don\'t want to spoil anything more than I have, but just know that while watching it I learned a very interesting lesson.""But I share his (abusive parent) blood.""

However, I don\'t know if it was the translation or what, but this show took queerbaiting to another level.For the first three or so episodes, I was actually enjoying this show. It was mainly just about two dudes teaching us about mineralogy and gemstones. I learned a lot...and had a fairly good time. Episodes four to ten (where I decided to drop it) started, ahem, to go places.Seigi would bring up every so often (esp in ep 4) how beautiful Richard was. In ep 6, Seigi and Richard decided to be extra as hell to fool gem fraud con artists. In ep 7, Seigi says to Richard that he ""liked him,"" ""really liked him,"" and Richard says, ""don\'t regret saying you like me."" (How am I supposed to interpret that?Then, out of nowhere, it was episode 8 where the production was like, ""hey, we gotta remind the audience that these guys are straight."" So, Seigi starts getting really bummed out that his college friend who\'s a girl, Tanimoto, was going to marriage interviews. They really did have good chemistry—as friends. All they did together up until that point was talk about mineralogy, gemstones, and how much Seigi liked Richard (really, she kept pointing that out). Overall, Seigi spent wayyy more time with Richard than Tanimoto.But, Richard, seemingly out of nowhere, calls Seigi a fool for not going after this girl. Then, when Seigi finally musters the courage to confess, his indirect confession is misinterpreted by Tanimoto as validation for her feelings about not being ready for marriage. (Personally, I interpreted Tanimoto\'s feelings about men, love, and marriage as her being possibly an aro/ace lesbian, but that\'s probably just me.)Then! Episodes 9 and 10, Seigi follows Richard all the way to London! Without knowing his specific location! All so that he can ""make pudding for him when he gets tired.""...Bro, do straight bros do that for straight homies? I mean, really.THEN THEY NEARLY GET STRAIGHT-UP FUCKING MARRIED??? But, they don\'t because that was a ruse, obviously, so that Seigi could solve Richard\'s family\'s inheritance problem (I won\'t go into specifics here because that\'s deep spoilers).BUT THEN ONE OF THE SHOTS THEY HOLD ON TO FOR A FEW LONG SECONDS IS OF THEM LOOKING LIKE THEY\'RE HOLDING HANDS AFTER EXCHANGING PRECIOUS FAMILY HEIRLOOMS WITH THE PROMISE TO ""ALWAYS BE IN TOUCH"" NO MATTER WHAT???Dude, they really gave us a wedding vow scene with a no-homo asterisk.I read into the rest on Wikipedia—episode eleven seems like filler and episode twelve seems like character regression (plus, Seigi is given tanzanite which is like rarer than diamonds?? I mean, dude). Episode ten ended on the conclusion of an arc, so that\'s where I decided to stop or else I\'d just torture myself for another hour.Look, other than the super-annoying queerbaiting (and big side-profile noses and the opening theme that I found kind of boring), this was a fairly solid show in terms of characters and plot (except for that weird marriage clause thing in order for Richard to get his inheritance which I\'m pretty fucking sure doesn\'t happen in real life). You still do learn quite a lot about gemstones and mineralogy, including certain gems\' histories and how con artists operate. The CG gemstones didn\'t look... too bad and the production value stayed consistent...ly mid-tier.Overall, not super terrible, but not super great.

This was fixed as the series continued, but it could be a hurdle for people wanting to get into this series that they have to watch half of it before they can see the connected plot line. The other issue I found with the story was that like anything based on books,...they had to cut a lot of stuff out and that hurt the pacing.

The two main characters, Seigi and Richard, have good chemistry and while the story is simple (picks up in drama near the later episodes though) I came into wanting to watch something light and simple.I do like the characters, though I wish Richard was a bit more expressive like his light novel and manga counterpart. I also recommend reading the light novel and manga as the anime does leave out certain plot points which in turn messes with the...pacing of the anime.  I have not read the novel as it is in japanese but I have read a couple of manga chapters and it's a lot more detailed then the anime, so I'm excited for more chapters to come out. i think this anime needed more than 12 episodes to tell the story and if it did it would be immensely better. pacing of the anime.

Mainly he talks about meeting Seigi, a student studying at university, and Richard, a foreign jeweler. After meeting, Seigi asks Richard for help in identifying the provenance of a ring, received after his grandmother's death. It turns out that the ring was stolen by her grandmother herself. Together they manage to find the real owner of the ring. The situation, however, turns unexpectedly to the best, and Seigi, with his benevolent action, receives forgiveness from the victim, allowing his grandmother to rest in peace. Seigi, having been interested in both his work in particular the stones concerned and...his method of investigation, will cooperate with him as an aide. On many occasions, however, he will not only see Richard identifying stones but will resolve with him various cases including those that need to be solved on the spot. Seigi will eventually have such a high understanding with Richard that he will be able to solve his mysterious family situation.Being an anime of investigation, which purely relies on the psychology of individuals, I cannot dwell on the specific cases. I can say, however, that in the anime it is present, quite extensively, the relationship between the trader and the customer. He is not a mere seller of items. We talk about precious stones with a certain value, so we expect a mutual professionalism from the jeweler. The customer, on the other hand, will have to start a dialogue in order to better understand his decisions about the stone to choose, all based on his economic situation. So there is more experience between the two than usual commerce; dialogue of understanding, and also sometimes of trust. In the anime, however, a more intense investigative component is added precisely to represent more of the usual daily life and make the viewer more enticed to watch it.The episodes then present themselves as self-concluding with the difference of the first and last that refer instead to Seigi's personal matters. It is not always possible to like the trend of episodes that can be slow due to the almost total absence of action. But I really appreciate the psychological component that proves consistent and effective in every situation. In addition, various stones are seen in the course of the anime and sometimes they are studied in a particular way.

Nothing too special stuck to me. The backgrounds were alright.The sounds also didn't affect my enjoyment though the voice actor choices were chosen wisely.Characters were nicely done. Seigi was basic enough to understand, but...Richard is not fleshed out until halfway through the show.

Richard himself is appropriately gorgeous to look at, considering his beauty does play a role in the plot.There were a few instances of janky movement in key focus scenes but rare enough to only really leave an impression BECAUSE they stood out due to being so rare.The sound was a very positive surprise, with an unusual range of music genres represented in the BGM and barely any, if at all, repeated tracks. Of course, the focus was classical music, but it fits the series well. The voice actors fit their roles well and the opening and ending were pleasant to listen to.So overall, it was interesting and very enjoyable to watch, aside from the frustration towards the end how much the story ended up falling apart, which sadly keeps it at a 7/10 to me.Finally, to adress the BL topic (though it didn\'t affect my rating):I went into this expecting it to NOT be BL. I figured there would be some yaoi fangirl baiting, but within reason, and just wanted to see a normal story about unlikely friends. But nope. The amount of baiting is ridiculous and there is zero attempt to portray their relationship as a mere friendship whatsoever. The characters go from liking each other to constantly raving about how attractive they consider the other, to literally confessing their love several times while chasing each other across the globe, to then entering a civic partnership (all while one of them is convinced the other is gay). But of course nothing ever comes of it, because this isn\'t a BL series.I personally found it pretty irritating, because none of that needed to be there. If it\'s not a romance, don\'t try to portray it as one. If it is, do it properly and not in this half-assed way. If this was Chinese media, I could somewhat forgive it because of the censorship rules forcing creators to turn actual BL into a ""they are just really, really, REALLY close friends, your honor"" trope, but Japan doesn\'t suffer from the same kind of censorship. If they had wanted to make this a BL, they could have done that.Despite that, I wouldn\'t call the series queerbaiting, because I very much did enjoy the casual representation of other LGBT+ characters in the series (like the lesbian couple and the probably aro friend).

Then of course Richard like the dashing English Prince type that he is, comes to the rescue and sorts their issues out! His shop should be...a counselling service more than a Jewellery store to be honest lol!Y'know I wish the shounen ai or the Yaoi tag was added here because realistically, Richard and Seigi are a potential couple!

That being said, Housekishou confused the hell out of me! (lol) At first I thought it was going to be an episodic-type detective show with each episode being about a different case, but things started going awry when the episodes turned out to be more of uncovering customers' personal drama, with each jewel having a symbolic significance, rather than being a part of a mystery or crime. And then after a few episodes of that, the story totally blindsided me by suddenly focusing on Richard's life! Needless to say, it...was a complete roller coaster of expectations for me.Looking back, I see now that the early episodes were supposed to be about a string of third party characters whose problems would resonate with the main character, Seigi, and serve as character growth, but this was executed rather poorly. As such, when we arrive at the point where Richard and Seigi's story comes to a climax, there is a lack of emotional investment on the part of the audience.However, I think the show redeemed itself with the last two episodes that featured new characters with deep ties to Richard and Seigi and their separate pasts.

Both the main characters felt very bland and uninteresting and as a result of this almost inhuman.The relationship “development” between the two was especially dreadful to watch and felt as if the entire script was written separately by two people with no communication between eachother one of which wanted them to be a couple and the other one just wrote them as friends, many lines contradict eachother, and their relationship seems extremely unbalanced and awkward.At this point i don’t even know if this should be considered queerbaiting or just bad writing.I’d also like to mention the main character’s girl-friend. For a brief moment i got quite excited that there was a character in the series with aro/ace traits, but apparently not, she just needs to “not give up on relationships and find the right man”. (I’d comment more on that entire scene but i am not sure how to do that without spoilers)Art and sound: The artstyle was pretty decent i guess...? There was nothing really wrong with it and the colour palettes weren’t unpleasant to look at.The soundtrack was extremely boring and there was nothing very memorable about it but i would rather say that’s a matter of taste.Overall i think this was a waste of time so unless you specifically enjoy mineralogy or stories about family drama or really like the characters i wouldn’t recommend. in the end that doesn’t even matter as throughout the whole series, no one’s actions ever have any consequences.Characters: The character writing overall seemed very stereotypical, especially the whole “hero of justice” thing...seriously?

It falls off towards the end, but a bit more on that below.Story: First, this anime is more a slice-of-life than mystery, and should be treated as such. Each episode is warm and more serves to expand the audience\'s perception of people and what\'s possible than to get them to unravel a big, complicated plan. And because it\'s more of a slice-of-life, the stories depicted are fresh and unexpected, and take a vastly more liberal tone with the characters than many of its conservative peers in the same genre. To which, it...should be noted that included in that liberalism is a ""take-it-however-you-like"" approach, adding enough scenes to nudge you into thinking about a possibly queerplatonic relationship between the main characters. As this is an underlying, building theme, it can be uncomfortable for viewers who are not prepared for/interested in it.My biggest complaint is--as it seems to be the case with many animes--towards the last few episodes. There\'s a great build-up near the end, leaving the remaining unrelated episodes to fall a little flat. It\'s greatest/most involved plot was unfortunately a little contrived, but more spoke towards a situation than, again, a complicated or even compelling story.Animation: Lackluster. Not a complete eyesore, but not stellar, either. That does include Richard, the most ""eye-catching"" person in the series. I do like the look of the gems, but it clashes with the mundane animation in the series.Sound: Unremarkable, sans Sakurai. Next.Characters: Richard steals the show for me, and my love for him carried me all the way to episode 11. He\'s full of contrasts and telltale quirks, and that\'s what makes him stand out.  He also balances out very well with Seigi, who...has all of the altruistic recklessness of Watanuki Kimihiro and only 50% of his success. I found myself with a bad case of Second Hand Embarrassment with some of Seigi\'s actions, but somehow, the duo manages to pull through to the end. Unfortunately, other to tell a story or prove a point, most of the side characters have a one-dimensional purpose, and we don\'t see them more than once or twice. To varying degrees, Seigi, Richard, and Tanimoto endure development over the 12 episodes.Conclusion: It\'s a quick, soft, novel, and digestible watch (see: slice-of-life). Its background liberalism caters well to those who like a little fanservice and nuance, but is still conservative enough to check a few boxes...although that does get muddy later on, especially with its implications. It tries to strive for a little of everything (Drama, Romance, Mystery (???), etc.) but doesn\'t quite pull off anything fully. As a result, you might watch it once, but chances are, you might not be interested enough to watch it twice. should be noted that included in that liberalism is a ""take-it-however-you-like"" approach, adding enough scenes to nudge you into thinking about a possibly queerplatonic relationship between the main characters. As this is an underlying, building theme, it can be uncomfortable for viewers who are not prepared for/interested in it.My biggest complaint is--as it seems to be the case with many animes--towards the last few episodes. There\'s a great build-up near the end, leaving the remaining unrelated episodes to fall a little flat. It\'s greatest/most involved plot was unfortunately a little contrived, but more spoke towards a situation than, again, a complicated or even compelling story.Animation: Lackluster. Not a complete eyesore, but not stellar, either. That does include Richard, the most ""eye-catching"" person in the series. I do like the look of the gems, but it clashes with the mundane animation in the series.Sound: Unremarkable, sans Sakurai. Next.Characters: Richard steals the show for me, and my love for him carried me all the way to episode 11. He\'s full of contrasts and telltale quirks, and that\'s what makes him stand out.  He also balances out very well with Seigi, who...has all of the altruistic recklessness of Watanuki Kimihiro and only 50% of his success. I found myself with a bad case of Second Hand Embarrassment with some of Seigi\'s actions, but somehow, the duo manages to pull through to the end. Unfortunately, other to tell a story or prove a point, most of the side characters have a one-dimensional purpose, and we don\'t see them more than once or twice. To varying degrees, Seigi, Richard, and Tanimoto endure development over the 12 episodes.Conclusion: It\'s a quick, soft, novel, and digestible watch (see: slice-of-life). Its background liberalism caters well to those who like a little fanservice and nuance, but is still conservative enough to check a few boxes...although that does get muddy later on, especially with its implications.

It has such a welcoming storyline that pulls you in and makes you feel like you are on the receiving end of a lovely hug. It is soft, without being sappy or over the top. Just a gentle coming of age story.It is sort of a slice of life, somewhere between shonen & shojo depending on how you look at it. I would argue that this is one that can be applicable to any audience but I am sure there is a soft spot in the queer community for it since...it has a general air of acceptance and welcomeness.It might be a bit boring for some (*cough* me) but it is genuinely such a sweet story. it has a general air of acceptance and welcomeness.It might be a bit boring for some (*cough* me) but it is genuinely such a sweet story.', ""Man, I almost dropped this show. I was disappointed to say in the least, because I'm a jewelry artist with my own small business. I was over the moon during the initial episodes, where each episode revealed a different 'case' or customer story and their connection with gemstones/jewelry. The insight and knowledge on gemstones was pretty spot-on. But after Episode 5... the series focuses heavily on the relationship between Seigi and Richard. Which, despite my reservations, proved to be increasingly romantic... there's even a marriage proposal. There's nothing wrong with that, I just wish there had been a 'Boys' Love' tag for this title, because...it's not my cup of tea. Even 'Romance,' would've sufficed to give more clues to the viewers of what they're getting into.There was less and less screen time about rocks and gems, and more screen time on how much affection the two men have for each other. It was also very confusing, as the anime tried to portray them both as straight with female love interests, rejecting notions of POSSIBLE LOVE. While they pretty much do everything lovers do and marriage is an option.So if you also enjoy minerals and gemstones, I'd highly recommend Episode 1 - 5 for a refreshing and insightful take on the industry, with beautiful illustrations. 10/10. But feel free to drop it after that unless you enjoy exploring Seigi's romances and relationships further. it's not my cup of tea.

In fact, I wasn't planning to watch this show at all before I realized that one of my friends had mentioned it in a school project, so I assumed it was probably good if she liked it that much. However, the second episode...ended up auto-playing. Wow, was I was surprised when hit with Richard's words to Seigi regarding how he should treat the customers without prejudice or discrimination regardless of differences and then getting introduced to a non-heterosexual character so casually right off the bat.Now don't get me wrong, this show doesn't specifically focus on romance or even social justice, but to have such as respectful environment and casually integrate this into an anime without straying from its major plot is something that impressed me and I wish other works could follow in its footsteps.The second episode intrigued me so much that I decided to keep watching, and once again I was very glad I made the decision. If memory serves correctly, the first half of the episodes were mainly episodic, dealing with customers and their stories and though there was nothing bad about them, I wouldn't say they were interesting enough to last a whole show. Then the plot starts to shift its focus to the stories of the main characters, starting with Richard. This shift actually felt quite natural and eventually, the story started dealing with more drama that leaves you wanting to watch more and more. I wouldn't say it's enough to call it a thriller but the feeling I got from the episodes in the second half felt very fulfilling to me and made the show much more interesting.I found that the characters in this show aren't really anything special by themselves compared to characters from other series. Yet despite that, I think the author does a very good job of getting you interested in them and their development. I expected Tanimoto to be such a plain character at the very beginning but I honestly loved the role the author chose for her by the end of the show. Even Seigi who I thought would annoy me with his goody-two-shoes personality didn't end up annoying me at all by the end to my surprise. If anything the author manages to make you feel pity for him.I think the main downsides I have for the show are:1) There's nothing that particularly makes this show stand out compared to other anime, even if it's a work that's well-done for its own story.2) Due to the 12-episode nature, there were many things cut out from the novel. As a result, there are a few scenes near the end that end up being confusing with a lack of context, and the last episode feels seemingly out of place and rushed even if it's still pretty satisfying. It's somewhat unfair that Richard got so many episodes about his story compared to Seigi but understandable due to anime limitations. I believe this issue isn't there for the novel but I'm not able to fully read it yet.I recommend looking in the episode 12 discussion for posts by novel readers elaborating on things that were cut out as well as differences between the novel and the anime as a side note if you're as curious as me.In regards to all the comments about queerbaiting, I don't believe it was the author's intention to make it appear that way. From the beginning, it was already addressed that the show would have a respectful environment for LGBTQ+ characters and the novel has established even more canon queer characters. I've read many posts by novel readers describing things that happen in the novel that don't appear in the anime and I believe it's because of all the cutting and rushing the anime had to do that makes it appear this way. My perception of novel Richard and Seigi is that their relationship can be interpreted in a similar manner to Ash and Eiji from Banana Fish. I'm a biromantic asexual person and these are my personal thoughts, others may have different opinions and I respect that.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed watching this show and how it managed to surpass my expectations of it so I hope anybody else who likes watching shows with drama and slice of life elements will at least feel somewhat similar!

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41006/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Gou,"['--- The review contains spoilers ---""Oh Rika, I told you to pick one, didn\'t?"" ~ Satoko Houjou24 episodes, a dream: to continue a franchise of almost 20 years at the height of visual novels and anime. Higurashi no Naku koro ni returned in 2020, with a surreal season. In the first season, we saw crazy, disturbing scenes and a shocking story. Higurashi Kai softens and resolves the disruption and brings a great ending to the entire series. Higurashi Rei is shorter, only 5 episodes, serving as a sequel after Kai. Now, in 2020/1, Higurashi Gou is broadcast and a new information clash is used in...order to create two more cours for the show. ""14 years have passed since the original broadcast, will they still like the anime?"", That question has bothered me since the first of October, but today I can finally understand who liked it and who hated it, after all, it is not common in the days of today having an anime like this.To begin with, it is visible the work and the high effort of Passione studio and the director, Keiichirou Kawaguchi, in making episodes without any reference to games and bows different from what we already knew before. Of course, the first thirteen episodes brought many impactful scenes and managed to recreate iconic moments (like Rena\'s ""USODA !!""). It was definitely surprising how the first half of behaved positively as being a sequel, after all, Rika is already tired. A hundred years in loopings ... I must admit that this reference to Higurashi Kai may seem confusing at first, but it managed to bring up a new hypothesis: what if she leaves Hinamizawa, after a happy ending in 1983? Well, that\'s what happened. Rika enrolls at St. Lucia College and begins her journey. Obviously, we don\'t know how the end of this world was, since she herself doesn\'t have all the memories herself (even Hanyuu offering everything she has in Nekodamashi). It is incredible this change of perspective, in which Rika goes from being a simple and not very important character, to the protagonist of every anime. ""But, wait, what? What\'s going on with Satoko ????"". Yes, now we have a situation where Satoko knows more than the viewers themselves and even Rika herself. You know, I had some problems with the first two seasons. Interesting characters, like Oishi and Satoko, were not fully utilized. In most cases, they were more like a character group that is only important to be quoted or used specifically in some episodes. But look at how we are doing: Oishi has gone mad in Tataridamashi and Satoko finds Eua, an entity, like our dear Hanyuu, who also has creative powers from other worlds. It is difficult to say and explain all the points and relevance of Eua without mentioning Umineko (another series in the When They Cry franchise), so much so that it is understandable to see people disgusted by this introduction of a sudden character, but I must say that it was a great choice of scriptwriter for this fourth season. He brought a continuation with material shortened by the Ryukishi07 series limits and transcended the limits for something big.Rena, Shion, Mion and Keichi are the ones that were most ""forgotten"" during the second part of the anime. In fact, this is unpleasant. It is not the same impression of character development that they had, compared to the old anime. My favorite Shion (even Higurashi Gou), was practically nonexistent in the entire show. Rena again became the ""yandere"" character of the show, maintaining many climaxes and iconic moments, especially in Onidamashi. Keichi, on the other hand, became the protagonist of the entire first half, but again presented some construction flaws with the show in the sequence. I don\'t say it was bad, since the outcome was purposely focused on Rika, Satoko and Hanyuu. Speaking of Hanyuu, she finally had more explanations regarding her limits as an entity that personifies Oyashiro-Sama. She did in fact become a fundamental piece for Rika during the final events, but I was sad to see that she apparently had a not very good and even melancholy fate.And how can we not mention the masterpiece that was episode 16? Among all that we\'ve seen, this moment was much more exciting and cathartic than anything we\'ve seen before. It was a promising entry from a different Satoko. It seemed that she was the villain of the series, and in fact, she comes to be. When Eua offers part of its powers to Satoko, it uses it to normalize the problems that Rika leaving Hinamizawa would leave forever marked in these infinite fragments. It is not common, nor usual to see Satoko being a scary character in Higurashi. The cases always involved Rena, Shion, Keichi and Mion as the biggest protagonists and cursed. Satoko has never been so prominent before, and I loved it. Her personality having a little change, experiencing everything that Rika lived, was a great narrative to follow the story forward. I like alternating postures and psychological dualities in Higurashi, but Satoko\'s perspective has outgrown much of what has already been brought up. She starts from a child who loves her friend as her only family to a young woman unsure about the upheaval that changes in her friendship with Rika could change Hinamizawa\'s course. And even though this seems to be a spook on Satoko\'s part, her side of concern for her home village is visible, after all, even if there is a perfect destination, Higurashi always contains tragedies and plot twists, where some moments are not predictable. Higurashi Gou was like that and knew how to use his elements very well.Another issue to be valued is the production of the show. Of course, Higurashi was never an anime to be praised for its animation, that I confess, but the Passione studio brought a much better look than the art of 2006 and brought it much closer with the version of the games. This aesthetic is reminiscent of the Monotagari Series (of course, the show\'s designer did direct work on this series), in addition to appropriating more up-to-date environments. Again, some episodes are not well used even with this improvement, it is not easy to accept the Kimiyoshi scene in episode 15, for example, but it was the best they were able to do in its entirety. Many moments had a very good and above average graphic, which made me happy from the beginning. In addition, the songs again are one of the strongest points of the franchise. The opening was very good for the situations that the anime was in with the time, besides the endings were absurdly good. Irregular Entropy and God\'s Syndrome are songs that will mark me forever, because in addition to adding well to the message that Higurashi wants to convey, he promoted a great artistic style in the images that composed them throughout the show. The plot? As already said, he was creative, innovative and brought a different posture. It was a perfection made by the show\'s screenwriter, who knew how to take advantage of many of Higurashi\'s details, in addition to his references to the old one and the game, which are huge. The director was also impeccable at many times (episode 16 was, for me, the best of all anime in 2020, easily). The franchise can surely celebrate with the result obtained. When They Cry and 07th Expansion must be happy.Many are wondering if Higurashi Gou can continue with a sequel. I feel like yes. At times, the show has convinced itself that it has more to show. It\'s not like everything that happened was empty, there are already 3 other seasons that show that clearly. But it would be great to see other strands and attempts in history, to continue the series seriously. Particularly, Hinamizawa has a lot of content to be explored, that is a fact. So, continuing with a few more episodes and a new sequence would bring new chances and adaptations to the show as a whole.(And look what a surprise, before sending the review, Higurashi will have a sequence confirmed by Funimation.)Finally, if you\'ve made it this far, you should realize that it\'s not just any anime. Higurashi marked generations (me too) and broke many paradigms of horror and suspense, something that has not been seen for a long time. 2020 was a difficult year, the anime obviously suffered from the bad reception of many fans and newcomers with the show. I must say, it is normal and I respect the position of these people. Nobody imagined that these more controversial versions and changes in history would be chosen by Kawaguchi. However, I loved everything that was proposed. Higurashi has entered my favorites because of this season, which, for me, is nothing short of great. I really hope for a possible reinterpretation of people with the show, in fact, we are talking about a unique and exclusive content, the beloved of Ryukishi07, a little commented masterpiece. Congratulations to everyone who pledged to make this anime. Congratulations to Passione, for taking such a good title and continuing with great originality. To those who didn\'t watch the first few seasons, I highly recommend watching it, if it pleased you. You will certainly have no regrets about this.NIPPAH  <3 order to create two more cours for the show.

IS. NOT. A. REMAKE.THIS IS A SEQUEL! A THIRD SEASON!This should have been clear from episode 2 and the opening alone.(Slight Spoiler Warning if you haven\'t seen/read the original)Episode 2 immediately jumps into it and shows you Hanyuu (who wasn\'t even introduced in the first season of the Deen adaptation) with Rika talking about the time...loops and how they ""returned once again"" while they supposedly finally escaped that hell.(Slight Spoiler End)When it comes to the opening I\'d like to make one more thing clear:THIS SEQUEL WILL MOST CERTAINLY HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH UMINEKO IN SOME SHAPE OR FORM, SO IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE UMINEKO VISUAL NOVEL, THEN I ADVICE YOU DO THIS BEFORE CONTINUING OR STARTING THIS SHOW.Why am I so sure? In the opening we get to see Featherine\'s silhouette and a shot of the Ushiromiya mansion.In case you have seen Higurashi Rei, remember Rika talking about ""Bernkastel""?Shes also a character from Umineko.Anyway, because they clearly show this in the opening, we can probally except some twist that will be better understood and more enjoyed with knowledge about the Umineko franchise. Ofcourse even I dont know what this twist will be, which is making me (as a fan of both Higurashi and Umineko) very hyped up and excited! But ofcourse for people unaware of Umineko this will probally be misunderstood/vague or just straight up confusing.I\'d like to go into more detail, but to avoid spoilers for Umineko, I\'ll be brief about this part:The Higurashi story is a game to the witches, just another fragment they decided to play with, i also speculate that the ""Rika"" with the red eyes is actually Bernkastel.And the fact that the mansion is shown and not just Featherine, who is another witch, gives me the feeling this won\'t just be a little cameo...The main reason for my review is clearing up confusion about the show and make people realise this hate/dissapointment is undeserved (at this point in time, episode 14)When it comes to the pacing of the show, its a little faster then season 1, but if you already know about the original arc that the new one is another ""route"" of, then its understandable... because most of us already know what happened in that arc, until ofcourse the parts where it changes.This is also another confirmation that this is a sequel, every arc goes into a completely different direction while Rika uses the tactics she learned from the previous time she experienced this arc, but instead of it going smoothly by already knowing how to handle the situation.. it somehow ends up going horribly wrong anyway. This is in my opinion intriguing.This is the mystery we are trying to solve with this new season: what changed, why is Rika back and why are things not going the way they\'re supposed to.UPDATE: The current arc, Nekodamashi-hen (episode 14-15-16), is an arc that hasn\'t been in the Deen adaptation OR the visual novel. From here on out, everything will be freshly new content.IN CONCLUSION, I\'ll say it in red, this is the best way to experience Higurashi Gou1. Read the Higurashi VN OR Watch the Studio Deen adaptation (VN is recommended)2. READ the Umineko no naku koro ni visual novel, DO NOT watch the incomplete rushed anime.3. Change your mindset of what you\'re expecting this show to be.

Keep an open mind and make sure your knowledge about the franchise is up to date.Just by having prior knowledge and an open mind, this level of reasoning is possible for Furudo Erika. What do you think, everyone? ಸ‿ಸ', 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSThe entire time spent watching Higurashi Gou, I found a pair of questions plaguing my mind: who is this for and why does it exist?Unfortunately, two cours later I still lack any satisfactory answers. As much as I’d like to believe this exists for reasons beyond plugging a gacha game and lining the creators’ pockets, I’m struggling to say otherwise. I can only hope the upcoming sequel Sotsu will be able to build off of Gou’s foundation and take this story anywhere interesting or meaningful; as is, the only things I can credit Gou for are its extreme lack of respect for...the viewer’s time and mental capacities, and its incessant desire to subvert the viewer’s expectations and stomp over everything the original series stood for.Let me start by reiterating the question of ‘who is this for?’, because I think it’s a key point to criticizing Gou. As many viewers unfortunately found out the hard way, Higurashi Gou is not a remake -- despite being initially marketed as such. The only possible explanations I can come up with for this decision are a) getting more viewers by baiting people unfamiliar with the franchise to watch it and b) Ryukishi07 having a lot of fun messing with people. Given statements that Higurashi Gou would be welcoming for these new viewers, I’m inclined to believe there’s at least some truth to the latter.Of course, Gou spoils the original series pretty significantly and I think everyone acquainted with it would agree that this isn’t a good starting point for newcomers. Therefore, Higurashi Gou must be targeted towards the existing fans of the series, right?Well… sort of?See, one of Gou’s biggest issues is that it spends its entire runtime hedging the interests of both groups. This fundamentally doesn’t work; it only succeeds in confusing newer viewers while ruining many twists of the original story. Meanwhile, this only makes the story drag on and on for experienced viewers, who have to sit through recap after recap that add virtually nothing to Gou’s new story.The entire first cour falls heavily into this trap. (Spoilers ahead because I can’t really criticize Gou without discussing its one significant plot twist.) It’s essentially 13 episodes of accelerated rehashing, except the endings to the arcs have changed in an effort to capture experienced viewers’ interest. The arcs don’t work anywhere nearly as well because they’re built to have very different payoffs; in fact, they mainly serve to introduce newer viewers to the cast. That being said, I’m critiquing this as what it is: a sequel and not a reboot -- so I don’t really care about that.What I do -- or rather /did/ -- care about was the new mysteries the first cour set up. It seemed to build up some grand web of mystique in the vein of the original. I was curious; what was up with the Sonozaki sisters -- was it Mion this time who’d gone L5? What was up with Satoko, or Ooishi, or Takano? Why was Rika merely sitting back and watching things go awry this time after the lessons of the original series?The aforementioned subversions of expectations had already begun. A quick reveal that this was a sequel, a gradual reveal that someone new was likely pulling the strings, and twist endings for each rehashed arc of the original Higurashi -- all providing just enough interest through a lot of dry reused content to keep me wanting to push through. Little did I know anything interesting about this first cour was just another subversion, as the second cour makes it all pointless.(Re)acquainting the viewer with the original cast? None of them have any plot relevance aside from Rika and Satoko. Setting up a grand sense of mystery with all the twists and moving parts? Too bad, the only purpose to any of it was the obvious things. Someone was deliberately making the arcs that should be going right go horribly wrong in new ways (and yes, that someone was Satoko, who everyone and their dog was suspicious of by the end of the cour. More on her later, of course.) Characters acting suspiciously out of character (such as Rika conveniently deciding to ignore her friends when confiding in them was what saved her in the first place)? Either a result of Gou changing arc endings for the sake of changing them or of Gou deciding to make them out of character (which certainly wasn’t about to stop).Anyways, moving into the second cour we get our first arc, Nekodamashi-hen. The first two episodes of Nekodamashi-hen exist to convey one point: being Rika Furude is suffering. In particular, the second one begins to make it clear Gou just wants to spin its wheels and waste time -- a theme that only gets clearer across the second cour (just in case a cour of rehash to foreshadow one or two meaningful points didn’t get it across). It finally addresses Rika’s lack of seeking help by flash-forwarding through a bunch of outright comical gore scenes (more on that later as well) where everyone betrays her. Any sense of mystery created earlier on evaporates as the show bashes into your head ‘someone is clearly trying to mess with Rika’.After this, the third episode decides there hadn’t been enough pointless gore/torture porn and spends ten minutes having Satoko drag out Rika’s intestines. It was at this exact moment that I gave up on expecting Gou to be clever or meaningful.Let’s compare the Deen adaption for a moment -- something that (regardless of any of many fair criticisms levied at it) tried to be legitimately unsettling instead of purely relying upon cheap theatrics. Deen adaption? Realizes that describing Watanagashi is already enough to rattle a viewer. Gou? Spends half an episode dragging out showing it in excruciating detail. Deen adaption? Certainly goes extra with the gore/violence aspect at points, but is purposeful with them and usually wraps them in enough meaningful mystery or character/plot-related intensity to make it captivating. Scenes like that time Keiichi and Satoko stumble upon Rika’s mutilated corpse build an atmosphere of mystery and tension, scenes like Shion butchering Satoko and having a mental breakdown further the extremely messed up character development at play and have significant payoffs later in the series, etc etc. Gou? Mindless drawn out violence for the sake of mindless drawn out violence. Blood splatters the size of a small tsunami attached to a bright, lively art style that both combine to make it impossible to take anything seriously. Bonking people on the head with a baseball bat and having their eyes comically bulge out. At one point, a character throws themself in front of a bus just to comically blood splatter another character. It’s impossible to take any of it seriously.Anyways, back to the episode. Ignoring the comically bad torture porn, this is also where Gou begins to completely break down in portraying the characters. Rika at this point is down worse than she was at the beginning of Kai. She curses her cruel fate, wants nothing more than to leave Hinamizawa and all of the horrible memories she has attached there, and has basically given up on trying to fight against it. (It’s already rather strange that Rika wants to leave behind Hinamizawa and most of her friends given the message of the original series. It’s even stranger given Higurashi Rei (which completely contradicts this motive), but wanting to leave behind a century of awful memories is rationalizable so I digress.)Satoko (who Rika at least thinks has gone L5 and completely insane from Hinamizawa Syndrome) says some mumbo-jumbo to her about how Rika is cursed by Oyashiro, and Rika’s character motives built up through the last arc almost entirely evaporate. Never mind that Rika is even intimately familiar with ‘Oyashiro’ -- that’s all it takes. She goes from literally wanting to commit suicide to ‘Actually, I wouldn’t trade my time for Hinamizawa in the world’ because of a bit of gaslighting.If you thought that character moment was nonsensical, the next arc then tops it with an outright butchering of Satoko’s character. We’re lead to feel sympathetic for Satoko because Rika “abandoned her” (emphasis on the quotation marks), which is supposed to make us feel bad for the character who’s time-looping to torture and gaslight her supposed friend into staying with her forever and in general massacring her friends and village over repetitive timeloops.This abandonment consists of Rika wanting to leave Hinamizawa, going to a fancy boarding school, and making a bunch of new high society friends while Satoko struggles academically. She offers to help Satoko, Satoko refuses, and isn’t capable of keeping up with the school. This causes her to fall into a state where she wants to loop back and change everything, and is somehow granted that power by a new, suspiciously Umineko-like Hanyuu equivalent.Reasonable enough progression so far, right?Satoko then loops back, gets persuaded by Rika to go through essentially the same loop again because Rika says she’d never abandon her friend, refuses Rika’s help again, and ends up in the same situation. This causes Satoko to become so mad and distrustful of Rika she goes insane and turns into a cartoon villain obsessing over making the perfect timeline where Rika stays with her forever.I can only believe there’s some sort of modified Hinamizawa Syndrome at work here, as Satoko from this point onward makes no sense with the original depiction of the character (or in general for that matter). However, given the show spends an entire arc establishing her motives -- along with multiple episodes that add nothing to the story beyond ‘In case you didn’t notice the last ten times we said it, yes Satoko is bad now’... it’s hard for me to say that with conviction.(Seriously, in case I haven’t conveyed how ridiculous this becomes, here’s an example. There’s a point where Satoko’s given access to the timelines Rika suffered through over a century, and Satoko’s response is “I must watch them all to understand her”. The show then tells us she spends a century watching timelines of everything going wrong, comes out of it with zero change to her motivations (if anything she’s more gung-ho to manipulate Rika and feels less sympathy for her ‘friend’), and carries on as if this is a completely logical response to a friend growing more distant from you.)The subversions of expectations only continue to grow in the final arc -- I can only imagine R07 is having a lot of fun messing with us. The plot stops moving entirely after Rika’s arc after leaving off at a cliffhanger and never comes back, even after a very in-depth flashback of Satoko’s motivations. With three episodes left, it slows to an absolute crawl with no meaningful progression. The first of these three episodes is another episode that adds literally nothing to the story -- it’s just Satoko and ‘Eua’ talking and plotting with more establishment that Satoko is acting completely out of character… just in case we couldn’t realize Satoko has become bad? She also finds out about Satoshi and doesn’t seem to particularly care, which outright makes no sense given her obsession and complexes towards him in the original, but whatever -- why start being in-character now.The second decides to throw in a random Teppei redemption arc. While this episode does at least try to do something interesting, I unsurprisingly don’t feel particularly sympathetic for an abusive father who beats and abandons a young child just because he realizes he’s going to die alone. Perhaps the sequel will build off of this in useful ways, but it adds nothing to the story so far (not to mention it feels like an appalling narrative given the character’s previous depiction). Otherwise, the episode seemingly exists just to demonstrate characters can learn things over the course of loops (something we already knew about).The next episode (and finale for the series) also exists for the same reason. It tries to explain some of the mysteries of the first cour (Takano’s motivations and how Satoko acquired the virus), but a) the concept has already been established many times over, b) the viewer can infer how Satoko’s looping powers could gain her access to the virus without an episode dedicated to it (if anything the idea that ‘Satoko has to codebreak to get the virus and does it by manually attempting and resetting every time she guess the wrong password’ is stupider than any way I would’ve imagined), and c) resolving the random mysteries of the first cour means nothing if they don’t matter whatsoever to the plot -- you’re just adding content for the sake of adding content. Half the episode is also spent as a flashback to Kai -- even during the season finale Gou still attempts to cater to new Higurashi viewers by exposition dumping the plot of the original series.I’ve said it before, but Gou really feels like it has no respect for the viewer’s time. Having completed the series, I feel like I watched about 3 episodes of content stretched across 2 cours. The entire plot can be summed up as follows: Rika is returned to June 1983, and this time everything is being directly manipulated against her. It’s eventually revealed that this is being done by Satoko, who feels betrayed by Rika and wants to create a timeline where Rika and her are happily together.That is the entire plot of two whole cours. Any attempted sense of misdirection feels like just that -- misdirection for misdirection’s sake to pad for time. Any revisiting of anything else feels like it’s just there to pad for time. Any usage of other existing characters feels like it’s just there to pad for time.Even now, I’d still like to believe there’s more to this story -- I still hope in vain for Sotsu to redeem some of this drudgery. Unfortunately, all I can say for now is I came into Gou wanting to revisit both the deep web of mystery and beloved cast of the original Higurashi, and found a distinct lack of either. Instead, I found a sequel that only serves to trample on everything I loved about Higurashi. The messaging of the value of trust and friendship are gone, replaced with dreary cynicism and misery. Instead everyone has been quietly broken apart -- I can’t help but think of one background point where the show mentions Mion’s been ignoring her old friends for months now that she’s a college student. Shion completely disappears and Rena and even Keiichi -- the one who Rika once viewed as the key to changing fate -- have stopped mattering entirely. Any of the hidden depth of the characters feels forgotten in favour of dumbing them down to the repeated jokes, and any of the heart the series has disappears with it.Any mysteries show in Gou feel like they’re just there to spin their wheels pointlessly, and any cleverness and subtlety in the show feels like it’s been thrown out the window in favour of repetitively shoving points down the viewer’s throat to convey their importance. Any genuine sense of tension or psychological unease has disappeared in favour of cheap theatrics befitting a c-list horror movie. Any meaning to these varied timelines has also disappeared; Satoko even literally says in the final episode that all her failed timelines don’t matter, and they only feel like some combination of dead space and misery for misery’s sake. The pacing drags on at a snail’s pace, and it doesn’t even matter because nothing matters anymore -- this new hellbound Satoko can simply snap her fingers and undo it with her new ridiculously broken powers.Higurashi Gou has either intentionally or unintentionally deconstructed basically every strength of the series. While some fans seem to find that entertaining, I simply cannot understand why anyone would want that. I don’t even possibly know where it’s going anymore, and I’m not even sure I want to find out. I’m sure I’ll end up watching Sotsu regardless, hoping in vain to recapture some of the magic that made me love this series in the first place, and I suspect I’ll end up back here again venting my absolute disappointment. Maybe it’ll turn out better and redeem some of Gou’s failings for me, but I can’t see any world in which this wasn’t a huge letdown. the viewer’s time and mental capacities, and its incessant desire to subvert the viewer’s expectations and stomp over everything the original series stood for.Let me start by reiterating the question of ‘who is this for?’, because I think it’s a key point to criticizing Gou. As many viewers unfortunately found out the hard way, Higurashi Gou is not a remake -- despite being initially marketed as such. The only possible explanations I can come up with for this decision are a) getting more viewers by baiting people unfamiliar with the franchise to watch it and b) Ryukishi07 having a lot of fun messing with people. Given statements that Higurashi Gou would be welcoming for these new viewers, I’m inclined to believe there’s at least some truth to the latter.Of course, Gou spoils the original series pretty significantly and I think everyone acquainted with it would agree that this isn’t a good starting point for newcomers. Therefore, Higurashi Gou must be targeted towards the existing fans of the series, right?Well… sort of?See, one of Gou’s biggest issues is that it spends its entire runtime hedging the interests of both groups. This fundamentally doesn’t work; it only succeeds in confusing newer viewers while ruining many twists of the original story. Meanwhile, this only makes the story drag on and on for experienced viewers, who have to sit through recap after recap that add virtually nothing to Gou’s new story.The entire first cour falls heavily into this trap. (Spoilers ahead because I can’t really criticize Gou without discussing its one significant plot twist.) It’s essentially 13 episodes of accelerated rehashing, except the endings to the arcs have changed in an effort to capture experienced viewers’ interest. The arcs don’t work anywhere nearly as well because they’re built to have very different payoffs; in fact, they mainly serve to introduce newer viewers to the cast. That being said, I’m critiquing this as what it is: a sequel and not a reboot -- so I don’t really care about that.What I do -- or rather /did/ -- care about was the new mysteries the first cour set up. It seemed to build up some grand web of mystique in the vein of the original. I was curious; what was up with the Sonozaki sisters -- was it Mion this time who’d gone L5? What was up with Satoko, or Ooishi, or Takano? Why was Rika merely sitting back and watching things go awry this time after the lessons of the original series?The aforementioned subversions of expectations had already begun. A quick reveal that this was a sequel, a gradual reveal that someone new was likely pulling the strings, and twist endings for each rehashed arc of the original Higurashi -- all providing just enough interest through a lot of dry reused content to keep me wanting to push through. Little did I know anything interesting about this first cour was just another subversion, as the second cour makes it all pointless.(Re)acquainting the viewer with the original cast? None of them have any plot relevance aside from Rika and Satoko. Setting up a grand sense of mystery with all the twists and moving parts? Too bad, the only purpose to any of it was the obvious things. Someone was deliberately making the arcs that should be going right go horribly wrong in new ways (and yes, that someone was Satoko, who everyone and their dog was suspicious of by the end of the cour. More on her later, of course.) Characters acting suspiciously out of character (such as Rika conveniently deciding to ignore her friends when confiding in them was what saved her in the first place)? Either a result of Gou changing arc endings for the sake of changing them or of Gou deciding to make them out of character (which certainly wasn’t about to stop).Anyways, moving into the second cour we get our first arc, Nekodamashi-hen. The first two episodes of Nekodamashi-hen exist to convey one point: being Rika Furude is suffering. In particular, the second one begins to make it clear Gou just wants to spin its wheels and waste time -- a theme that only gets clearer across the second cour (just in case a cour of rehash to foreshadow one or two meaningful points didn’t get it across). It finally addresses Rika’s lack of seeking help by flash-forwarding through a bunch of outright comical gore scenes (more on that later as well) where everyone betrays her. Any sense of mystery created earlier on evaporates as the show bashes into your head ‘someone is clearly trying to mess with Rika’.After this, the third episode decides there hadn’t been enough pointless gore/torture porn and spends ten minutes having Satoko drag out Rika’s intestines. It was at this exact moment that I gave up on expecting Gou to be clever or meaningful.Let’s compare the Deen adaption for a moment -- something that (regardless of any of many fair criticisms levied at it) tried to be legitimately unsettling instead of purely relying upon cheap theatrics. Deen adaption? Realizes that describing Watanagashi is already enough to rattle a viewer. Gou? Spends half an episode dragging out showing it in excruciating detail. Deen adaption? Certainly goes extra with the gore/violence aspect at points, but is purposeful with them and usually wraps them in enough meaningful mystery or character/plot-related intensity to make it captivating. Scenes like that time Keiichi and Satoko stumble upon Rika’s mutilated corpse build an atmosphere of mystery and tension, scenes like Shion butchering Satoko and having a mental breakdown further the extremely messed up character development at play and have significant payoffs later in the series, etc etc. Gou? Mindless drawn out violence for the sake of mindless drawn out violence. Blood splatters the size of a small tsunami attached to a bright, lively art style that both combine to make it impossible to take anything seriously. Bonking people on the head with a baseball bat and having their eyes comically bulge out. At one point, a character throws themself in front of a bus just to comically blood splatter another character. It’s impossible to take any of it seriously.Anyways, back to the episode. Ignoring the comically bad torture porn, this is also where Gou begins to completely break down in portraying the characters. Rika at this point is down worse than she was at the beginning of Kai. She curses her cruel fate, wants nothing more than to leave Hinamizawa and all of the horrible memories she has attached there, and has basically given up on trying to fight against it. (It’s already rather strange that Rika wants to leave behind Hinamizawa and most of her friends given the message of the original series. It’s even stranger given Higurashi Rei (which completely contradicts this motive), but wanting to leave behind a century of awful memories is rationalizable so I digress.)Satoko (who Rika at least thinks has gone L5 and completely insane from Hinamizawa Syndrome) says some mumbo-jumbo to her about how Rika is cursed by Oyashiro, and Rika’s character motives built up through the last arc almost entirely evaporate. Never mind that Rika is even intimately familiar with ‘Oyashiro’ -- that’s all it takes. She goes from literally wanting to commit suicide to ‘Actually, I wouldn’t trade my time for Hinamizawa in the world’ because of a bit of gaslighting.If you thought that character moment was nonsensical, the next arc then tops it with an outright butchering of Satoko’s character. We’re lead to feel sympathetic for Satoko because Rika “abandoned her” (emphasis on the quotation marks), which is supposed to make us feel bad for the character who’s time-looping to torture and gaslight her supposed friend into staying with her forever and in general massacring her friends and village over repetitive timeloops.This abandonment consists of Rika wanting to leave Hinamizawa, going to a fancy boarding school, and making a bunch of new high society friends while Satoko struggles academically. She offers to help Satoko, Satoko refuses, and isn’t capable of keeping up with the school. This causes her to fall into a state where she wants to loop back and change everything, and is somehow granted that power by a new, suspiciously Umineko-like Hanyuu equivalent.Reasonable enough progression so far, right?Satoko then loops back, gets persuaded by Rika to go through essentially the same loop again because Rika says she’d never abandon her friend, refuses Rika’s help again, and ends up in the same situation. This causes Satoko to become so mad and distrustful of Rika she goes insane and turns into a cartoon villain obsessing over making the perfect timeline where Rika stays with her forever.I can only believe there’s some sort of modified Hinamizawa Syndrome at work here, as Satoko from this point onward makes no sense with the original depiction of the character (or in general for that matter). However, given the show spends an entire arc establishing her motives -- along with multiple episodes that add nothing to the story beyond ‘In case you didn’t notice the last ten times we said it, yes Satoko is bad now’... it’s hard for me to say that with conviction.(Seriously, in case I haven’t conveyed how ridiculous this becomes, here’s an example.

In an effort to be simultaneously accessible to newcomers and satisfying to long time fans, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou tries to be a remake and a sequel at the same time, but it manages to only have the failures of both, so the resulting mess should...hardly pander to either demographic at all. While I’m not going to spoil anything specific, it's worth mentioning this show begins exactly where season one does, but it also immediately exposes secrets from season two before finishing a single arc or even establishing the fact this series is a time loop, thus it dismantles everything good about the original mystery by revealing what's inside the mystery box before you even knew it was there. Newcomers won’t appreciate or even comprehend the significance of certain knowledge without fully understanding the time loop and will also fail to recognize principle characters when so much focus is being shifted to those who shouldn't even be introduced yet, and fans of the original will be confused as to why any of this is appearing so soon and in such a jumbled fashion. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou consistently miscalculates how it plans to cohesively rearrange major fixtures of the plot so often, it fails to even feel like the same story any longer.Before I even criticize the writing in depth, however, I first must decry the aspect of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou which turned me off to it even before fully comprehending its horrendous narrative structure and other fundamental problems: and that is its art style. Studio Deen has been well known in all the wrong ways for all the right reasons for the last twenty five years, and the original Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was no exception to their sometimes disastrous animation production values. That said, as much as the community wants to make memes out of awkward looking screenshots, the scratchy hand-drawn look of Deen’s linework combined with the simple colors and thick retro shadows Chiaki Kon used to juggle the show’s two very different tones made the general atmosphere feel extremely artful and visually cohesive, and when it came to the true horror and gore, the disregard for the anatomical integrity of the character art really did contribute to the demented feeling of the already shocking scenarios. The animation quality of Studio Passione’s Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou is consistently and clearly higher than that of the original Deen projects, but the actual art design and visual style is inarguably uninspired, and in my own personal opinion, just downright ugly. Everything looks so uncannily shiny and clean despite the naturalistic setting of Hinamizawa, and the glossy, digital coloration on all the character art just makes everyone look inhuman. It’s impossibly unimmersive.It’s almost a shame the original voice cast did such a good job reprising their roles, because the writing is so dull, it turned a thriller into a slog. While season two definitely slowed down to unpack the mystery and finally work towards a solution to stop the loop and save the day, season one was absolutely nail-biting, fiercely memorable, and filled to the brim with clues and hints season two would eventually come around to piece together. Every episode had it’s own twists and turns, and even some of the dialogue found in the saccharine scenes at the beginning of each loop was meant to imply something important to the plot, and this tight script never failed to keep you so far on the edge of your seat, you’d nearly fall off when the excitement went up to eleven. However, this ability to remain engaging throughout has been entirely lost. The same meandering conversations and pandering diversions from the story at hand which are so common in anime nowadays have now penetrated a franchise as famously intoxicating as this one, and the resulting show is honestly boring to sit through. The worst part of it all, though, is the caveat of expanded universe. It turns out a lot of the alterations that make no sense even to those who’ve seen the original are actually elements from the Higurashi AND Umineko visual novels, so if you want the full experience, you have to venture outside the franchise and outside the entire god damn medium of animation which you came to enjoy in the first place to do so.Being the cynical bitch I am, my original conception of this project was one of pure skepticism and dismissal upon first seeing the key visual with Reina’s new generic moe design. If anything, I figured they were just bringing the series back to milk it for the gore and call it a day, but they didn’t even deliver on that. The death scenes are paltry when compared to the legendary originals, and I think it all just comes down to a misguided vision for what the series was or, frankly, just bad directing. To even do the whole remake-but-also-a-sequel thing at all, they had to make the first episode essentially a one-to-one copy of the original to mislead everyone into thinking they were starting from narrative scratch, and even though the show slowly but surely crashes and burns, I think this was a good decision to begin with because it gives the audience a perfect and immediate opportunity to directly compare the two iterations. Say what you will about Chiaki Kon as a creative, and say what you will about Studio Deen as a production company, but you simply must recognize how well the original team captured the foreboding ambiance 07th Expansion manifests within the core of all their works, and you also must appreciate how electrifying the tension was in Kon’s sporadic direction, sporadic direction which itself demonstrated how expertly she was able to capture Ryukishi’s whiplashing tone shifts.

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou was my most anticipated show from the Fall 2020 season, but in its current state it’s shaping up to be a disappointment to fans of the original, and confusing to newcomers to the series. Disclaimer: this show is still ongoing. All of my thoughts are subject to change as the show progresses. With that out of the way, let’s dive in.I’m not sure if Passione ever officially said this would be a remake, but that’s definitely what everyone thought it was going to be. Google “Higurashi...remake” and you’ll see what I mean. Well, turns out that they pulled a fast one on us and instead of giving the original series the Fruits Basket treatment, this is actually (kinda?) a third season! I’m not marking that as a spoiler since it’s obvious from episode 1. The way they’ve done this is weird though. Instead of all new content, they’re remaking the arcs from the original show but giving them different endings. I’m sure as the season progresses it’ll deviate more and more from the first season, but the unfortunate consequence of that decision is that it leads your brain to make direct comparisons to the original show. So, how does the new one stack up to the old one? So far, not so well.The first issue I have with Gou is the animation. Let’s think back to the original show; we all know Studio Deen is famous for… ahem… “subpar” animation. And the old Higurashi definitely suffered from that, mainly in the first season. Characters were often drawn off-model, backgrounds were simple, character proportions were kinda off, movement was stiff. But the one thing Deen did right is they basically had 2 “modes” for the show: moe mode, and horror mode. During the majority of the show when characters were acting normally, everything had a bright moe look. But when the horror started, everything about the art style changed. Lighting got darker, camera angles went askew, and character proportions changed. You could tell just from the stylistic changes that some serious stuff was about to go down. Sometimes they’d even use that as a fake-out—they’d change to “horror” mode, but the scene would pass and nothing would happen. That added suspense and tension, and kept us as the audience from ever getting too comfortable in this world.The new show is bright and moe all. the. time. Even during the kills. I’ve seen people try to defend that as being some kind of deliberate contrast. “It’s supposed to be shocking seeing these cute characters covered in blood and killing people!” Yeah, that’s shocking, but it’s not scary. The worst change has probably been to the famous “Higurashi face”. You know the one, it’s been imitated in almost every horror anime since. In the original show, characters’ faces would become heavily distorted during the intense horror scenes, sometimes to an almost unrecognizable extent. In the new one, they stay too moe. They eyes are still too soft and round and the expressions aren’t as intense. I was really excited to see the Higurashi face updated to 2020 animation standards, but from its first appearance, I’ve been disappointed.The second issue I have is with the writing. The original Higurashi was, in my opinion, a masterclass in tight writing. Every episode flew by; 24 minutes always felt like 5. This is because every line mattered. Every conversation mattered. Every scene mattered. You couldn’t take anything away from the original show without losing something. That’s how a good show should be, it keeps you engaged by always feeding you relevant information. The way a show starts to drag is by having lines of pointless dialogue, characters repeating themselves, or having filler scenes that go nowhere. That’s the trap (pun intended) the new show is starting to fall into.For example, in the original show, we establish early in the second season that the character Satoko makes traps. It’s established quickly in one scene in episode 2, it’s played for laughs in episode 3, and it isn’t brought up again until it becomes relevant to the plot. And in each of those instances, we’re taught something about the other characters, too; it doesn’t JUST establish Satoko’s trap-making skill. In the new show, we establish her trap-making skill in the first 10 minutes of episode 1 in a new scene where she hides a blackboard eraser in a doorjamb. Keiichi falls for it, and then the characters practically mug to the camera and go “Hey, did you know, SATAKO MAKES TRAPS???” And then again, at the end of the same episode, Satoko wins their scavenger hunt for a marker with a trap which, this time, makes no sense how she could have set one up without knowing ahead of time where the marker was. A throwaway line like, “Satoko has traps set all over the school!” could have explained it away, but we get nothing. Instead, it just re-establishes what we already know.There’s an even worse example in episode 4 where Keiichi ends up in the hospital after being attacked by a certain character. Ooshi walks into his hospital room and asks him to explain what happened, and Keiichi basically tells him he doesn’t know what happened. Ooshi says “I’ll visit again soon. Feel better.” and walks out. I still don’t understand what the point of that interaction was. We already know Keiichi is confused, that interaction didn’t teach us anything we didn’t already know about the characters or the plot.One other thing that bothers me is how early they’re revealing an important aspect of a certain character. I won’t get into detail on that one because it’s major spoilers if you haven’t watched either show, but suffice to say that if you’re a newcomer and you start with Gou, you will have certain elements of the original spoiled for you if you do decide to go back and watch the original show. That wouldn’t matter if this was a direct remake, but like I said before, it seems like it’s a third season, meaning you still have to watch the original to get the full story.Overall, I think it’s still too early to tell how good this show will ultimately be. But as of episode 6, there are some early warning signs that this season might not live up to the legendary status of its predecessors. Here’s to hoping they manage to surprise us. remake” and you’ll see what I mean. Well, turns out that they pulled a fast one on us and instead of giving the original series the Fruits Basket treatment, this is actually (kinda?) a third season! I’m not marking that as a spoiler since it’s obvious from episode 1. The way they’ve done this is weird though. Instead of all new content, they’re remaking the arcs from the original show but giving them different endings. I’m sure as the season progresses it’ll deviate more and more from the first season, but the unfortunate consequence of that decision is that it leads your brain to make direct comparisons to the original show. So, how does the new one stack up to the old one? So far, not so well.The first issue I have with Gou is the animation. Let’s think back to the original show; we all know Studio Deen is famous for… ahem… “subpar” animation. And the old Higurashi definitely suffered from that, mainly in the first season. Characters were often drawn off-model, backgrounds were simple, character proportions were kinda off, movement was stiff. But the one thing Deen did right is they basically had 2 “modes” for the show: moe mode, and horror mode. During the majority of the show when characters were acting normally, everything had a bright moe look. But when the horror started, everything about the art style changed. Lighting got darker, camera angles went askew, and character proportions changed. You could tell just from the stylistic changes that some serious stuff was about to go down. Sometimes they’d even use that as a fake-out—they’d change to “horror” mode, but the scene would pass and nothing would happen. That added suspense and tension, and kept us as the audience from ever getting too comfortable in this world.The new show is bright and moe all. the. time. Even during the kills.

Here’s to hoping they manage to surprise us.', 'If you stumbled upon this article because you\'re curious about Higurashi and think you can start from here. This is the place for you. Don\'t worry. I won\'t include any spoilers at all. Now let me tell you, this is not a remake, a reboot, a spin-off, or any of that. It\'s a bonafide sequel. Whoever told you otherwise is a liar and should be ashamed of themselves. When it comes to the haters. Are there what seems to be what you call plotholes, or simply that things don\'t make sense? What did you expect? If you have watched the prequel and not wandered into...Gou just cause, you\'d know these things. I want to say I am honestly disappointed in those who dare call themselves fans of the visual novel. Did you even realize that Gou is by far the most consistent Higurashi to date that follows the style of the visual novel to the teeth and Ryukishi\'s writing? It\'s answering questions that only true fans are aware of from the prequel, expanding on topics hinted at in Higurashi, all the while establishing a proper connection to Umineko and even the newly WTC (When They Cry) visual novel Ciconia. On top of all that, while building upon the finer details from previous Higurashi. It\'s giving us a new story that still manages to retain the mysterious and other aspects we love from Higurashi. In other words, if you are a Ryukishi07 enthusiast. It doesn\'t get any better than this.I have seen all kinds of nonsensical reasons to justify the hate. If you are talking about production being a hit or miss or other inconsistencies. I get where you\'re coming from, even if I don\'t entirely agree, but having seen all of Higurashi, followed by Gou. All this should have at least told you from a writing point of view that Ryukishi\'s the kind of writer that likes to confuzzle the audience, make them feel utterly lost, give them a reason to use the mind. Hence leave enough evidence and clues to give them a crack at solving the puzzle pieces. The WTC franchise has always been the kind of story where you have to go through the entire story to genuinely appreciate it because it\'s designed that way. We only got parts of the pages in the book, but many are still missing, though it will be filled by Sotsu when it rolls around 2021 07/07. Bless you, for that reference, Ryukishi07. Higurashi Gou is first and foremost a sequel. In which case, it means we got five seasons of Higurashi (Rei and Sotsu included). I cannot even begin to express my happiness at the thought of that. Ryukishi is known to write his story in a way where each work influences the other, making the experience richer and even savourier. Hence, reading another work from WTC might give you a completely new perception of what Higurashi as a whole is about.It might make things even easier to follow or hard, depending on how you take it. Regardless, if you\'re done with Higurashi, I highly suggest checking out Umineko\'s visual novel or the manga (not the awful anime adaptation). Another masterpiece by the hands of Ryukishi. It\'ll definitely clear your mind and give you a completely new comprehension. Let me throw this out there the ""origin of miracles"" and the ""origin of certainty."" If you\'ve read Umineko already, then you should know what I am hinting at here. I won\'t include direct spoilers as I want everyone the joy of figuring it out for themselves. After all, part of the fun about any entries of WTC (When They Cry) is being able to predict and theorize to your heart\'s content. Oh, not to mention witnessing how completely off the mark you are when your ideas fall flat as Ryukishi sneers at you. I will admit it was not cool of Ryukishi to introduce Gou as a remake or a reboot. That even the newcomers can watch it. Considering it spoils major chunks of Higurashi in the second episode. In contrast, in the first episode, things are not as clear. Sadly, not everyone knows that Ryukishi is a major troll that lies as naturally as he breathes. But you have to be lying to me if you said nothing felt off by the second episode. It\'s true Higurashi is meant to give you a sense of feeling lost, things not making sense, but Gou took that to another level. If you watched it without having seen previous installments, you could tell it was clearly not friendly to newcomers even for a bit, suggesting it might\'ve been a sequel, which it happened to be.There\'s no denying the new art\'s more lighthearted than the previous Higurashi, which might ruin the atmospheric tone for some. In my case, I love it. Why? Because it\'s the most faithful style to the visual novel, we\'ve received yet. I adore the good old art-style from the Deen adaptation, too, but when it comes to expressions and comedy, it hits far stronger with this new style. The characters have never been so expressive without looking all messy and off-modeled, which is a recurring issue in the Deen version. Even voice-acting has been absolutely top-notch and cleaner, as you would expect with upgraded software and hardware. No, the production and direction are not perfect, but would you seriously call it terrible? Not even close. I have nothing but praise for Akio Watanabe\'s gorgeous and rich art-style and Keiichiro Kawaguchi\'s strong direction, which never made me wonder if I was watching anything but Higurashi. One specific episode was a genuine masterpiece, from the direction to the voice acting, to the shot composition, to the way the colors were used to emphasize the severity of the situation. Oh, let\'s not forget about the gore and the sound effects, which make you so uncomfortable that you have to turn away or cover your eyes. It was gruesome, but it also illustrated the unstable mind of a certain someone.And Most of the few animation inconsistencies here and there can easily be fixed in the BD release. Studio Passione didn\'t even shy away from gore by giving us an early release of few uncensored episodes. Sadly, haters somehow found a way to insult it even that, failing to notice how good the effects, the tone, and brutality were. Trust me, this was gore without any limitations whatsoever. I was cringing like mad, had to even cover my eyes since it was truly a visceral spectacle. Don\'t get me wrong here. I loved it, even if it made me hold onto my gut as my life counted on it. Gou also got a manga adaptation that was released at the same time as the anime. It includes more details that anime cut out. The art-style of Tomose Akase is absolutely gorgeous, as is the execution of the tone and paneling. Think of the manga as a supplementary to the anime. It\'s amazing so far. Chapter comes out on a bi-monthly basis.Did you know Higurashi has always been more of a mystery than a horror story, but not many seem to not understand that? Sure, the first part clearly had lots of jumpscares and other terrifying moments that made you jump out of your seat. But Higurashi always has been a circle of tragedies with a big dash of mystery to make you feel lost, question things, and so on. The unfamiliarity of Hinamizawa and the things going on there had us under the influence of paranoia. But at the end of the road, we got our answers, and we knew where and how to connect the dots. In Gou\'s case, it\'s trying to sell itself even more as a tragedy than horror. That might be why you don\'t feel as frightened, but you\'re straight out lying if you said you\'re not feeling lost either. An example of this is the iconic main theme of Higurashi. The original version has a more scary and paranoid vibe, while the Gou version sounds sad and emanates a feeling of loss and suffering. In other words, tragedy. Hopefully, you see the point I am trying to make here. Gou is a completely new take on our beloved Higurashi without losing key elements of the prequel. On another note, the soundtrack in Higurashi Gou is phenomenal and nails its relevant themes Gou is trying to showcase. We had Asaka on the opening, blessing us with a bopper track. Ayane returned again with more striking and beautiful tunes. Mind you, both songs include heavy symbolism, foreshadowing, context. Even the dialogue is super important. You can tell Ryukishi was there with Passion supporting them and instructing them as clearly, his fingerprints are everywhere.Yes, I loved Higurashi Gou as if it was not obvious already, plus evidently, I am biased with it, but that\'s fine. I am not forcing you to take things I am writing her for granted. If I can offer you a new perspective and give you some value, then that\'s enough for me. I don\'t like seeing one of my favorite writers being insulted when haters aren\'t even able to provide logical reasoning to support their rant. So here I will state who Higurashi and WTC franchise as a whole is truly meant for. Are you on the lookout for a puzzle that might seem hazy not make sense at first, but gradually as the pieces get revealed, it falls in places? Do you love the idea of been giving the room to theorize and predict events? Then there you go. It\'s also worth noting, you need to patient, have your brain on at all times, be open-minded, able to think outside of the box. Higurashi is not meant for your average watcher or reader. What\'s so good about Higurashi? It\'s the fact Ryukishi utilizes details from his enormous WTC collection to build upon and expand the story further. Plus, he somehow makes things always connect when it seems impossible and does a wonderful job of explaining it. He writes the works to also gives out a very meaningful and emotional message that is relevant in the current day and even the past. If you are curious about more of those takes, I suggest reading my first Higurashi review, which also includes no spoilers and delves into characters, among other things. You can find it on my Anilist. I mainly wanted this review to show you why Gou was always meant to be a thing, should you watch it and dispel some of the hate it\'s been received by others.In any case, Higurashi Gou is my favorite anime of the 2021 Spring season, and with Sotsu right around the corner. This new installment of Higurashi most likely will be my AOTY of 2021. My hats off to Ryukishi-sensei and the entirety staff off Passione. They killed it. If you have not already started Higurashi. I highly recommend it. Whether it be the superior visual novel, solid manga adaptation, or the a-okay but not even close to terrible anime. Sure, it\'s low-cost, but Deen nailed the atmospheric tone, even if many details from the manga and especially the visual novel got cut out. It\'s completely worth your time and a good way to dip your toes into WTC verse, even if it\'s not the best way and definite way to experience Higurashi. I didn\'t include any spoilers since Gou is so fragile that slipping some can ruin it completely. I want everyone to watch Higurashi and the second part of Higurashi, starting with Gou, ending with Sotsu. As blind as possible, you don\'t want to ruin this unique gem\'s once-in-a-lifetime experience. By the subtext, hints, even the writing, it\'s clear a lot of time and effort went into writing Gou. If you go ahead and reread Higurashi, you could see that it was even planned.It should be noted, my score encompasses my enjoyment and the faith I have in Ryukishi when everything is complete, that\'s why it\'s already so high. Despite so, I also had moments where I was not entirely on board and failed to understand things in Gou, but in the last two arcs, I was completely absorbed into the story. I should\'ve expected as much since I was lost during the very first Higurashi. Still, I was addicted the deeper I went into it. It tells me on a new rewatch, I will be able to appreciate it far more since now some key things do make sense. We know whodunnit, whydunnit, howdunnit, but clearly, there is a lot more story to tell. We have some of the keys to grasp certain details and comprehend them, even if the puzzle got holes left to fill. That\'s what makes Ryukishi such a brilliant writer since you know it\'s all intentional. There are hints of the events of Gou in the prequel even before it was a thing. You\'d most likely only realize it first now since your perception will once again increase, alongside your passion for WTC. After all, this franchise is the kind of story that revisiting would be much more rewarding than the first time. Plus, reading other WTC works will again influence your feelings about other products from the WTC franchise.At last, I want you to know Higurashi Gou (karma) is playing out like Kai because it answers parts of the questions but leaves the rest for a sequel. You might be confused about what\'s going on, but this will clearly be answered in Sotsu. All your worries will be laid to rest. The anime adaptation of Kai had two answers arc, so does Gou. But like prequel Higurashi, we might have eight arcs in total. Four of which are questions and the remeaning being the answers. In other words, Sotsu is the answer to all our questions. Plus, it will be the graduation, the ultimate closure to the whole Higurashi franchise. It\'s been going for over 20+ years, but Ryukishi can finally complete the whole puzzle at last. This is again hinting at Higurashi Gou always being planned.  Don\'t even get me started on how Gou might be the segue into the events of Ciconia. If my words were able to pique your curiosity even slightly, take this chance to dip your toes in WTC, starting with Higurashi. Welcome to Hinamiazwa. Gou just cause, you\'d know these things. I want to say I am honestly disappointed in those who dare call themselves fans of the visual novel. Did you even realize that Gou is by far the most consistent Higurashi to date that follows the style of the visual novel to the teeth and Ryukishi\'s writing?

I should\'ve expected as much since I was lost during the very first Higurashi. Still, I was addicted the deeper I went into it. It tells me on a new rewatch, I will be able to appreciate it far more since now some key things do make sense. We know whodunnit, whydunnit, howdunnit, but clearly, there is a lot more story to tell. We have some of the keys to grasp certain details and comprehend them, even if the puzzle got holes left to fill. That\'s what makes Ryukishi such a brilliant writer since you know it\'s all intentional. There are hints of the events of Gou in the prequel even before it was a thing. You\'d most likely only realize it first now since your perception will once again increase, alongside your passion for WTC. After all, this franchise is the kind of story that revisiting would be much more rewarding than the first time. Plus, reading other WTC works will again influence your feelings about other products from the WTC franchise.At last, I want you to know Higurashi Gou (karma) is playing out like Kai because it answers parts of the questions but leaves the rest for a sequel. You might be confused about what\'s going on, but this will clearly be answered in Sotsu. All your worries will be laid to rest. The anime adaptation of Kai had two answers arc, so does Gou. But like prequel Higurashi, we might have eight arcs in total. Four of which are questions and the remeaning being the answers. In other words, Sotsu is the answer to all our questions. Plus, it will be the graduation, the ultimate closure to the whole Higurashi franchise. It\'s been going for over 20+ years, but Ryukishi can finally complete the whole puzzle at last. This is again hinting at Higurashi Gou always being planned.  Don\'t even get me started on how Gou might be the segue into the events of Ciconia. If my words were able to pique your curiosity even slightly, take this chance to dip your toes in WTC, starting with Higurashi. Welcome to Hinamiazwa.', ""EDIT: (April 17, 2021): I actually disagree with the number I gave here but I can't take this down; it's the first time I got 70+ upvotes (T_T) lemme just say I don't like this anime enough to give it an 8 now...it was sort of okay in the beginning and got really bad in the middle but got just a little better later.-----------------------------The creators tried to find a balance which both newcomers and revisitors to Higurashi can enjoy. In the first 2 episodes, the attempt is evident by the inserting of novel cutscenes of Rika, made short for newcomers but nevertheless done for the...sake of revisitors; and alongside the cutscenes, the usual progression of the storyline continues keeping it newer for revisitors as much as it is altered. I’d like to emphasize that the revisitor can feel positive elements subtracted from the original.The creators’ balancing is an attempt that feels appreciable but not largely successful in the eyes of a revisitor. The revisitor feels it is a pity the newcomer will miss out on starting Higurashi believing that 'magic' doesn't exist as the 'magical' aspect of Higurashi is awaiting him at the beginning of season 2 for his fine tasting of 'plot-twist.' One of the ingenious aspects of Higurashi was this surprising holy conversion to being magical themed from being non-magical themed.The new anime fails to outdo its predecessor in making him invest his emotions and concerns for the characters. In the original, the moments of sloppily drawn characters which gave some moments of laughter induced by good “tsukkomi - boke” comedy (Rena’s ‘Omochikaeri’ is sort of like this), and the melancholy dim orange gleam of twilight which would transport you back in time to a day that you saw that light without a worry in the world were factors in making the watcher invested and that this newer anime doesn’t have so far. The intermittent cartoonish art of the original allowed more creativity for scripting the character’s interactions to make them feel more playful, naughty, and caring for each other, which, in turn, are also such factors. Despite having watched only up to episode 6, I can still say with some confidence that such emotion-investing factors will be much weaker in this anime because of its short length, 24 episodes, compared to the lengthy 50 episodes of the original (season 1 and 2 combined), and I will continue to explain why below.There is a problem with this slightly newer plot that might come from a subjective viewpoint and is only noticeable to a revisitor. While we're thankful for another season of Higurashi, it just feels all too imprudent to cast Rika down the pit again right after her salvation from it. This plot decision expands the rift between reality and the fictional by its inhumanity; for the revisitor, the reality is that this plot change (or plot addition) doesn’t exist and the fictional is this plot change itself. What normally follows salvation is a time of rest and comfort, but to give her no time to rest only accomplishes the reinstating that Rika is damned to Hell for eternity and removes a 'Happily Ever After' which many of us have now falsely believed in for over a decade. Not only is Rika thrown down the pit again, the spirit of Hanyuu hovering in front of her is now only a remnant of her actual self. So that's more than adding just a bit of garnish to that undesired plate of suffering there. (Rika cooly accepts Hanyuu's image as a remnant without much agitation though) - the creators just seem to be shouting at the pit, “Just burn in hell a little longer for us, Rika, so we can earn more money!” - This inhumanity confirms the suddenness and rashness of the plot change that had no foreshadowing failing to shrink the rift that is key to pulling the revisitor back into the anime. It may not be so for the newcomer because nothing is sudden and rash about something that is new!However, after episode 4, the revisitor will feel that the newer plot additions are surprisingly admissible to at least a “B-” in his criteria of “good remakes.” He will go like, “Ah, so this is the path they are taking!” The creators are taking the path that has been in the back of the mind of a fervent ponderer of Higurashi’s plot, someone who spends a lot of time loving the story: “What if Keiichi were to have done ____ than that? What if that happened instead of that?” He can start to foretell what left of this anime is going to be solved, assuming that there was anything left unsolved in the first place. He may also feel a little optimistic about the future and eager to find out the greater happiness this newer anime may beget than the happiness achieved at the end of season 2 - this may be the driving source of the revisitor to continue watching.While my next line of criticism I have isn't one that the creator is largely responsible for, I have to mention it. It is a problem for me that this new anime doesn't facilitate your reminiscence of June of 1983, a time long before many of us were born, by forgoing the normal artstyle: the old colorings, old anime hairstyles which bangs of great sizes were drawn in, (Rika's bangs used to be so much bigger), weird head-to-body ratio in cartoon scenes, cute cartoony Rena, and the recordings of cicadas' cries from what feels like the summer of 1983. The somewhat fuzzy and older artstyle itself seemed to testify that it came from that year. The mesmerizing sound of teeming bugs on trees varying in volume and always humming in the background made it feel like life undoubtedly exist in this world of Higurashi, a world whose main theme is so contradictory to that very idea; this sound transported you to the past, in which wildlife was actually more abundant due to less pesticides and environmental damage done by humans. One of my prime reasons for loving Higurashi was this nostalgic reminiscence, but this may not matter to most people.This Higurashi is in a newer artstyle, with refined characters, and with less sloppy artwork, but I wish they kept the same character design and art style as from Higurashi Kira... Their hair always has gloss; like, is the sun really shining from that direction? I think I am seeing gloss not only on their hair but on their cheeks as well…I highly recommend the newcomer to watch the original first and then this. The more I progress, the more this opinion gets solidified because the newcomer will miss out on some hints and turning points so subtle the newcomer would never imagine was a hint. The faster pace of this newer anime may be an advantage because the original first season felt like it was going nowhere at times due to the lack of a “solution” and the redundancy felt in season 1. Watching the original required some patience, which is not required for this new anime, but the way the original drags you into their world is of another level, which this anime can’t do with its fast-paced dialogue and the less artistic scenes for the lack of time. Indeed, the dialogue is sometimes so fast-paced (noticeable in episode 6) that I feel like I am more in a theatre watching live actors and actresses speak their lines than a motion-picture with smooth sequences.Overall, the balance isn't mastered, but will most likely be effective to produce its desired result: to entertain both newcomers and revisitors. For the moments of shock and the shivering tension pulling the newcomer to the edge of his or her seat still seems to remain in this new anime.In all categories: 8 out of 10, but when viewing it with the eyes of comparison to the original, 7 out of 10 in all categories except the semi-new plot, which I haven’t finished. sake of revisitors; and alongside the cutscenes, the usual progression of the storyline continues keeping it newer for revisitors as much as it is altered.

Higurashi isn’t some ancient artifact but it’s been nearly 15 years since its TV anime debut. Higurashi is destined to get a new anime series and is here to make a statement.The new Higurashi takes place 13 years since the last proper Higurashi anime. Originally, viewers thought the new show was a remake but soon realized that it’s actually an entirely new story. How about that? A new Higurashi with mystery thriller themes that fans have been anticipated for after all these years. Even for new fans, Higurashi demonstrates its ability to tell a suspenseful story through its complex characters...and themes. Do you want to relive the Higurashi experience again?To quite frank, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou has been somewhat of a niche show although it is popular among the visual novel community. It has even recently gained traction with its games on Steam and other gaming platforms. The anime had been planned out as a 2-cour (24 episodes) although was delayed for a full season. Helmed by studio Passione, you’ll quickly notice the visual change, especially the character designs. It’s been modified to fit more with more modern standards although the script is still handled by the one and only, Ryukishi07.Yes, it’s a brand new story so to get the obvious of the way, can you watch this show without any knowledge of the franchise? The answer is both yes and no. While it does offer a new story experience, some of the recurring plot elements would be more enjoyable if you’ve seen the previous series. The new show is divided into 5 different arcs each telling a different story although with recurring elements. We start off with the first episode reintroducing the familiar cast including the iconic Ryuugu Rena. From this arc, we learn of the Curse of Oyashiro, a prominent recurring element of the overall franchise. We also learn of suspicious circumstances of mysterious deaths and disappearances in the fictional village Hinamizawa. From this arc, viewers will experience the darker secrets of the village and how each character roles is played. There’s also memorable moments such as Rena’s infamous door scene, her iconic ‘usoda!”, or Rika’s signature miko performances. To be honest, watching this new arc felt no less different than the old Higurashi. We have the familiar mood of a normal day that takes a 180 degree turn as unsettling secrets are revealed. Furthermore, it all leads to a climatic showdown complete with blood and gore. It’s the Higurashi way of selling its product and hits the right marks with what it does.Following the sinister events of the first arc, we enter the Watanagashi-hen arc that features the prominent presence of Sonoaki Shion. In this arc, Shion is featured as an important character and plays an important role along with main protagonist Keiichi. The two develop a closer bond than ever although gets more and more complex as startling revelations begins to unravel itself. There’s also more characterization on Shion herself. In fact, it’s safe to say that Higurashi is well known for showing different sides of the main cast. Some characters desperately tries to hide their façade on the outside. For Shion’s case, she displays a level of vulnerability. And of course, you can bet that mystery plays a deep role again with the Oyashiro curse.Unfortunately for some characters, they can’t seem to escape fate or the reality of abuse. Hojou Satoko is one such example as she is victim of abuse at the hands of her own uncle. In later chapters of the season, we see how mentally broken she is due to the effects. It’s a dark reality that highlights the sensitivity of the show. Given Satoko’s age, she’s the victim of child abuse and for someone so young, experiencing trauma will likely have life-long consequences. Luckily, she has friends and they lend a willing hand to help. Keiichi in particular plays a prominent role to try and bring Satoko out of the darkness.By the time you’ve reached over half of the show and into the fourth arc, you’d have a general overall impression of this new season, right? Well, not entirely especially with how Rika’s motivation to change fate. In fact, fate itself seems to be an important theme of the show as characters try to fight against it, namely Keiichi in previous arcs. In the Nekodamashi-hen arc, we also find out Hanyuu’s role in relation to the supernatural and Rika’s connection to her. I won’t spoil it but do expect to see significant events that impact the Higurahshi franchise. In the final few episodes, there is even an entity with influence throughout the entire series. It’s especially important with everything that connects the season together and to see how far one entity goes to antagonize our beloved main cast.Higurashi is an anime with psychological and thriller elements that tells a bold story with each arc. Who would’ve thought there’s also moments for comedy? If you’re a new fan of the show, do be prepared for lighthearted moments in the form of character chemistry. Keiichi is the frequent target of jokes as the girls loves to make fun of him. Whether it’s simple card games or putting on a lewd outfit (thanks Shion), there’s room for laughs this season. But make no mistake, Higurashi didn’t make its return to humor the audience. It came back to make a statement and that is to sell horror, thriller, and psychological contents. There’s blood, gore, and psychological breakdowns. Most of this is expressed through the human reactions of the cast, sometimes with extreme level of insanity. I’m sure older fans are also pleased to see old characteristics of the cast return such as Rena and Rika. I mean, who can ever forget Rika's adorable “nipah”?And it takes a talented crew to portray the roles of the characters. I give praise especially to Rika’s VA this season for demonstrating the ability to play such a young child but also being able to quickly adapt into a more mature voice. The soundtrack and music also adds more suspense to the overall vibe of the show, something that Higurashi is infamous for doing. I sure hope you get used to the sound of cicadas because there’s plenty where that comes from.Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou may feel overwhelming at first but with each episode, it’s important to know what the anime wants you to experience. Do you want to be surprised by the plot revelations or are you interested in seeing character development? It’s at some point in the series where you need to decide on how to approach this new season. To be quite honest, Higurashi is still mostly targeted a niche audience.

I don't know if he bumped his head a little too hard or he's suffering from lockdown induced depression like all of us, but it's hard for me to believe this is the same pen that wrote the original visual novel, which I hold so so dear to my heart.Perhaps he should never touch...Higurashi ever again and focus on that other visual novel with the seagulls and murders. It's for the best. Higurashi ever again and focus on that other visual novel with the seagulls and murders. It's for the best."", 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSHigurashi Gou, or how to artificially extend a series at the expense of its themes and characters.Higurashi is an impressively expansive franchise spanning almost 2 decades with its story brought to life in numerous different types of medium; from VNs, anime, manga, live action, games, novels, audio drama, and even a stage play. I estimate, conservatively, that a fan who exhausted all installments would have invested more than at least 250 hours into the franchise. It has over the years made itself sort of a household name in anime and VN communities alike, which is all the more reason a poor sequel...detriments the fictional world to the degree it does. That\'s where Gou comes into picture, and does precisely that. It, among other things, breaks its characters, trivializes its predecessors, convolutes the extended universe by pseudo-linking it with Umineko—another behemoth that requires a huge investment to get into—effectively barring from entry (or at the very least barring from a profound understanding) anyone who hasn\'t additional 120 hours to spare, and all around wastes precious runtime with scenes that do not amount to anything meaningfulGou, onwards from Nekogoroshi-hen, skips the answer arcs and, in its haste, decides to expose whodunnit and howdunnit prematurely, and from that point everything turns south. A new character is introduced, whom I shall call Goutoko. Goutoko appears very similar to a certain character from the original series, absent any expression of genuine humanity, or sanity for that matter. Goutoko is ruthless and extremely tenacious, far more than anyone that remotely resembles a human being is capable of. In stark contrast to the girl whom she\'s assuming the position of—who was determined but vulnerable and human at nature, she has infinite mental fortitude, and therefore can proceed the plot as conveniently as she wishes to. RNG did not favor her way during her schemes? She\'ll just kill herself 3 million times until it does! After all, possibility of every non-zero chance event occurring approaches certainty as attempts go to infinity! Never mind one of the biggest plot events of the original being the limitations of one\'s mind when undergone too much suffering, Rika\'s concern that her sould will wither away if she does not prevail soon. But make no mistake, Goutoko isn\'t a snowflake like Rika is, she has the power of being based, which allows her to condemn her best friend to excruciating pains in the hellhole where she was tortured a whole lifetime. The motivation? ""She\'s kind of a meanie and I don\'t really like studying lol"" Right...A good transition from there would be the clear undoing of Satoko\'s character progression as well as a prevalent theme that existed in the original: ""That seeking help is something to be celebrated, enduring alone not to be proud of."" From Tatarigoroshi to Minagoroshi, Satoko manages to grow as a person and reach out her hand for a miracle to occur. This is a really touching moments and goes to show that, through cooperation, most hopeless of moments can be overcome. Yeah... that idea is now scrapped. Satoko becomes a little baby who cannot ask for aid. She instead wallows in self-misery, gets very spiteful, and loses her humanity somehow?? It\'s a blatant depart from the strong girl who steels her resolve and gets ahold of her future in the beautiful culmination that is Minagoroshi-hen. As someone who really appreciated Satoko\'s character, this utter disregard for pre-established characterization is intolerable to me; ergo, my choice of wording: ""Goutoko"".Since it\'s Goutoko\'s time to shine, the main villain of all the previous installment, Miyo Takano, is to naturally be stepped down. But this poses a difficult problem: Takano, whose sheer iron will and lifelong efforts has precluded Rika from besting her for countless attempts in which her conviction stayed consistent, will need to be removed from the proactive role in a sufficiently understandable manner. That... doesn\'t happen. She just conveniently happens to remember her demise in a previous fragment, finds a letter that she apparently hasn\'t came across by chance in any of those possibilities, and has a change of heart, preventing a nigh-certain occurrence. This is a gross minimization of the combined efforts of everyone we rooted for, of the flesh and blood sacrifices that\'ve been made across multiple timelines, all to ruin another character.The last of my complaints would be the many instances of scenes that seemingly don\'t contribute much to this new tale the show is trying to tell eating away precious time. These can either be Gou-original scenes like a reformed Teppei going on about his life, or scenes we\'re all too familiar with like petitioning the child welfare services for redress, debating the Onigafuchi Defense Alliance to request their aid with Satoko\'s situation, or Miyo\'s defeat and the subsequent happenstances. While it\'s not the worst thing in the world to see them unfold yet again in different artstyle, when you have a brand new story to tell, I can\'t help but feel there\'s a mismatch of priorities to divulge a lot of time to parts the viewer will be intimately familiar with, leaving the real meat of the discussion unbaked. Satsu may have a better shot in that respect, but the damage is incurred.\'Higurashi: When They Cry - Gou\' is a huge blemish in the franchise, throwing the hard-earned lessons of the past to trash and resetting its characters to build them from scratch, it does a disservice to the fans of the original who\'d rather keep their fan favorites intact, and their stories not trampled upon. detriments the fictional world to the degree it does. That\'s where Gou comes into picture, and does precisely that. It, among other things, breaks its characters, trivializes its predecessors, convolutes the extended universe by pseudo-linking it with Umineko—another behemoth that requires a huge investment to get into—effectively barring from entry (or at the very least barring from a profound understanding) anyone who hasn\'t additional 120 hours to spare, and all around wastes precious runtime with scenes that do not amount to anything meaningfulGou, onwards from Nekogoroshi-hen, skips the answer arcs and, in its haste, decides to expose whodunnit and howdunnit prematurely, and from that point everything turns south. A new character is introduced, whom I shall call Goutoko. Goutoko appears very similar to a certain character from the original series, absent any expression of genuine humanity, or sanity for that matter. Goutoko is ruthless and extremely tenacious, far more than anyone that remotely resembles a human being is capable of. In stark contrast to the girl whom she\'s assuming the position of—who was determined but vulnerable and human at nature, she has infinite mental fortitude, and therefore can proceed the plot as conveniently as she wishes to. RNG did not favor her way during her schemes? She\'ll just kill herself 3 million times until it does! After all, possibility of every non-zero chance event occurring approaches certainty as attempts go to infinity! Never mind one of the biggest plot events of the original being the limitations of one\'s mind when undergone too much suffering, Rika\'s concern that her sould will wither away if she does not prevail soon. But make no mistake, Goutoko isn\'t a snowflake like Rika is, she has the power of being based, which allows her to condemn her best friend to excruciating pains in the hellhole where she was tortured a whole lifetime. The motivation? ""She\'s kind of a meanie and I don\'t really like studying lol"" Right...A good transition from there would be the clear undoing of Satoko\'s character progression as well as a prevalent theme that existed in the original: ""That seeking help is something to be celebrated, enduring alone not to be proud of."" From Tatarigoroshi to Minagoroshi, Satoko manages to grow as a person and reach out her hand for a miracle to occur. This is a really touching moments and goes to show that, through cooperation, most hopeless of moments can be overcome. Yeah... that idea is now scrapped. Satoko becomes a little baby who cannot ask for aid. She instead wallows in self-misery, gets very spiteful, and loses her humanity somehow?? It\'s a blatant depart from the strong girl who steels her resolve and gets ahold of her future in the beautiful culmination that is Minagoroshi-hen. As someone who really appreciated Satoko\'s character, this utter disregard for pre-established characterization is intolerable to me; ergo, my choice of wording: ""Goutoko"".Since it\'s Goutoko\'s time to shine, the main villain of all the previous installment, Miyo Takano, is to naturally be stepped down. But this poses a difficult problem: Takano, whose sheer iron will and lifelong efforts has precluded Rika from besting her for countless attempts in which her conviction stayed consistent, will need to be removed from the proactive role in a sufficiently understandable manner. That... doesn\'t happen. She just conveniently happens to remember her demise in a previous fragment, finds a letter that she apparently hasn\'t came across by chance in any of those possibilities, and has a change of heart, preventing a nigh-certain occurrence. This is a gross minimization of the combined efforts of everyone we rooted for, of the flesh and blood sacrifices that\'ve been made across multiple timelines, all to ruin another character.The last of my complaints would be the many instances of scenes that seemingly don\'t contribute much to this new tale the show is trying to tell eating away precious time. These can either be Gou-original scenes like a reformed Teppei going on about his life, or scenes we\'re all too familiar with like petitioning the child welfare services for redress, debating the Onigafuchi Defense Alliance to request their aid with Satoko\'s situation, or Miyo\'s defeat and the subsequent happenstances.

It\'s a relatable story about the need to move on and live for yourself that\'s roughly the opposite (but not mutually exclusive) of what the original Higurashi anime is all about.The horror and mystery of the original Higurashi is still very much present in this series. It\'s a slow burn during the first half - especially for Higurashi veterans - for a reason, but the payoff for said slow burn was VERY much worth it.Art: 8/10This time around, Higurashi Gou is animated by Studio Passione rather than Studio Deen. The art style is much more clean and ""shiny"" compared to the original, which some fans of the original will enjoy and some won\'t. Ironically, the character-model inconsistency in the original Higurashi was a strength as it gave an element of ""distorted horror"", especially with facial expressions; as a result, Higurashi Gou lacks that distorted horror element of the original series.I personally find this completely understandable for Gou because questioning reality was a key part of the viewer experience as it relates to the mystery of Hinamizawa Syndrome and empathizing with its victims in the original Higurashi; Gou assumes that you are a returning viewer who\'s fully aware of its nature.However, that\'s not to say that Gou doesn\'t do a good job of conveying its own brand of horror through its art. Its more realistic and fluid animation compared to the original makes the murder scenes hit much harder, and, without spoiling anything, one particularly fluid piece of animation in the first half of Gou has an amazingly horrific payoff around episode 14 (not the exact episode to avoid spoilers).On a final note, the OP and ED are absolutely stellar, the OP being my favorite of all the Higurashi OP\'s.Sound: 7/10The sound is what I\'d consider the weakest part of Gou. There\'s nothing exceptional or lackluster about it; the background music and silence compliment their respective scenes well, but nowhere near as well as the melancholic and spine-chilling BGM that made the original Higurashi such a well-known classic.With that said, the music for the OP and ED is absolutely amazing and, rather than spine-chilling horror, conveys high-tension desperation more along the lines of ""why do I hear boss music?"" Shikura Chiyomaru completely blew it out of the park.Characters: 9/10There really isn\'t much for me to say here. The characters are the same as they were in the original Higurashi; if you liked them then, you\'ll like them here.Enjoyment: 10/10As someone who\'s into good mysteries, I can confidently say that I\'m enjoying this anime more than any other anime currently airing this season, which is saying something since this season is stacked with amazing and understandably hyped anime like Re: Zero and Attack on Titan. With that said, if you aren\'t into detail-oriented mystery, graphically symbolic horror, or any of Ryukishi\'s previous works, you most likely will not like this anime. However, if you fit into any of these and have watched the original Higurashi, please give Higurashi Gou a shot.EDIT: Just another note.

I would have liked that to be honest. But this is actually a sequel, which kinda makes things…. Not work as well. Long story short, I enjoyed this a bit, but there are some big issues that would make me tell you to avoid watching this if you are a fan of the Higurashi series, since this may ultimately ruin it for you.Seeing as I\'m telling you it\'s a sequel, I\'m hoping anyone that hasn\'t watched the original will stop reading by now (I do recommend you to watch the original...if you want to watch a really good horror series).So we all know how this series works, so if I\'m telling you this is a sequel, yet it was being confused for a remake, we can all figure out what happened. For one reason or another, Rika is going through these loops again (this is made clear very early on, and is as much as I will outright \'spoil\', don\'t worry). As I said before, I still enjoyed it a bit for what it was. Being able to enjoy higurashi again was nice for a bit. But why? Why is this happening? How was this able to happen? We had a pretty good resolution to the story, and forcing it to happen again doesn\'t really make sense to me. I will say, the actual story this time (which more or less starts 2/3 into the season) is different to before. However, I also feel as though it ruined many of the characters. As an addition to the series, this doesn\'t work too well. It only really ruins the series. If this would have actually just been a remake, it would have been nice. Bit unnecessary, but still nice. Instead we have a weird mix of sort of remake and sort of sequel for the first two-thirds of the show, and then an odd choice of actual outright ""sequel"" material for the last third.So should you watch this? Well… Maybe? But probably not. Though I was able to enjoy the beginning of it for \'nostalgia\' (I\'ve only been watching anime for 2 years but still), if you want to go through some nostalgia, then just rewatch the original series. This doesn\'t seem to provide any actual benefit, and just ruins certain characters. Don\'t get me wrong though, if you don\'t completely mind, you may be able to think of this as an alternative path (that still requires knowledge of the originals), and this could provide some decent entertainment, as I got. But realistically, this is probably something to pass on. if you want to watch a really good horror series).So we all know how this series works, so if I\'m telling you this is a sequel, yet it was being confused for a remake, we can all figure out what happened.

But realistically, this is probably something to pass on.', 'This ""3rd season"" per se, is a long shot from its previous entries. My main concerns is its presentation although the story does have its problem in comparison to the original too.Story(6)More or less covering the same arcs as in the first season almost verbatim but with slight changes here or there. Maybe a different character does a thing slightly differently for the fanbase to theorize obsessivley over as to what it means, but so far, only the ending to each arc changes where a different character does the killing. I\'ve seen people say ""its good for both newcomers and OG viewers"" but at most...I would think new viewers will think the story is fine while OG viewers will be bored by the same story and off put by the visual/audio presentation. The OG had amazing direction that allowed the story to be told through visuals, but gou always either comes off as too flat or too tacky with its direction. Somewhat of an uncanny valley area where they didn\'t commit enough to the intensity so as to just look awkward.Art(3)FLAT. Artwork is too bright and makes everything look really flat. Hinamizawa has never looked more boring and the character designs are a mixed bag of mostly really bad, to a few characters who dont look half bad in this style(lookin at you Chie). Keicchi\'s design drives me insane. He looks way too babyish and his jacket is shit, I miss assault jacket keicchi... I think the arts biggest problem is that its just too clean. Clean artwork in most cases means animators take next to no risks trying to do something interesting and just try to make a servicable product, which this comes off as, a product. say what you want about even the first season, there was a lot of visual stylistic flourishes in those 2 seasons that made them the cult classics they are today unlike gou which will definitely deminish the shows rep imo.Sound(4)Voices are wierdly obnoxious in this. even though its the same voice actors(JAP), they are way too shouty for a lot of it(mainly keicchi). Also the characters quirks through dialog like rikas nipahs or satokos laugh are abused to hell and back as if to say that is the entirety of their character Renas voice is probably the standout performance. she does a solid job and still feels like Rena.The ost isnt noteworthy, like the OG i guess, but the OP and ED are letdowns being kind of generic ""horror/thriller"" anime songs but some may like it. The first 2 OPS and the 2nd ED of the OG series are all legendary imo.Characters(3)I feel like the characters personalities are all stripped down signicantly in gou. Keicchi seems like a purely reactive character who can\'t do anything unless someone tells him to, taking away the moments where people recognise him as K is a diservice to my boi. He really is the character that gets the worst treatment in all of gou. All the other characters have there most obvious quirks inflated and abused, take Shion for example. She has serious anger issues in this and is constantly flipping her shit at any moments notice, while in OG, she would get pissed but her personality would actually fluctuate like a normal human being rather that just going from blissfully happy to batshit angry the next moment. Most side characters are insanely flat and one-note.Also fuck that cat mouth thing they keep doing with all the characters, it is hideous as fuck and only serves to distract at every moment.Overall, Gou is kind of a pointless entry as far as a I see it, a merchandising cash cow even, shoving as many recognisable elements from the orginal with reckless abandon just to make us go ""duh, I remember that, duh, I cant wait to get that Rika in a septic tank figurine"". As far as Im concerned, Higurashi finished with the OVA\'s after the second season. If they wanted this to be a continuation, they should have maybe written one or two completely new scenarios for the characters seeing as they can be endless with Rikas whole situation.

I\'m using ""sequel"" in quotations because this was a completely unnecessary anime. The original Higurashi ended just fine, we had a satisfying conclusion, so, I\'d like to know, who asked for a new season with a plot this downright stupid compared to the source material? I\'m not sure what counts as a spoiler and what doesn\'t so I won\'t get into it, but other reviews do a better job of summarizing the plot. The art is okay, not the best, not the worst (though it has a large amount of gore compared to Studio Deen\'s adaptation for absolutely no reason other than shock value) and the soundtrack is pretty mediocre, but these two are the least of Gou\'s problems.I do not recommend this to fans of Higurashi, it feels like a very cheap cash grab, meant to just milk money out of the fans of this franchise (and a majority of fans seem happy with this blatant fact) and not something written out of passion and love for the When They Cry universe.

And with that in mind let's start this review.Higurashi no Naku Koro ni gou(referred to as gou) is your average harem with one dude in a school with 4 of his female friends. 1 tsundere, 1 girl overly obsessed with cute things(questionable definition of cute) and two lol... I mean young girls. How could thins show ever be interesting in the mountain of the harem that comes out every season, right?WRONGThis show is anything but...cute, well there are some cute moments and all, but the main themes are never lost, which is of suspicion and fear of everyone. gou is a remake, or a better word would be reimagination, or a sequel(basically it does not follow the same story or outcomes) of the original Higurashi series which has 2 seasons and the 3rd season of 5 episodes, back in the 2010s. This show can be watched by new viewers, but I think it is more fun to watch it after watching the original series as some events occur earlier then the original and the ending are completely different from the original series.STORY-9(spoilers)Gou is a show which takes place in the small town of Hinamizawa, which is a mysterious town in which every year on the cotton drifting festival, 1 person dies and 1 disappears, the protagonist Maebara Keiichi moves to hinamizawa from the town due to undisclosed reasons, where he meets 4 girls and becomes friends with them. All seems fun and happy, till the cotton drifting festival, where the shit goes down. And it goes down like hell, with various unprecedented situations occurring one after the other with no apparent reason. I really like the story of Higurashi which is not too much of horror(I am not very good with horror), but more phycological and suspenseful, so you should definitely give it a try.ART-8I find the art to be better than that of the original series, not sure if this is my personal opinion cause I like newer animations. the character designs are done so well that they can adapt both for the cuteness of the characters as well as the scary faces and expressions.SOUND-8The sound seems better and more diverse as compared to the original series, with perfect timing for the serious scenes and the fun scenes and a good cut for when they get serious. The series is much scarier with the changing sounds and silence.CHARACTERS-9There is no point in talking about the characters since that would ruin the fun, so rather just expect unique character traits.ENJOYMENT-9I am really enjoying Gou and can't wait to see how this series changes and grows from the original series.OVERALL-9Whether you are a newbie or an old viewer of Higurashi, you should expect some good scares and chills up your spine, cause this is a show that will make you look out your window to see that no one is spying on you. cute, well there are some cute moments and all, but the main themes are never lost, which is of suspicion and fear of everyone. gou is a remake, or a better word would be reimagination, or a sequel(basically it does not follow the same story or outcomes) of the original Higurashi series which has 2 seasons and the 3rd season of 5 episodes, back in the 2010s.

However, in its attempt to please both audiences, it fails at doing both. I would instead recommend that any newcomers go and watch the 2006 anime, and only watch this one if you have a strong desire to see everything you liked about the old one get ruined.The animation is not bad on its own. However, Higurashi is about horror and mystery, so the bright colors and moe character designs fit poorly here. There are also some scenes that could have had...better direction, such as the ""uso da"" scene (compared to the original 2006 anime). Other scenes made poor use of lighting (the inside of the shed in Watadamashi was too dark) or just left some things to be desired, but those are just minor nitpicks.The soundtrack is actually lifted straight from the original anime, so it fit well with most scenes. Although I do enjoy the new OP and ED songs, I don\'t think they fit Higurashi as well as the original ones, but they are good to listen to on their own.Now with the good parts out of the way, let\'s dive into the absolute trainwreck of its story.The first episode is almost a shot for shot remake of the first episode of the original series, and if the rest of the season had played out this way, I think Gou would have done quite well. But starting with the second episode, there was an immediate divide in the fanbase, and that divide only became stronger with each passing episode. We learn that the story takes place AFTER the original had already ended. So it cannot be a remake -- it is truly a sequel taking place after the events of the original anime, which goes against all of the marketing material leading up to this moment. A major plot twist (from the SECOND season) of the original anime is also revealed immediately, which is fine if the story is a sequel. But again, this was advertised as a remake, and so now anyone who watches this anime BEFORE going back to the old one is going to have the original experience ruined.The 2006 anime was a story of horror and mystery, so spoiling a major plot twist does significant damage to the overall experience. Unfortunately throughout the season, Gou continues to spoil these major plot elements, but without giving them enough context for anyone new to the series to actually appreciate (without going back to watch the old series). So Gou is not enjoyable because you don\'t know enough, but the original is no longer enjoyable because you know too much. That is primarily why I can\'t recommend any newcomers to watch this anime.So how does Gou\'s story hold up to viewers who have seen the original anime? Well if you were expecting Gou to be anything like the original, you would be mistaken. There is not much horror or mystery here, and what is present is done so poorly that it can\'t ever be taken seriously -- a fight scene early on results in massive pools of blood that make JJBA\'s blood splatter look realistic. There are so many contrived plot conveniences that I can\'t even list them all here.The first half of Gou is a pseudo retelling of each arc of the original anime, with a few subtle differences and then a big spin on each ending. Unfortunately, these twists make the arcs significantly worse from the viewer\'s perspective. The underlying themes and messages of each arc are destroyed in favor of creating a ""mystery"" to try and solve. Who is behind these changes, how are they doing it, and why? Although each arc was once an engaging and thrilling story in their own rights, for veteran fans it is mostly stuff we\'ve seen before but with a worse ending. So the whole experience is painfully slow and boring to watch.The second half of Gou is actually new content, but it completely ruins everything that came before it. It spends much of its time giving away the answers to the questions from the first half, but those answers are incredibly disappointing. They also contradict the themes of the original story: ""trust your friends and work together to overcome fate"". It\'s likely that was an intentional subversion of the theme (because Ryukishi likes to do that kind of thing) but I think it ruins what was otherwise an incredible story with a positive message. What exactly is the message of Gou? ""Nothing is sacred?""What really bothers me about all this is the fact that everything is so shallow. The first half only exists because of the second half, which doesn\'t really need to exist at all. The original story was resolved, but suddenly people start acting out of character to cause really petty drama which results in a re-telling of the original story... I just don\'t understand the point of the show. Who are we supposed to be cheering for? It seems like the point of the story is to find a way to end the story, which is kind of a silly story to start telling in the first place. It all seems like a waste of time.I know that when Ryukishi wrote visual novels, the pacing was always terrible, but I guess this is that kind of thing in anime form. Scenes are unnecessarily long and most of the time show you things you already know. Much of Gou\'s time is spent re-telling parts of the original series, so it seems like not only a waste of time but also the animation studio\'s money and efforts. If you\'re going to have 24 episodes, there was plenty of content that could have been animated instead. Creating new arcs like the ones only briefly shown in Nekodamashi were more interesting and could have actually entertained both old and new fans. Or focus on the St. Lucia school and actually expand more on that setting and its characters. Almost anything could have been better than how Gou actually turned out.The characters in the original story were all deeply expanded upon and relatable, but in Gou they are all extreme caricatures or just forgotten as the plot demands it. The antagonist\'s motivation is so childish and petty that it\'s not just unbelievable but also totally out of character. The way they go about causing mayhem is also horribly contrived, and while technically it is feasible for someone to pull off, it is massively out of character for that particular person. The culprit is not a human, but an exaggerated caricature who can plan and pull off crazy tricks like something out of Tom & Jerry.It was also painfully obvious from the second episode that most of the story is only happening to ""connect the dots"" between Higurashi and Umineko. This was so obvious that I can\'t consider that to be any part of the mystery. It also seems like every aspect of the plot is trying to force this end result to happen, rather than organically occur based on the characters\' original personalities. As much as I like Umineko, I don\'t think it was worth destroying Higurashi to make this happen. Or at least, it could have been done in a better way.The final episode of the season resolves nothing, and we must wait for Sotsu (the next season) to air before we get an actual conclusion to this disaster of a story. I will still probably watch it because I want to see where this goes, with a small bit of hope that maybe this story can be saved somehow, but I\'m not getting too excited, either. better direction, such as the ""uso da"" scene (compared to the original 2006 anime).

Surprised it isn't, classic Ryukishi07 trolling his audience.Higurashi Naku Koro ni Gou is certainly a sequel as it presents the arcs in a similar structure that parallels with the earlier arcs from the original Higurashi. This could work as entry Higurashi for new watchers, but the problem is they showed supernatural powers or scenes earlier on, as opposed to Original Higurashi, which was only revealed later. Watching or reading earlier arcs of Higurashi, we're supposed to think as a mystery horror. But since supernatural...powers were revealed earlier in Higurashi Gou, people will think through supernatural and real perspectives to deduce what is going on. The ending arc of this new Higurashi pretty much gives us the background of what is going on, why Rika is repeating the loops almost the same as her experiences back in the original  Higurashi, even if she did something to prevent the tragedies. So if you feel like your not getting something new, bear with it and go watch it till the ending arc, there's something new there. I like the Higurashi series, so I hope this new entry to the Higurashi series will be worthwhile.The studio working with this new Higurashi is studio Passione, which is known for animating ecchi shows like High School DxD Hero and Interspecies Ishuzoku Reviewers. Akio Watanabe did the character designs. He is known for the Monogatari and Grisaia series character designs. For me, I'm not used to its too moe design and shiny palette to the characters of Higurashi anime. The lighting is a hit and miss. Mostly a miss, when they do a dark scene. When it's dark, it's certainly dark, you can barely see, which to me is not a problem back in the original Higurashi anime.The iconic Cicadas sounds are still present, it gives me a nostalgic feeling. As opposed to the original Higurashi or the prequel, Higurashi Gou has less of an eerie atmosphere and is more lenient to Slice of Life.  It's not a bad thing, but if you're expecting more of a tense feeling similar to the Original Higurashi, you'll only get enough to shiver. The OP and ED are good in their way, they are upbeat but still gives a tense feeling, compare to Original Higurashi OP and ED, which are mellow and eerie.Higurashi Naku Koro ni  is one of those prime examples of anime that is successful horror anime done right. It could frighten you or at least give you a suspense feeling. Hopefully, the sequel will give us satisfying answer arcs and be as a successful piece of entertainment as its prequel. powers were revealed earlier in Higurashi Gou, people will think through supernatural and real perspectives to deduce what is going on.

I\'m not very accustomed to write in english, but I did my best. Also, this review may contain some minor spoilers, but I did my best to not spoil anything great.Oh man, I didn’t wanted to do the review that I’m about to do, but I feel compelled to do one as a longtime fan of the When They Cry series (both Higurashi and Umineko).Where should I start? Well, I\'ll start with what I think is perhaps the main reason for this low score. First of all, what is the central message, the main theme of the original...series? Is the violence? The gore? The horror? Nope. The main theme of the original series has always been and always will be: friendship, trust, hope and a desperate struggle against a terrible fate. And now I’ll question: What is the central message of Higurashi Gou? Higurashi Gou (despite having a complexity even worthy of the When They Cry series) is a empty anime. It seems that Ryukishi07 didn’t know how to get the  essence of his own work, because Higurashi Gou is anythig, except Higurashi. (He was so lost that he said the series was a ""newcomer friendly"", yeah of course, the 4th season of something will be very “newcomer friendly”, ONLY in your head Ryukishi...)Second problem: What need was there for a sequel after Higurashi Rei? The story was already well closed with only 1 loose end that could be resolved in only 1 OVA. Still it was decided to do an unnecessary sequel that all it did was step on the legacy of the original. Practically nothing that made Higurashi a masterpiece is present in Gou.These were just general problems, but there are more specific ones like: Many of the scenes that apparently do not make sense to an experienced fan of the series are explainable, except, for example, of Keiichi breaking down the prison door and Ooishi using cheat and unlocking infinite ammo. Another thing that doesn\'t make sense is the motivation of the main villain of Gou. While in the original the main villain had an excellent motivation to do what (s)he does, in Gou the motivation of the new villain is very, very weak.Now that I got to this subject, let\'s talk about characters. And once again Ryukishi lost his touch (I\'m starting to lose my faith in you man). The characters in Gou are nothing more than a shallow, stereotyped version of themselves. Let\'s look at the main characters:Rena:Original: Character with several emotional problems and internal discussions, and therefore, despite her cute exterior, she can be extremely unstable; it is very smart.Gou: “kyuute mode” + bipolarity (as her internal conflicts are not shown).Keiichi:Original: An idiot, but with a good heart, determined to help his friends and not to stop fighting until the end to save them. He has his moments of intelligence.Gou: An idiot, indecisive (always needs the attitude of some other character to take the initiative), dumb and shallow.Rika:Original: Extremely complex character and with attitudes and personality extremely compatible with everything she went through.Gou: Complex character, but with extremely incompatible attitudes towards everything she went through.Satoko:Original: Interesting character, cute, emotionally strong after everything she went through, very attached to Keiichi, Shion and Rika.Gou: Quite complex, but... traps everywhere, attitudes incompatible with what she went through, fanatic for Rika.Mion:Original: Epic character, she is the glue, the conscience of the group, the most reliable character, puts herself at risk without even thinking twice for the sake of her friends.Gou: Character shallow and left out (there was only one moment that made us remember how important she is).Shion:Original: Very complex and well crafted character, one of the best characters in the series.Gou: ????? Totally forgotten.The direction of Higurashi Gou is also very lost, many of the moments of tension and horror have totally lost their impact (compare the scenes of the ""usoda"").The art itself I really liked, but the direction fails so much in some scenes that end up turning suspense into involuntary comedy (hi Akasaka).Good soundtrack, it\'s nowhere near the level of the VN or even Deen\'s adaptation, but the opening and ending songs are good.Enjoyment: Would you enjoy yourself watching one of your favorite works being ruined? Yeah, me neither. I will now read the VN or the manga again to detox from Gou. Higurashi Gou doesn\'t exist (just like Umineko\'s anime), Higurashi\'s anime ends in Rei. Go watch Deen\'s adaptation, read the manga or VN (preferably the latter two), run away from Gou with all your might. series? Is the violence? The gore? The horror? Nope.

For most people, the standard was the original Deen anime from 2006-2007, and for a sequel to not even begin to reach the quality of that, let alone the original VN, is… well… maybe it just shouldn’t have been made in the first place.Gou is unique in that, if you’ve consumed any Higurashi content before it, it will actively hinder your experience while watching it. Yes, you will have a worse time watching a sequel if you\'ve...already watched the original. I am not joking. A massive reason for this is the fact that half of Higurashi Gou is glorified recap; the first three arcs are adapted straight from the 2002 VN with detailed differences and a changed conclusion to serve the new narrative. This is why, if you’ve consumed Higurashi in any shape or form before this, it’ll likely bore you half to death. The episodes add absolutely nothing of value to the characters and even trivialize their arc and development from the original, making them somehow less of a character. These arcs only exist to serve the new narrative and to make sure newcomers aren’t too confused… which is so… completely backward.Promotional material is mostly harmless; it’s literally just advertising, and that’s what it should be. I can’t decide whether I love the trailer for Gou or detest it. On one hand, it was a decently funny bait-and-switch, advertising the show as a remake of a beloved VN to then be revealed as a sequel in episode 2, and on the other hand, it would’ve been much better as a remake. This isn’t even mentioning the swarm of first-timers to the series starting off with Gou, partially due to the fact that the original Higurashi has become rather hard to watch legally. The original Higurashi Deen anime was… good, I guess, but to say it was totally faithful to the original and used its time wisely is just wrong. I was so hyped for a remake because of this, so you can imagine my dismay when I found out it wasn’t.Shock factor in place of depth and horror.If you’ve ever seen the original, I should hope that you came to the conclusion that the “horror” of it came from the artistically crafted plot and impactful death scenes. Taking the beginning of the original VN as an example, it starts with an ambiguous, repetitive bashing sound over Keiichi’s inner monologue as he commits an atrocity we have yet to see. It’s insightful, it’s mysterious, and most of all, it’s impactful. Then we come to Gou, which throws all meaning out the window and replaces it with unsettling images and sounds. Sure, it’s more in line with the traditional idea of “horror = scary,” but it’s such a poor choice considering the themes of the original. I’m not even saying it did the unsettling images and sounds particularly well either; they’re not thought out or even scary, really. Most of the death scenes result in the entire room they\'re in being absolutely covered in blood, no matter what weapon they’re using, and even ignoring the blood, everything from the characters to the animation falls in line with your typical slasher, rather than the psychological horror it’s supposed to be. And that’s the one thing anime does incredibly poorly; slashers succeed in scaring their audience due to it being live action and therefore relatable to an extent. Anime can’t do that, for obvious reasons.It’s just not scary. In any sense of the word.I honestly feel bad for the voice actors, who continuously put up a stellar performance no matter the quality of the Higurashi content they’re featured in. They’re one of the shining stars that I got from scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of compliments to give the show. It’s astonishing how they can put up this good of a performance even after 14 years of voice acting for the franchise, and I have endless praise for all of them. Though when it comes to the new coat of paint the sequel got, I’m not so kind. I really, really thought about this, and I prefer the original art and animation. Intentional or not, the bad art and questionable animation definitively set a tone that matched the narrative of the show. Gou’s just feels so bland and basic; it doesn’t change to match specific tones presented by the plot, nor is it good (This does NOT include the EDs, which were amazing). It’s “good,” don’t get me wrong, but that’s all I can give it, and it links back into my argument about the lack of depth the show has, and I think the animation is a rather nit-picky example of that.I’ve held off talking about the main issue of the first season so far, which is undoubtedly the story and pacing. The pacing is so incredibly inconsistent in the worst places. Take, for example, the first 13 episodes. I know I’ve mentioned them a lot, but I cannot stress enough just how bad they are, and I will keep talking about them until I’ve convinced you. As I said before: “half of Higurashi Gou is glorified recap.” This by itself isn’t a bad thing; however, none of it is cut. Despite being a sequel, it goes out of its way to explain almost every single thing we should already know by this point. And as a result, it just feels like you’re watching the original Deen anime again. This isn’t even contained to the first 13 episodes; parts of Sotsu and later in Gou we get Matsuribayashi-hen recap when plot should be taking place.In a post-episode 13 world, the plot does actually happen, and the story makes meaningful progress for the first time in 4 hours. It arguably gets worse. The pacing goes into overdrive to the point where major character development is cut down into 4 episodes. It gets worse. Out of those 4 episodes, only roughly 2 of them (2 halves of 2 episodes put together and 1 good episode) have any meaning, while the others are relegated to padding and murder scenes. The murder scenes in particular could’ve been done well; all they would need to do is portray Rika’s active thought processes and mental deterioration in a meaningful way as she was being killed, but all they gave us were a few lines of dialogue from her each scene, most of them being completely irrelevant.Funnily enough, Gou’s peak was when it was acting as it was meant to be from the start, a sequel to the original. The main characters get nice development, and the story that ended from the original is directly continued.The second half of the arc is where the actual answers are revealed to us, and most importantly, we get to see one of the best characters from the original go down a dark spiral called bad writing. Some of the decisions made here are so bad and frankly disrespectful that I couldn’t take any of them seriously. It also clearly shows that the writer has no understanding of human emotion, with many events that should’ve at least put a strain on the main character\'s mental state just further fueled their questionable motivation for their even more questionable goal.Now I have no doubt that the higher-ups at studio Passione had some influence in how this was written. Considering the general outside perspective of Higurashi, especially the anime, being along the lines of a murder-thriller with lots of gore and violence, they likely pushed the people actually making the show in that direction because they thought it would make a decent profit.Overall, this show is really bad; I hate it from the bottom of my heart, and nothing is likely to change that.Remember: It’s not canon if you don’t like it; just forget it existed and move on with your life. - Me, when this first aired."" already watched the original. I am not joking. A massive reason for this is the fact that half of Higurashi Gou is glorified recap; the first three arcs are adapted straight from the 2002 VN with detailed differences and a changed conclusion to serve the new narrative. This is why, if you’ve consumed Higurashi in any shape or form before this, it’ll likely bore you half to death. The episodes add absolutely nothing of value to the characters and even trivialize their arc and development from the original, making them somehow less of a character. These arcs only exist to serve the new narrative and to make sure newcomers aren’t too confused… which is so… completely backward.Promotional material is mostly harmless; it’s literally just advertising, and that’s what it should be. I can’t decide whether I love the trailer for Gou or detest it. On one hand, it was a decently funny bait-and-switch, advertising the show as a remake of a beloved VN to then be revealed as a sequel in episode 2, and on the other hand, it would’ve been much better as a remake. This isn’t even mentioning the swarm of first-timers to the series starting off with Gou, partially due to the fact that the original Higurashi has become rather hard to watch legally. The original Higurashi Deen anime was… good, I guess, but to say it was totally faithful to the original and used its time wisely is just wrong. I was so hyped for a remake because of this, so you can imagine my dismay when I found out it wasn’t.Shock factor in place of depth and horror.If you’ve ever seen the original, I should hope that you came to the conclusion that the “horror” of it came from the artistically crafted plot and impactful death scenes. Taking the beginning of the original VN as an example, it starts with an ambiguous, repetitive bashing sound over Keiichi’s inner monologue as he commits an atrocity we have yet to see. It’s insightful, it’s mysterious, and most of all, it’s impactful. Then we come to Gou, which throws all meaning out the window and replaces it with unsettling images and sounds. Sure, it’s more in line with the traditional idea of “horror = scary,” but it’s such a poor choice considering the themes of the original. I’m not even saying it did the unsettling images and sounds particularly well either; they’re not thought out or even scary, really. Most of the death scenes result in the entire room they\'re in being absolutely covered in blood, no matter what weapon they’re using, and even ignoring the blood, everything from the characters to the animation falls in line with your typical slasher, rather than the psychological horror it’s supposed to be. And that’s the one thing anime does incredibly poorly; slashers succeed in scaring their audience due to it being live action and therefore relatable to an extent. Anime can’t do that, for obvious reasons.It’s just not scary. In any sense of the word.I honestly feel bad for the voice actors, who continuously put up a stellar performance no matter the quality of the Higurashi content they’re featured in.

The last two episodes of the arcs try to compile both its counterpart from the 2nd season AND the counterpart from the first season. Or so it seems? In reality, it tries to accentuate what this season is trying to say, but I won't spoil it. When I think of Gou as a sequel, it makes sense.

The other sounds are also great, no complains here, so 10/10.CHARACTER: I get it: it's a remake, so they shouldn't get too much into the characters.

Higurashi Gou is an offense to both the legacy that its predecessors have created, as well as a stain on the otherwise amazing track record of Ryukishi07.As a sequel, it retroactively detracts from many elements of Higurashi, and also undermines the respectability of characters from both it and Umineko as well. Considering how as a standalone anime this show would be even more of an utter mess, it is not only fair to measure it up...against the stories from which it attempts to associate itself with, but necessary, as this show presents itself as an heir to them.The story exists only for its own sake, switching between sloppy and rushed remakes of original arcs with a wacky twist, to inventing new conflicts that are fundamentally flawed. These new conflicts are not even given enough screen time to pan out, as the show decides to leave a cliffhanger for another season to resolve the only new conflict they created, despite feeling they had the time to have completely unnecessary episodes about the most unrelated events, such as an entire episode devoted to everyone's favorite character, Satoko's Uncle, literally right before the final episode of the season. Another instance of this is how many more episodes than were needed were devoted to the arc revolving around the protest to help Satoko. This was followed by an entire episode of loli gore porn because the pacing of the show needed to pick up so they just compiled as many deaths as they could into a 20 minute timeframe. I've never seen an anime somehow simultaneously suffer from the need for more time to explain things and from having so much time that they waste it, but somehow Gou manages to do both.The art and sound is decent, recycling only a fraction of the original Higurashi's amazing score, while using the Monogatari style moe blobs that some people might enjoy but to me feels completely out of place in HigurashiThe characters are probably the worst aspect of Higurashi Gou, and I'm saying this as a huge fan of both Higurashi and Umineko. It's one thing to take characters who act/think one way and have them do something uncharacteristic or unrealistic to their characterization(as this show also does). But its another thing to have them do 180 degree character flips and become psychopathic yanderes who would rather horrifically torture their closest friend. It takes a special kind of ineptitude to make murdering friends in Higurashi seem out of place, yet Gou manages to do so. I'll try to stay away from too many spoilers, so to explain it, a character feels spited by the growing distance between themselves and Rika (that they partially imposed on themselves). This spite eventually leads them to brutally torture and kill Rika over and over, despite learning about Rika's decades of torment in Hinamizawa and gaining the ability to loop as well. Instead of using the newfound looping abilities to repair their friendship, the person decides the best way to fix it is to become the very nightmare that they know Rika has tried so desperately to escape. The goal? Make Rika like them and stay in Hinamizawa. Ah yes, by becoming the thing they hate, that will make Rika want to stay with them. This person is under no effects of Hinamizawa syndrome or any other capacity reducing phenomena, and decides of their own free will to kill Rika. They've already displayed that they are smart enough to resolve the problem by cheating on tests to stay in the same class, or by simply not refusing to hang out with Rika when invited to. But no, they become certain they have to kill Rika because someone has to kill Rika for the plot to exist. To make matters worse. other characters like Rena, Shion, Keiichi, ect, are completely sidelined and given no focus whatsoever, their only appearance on screen is to allow them to give one of their classic quotable lines and maybe a few shots of fanservice and nostalgia baiting.Needless to say, my enjoyment of Higurashi Gou was not very high. And to be honest, I'm surprised there are some Higurashi fans that actually enjoyed this trainwreck. I want to believe that they would probably be the very type of Goat people that the writer criticizes in their work, however the fact that Ryukishi himself wrote this deeply concerns me.

The show to compare this to is not Higurashi, but Higurashi Kai.Higurashi Gou at first looks like a remake, but it becomes apparent by the end of the first episode that something's off, and by the second that it's a sequel to the events of Kai. As a result, this affects not just the content of the story, but the tone. For those of you who have forgotten or have not seen the original, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is largely a Horror/Suspense show with a...mystery brewing in the background that doesn't really come to the forefront until the end. Kai, on the other hand, is a Mystery/Thriller story that uses the original as an argument for WHY you should be worried for the characters--the horror is largely abandoned in favor of identifying the culprit and surviving the scenario.While Gou does attempt to capture some of the horror of its first season, the structure and characterization clearly leans more towards the Mystery/Thriller tone of the second season. More of the run time is dedicated to asking questions than exploring or exploiting the paranoia of its characters. This is fine if you go into it expecting a mystery, but I feel like many people, newcomers especially, went into the show expecting horror. That said, as a mystery, Gou still has the excellent levels of polish and intrigue that I've come to expect from the author.Of course, if you saw and enjoyed Higurashi and Higurashi Kai, this show is a must for you.8/10 so far.

Have read both Higurashi and Umineko and loved them (read Ciconia when it came out as well), along with other little pieces of his writing here and there, such as non-07th Expansion visual novel routes. So I was extremely excited to see a remake of the original...Higurashi anime, which in my opinion left a lot to be desired (season 1 especially, but Kai had some problems as well).But surprise! As we already saw, this is not actually a remake. How cool! I hadn\'t thought we\'d be getting new content, so i was a bit confused but also kind of happy. I thought, for sure, that this was going to be completely uncharted territory, that Ryukishi was going to show us completely different loops so we didn\'t end up spoiling the people who had not read the original visual novels or watched the DEEN anime.(I was wrong!)My concerns with Higurashi Gou started out fairly early on, when they decided to show one of the biggest spoilers in the original series in the first episode or two of the anime. Different world, different rules, all of that I get, but this no doubt would lessen any enjoyment first-time viewers would have reading or watching the original Higurashi visual novel or anime adaptation, in my opinion.Spoiling a twist isn\'t something that completely takes away from watching a series if it\'s written well, but the fact that this spoils not only a twist, but gives us lite-versions of every arc\'s problematics and remixes the endings a little bit just so they can justify calling this a sequel only makes such problems feel a lot easier to overcome. Not only that, but it makes a certain main character feel out of place through the narrative Gou is trying to craft.""Maybe the arcs are getting wrapped faster because that character already knows what to expect!"" you say, and with reason. They\'ve already established that this is not only not a remake: it\'s a sequel. But that\'s exactly why some characters\' behaviors feel out of place, in particular when it comes to Rika. Considering what she went through, and the fact that she has all of her memories from the original story, she should know that what she\'s doing is not helpful. And no, I don\'t mean it in a ""why doesn\'t Rika just get a gun"" sense, I mean that she knows the actual solution isn\'t as simple as changing one part of the story in order to fix every problem.Minagoroshi-hen taught us that even if you fix one problem in the world of Higurashi, there\'s still the larger issue at hand. Matsuribayashi-hen was a world in which every possible issue needed to get worked on, because that was the only way to achieve a happy ending. Rika knows this, and yet, so I definitely thought we\'d be getting a proactive Rika who knows these stakes. Sadly, we needed an Onikakushi, Watanagashi and Tatarigoroshi re-telling for some reason.Higurashi has always been its best self not because of pretty art, but because of its amazing story, and this is not good writing.By and large, I feel like the story would be confusing for a first-time viewer and ruin their enjoyment of the original series, and it also fails to entertain people who are already familiar with the material. The answer arcs will have to work very hard to stick any type of landing. Does it have potential? Of course, there\'s still half a season to go, but I do believe that the foundation Higurashi Gou is standing on is shaky at best.As far as non-story and non-character writing aspects to this sequel, I gotta say I haven\'t had that many problems with the art. DEEN\'s designs (or Ryukishi\'s og sprites for that matter), if nostalgic, are not really that pretty either. The scary faces are better in those for sure, but more because we\'ve gotten a bit more used to them and it\'s a tough act to follow. Everyone is a bit too moe and the white shine on absolutely everything drives me bonkers, but that\'s about it.My main issue is not with the art, but with the direction.Horror is a very hard genre to sell, because in order to make something scary, you have to be very careful with how you present it. The reason the original Higurashi anime could get away with not presenting the question arcs\' story in the best way is because what they lacked in budget and faithfulness, they had in horror (and i don\'t mean blood either!)The horror scenes were carefully crafted in the DEEN anime, with planes trying to always focus on what would make the biggest visual impacts. Just by comparing the ""you\'re lying"" scenes from both anime that much is clear... Keiichi\'s face reflected in the water, his face being half engulfed in shadow, the birds flying to emphasize how loud the yelling had been. These are things that show planning, caring, and that wrapped an unsuspecting audience into the ride of a lifetime.Higurashi Gou\'s director simply put needs to watch some more horror movies and get the pacing down a little bit better.The voice direction is also not great... not to keep harping onto how it doesn\'t compare to the DEEN anime, but considering this is the same voice cast oftentimes delivering the same lines it\'s kind of hard not to. Watching Satoko\'s breakdown in both series was a completely different experience.Music isn\'t really there for me either. The intro is competent and the ending is fine, but I can barely hear any music within the episodes in itself, and sound design in the scenes where things should be most tense is nonexistent. Sound design is a core element of the horror genre, and it\'s kind of sad seeing this when the vn is so iconic in part because of the music! (dai, where are youuu)In conclusion... an attempt of a love letter to 07th Expansion fans that ended up falling flat on its face. It doesn\'t matter how much you think this series will tie into a possible Umineko anime, because the series is currently not able to stand on its own two feet. It tries to be a sequel /and/ a remake but it kind of fails at both. Because of my love for the original Higurashi vns, I\'ll be hoping for it to stick its landing, but even if it does, this still wouldn\'t make up for what a terrible experience watching this has been so far.Still, we can dream. Higurashi anime, which in my opinion left a lot to be desired (season 1 especially, but Kai had some problems as well).But surprise! As we already saw, this is not actually a remake. How cool! I hadn\'t thought we\'d be getting new content, so i was a bit confused but also kind of happy. I thought, for sure, that this was going to be completely uncharted territory, that Ryukishi was going to show us completely different loops so we didn\'t end up spoiling the people who had not read the original visual novels or watched the DEEN anime.(I was wrong!)My concerns with Higurashi Gou started out fairly early on, when they decided to show one of the biggest spoilers in the original series in the first episode or two of the anime. Different world, different rules, all of that I get, but this no doubt would lessen any enjoyment first-time viewers would have reading or watching the original Higurashi visual novel or anime adaptation, in my opinion.Spoiling a twist isn\'t something that completely takes away from watching a series if it\'s written well, but the fact that this spoils not only a twist, but gives us lite-versions of every arc\'s problematics and remixes the endings a little bit just so they can justify calling this a sequel only makes such problems feel a lot easier to overcome. Not only that, but it makes a certain main character feel out of place through the narrative Gou is trying to craft.""Maybe the arcs are getting wrapped faster because that character already knows what to expect!"" you say, and with reason. They\'ve already established that this is not only not a remake: it\'s a sequel. But that\'s exactly why some characters\' behaviors feel out of place, in particular when it comes to Rika. Considering what she went through, and the fact that she has all of her memories from the original story, she should know that what she\'s doing is not helpful. And no, I don\'t mean it in a ""why doesn\'t Rika just get a gun"" sense, I mean that she knows the actual solution isn\'t as simple as changing one part of the story in order to fix every problem.Minagoroshi-hen taught us that even if you fix one problem in the world of Higurashi, there\'s still the larger issue at hand. Matsuribayashi-hen was a world in which every possible issue needed to get worked on, because that was the only way to achieve a happy ending. Rika knows this, and yet, so I definitely thought we\'d be getting a proactive Rika who knows these stakes. Sadly, we needed an Onikakushi, Watanagashi and Tatarigoroshi re-telling for some reason.Higurashi has always been its best self not because of pretty art, but because of its amazing story, and this is not good writing.By and large, I feel like the story would be confusing for a first-time viewer and ruin their enjoyment of the original series, and it also fails to entertain people who are already familiar with the material. The answer arcs will have to work very hard to stick any type of landing. Does it have potential? Of course, there\'s still half a season to go, but I do believe that the foundation Higurashi Gou is standing on is shaky at best.As far as non-story and non-character writing aspects to this sequel, I gotta say I haven\'t had that many problems with the art. DEEN\'s designs (or Ryukishi\'s og sprites for that matter), if nostalgic, are not really that pretty either. The scary faces are better in those for sure, but more because we\'ve gotten a bit more used to them and it\'s a tough act to follow. Everyone is a bit too moe and the white shine on absolutely everything drives me bonkers, but that\'s about it.My main issue is not with the art, but with the direction.Horror is a very hard genre to sell, because in order to make something scary, you have to be very careful with how you present it. The reason the original Higurashi anime could get away with not presenting the question arcs\' story in the best way is because what they lacked in budget and faithfulness, they had in horror (and i don\'t mean blood either!)The horror scenes were carefully crafted in the DEEN anime, with planes trying to always focus on what would make the biggest visual impacts. Just by comparing the ""you\'re lying"" scenes from both anime that much is clear... Keiichi\'s face reflected in the water, his face being half engulfed in shadow, the birds flying to emphasize how loud the yelling had been. These are things that show planning, caring, and that wrapped an unsuspecting audience into the ride of a lifetime.Higurashi Gou\'s director simply put needs to watch some more horror movies and get the pacing down a little bit better.The voice direction is also not great... not to keep harping onto how it doesn\'t compare to the DEEN anime, but considering this is the same voice cast oftentimes delivering the same lines it\'s kind of hard not to. Watching Satoko\'s breakdown in both series was a completely different experience.Music isn\'t really there for me either. The intro is competent and the ending is fine, but I can barely hear any music within the episodes in itself, and sound design in the scenes where things should be most tense is nonexistent. Sound design is a core element of the horror genre, and it\'s kind of sad seeing this when the vn is so iconic in part because of the music! (dai, where are youuu)In conclusion... an attempt of a love letter to 07th Expansion fans that ended up falling flat on its face. It doesn\'t matter how much you think this series will tie into a possible Umineko anime, because the series is currently not able to stand on its own two feet. It tries to be a sequel /and/ a remake but it kind of fails at both. Because of my love for the original Higurashi vns, I\'ll be hoping for it to stick its landing, but even if it does, this still wouldn\'t make up for what a terrible experience watching this has been so far.Still, we can dream.', ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou (2020)People will run and defend this show like the last stand in a war but is it really worth it this time around?Honestly, this isn't bad for me because I had the wrong mindset of thinking it is a remake I did not. I took it as something on its own or as a new season in a newer format or whatever. Honestly, though I just cannot fathom the hype with the show in the first place, it just sucks with how dragged out it is and how silly and convenient many things are.As far as the story...goes that is what let it down. The first sequence was really interesting and well done and then from there it just went further downhill with more dragging out stories much longer than they needed to be. The final episode was good, I guess? It leads to further showing from July 2021 which is expected with how it ended but also a bit like why? It is just dull and dragged out.The art I give credit to being a modern take on the old style and is nicely done and crisp throughout the most part of it.The sound is pretty good too if not sometimes annoying with Rika's catchphrase making me want to skip it every time I hear it. The ED of the first part was really good I will say. General the soundtrack is pretty well done.The characters obviously change a lot during this which is expected and it changes all the time and that is easy to follow. The characters however are just not all that interesting. They are developed but at the same time, I could barely tell you anything about anyone since they all have such vast personality differences. IF not for this village I honestly doubt they would be so close in a different setting. Also, the goddess is just so boring its ridiculous.The show is just not very exciting considering the show should be. It should be a deep, complex and masterful story that the show could be but just isn't. It holds no right to say it comes from the original show at least that had substance behind it and you could really get into the show and its characters. Maybe I will watch the next part to see if my mind can be changed, though it probably won't be this year. Hopefully, unlike this season I won't find myself begging my body to fast forward.3/10.

Pretty generous considering."", ""Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou is a must watch but after you have watched the original series (Original and Kai) or played the original visual novel.Let's start with why the above is so important, after the faithful adaptation of the first episode the show shows its true intentions, to be a sequel to the original story. Episode 2 opens with dialogue between Rika and Hanyuu explaining that it is a sequel. With this fans who are trying to get into the series with the fresh and much better animation will feel lost and disappointed with the product. This is just one reason why you...should NOT start with Higurashi New.Now why as a fan of the original I have enjoyed the first fifteen episodes so far (mostly). The first four arcs mostly start out the same as the originals with some nice jokes so I will go through them one by one.Arc 1 Demon DeceivingThis one starts the exact same as said before but has a few changes throughout with a certain character hinting at doing certain stuff. The character this arc focuses on is Rika and Keiichi. Both characters are well developed in four episodes. The introduction of Oyashiro-Sama's curse and other plot points are introduced quite well in this opening arc, and so is the supernatural aspect which wasn't till season 2 of the original. This arc has great pacing and a truly shocking final 10 minutes which shocked me and left me feeling uneasy. A great opening act to Higurashi New.Arc 2 Cotton DeceivingNow we get to a fantastic arc of Higurashi original. The arc which focuses on Mion. I have some problems with the arc on one reason, this arc will never get the second part which answers all our questions. The original Arc which focused on Mion was so good because the answers came in a later arc which focused on her twin sister Shion, the arcs altogether where 10 of the 25 episodes of Season 1 but in new it is only four episodes. The arc itself is extremely interesting as when it ends even old fans are intrigued about the ending, who is the culprit? who is alive? who is dead? I myself was extremely interested to see the answer arc for Cotton deceiving but it looks like we won't get to it which I will explain later on. Overall though it is still the most ambiguous and interesting arc so far.Arc 3 Curse DeceivingNow we get to a more realistic arc, Satako's arc. This arc deals with the abuse of children from their relatives and is done in an extremely well done manner. This arc integrates season 1 and 2 Satako arc which does cause some problems. The arc felt like it dragged quite a bit although it is only 5 episodes, maybe this was because I was watching it weekly but I did get bored of this arc quite quickly. What made this arc maybe the most surprising was the ending, well done on subverting my expectations, once again it was an ending which left me feeling uneasy. This arc is worth it just for that final 10 minutes.Arc 4 Cat Deceiving  SPOILERS FOR ORIGINAL AND KAIThis is an anime original arc so far and it is perfect. Arc 3 perfectly transitions into arc 4. This arc focuses on Rika. I will not say much about this arc but this is what I was missing from the second season. Rika always died off screen and then when it focuses on her in Kai we don't see her struggle that much to break the loop. Two attempts and she makes it out when it is following Rika. I didn't enjoy the second but if we now see her break through the cycle after this arc honestly it would be perfect. This arc also makes me feel that we won't get the answer arc to Cotton Deceiving as it feels like this will wrap up new with no second season.Overall Higurashi new is a great sequel to the original two seasons and even the visual novel. There is yet to be answers surrounding the circumstances of New but I am sure we will get the answers whether it is integrated into the work of Ryukishi's other masterpieces or not is yet to be seen but hopefully it can end satisfyingly or an ending which wants us asking for more. should NOT start with Higurashi New.Now why as a fan of the original I have enjoyed the first fifteen episodes so far (mostly).

This series, up until yesterday, was probably my least favorite anime. Would I recommend this? If you have seen 2006 or Kai, or read any of the visual novels beforehand, then yes I do recommend it (although I dislike it). Anyway, the series as a whole went from many different ratings for me, at first it was ok, then it went bad, then it got even worse with the third arc, the fourth arc was perfect and nearly saved the series...as a whole, and then the last one we just had, I thought it was pretty terrible but the ending, as said, makes up for it even if it was a little uneventful. Anyway, with that being said, I'm going on for way too long. Have a good one and thanks for reading my boring ass review.Higurashi Gou is the fourth season of the Higurashi series (if you didn't know Rei existed, LOL) and I am a massive fan of the original series, I've read a lot of the manga, I've read SOME of the visual novels (yeah, not a vn person), I've seen the 2006 anime, Kai, Rei, Kira (sadly), Outbreak, and even some of the special shorts like Ura-Higu and stuff along the lines.Unfortunately, Higurashi Gou is, up until ep. 13, a repeat of the original series with minor changes except one big one being the ending changed. Most of the time the ending of the first 3 arcs is bland as all hell or just funny. This entire series only had 6 episodes I enjoyed, 14-19. Everything else is just bad imo.I feel like nobody is talking about the advertising. The way this was marketed was as a reboot, this could possibly mislead new fans of the series...I also recently learned you have to read all the visual novels to make Higurashi Gou enjoyable in any way. I'm not sure how true this last part is so please take it with a grain of salt, but if that's the case, god damn.The storyline is sort of the same as the original Higurashi up until the 4th arc (the only good one) with mild changes and, as said, the one big major change being the endings. It's also confusing, I am trying my best to not spoil this if you couldn't tell but, certain things are never explained. What made the original Higurashi very very fun was the fact that there was mystery, you could form your own theory about it. There was things to base your theories off. With Higurashi Gou, it's almost completely gone.Higurashi Gou DOES have 2 more episodes left after this week's Thursday but I'm sure it won't be able to redeem itself anytime soon. It's already past the point of no return and, when it was good, it was only for 6 episodes.Overall, Higurashi Gou is not that good in my opinion. Obviously, YOU can like it, but as a person who considers Higurashi's manga and the 2006 anime important to myself, I have the right to explain how much I dislike Higurashi Gou, so please don't spam my comments.

Watch the ORIGINAL HIGURASHI FIRST.If you have already finished the ORIGINAL, I still urge you to watch atleastthe Higurashi 2nd Season. That will surely freshen you up on this season's Events....If you have come this far, I will try to keep my review short.Story: Higurashi Gou keeps the original tone, gore ,twists and engaging storytelling.But it doesn't stop there, but capitalize on it and strengthens some of the pointsthat might have been missing in the previous two season.

This season art is a step up for me.it's crisp, bright and colorful with modern character designs while keeping the original's essence.But make no mistake, the panoramas, village atmosphere and gore has been doneflawlessly which has been very rare in the modern anime.Sound: Higurashi's OPs & EDs have always been my favorite, this season felt no different.Specially art of ED theme was stupendous and it brought something fresh to the table.As for voice acting, voice actors simply nailed there roles, here I wanna give credit to Satoko's seiyuu.She literally gave life to Satoko. Her emotions and interaction with others felt ridiculously humane. (Bare in mind I hated Satoko in the Original).There  weren't many OSTs, but the background sounds e.g insect sounds, wind gusts, night time sounds mixed with bewitching scenariesenhanced the countryside feel of the 80s.Characters: All the characters are likable, cheery and have their own arcs dedicated to them. Higurashi's biggestpoint is it's character driven story telling. You get to witness the story from the perspective of each character.Which give further credence to why a certain character behaved in that sense.This character driven story style has always been Higurashi's forte.

Gou just makes a mockery of everything the original built up and I\'ll probably be pretending it doesn\'t exist after it\'s finished airing. It definitely doesn\'t feel like it\'s written by the same person as the original.Story - 2/10The main theme of the original Higurashi was that you can always break through what seems like a predetermined fate by working together with your friends staying determined. Might sound cliche with that ""power of friendship"" type of theme, but it really made it...work. Gou, however, completely tramples all over this. For some reason Rika NEVER asks her friends for help despite it being very clear that it\'s what she needs to do to break through this challenge.  Additionally, every time one of the arcs in the first half seems like it\'s starting to get good, the climax is essentially skipped over and the next arc begins. Super frustrating to watch.  The second half of this show reveals a new antagonist, who\'s motivations are weak/contrived and it really makes it hard to engage with the plot.Art - 5/10The bright, and colorful artstyle is fine, but where higurashi really shined is how grim the dark scenes looked. In this show, those scenes just have a dark filter and a camera shake. Not super impressive.Sound - 5/10The original higurashi had an amazing OST that was used perfectly to supplement both the emotional and intense moments of the story. Gou doesn\'t really have that. The scenes themselves don\'t have much going for them in terms of OST, however the OP and ED are absolute BANGERS. I listened to the opening on repeat for a while and honestly it\'s the best part of every episode.Characters - 2/10NONE of the characters show any of the positive qualities they had in the beginning. Keiichi is supposed to be charismatic and smart while being a bit of a dork, but here he\'s just a bland idiot. Rena is supposed to be super cutesy on the outside while having some serious internal struggles and being intelligent enough to solve murder cases by herself. In Gou, she shows none of that struggle or intelligence outside of one scene, but that doesn\'t get fleshed out at all. It\'s sad. Rika is supposed to understand the value of asking friends for help, so it\'s super frustrating to see her just...not do that. Mion has a really great scene, but that arc is unfortunately cut short and never revisited. Overall, the characters are just shadows of what they used to be.Overall, I\'m at the point where I\'m just watching this show holding a small sliver of hope that in the final episodes it\'ll get a bit better. I\'ll definitely be going back and watching the original to wash myself of the bitterness I feel watching this new series. 2/10 work. Gou, however, completely tramples all over this. For some reason Rika NEVER asks her friends for help despite it being very clear that it\'s what she needs to do to break through this challenge.  Additionally, every time one of the arcs in the first half seems like it\'s starting to get good, the climax is essentially skipped over and the next arc begins. Super frustrating to watch.  The second half of this show reveals a new antagonist, who\'s motivations are weak/contrived and it really makes it hard to engage with the plot.Art - 5/10The bright, and colorful artstyle is fine, but where higurashi really shined is how grim the dark scenes looked. In this show, those scenes just have a dark filter and a camera shake. Not super impressive.Sound - 5/10The original higurashi had an amazing OST that was used perfectly to supplement both the emotional and intense moments of the story. Gou doesn\'t really have that. The scenes themselves don\'t have much going for them in terms of OST, however the OP and ED are absolute BANGERS. I listened to the opening on repeat for a while and honestly it\'s the best part of every episode.Characters - 2/10NONE of the characters show any of the positive qualities they had in the beginning. Keiichi is supposed to be charismatic and smart while being a bit of a dork, but here he\'s just a bland idiot. Rena is supposed to be super cutesy on the outside while having some serious internal struggles and being intelligent enough to solve murder cases by herself. In Gou, she shows none of that struggle or intelligence outside of one scene, but that doesn\'t get fleshed out at all. It\'s sad. Rika is supposed to understand the value of asking friends for help, so it\'s super frustrating to see her just...not do that. Mion has a really great scene, but that arc is unfortunately cut short and never revisited. Overall, the characters are just shadows of what they used to be.Overall, I\'m at the point where I\'m just watching this show holding a small sliver of hope that in the final episodes it\'ll get a bit better. I\'ll definitely be going back and watching the original to wash myself of the bitterness I feel watching this new series. 2/10', 'Spoilers ishI guess people have already pointed out all the flaws with this show. It fails as a remake and a sequel.As a remake, the viewers receive at least half a season of pseudo remake episodes that resemble the original show. Except the needless brutal violence that is present in Gou actually made some sense and pushed the story forward in the original VN/anime. Nothing is ever made of them in this show except that Satoko is implied to be involved with all the messed up events happening. This is not the main problem for new watchers. New watchers will have no idea what the...fuck is going on, with new/familiar faces being introduced at a whim and plot points leading nowhere.The problem is, Higurashi fans have no idea what is going on either.

You need to at least watch the original Higurashi anime from 2006/07 to understand it. Watching this serie first and then going back to the old ones will SPOIL and RUIN everything. You can also watch the Kira or Rei OVA's or the Kaku movie for more lore.

People can get confused because it adds to the mix some horror, comedy, slice of life and at times some sci-fi, sobrenatural or magical stuff.

This anime...really didn't need this sequel.When the cicadas cry, oof. I am now wishing it wasn't part of the main-linear story now. This anime does work as a stand-alone sequel to the original. However, I highly recommend not letting this be your first entry in this long series. There are just too many references, subtle hints and call-backs to the original series. It’s just much more rewarding knowing the previous arcs and the whole story.The most distinctive thing about this sequel is the animation. So radiant and colorful for one’s eyes, you...really never want to look away. It just really fits when it comes to lightening up the atmosphere and comedic aspects of the anime. The problem is when it comes to the grueling and horror moments, it stays just that way. The lighting doesn’t dim down to match the tone or atmosphere, which makes it rather difficult to take seriously. Although they have more detailed facial expressions, I for one enjoy the new animation. However, I don’t enjoy the censorship and soft tone when it comes to murderous scenes. The opening for the show is also great, leaving so many hints of what’s to come, the opening's mood is what we need more in the anime.When it comes to the characters, they're lacking in some aspects which is why I say this shouldn’t be one’s first entry. There’s a lack of important dialogue between the characters not providing many details or hints as if we should already know them. I hope it’s expanded upon when things continue to happen but as of now it doesn’t feel entry-level friendly.---Spoilers.Thus far, I did find it enjoyable, until its second half. It's really pulling at straws, hoping to grasp long term fans. Sometimes it's better off leaving a series finished rather than milking it. Now were stuck with Sakoto living groundhog's day, since she has Rika's ability, but for different reasons. Not adding more overall lore/story but just wanting things to stay the same when they were young.We are literally just looping because someone doesn't want to grow up alongside and embrace change with Rika. Sakoto is not putting the effort to live up to academic standards and working hard in the all-girls school she studied so rigorously to enter just to follow in Rika's footsteps. I mean if you got her ability just why not loop, so you can do better academically by remembering test answers. Essentially, Satoko knows all the trauma Rika went through when she got her time loop power, but screw that. Furthermore, let's not reset to pass tests but reset to solve this suitcase code repeatedly until she gets it right, she's a sadist.

This entire first cour has just been episode after episode of wasted time and potential. Higurashi Gou can't decide if it wants to be a remake or a sequel, and in doing so it fails to do its job as both.I want to start off by saying that I'm a bit of a VN elitist, so I think the original Studio Deen version is not a good adaptation. I didn't like that so many key scenes were skipped or rushed...through; the Higurashi series comes off to me as a slow-burn horror, a descent into insanity if you will. Part of the fun is slowly raising suspicion over these characters, which I feel has been taken away in the anime adaptation. In rushing through these arcs Studio Deen turned Higurashi into some kind of thriller horror, a shell of what the Higurashi series truly is. Upon learning Higurashi was getting a new anime project, I was excited at the thought of anime-only watchers getting to properly experience this series, then was baffled upon the first episode being paced exactly the same as the Studio Deen version. This of course changed when the second episode revealed that this adaptation was really a sequel, and my hopes had been reinvigorated. A lot of my previous complaints would be invalid if I were to judge this through the lens of a sequel rather than a remake, except in choosing to barely diverge from the base story as well, this adaptation is also a disappointment as its own original thing.We have gotten at most minor alterations or alternate endings to these arcs, which when you think about it is not much different from Studio Deen's anime-only arc in their Higurashi Kai adaptation. There was so much they could have done here, and yet they made the baffling choice to copy almost everything from the original anime adaptation. The only thing it has over the Studio Deen version is a few scenes acted out or animated better, and yet it's hard to appreciate these scenes again since the exact same problems from the Studio Deen version carry on over here. When you know how much more there are to these scenes in the VN, you can't help but feel they're rushed here.To summarize, arc 1 teases us by revealing it's a sequel, arc 2 foreshadows changes in the story then does next to nothing, and arc 3 is a lazy Frankenstein monster of scenes from chapters 3 and 7 stitched together with so much left out. All 3 of these arcs have a last-second ending where someone explains to Keiichi that everyone died. They're all the same. I can only hope the second cour is immensely better than the first and finally chooses to diverge completely, because for now, there's sadly not much to appreciate here. through; the Higurashi series comes off to me as a slow-burn horror, a descent into insanity if you will.

I\'m mentioning the whole franchise because this season is linked to Umineko to a certain extent.I\'m not a Visual Novel reader and as an anime-only watcher I was very confused on what was going on for the first part of the season, then the second half made most of the things way clearer.Let\'s start by saying that this is NOT a Remake, this is a Sequel; it\'s pretty clear since the...first few seconds of episode 2 and i will enter into the details later in the review. For that reason i think that there\'s been a lot of misunderstandings on what the show was about and how to approach it as a viewer; You NEED to watch the past 2 seasons and ""Rei"" before getting into this new one, it\'s just a must, otherwise it will be almost impossible to get what\'s up with this show.I binged watched S1, S2 and ""Rei"" just a few weeks before Gou started so i had my memory fresh and clear about the events (although there\'s stuff that i\'m missing since the connection with Umineko no Naku Koro ni seems to be pretty strong).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------STORY: 9I\'ll be straight. I wasn\'t enjoying the first half of the season. As an anime only, i thought it was just a bunch of recicled crap from other season with little twists here and there that made absolutely no reason.But THERE IS a reason and it\'s made very clear why and how certaing things happen in the second half of the show. After episode 14  the story keeps getting better and better, with frequent unpredictable plot twist that, with a retrospective look, make a lot of sense. Episode 17 is the climax and, from there onward, the story never slows down.The season starts with a 1st episode that\'s basically the same as the 1st episode of the original series with small changes so there\'s not much to say about it. Episode 2, though, presents the first big plot twist as we get to know that the events of episode 1 were just happening because Rika looped. Again.She just came out of the spiral of blood and hatred she was stuck in for more than 100 years and there she falls back in right immediatly. This is the point where we know this is a sequel and not a remake.As a matter of fact, the first half of the show are basically events from previous seasons with little twists here and there:-Keichi gives the doll to Mion instead of Rena-From the Oyashiro\'s statue the thing that falls down is the head, not the hand-Rika is WAY more aggressive with anyone, Keichi in particular-The famous ladder scene happens at Rika\'s house and not at school and Mion (instead of Shion in the original), in that fragment, blames Rika for being from the 3 big families instead of Satoko for being cursedAnd much much more.So it\'s clear that Rika is just repeating the loop over and over as she used to. But she\'s getting tired of it because, as always, she can\'t remember when she revives how she died and who killed her. Takano in this season is not always the responsable of everything that happens.So she can\'t find a way to make things right.The more she tries, the more she feels helpless and when Hanyuu tells her that in her family\'s shrine there\'s a blade that will allow to kill a looper once for all without coming back she gives herself 5 more tries. If she fails 5 more times she will put an end to her existance. These are the episodes where the most blood is shed ( and the only ones where the plot feels like a proper horror instead of a psychological/supernatural/thriller ).When all hopes seem to be lost, in episode 17 we get to know that Satoko is like her too, but way stronger. She can come back from death as well but she remembers how she dies and who killed her, unlike Rika.My speculations on this argument is that Featherine, the goddess that stands with Satoko, is Hanyuu. The same Hanyuu who abandoned Rika that had a damaged horn. so maybe the difference in powers between Satoko and Rika comes from that horn being fully healed on Featherine and not on Hanyuu.The further we get into the show, the more we get to know how Satoko was the one behind most of Rika\'s fail attempts to make things right in this season. If Rika succeeds, she will leave Hinamizawa, leaving Satoko behind and she doesn\'t want that. Abusing the fact that Rika doesn\'t know about her friend\'s powers and that she forgets who kills her, Satoko messes up with her plans multiple times, killing the reincarnation of Oyashiro-Sama, her best friend, if needed too.Higurashi has deviated from the pure horror elements since we got to know about Rika way back in season 2, so it\'s good to see this thriller going on while putting back those classic gore moments, like episode 16, that made the show famous in the first place. I really enjoyed how the plot progressed and the pacing it had doing it: for the first half it is just random things with no context happening very slowly to build the suspance while the second half answers a lot of questions and becomes way more intriguing and stacked with informations.I\'ve heard that people say that without the VN of both Higurashi and Umineko, a lot of stuff doesn\'t make sense. That may be the case, but i feel like i understood most of the things that happened in this season.The only small downside is that the story doesn\'t feel/seem completed yet, another season has been announced in the last episode so we\'ll see everything coming full circle in that one (hopefully)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Art: 8I know a lot of people hated the new art style and the change of studio and i get that. They were used to a certain look that has been there from 15 years, so the approach to the new one is not that easy.On the other hand, I find the new art style VERY fitting for what this season rappresents and I quite enjoy the new one more.-The old art style exalted the horror, the gory scenes and the atmosphere. You always had the feeling that something was going to happen.-The new art style (that looks more ""moe"") exalts the contraxt between the typical slice of life elements of Higurashi and the moments where shit goes down. One minute earlier you were watching very bright and smily characters having good time togheter; the minute later you are watching these same exact characters murdering each other in the most horrible and violent ways. It gives the same vibe that Gakkougurashi gave at the time: Cute characters put in the most non-cute situations.The animation is slightly above average. Nothing bad, nothing amazing. But it doesn\'t need great animation and production value since for the most part is a dialogue heavy show. When it excalates, tho, you can see an increase of the quality of the drowings and movements.There\'s basically no CGI or it\'s barely noticeable and that obviously is a plus for me.The direction seemed nothing amazing at first, but once you get the Satoko\'s revelation, you can understand how wonderfully they hid clues about her being a looper with the camera shots in the first halfIf we take into account how poorly animated the original was in some scenes, you can say that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou is a big step up in that sense.But, again, I completely understand if you don\'t like the new art and animation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sound: 8As always, Higurashi never fails to deliver great sound design and OSTs. We all know about the cicadas chirps that set up the mood and the atmosphere of this little town in the mountains called Hinamizawa.The OSTs, while not being the greatest thing ever heard, are plenty and very diversified according to the situation and the scenes that are going on. They help building up the suspance as well as the sountracks of the original didThe voice acting is always top notch and the voice actors are the same from the old series from 15 years ago, so the approach is way more familiar.I\'m not an expert when it comes to music so i don\'t have much more to say about it---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Characters: 6.5This is where things get tricky.-On the one hand we have Rika and Satoko that get HUGE characterization and development. For the first 3 seasons i kinda disliked Satoko because i thought she was the most useless one of the group and the only things she did were bitching, crying and being annoying. With this season she really stepped up and became my favorite character of the whole franchise aside from Rika-On the other hand we have all the other characters that get hardly any development or screentime... Rena is beyond useless in this series and it sucks because she was one of the most interesting characters of the original, Keichi lost his role of main character in the old Higurashi too, but in this new one he becomes barely a side element of the story, Satoshi and Shion are practically non existent, Mion is decently important but doesn\'t go much further than that. Oishi, Takano,Tomitake and Akasaka have lost their relevance ( but that\'s fine, everything about them it has already been explained in the previous seasons ).It\'s literally a 2 men (or women) show between Satoko and Rika and i feel like more could have been done with all the other characters in these 24 episodes honestly---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Enoyment: 9What can I say? I loved how this show had me going from ""what the hell is this shit"" to ""Holy, this shit is amazing"".Like i said, I was very bored for the first half of the show because nothing seemed to make sense. Piece by piece, though, you start to get the gist of what\'s going on and towards the end everything wraps up very nicely.Basically every minute of the second half, specially from ep 17 onwards, had me going like ""WOW""Not many show lately had the power to hook me in like this, in particular not after 12 or so episodes of me not really liking it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: 9I really love this new season. I think it\'s so criminally underrated and the people who dropped it are missing on a very solid show.I think it deserves more attention and i really don\'t get how it went so heavily under the radar, in favour of other ""questionable"" seasonal shows, since it comes from a very very famous series.I am of the openion that this is the best season that Higurashi has ever had. I can\'t wait to see the sequel to further explore the lore behind the events and the charactersJust do yourself a favour and watch the original first. It\'s really important you do so, otherwise you wouldn\'t understand a single thing of this season.I hope my English was good enough for you guys :D〜NIPAAAAH〜 first few seconds of episode 2 and i will enter into the details later in the review. For that reason i think that there\'s been a lot of misunderstandings on what the show was about and how to approach it as a viewer; You NEED to watch the past 2 seasons and ""Rei"" before getting into this new one, it\'s just a must, otherwise it will be almost impossible to get what\'s up with this show.I binged watched S1, S2 and ""Rei"" just a few weeks before Gou started so i had my memory fresh and clear about the events (although there\'s stuff that i\'m missing since the connection with Umineko no Naku Koro ni seems to be pretty strong).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------STORY: 9I\'ll be straight.

You always had the feeling that something was going to happen.-The new art style (that looks more ""moe"") exalts the contraxt between the typical slice of life elements of Higurashi and the moments where shit goes down. One minute earlier you were watching very bright and smily characters having good time togheter; the minute later you are watching these same exact characters murdering each other in the most horrible and violent ways. It gives the same vibe that Gakkougurashi gave at the time: Cute characters put in the most non-cute situations.The animation is slightly above average. Nothing bad, nothing amazing. But it doesn\'t need great animation and production value since for the most part is a dialogue heavy show. When it excalates, tho, you can see an increase of the quality of the drowings and movements.There\'s basically no CGI or it\'s barely noticeable and that obviously is a plus for me.The direction seemed nothing amazing at first, but once you get the Satoko\'s revelation, you can understand how wonderfully they hid clues about her being a looper with the camera shots in the first halfIf we take into account how poorly animated the original was in some scenes, you can say that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou is a big step up in that sense.But, again, I completely understand if you don\'t like the new art and animation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sound: 8As always, Higurashi never fails to deliver great sound design and OSTs. We all know about the cicadas chirps that set up the mood and the atmosphere of this little town in the mountains called Hinamizawa.The OSTs, while not being the greatest thing ever heard, are plenty and very diversified according to the situation and the scenes that are going on. They help building up the suspance as well as the sountracks of the original didThe voice acting is always top notch and the voice actors are the same from the old series from 15 years ago, so the approach is way more familiar.I\'m not an expert when it comes to music so i don\'t have much more to say about it---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Characters: 6.5This is where things get tricky.-On the one hand we have Rika and Satoko that get HUGE characterization and development. For the first 3 seasons i kinda disliked Satoko because i thought she was the most useless one of the group and the only things she did were bitching, crying and being annoying. With this season she really stepped up and became my favorite character of the whole franchise aside from Rika-On the other hand we have all the other characters that get hardly any development or screentime... Rena is beyond useless in this series and it sucks because she was one of the most interesting characters of the original, Keichi lost his role of main character in the old Higurashi too, but in this new one he becomes barely a side element of the story, Satoshi and Shion are practically non existent, Mion is decently important but doesn\'t go much further than that. Oishi, Takano,Tomitake and Akasaka have lost their relevance ( but that\'s fine, everything about them it has already been explained in the previous seasons ).It\'s literally a 2 men (or women) show between Satoko and Rika and i feel like more could have been done with all the other characters in these 24 episodes honestly---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Enoyment: 9What can I say? I loved how this show had me going from ""what the hell is this shit"" to ""Holy, this shit is amazing"".Like i said, I was very bored for the first half of the show because nothing seemed to make sense. Piece by piece, though, you start to get the gist of what\'s going on and towards the end everything wraps up very nicely.Basically every minute of the second half, specially from ep 17 onwards, had me going like ""WOW""Not many show lately had the power to hook me in like this, in particular not after 12 or so episodes of me not really liking it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: 9I really love this new season. I think it\'s so criminally underrated and the people who dropped it are missing on a very solid show.I think it deserves more attention and i really don\'t get how it went so heavily under the radar, in favour of other ""questionable"" seasonal shows, since it comes from a very very famous series.I am of the openion that this is the best season that Higurashi has ever had. I can\'t wait to see the sequel to further explore the lore behind the events and the charactersJust do yourself a favour and watch the original first. It\'s really important you do so, otherwise you wouldn\'t understand a single thing of this season.I hope my English was good enough for you guys :D〜NIPAAAAH〜', ""This anime burns slower than a grandma running a marathon :). Personally speaking, i wasn't very impressed with the development of the story as a whole as I felt it was progressing wayyyy too slowly for my tastes. Plus, i didnt rlly even get the story XD. Maybe its because i'm newcomer to the higurashi series, but i found the story to be extremely convoluted with multiple arcs that seem to not even be connected to each other. Therefore, I have decided to drop this anime halfway through the season. Furthermore, when i watch this type of horror/gory animes, I expect there to be a...fair level of violence, bloodshed, and action, however I saw that there was a lack of scenes involving these categories and found that to be disappointing in multiple ways :(. fair level of violence, bloodshed, and action, however I saw that there was a lack of scenes involving these categories and found that to be disappointing in multiple ways :(."", 'There was a lot of controversy around what exactly Higurashi Gou was going into Fall 2020. Is it a sequel, reboot, remake, what? Ultimately, we found out after some misleading comments from the author that it’s a sequel. Therefore, I want to preface this review saying that Higurashi Gou requires at least some knowledge of previous Higurashi series to be fully appreciated.That said, Higurashi Gou represents an upgrade over the originals in almost every way for me. Passione did a great job of creating terrifying and chilling scenes, bringing beautiful art and generally great direction. What I particularly like more in this series compared to...the original is the focus on RIkka as opposed to Keichi. In the original series, Keichi is essentially the MC for large portions of the show, but I really don’t care for him. I find his personality to be bland and honestly almost nonexistent. He’s annoying, shallow and just not an interesting character. Rikka on the other hand, is what people THINK Subaru of Re:Zero is. Gou does a great job of hammering home her inner struggle and fight for a timeline in which everyone is happy. How broken and alone she is on this journey, etc. Seeing all the struggles she’s faced catapulted her into my top 10 MCs.In addition to the focus on Rikka, I enjoyed the additional development Satoko gets. Satoko is essentially the MC for the final third of the show, and the development she gets in those final 4 eps is more than she got in 60 of the original. On top of addtional character development, I like the job Passione did with creating these seemingly tranquil and peaceful scenes, followed by horrific deaths and brutality. In general, Higurashi has prided itself on creating a sense of dread for audiences. For instance, you have a cute slice of life episode, but it never really feels happy because you just know something awful is around the corner waiting to happen. Deen was decent with it, but I think Gou does a masterful job of capturing that feeling.From a technical aspect, I enjoyed the art of Gou much more than the original as well. The mono artstyle fits the series well and the colours, backgrounds, etc are all well done. In traditional Higurashi fashion, there’s a banger OP and ED as well as a great OST in general too.In conclusion, Higurashi Gou is from start to end a mysterious and terrifying adventure that never ceases to be fun and I can’t recommend it enough for fans of the series. Higurashi Gou gets 9 cotton balls out of 10. the original is the focus on RIkka as opposed to Keichi.

Higurashi Gou gets 9 cotton balls out of 10.', 'I initially gave Higurashi Gou a below-average rating of 3. After the last episode I still had some naive hope that they might somehow salvage the nonsensical story with the second season, but it turns out that Higurashi Sotsu is even worse, so I had no choice but to come back and drop my rating of the first season to 1 for wasting my time.Even as a long-time fanatic of the Higurashi series who had been looking forward to this new project, I found very little to enjoy here. I honestly find it hard to believe that Ryukishi07, the author behind the original Higurashi...and Umineko visual novels (Umineko being my absolute favorite visual novel of all time), had anything to do with this train wreck of a story.Let me blunt; I absolutely despise this anime. And this is coming from someone who actually somewhat enjoys such controversially awful shows as School Days. Let that sink in. The guy who actually likes School Days hates the new Higurashi. Yes, it is that bad.Higurashi Gou expects the audience to be familiar with the original Studio Deen adaptation (or the visual novel), because the first few story arcs are basically recaps of those same story arcs, but with a twist ending. However, this causes more frustration than intrigue for existing fans. The people who are familiar with the original series know that the characters here make all the right choices to avoid tragedy, yet things go south anyway. Remember how the themes of the original series were trusting your friends and working together to overcome impossible odds? Well, those themes are thrown right out of the window because of the forced ""uh oh, you did the right thing, but something bad happened anyway"" twists that get very predictable and obnoxious after a while.Let me ask a question; how is it entertaining to watch characters you\'ve grown to love make all the right decisions yet get horribly killed anyway? Answer: it is not.This series feels sadistic, and not in a good way that a horror series is supposed to. First of all, I wouldn\'t even categorize Higurashi Gou as horror, because unlike the original series, which had plenty of atmosphere and build-up to the creepy moments, here we get a completely bipolar series that assumes that characters being the closest friends in one scene and then randomly starting to murder each other in the next is somehow scary. It\'s not scary because those twists just come out of nowhere without any proper build-up. Your reaction is, ""what? Seriously?"" instead of ""oh my God!"" Even the animation can\'t pull off those crazy twisted Deen faces that actually scared the hell out of me in the original series. The character animations look rather stiff and the series overcompensates with completely unrealistic amounts of blood, which just makes the ""scary"" moments laughably try-hard.Anyway, I would have been fine with the repetitive ""ooh, you thought everything was going fine, but then something bad happened"" storytelling if it was actually leading to something interesting. Unfortunately what we get is the single dumbest plot-twist I have ever seen in an anime. Turns out that the bad guy all along was (SPOILERS btw)...*drum rollSatoko.Yes, that\'s right. The character whose parents died, was mercilessly abused by her uncle, and even lost her brother... we are supposed to hate her now. Why? Because she wants Rika to stay in Hinamizawa instead of going to a prestigious school. Yes really, that is the great big twist that is somehow supposed to justify seeing your favorite characters tortured over and over again.It probably goes without saying why this twist is so incomprehensibly dumb, but it\'s even more dumb the more you think about it. After all, it completely destroys the point that the first series was making. In the first series, the villain was Takano. She was an outside threat that our heroes had to outsmart despite her vast influence, cunning and determination. Only when Keiichi, Rika and the others began fully trusting one another and joined forces were they able to defeat Takano. But now this new dumb series is telling us that trusting your friends is bad, because they might be a bad guy who\'ll trap you in a timeloop until you do exactly what they want. And speaking of timelooping, giving Satoko that power makes her such an unfairly overpowered villain that it\'s not even fun trying to see how Rika gets out of it. Takano was a normal human with normal human resources and she was still a hundred times more interesting as an antagonist (not to mention her motivation actually made sense).If you want more details about how badly this anime sucks, check out my review of Higurashi Sotsu.Avoid this series like the plague. It is an absolute disgrace that directly insults the original series and its devoted fans.

I was really looking forward to watching this series, however, I was a bit disappointed with how things played out.One thing I would like to say was how dull the story felt. I noticed that during moments where it is supposed to be tense and it should leave you on the edge (which was a feeling that I thought I would be feeling quite a lot throughout this series) however, I did not...end up feeling that way at all until towards the end of the series. This may be due to the lack of camera angles and play with dark and light tones. I noticed when there is a moment of seriousness or a switch of character that the atmosphere remains very moe. That even when someone is getting brutally murdered, it still remains this colorful aura that left me unhooked and continued to leave me bored and unengaged to the point that I was actually debating whether or not I should drop this anime or not. Do not get me wrong, I loved the usage of colors they used in the series, but I wished I could have seen a far darker tone to make the scenes even more dramatic and gripping and it felt like they had lacked in that quite a bit.What was also a major turn-off was the character backstories. Now usually when diving into a character\'s past or story arc it would give you a better understanding of the character\'s personality. However, the only stories I actually fully enjoyed were Rika\'s and Reno\'s storyline. Everyone else did not give me the same feeling as I did watch these two characters. What makes this more interesting is how both of these character\'s stories were the most gruesome which is exactly what I was expecting of this show. Now, Satoko. I did enjoy her story, but I think the reason why I didn\'t actually get to enjoy it as much as I thought was that I never liked her character from the first episode. I found her whiny and annoying which is why I couldn\'t connect with her as well as I did with the others. But her relationship with her uncle at the end was just heartwrenching after knowing all the things he has done to her in the past, this was where I began to fully appreciate her character a bit more. Rika on the other hand I had no longer felt the same connection. She became this girl that I did not know when watching her become someone who wasn\'t ""her"". Now, Shion and Mion. If I am being brutally honest, their story was the least favorite of mine. In fact, it was a snooze fest. I wish I could\'ve enjoyed it more considering I really liked Shion\'s and Mion\'s character but it felt like a waste of time and if I had the chance to skip then I would\'ve.Overall, Higurashi was the most anticipated and yet the biggest disappointment for me. Yet again, we all do have our own preferences so my opinion does not accurately represent the anime as a whole. I would still recommend this anime if it seems like something that someone else might enjoy. It all is based on how the watcher feels:) end up feeling that way at all until towards the end of the series. This may be due to the lack of camera angles and play with dark and light tones.

It all is based on how the watcher feels:)', 'This review contains spoilers for the original Higurashi anime - Gou is a sequel, not a remake as was originally thought. This also contains spoilers for Gou, so if you still feel like watching it, you\'ve been warned.I wanted to like this show. I really did. The first half is interesting and sets up a nice mystery - if you can get over the ""wow, Rika\'s eyes are different, let\'s show that for the 50th time"" and the fact that a large portion of it is just redrawn footage from the far superior older anime. Side note: Higurashi is one of my favorite shows of...all time. I love it. It\'s my number 2 anime after Steins;gate. I also really enjoyed the VNs and Umineko, which is a ""sequel"" VN to the Higurashi (the anime for Umineko is not good.) With that being said, I had very high hopes for this show.That was a mistake. Gou takes a very satisfying conclusion and flips it on its head; Rika has been forced back into Hinamizawa after escaping the equivalent of 100 years of suffering. On its surface, while it ""ruins"" the original show\'s happy ending, the ending left a few unanswered questions - mainly, Satoshi was still comatose. There was still no cure for the mysterious syndrome that plagued the village. There was definitely room for a sequel, and Rika having to loop again was an interesting idea. Flipping things on their head seems to be a theme for the first half of Gou, and it\'s very interesting to see.However, once the show completes flipping the original higurashi on its head, the show falls apart. The villain is revealed to be none other than Rika\'s ""best friend,"" Satoko. Satoko, who has been mostly silent throughout Gou. Satoko, who Rika took care of and helped in the original series through multiple loops. Satoko, who lived with Rika after both their parents died. Satoko, who suffered from Hinamizawa syndrome in the original series and knows firsthand how horrible it can be. Satoko, who is almost certainly now in love with Rika.So, what is Satoko\'s motivation for putting Rika through more and more torture, making Rika doubt her own sanity, ending Rika\'s only shot at happiness?Rika didn\'t pay enough attention her. There\'s a little bit more to it, but Satoko\'s motivations are shaky at best, and her character is almost completely different from the original series. Most of the characters are similar to the original series, however Rika seems to have lost most of the intelligence she showed throughout the original show, and obviously Satoko is very different.Rika\'s dreamt of going to St. Lucia academy, something clearly shown in the original series. She invites Satoko to go with her - she\'s a bit pushy, but not in a manipulative way. Satoko agrees to go.Rika makes new friends at the academy. Satoko refuses to even talk to Rika\'s new friends. Satoko struggles at the school. Rika offers to help. Satoko ignores her.The pair go back to the village. Meeting a mysterious new Deity similar to Hanyuu in the original series, Satoko is given powers similar to Rika from the original series - if she dies, she can ""loop"" through time. Mind you, Rika is forced to go with her. Now, remember this as well - Satoko is fully aware of what Rika has gone through. She\'s seen Rika\'s one hundred year horror story. She knows what Rika has done to help her.What does Satoko do? She tries to force Rika to stay in the village. To stay in the place that Rika is haunted by. She actively tries to sabotage Rika\'s studying multiple times, but Rika is determined. Rika invites Satoko. Satoko seemingly tries to say ""no,"" but only if Rika stays. Satoko decides to go back to school. Of course, this doesn\'t end well, and Satoko kills herself and Rika in an overly gory scene. (That\'s another complaint I have - the original Higurashi had gore, but it wasn\'t the focus of the show. This show makes gore the main focus.)The entire story is chalked up to Satoko trying to give Rika Stockholm syndrome. Satoko, the person who Rika helped multiple times throughout the original show.Satoko is so incredibly out of character here that it\'s almost a different show. Now, she\'s the main problem I have with this show, but there are a bunch of other more minor issues. Satoko is sent to a ""prison"" when she fails. Apparently, this was a miscommunication between the series creator and the studio, but it\'s incredibly out of place and silly.  Shion and Satoshi have disappeared, both being shown for about 5 minutes total. Rena, Keiichi, and Mion have an extremely reduced amount of screen time compared to the original show, especially during the second half. I don\'t hate the art style, in fact I think the show looks nice, but it does feel a bit soulless compared to the original shows. The music is great, but nowhere near as iconic as the original show. The story has taken an extreme nose dive.On top of that, the show retains a lot of flaws from the original show. I understand that there are cultural differences, but Dr. Irie is incredibly creepy - just as he was in the old Higurashi anime.There are things I like about the show - it\'s fun to see Satoko ""reform"" her uncle, to have Takano give up her life of evil, seeing Rena, Mion, and Keiichi go to college, and a few other things, but they\'re few and far between.Overall, I can\'t recommend this show unless you absolutely want to see the characters you enjoyed from the original show. all time.

The story has taken an extreme nose dive.On top of that, the show retains a lot of flaws from the original show. I understand that there are cultural differences, but Dr. Irie is incredibly creepy - just as he was in the old Higurashi anime.There are things I like about the show - it\'s fun to see Satoko ""reform"" her uncle, to have Takano give up her life of evil, seeing Rena, Mion, and Keiichi go to college, and a few other things, but they\'re few and far between.Overall, I can\'t recommend this show unless you absolutely want to see the characters you enjoyed from the original show.', ""This is my first review, and I am only Reviewing this anime because a lot of people have been giving it abysmal scores. Don't get me wrong, everybody is entitled to their own opinion and in most cases, I do agree with the criticism pointed out at this particular season. It did have a fake promotion: this is not the remake we were promised, this is a continuation of the story.The first half of the season is stale. While I enjoy reliving some of the most iconic scenes from the series (with their KEY differences), I do have to admit that at some point,...it did get a little repetitive. For that reason, I can clearly see and understand why so many people felt disappointed and let down by this continuation. However, I believe that the events that occur in the second half of the season more than makeup for it.Without giving too much away (Because experiencing this season is a complete delight for me), the story really picks up in the end, makes you appreciate the small clues that were scattered throughout the episodes, and if you are an anime-only, it will really incentivize you to explore further the entirety of the Higurashi universe.  I have never had any interest in playing/reading any visual novels before, but thanks to this series I have found myself immersed in them. For me, that speaks volumes of the quality of the story and the impact that it might potentially have on the viewer.For those reasons, if you are still on the fence about either watching this season or not, I would highly recommend you give it a shot. I wholeheartedly believe that if you enjoyed the previous seasons, this one will slowly but surely grow on you.P.S: Their OP and second ED are absolute BANGERS! it did get a little repetitive.

There is no part of this show that is a remake, and if you haven't read or watched the entirety of the original Higurashi before getting to Gou, you're gonna have a bad time. Get outta here now and go do that. *THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS FOR THE ORIGINAL HIGURASHI SERIES SO REALLY, WATCH OUT.*If you're a Higurashi fan and you're wondering if Gou will ruin your fond memories of the original because of it's low score, know that that score is in large part due to confused first-timers or chumps criticizing it for diverging from the OG.That...isn't to say that there aren't also plenty of valid reasons to criticize Gou. In fact, let's start with those. For starters, the show takes an entire cour to get its wheels turning. The first twelve episodes are spent retreading routes 1,2, and 7 of the original Higruashi. These episodes are sprinkled with minor changes and all have different endings than the originals, so while it was fun playing 'spot the differences,' after 3 months that got a little old. The show could have easily started at its own halfway point and given up its prolonged fake-out stunt in exchange for much better pacing.In addition to these pacing issues, Gou looks pretty awful by modern anime standards. The directing is generally uninspired, with flat panning character shots taking up most of its screen time. There are a number of hideous CG objects, including the iconic Hinamizawa waterwheel that now haunts my nightmares, and Oishii's car, which doesn't so much drive as it does get dragged around the screen by an invisible cursor. Asides from Rika's ritual dance there are basically no animation highlights, and while the character designs are alright, they're often misdrawn in unfortunate ways. If you've come to Gou looking for a visual treat, you're out of luck. This show isn't pretty.However, it is pretty good. I subscribe to an old school of thought that says that aesthetics aren't everything, and while it is preferred to be immersed by the deliberate directing of a confident piece of animation, a good story can make up for all that and more. What Gou does right is that it understands what a sequel should be. Too many modern stories use sequels to retread familiar territory with a small twist, keeping the world familiar, the characters relatively static, and more importantly, the original ending more or less intact. For me, these kinds of sequels are closer to fanfiction, indulgent expansions for the fans that play it safe to avoid making anyone unhappy. They're also incredibly pointless and boring. If you're going to add to a story, have a reason.And boy oh boy, does Gou have a reason.In Gou, Ryukishi blows the original route 8 ending of Higruashi wide open, shattering the tied-with-a-bow conclusion and sticking a knife point at his original theme of trusting your friends at all costs. This was a flaw that was alluded to in the original, as some great minds on Twitter have pointed out. The original Higurashi points out that the so-called 'trust and unity' of the original ending was only made possible by uniting the main cast around a singular threat, the classic move of bringing people together by providing them a common enemy. For Keichii's club, everything was gravy. But what about Takano, their common enemy? How different was her delusional rampage from Shion's or Rena's? The message of the story was to try to understand the people around you better, to reach out to them when you notice something wrong, but at the end of Higurashi this was only achieved by making someone outside the club who was going through a similar experience into a scapegoat. What was more, Rika treated escaping June of 1983 as a singular point to wiggle out of, not as a solution earned through personal growth. The way she saw it, if she could survive 1983 then she would be happy with her friends, no questions asked. She never bothered to stop and think about how so many of the lingering issues her friends faced would continue to persist regardless of whether or not Takano was trying to kill her. Satoko was still overcoming her abuse and abandonment issues. Rena was still struggling with anxiety and depression. And the Hinamizawa virus, the metaphor for paranoia and distrust in small Japanese communities, was still around.These are the weaknesses of the original Higurashi ending that Gou challenges to the extend of its abilities. At its beginning, Rika finds herself sent back to 1983 Hinamizawa for an unknown reason. Convinced that she's already figured out the solution to the problem, she proceeds with confidence, only to discover that 1983 has changed. Takano is no longer a threat, but all of Hinamizawa's other swirling problems have been amplified. Rika, who we learn has been away at boarding school, resorts to her old methods, assuming that her hard-acquired glut of knowledge will get her out easily, but what she learns instead is that the town she was so eager to escape from is not so eager to let her go. What's more, the friends she treated more as trophies from her victory are more complicated--and have more agency--than she gave them credit for.And so Higurashi is put to the test by its own creator. There are a lot of people who were angered by the choices that this story made and the direction it took some of the story's original characters, but I never felt like this show was anything more than a hard-pressing interrogation of the the easy answers given by the original. The twists arose naturally from the loose ends of the first ending, emerging from Rika's failures and breaking open the naive notion that a cohesive, trusting community can be created simply by banding together to stop one bad actor. For the reasons I started off listing, this show is far from perfect. However, it is purposeful, inspired, and bold. It strikes hard at the core of its own original thesis, and it does so using ideas that Ryukishi has clearly been carefully planning for a long time. In my many long years of watching anime I've never been as excited for each new episode of an airing show, and I've never spent so long debriefing every piece with my friends. For capturing my attention and obsession for twenty-four straight weeks and still leaving me hyped as fuck for Sotsu in the summer, I give Higurashi Gou an unironic, uninflated 9/10 and recommend it to everyone who has an ounce of love for the original Higurashi series. isn't to say that there aren't also plenty of valid reasons to criticize Gou.

It\'s impressive how the creators managed to create a series that both og watchers and new watchers can enjoy. I don\'t really get why this anime has such a low rating. In my opinion it has been amazing since episode 1.

It loses one point because the art style is a little too ""cute"" for Higurashi. It loses some of the eeriness seen in the old series\' art...style, for example the legendary distorted face expressions of the characters. (Like the ladder scene with Sonozaki Mion).

The point of the loops in the actual story was that they would...end with a murder. How exactly did Keiichi survive after being stabbed MULTIPLE times?The art style was ""fine"", sure it\'s pretty, but I miss my malnourished thin kawaii girls from the original HIGURASHI NO NAKU KORO NI, these just looked like chubby children.Too much talking, too little killing.Thank you. end with a murder.

It spends way too much time rehashing old arcs and explaining how things work for new viewers that old viewers will be bored out of their minds.

Please, go watch/read the originals instead.', ""This review contain spoilers!Higurashi is one of my favourite series. I discovered it through anime 6 years ago and some years later I read visual novel. What originally made me interested in series was mystery and suspense. But then it turned out to be something more. It became story about group of people, that had to deal with their personal issues. That made me really like Higurashi, a story about group of friends trapped in repeating spiral of tragedies, some caused by themselves. This resulted in lots of emotional moments. It was good to see these characters growth wich later arcs and realizing their mistakes....I was rooting for Rika and her friends to finally win and it happened after lots of hardships and suffering. It was well deserved miracle.With Higurashi Gou, Rika was thrown again into the loop. I was very interested what the story has to show and in what direction it will go. I took liking in art style. Voice actors were gladly the same. Opening and ending were very good and they set the atmosphere and expectations.First disappointment hit with episode 4. After 3 episodes with very much the same content as original, it finally showed something new and interesting, only to end it quickly and move to the next arc. The same happened with next two arcs.This is clearly a sequel. Then why first 13 episodes looked like reused versions of older arcs? It just looks like creator did not have any idea how to write new arcs around new mystery, so he copied from original, add minor differences and too little new scenes, which for most parts looked like last minute plot twists to shock the audience. From my perspective, there was barely new content to keep me interested.And it's not even the only problem. Rika already know the culprit and she said, that she's gonna get back her happy ending. Then why very little was done by her in first 3 loops? Patting Tomitake's head and giving Keiichi some advice can't be called an attempts to fight with looming tragedy. In matsuribayashi arc from Higurashi Kai, she asked Irie, Tomitake and Akasaka for help. Then she talked with her friends and Ooishi to prepare a plan to fight with Takano and mountain dogs. Only with this she finally defeat the fate. And somehow in Higurashi Gou she forgot how to fight and ask for help. Dumbing down a character to make plot move forward is not a good way of storytelling.Introducing Hanyuu in episode 2 and then not showing her for next 12 episodes was such a waste. And when she finally showed up, not even 5 minutes have passed and she disappeared again. She was very important character in prequel, but here she barely existed. All this damashi arcs would be a bit better to swallow, if only she at least appeared after every chapter to discuss events with Rika. This would also provide some great context to Rika's hopeless situation presented in ep 14.Mystery aspect was lacking. It became very obvious who was working behind the scenes since ep 8. Even another looper theory was formed during that time. Problem is the plot, which followed original for the most part and gave too few new scenes. Thus it was easy to work out theories that were later confirmed in second half.Horror aspects were hit or miss. I liked scenes with Rena coming upstairs or banging on the door in Keiichi's house, but disliked USODA and Mion ladder scene. Some of them had great atmosphere and looked creepy and others clearly lacked execution or build up.Soundtrack was unfortunately disappointing. Nothing really stands out. There were few new tracks, but most of them were lazily copied from the old anime. And for most scenes I had a feeling that music was too quiet. Too bad ost from visual novel weren't included, because it's great.That's my rating for first 3 arcs:Onidamashi 6/10Watadamashi 5/10Tataridamashi 4/10Let's move to Nekodamashi arc. Episode 14 showed something new and interesting. Finally Rika's perspective has been shown and her despair after earlier tragedies. It gave me high hopes, that second cour will redeem this show.And how I was wrong by episode 15. It was pointless episode with unnecessary gore. These scenes were supposed to make me feel bad for Rika, but instead it made me angry at creators for wasting what could be very good 4 or 5 loops, especially the Akasaka one. They just decided to speed run Rika's deaths. I would rather watch full versions of these arcs instead of previous three. And even though the rest of the arc was good, I was still bitter about what was wasted in single episode.But on the good note, it was also the arc, where most of my theories find confirmation and some clarifications have been made to what was actually going on. Satoko reveal as a looper was cool. Takano apologizing to Rika was something I always wanted to see. Some more club activity was a welcome.My score for Nekodamashi is 6/10. Could be better if not for ep 15Moving to the next one.I really liked Satokowashi chapter when it started. It felt like a propel sequel. It was nice to see older characters and their life outside of June 1983. Ep 19 insert song sounded sweet and at the same time melancholic. And life of two close friends in Saint Lucia was what I expected, Rika quickly adapted to environment, but Satoko on the other hand felt like she didn't belong.It really was Satoko's time to shine. Getting her perspective was nice change. I actually understood her pain of feeling left behind. I only wished that a little more of her life in school was shown. Her becoming a looper was a good twist. I also liked slower pace, except for ep 22. Teppei having change of heart was very suprising and in a good way. Also good to finally known what's up with Takano.It could be 8/10 arc, BUTEpisode 22 happened.Satoko looper is really interesting concept. Obviously it painted her in a bad way, but I though 'It's Ryoukishi story, so there's something more going on than just Satoko messing with timeloops'. And the twist was... there was no twist, just awful execution.Satoko became crazy and obsessed about keeping Rika forever in Hinamizawa. And transition was unbelievable. In the same episode, she went from 'trying to convience Rika' to 'I will make Rika surrender'. Where was even the though process, which resulted in that decision? It just felt unnatural and forced. She did't even comment on Rika's 100 years of suffering and she felt no sympathy for her. Considering her actions in damashi arcs, she just became irredeemable. I absolutely hate the direction with Satoko's character.I can understand that she was a victim of abuse and there's always a possibility of her doing the same to the closest persons in the future. But that? The leaps in logic, or rather it's absence in creating this crazy looping girl was so over the top. Satoko just gone from point 3 or 4 to 34 and that huge gap wasn't even connected. That is not how character development should look like.Satoko in full 'Lambdadelta mode' looked like somebody wanted to write Umineko fan fiction about lesbian witches in the world of Higurashi and it's not a good sign. I don't care about origin story of witches, if it means destroying characters and themes of the original.Therefore I will lower my score by 2 and give Satokowashi 6/10Overall 5/10Higurashi Gou is anime, which obviously tried to please both newcomers and old watchers, but it failed on both fronts. Newbies got confused by revelations in later half and old fans were bored with first half of anime. But at least for the second group, it was a bit more enjoyable, because they could easily spot the differences and make theories. Show has multiple good concepts, but some of them were badly executed due to poor writing or direction. There were lots of things I liked, but also a lot of things I disliked.As of now, Higurashi Gou does not live up the original visual novel and anime. It destroyed the theme of friendship and shallowed Rika's 100 years of suffering for the sake of...? What is even the point of this sequel? It adds nothing to the original story and completely ruins the ending of Higurashi Kai, which Rika with help from her friends worked so hard for.I hope Higurashi Sotsu will change things for the better, but... I don't even know if I want to watch it. Direction is what really worries me. If it just going to be Lambdadelta and Bernkastel backstory with no good resolution, I will just pretend it doesn't exist. I was rooting for Rika and her friends to finally win and it happened after lots of hardships and suffering. It was well deserved miracle.With Higurashi Gou, Rika was thrown again into the loop. I was very interested what the story has to show and in what direction it will go. I took liking in art style. Voice actors were gladly the same. Opening and ending were very good and they set the atmosphere and expectations.First disappointment hit with episode 4. After 3 episodes with very much the same content as original, it finally showed something new and interesting, only to end it quickly and move to the next arc. The same happened with next two arcs.This is clearly a sequel. Then why first 13 episodes looked like reused versions of older arcs? It just looks like creator did not have any idea how to write new arcs around new mystery, so he copied from original, add minor differences and too little new scenes, which for most parts looked like last minute plot twists to shock the audience. From my perspective, there was barely new content to keep me interested.And it's not even the only problem. Rika already know the culprit and she said, that she's gonna get back her happy ending. Then why very little was done by her in first 3 loops? Patting Tomitake's head and giving Keiichi some advice can't be called an attempts to fight with looming tragedy. In matsuribayashi arc from Higurashi Kai, she asked Irie, Tomitake and Akasaka for help. Then she talked with her friends and Ooishi to prepare a plan to fight with Takano and mountain dogs. Only with this she finally defeat the fate. And somehow in Higurashi Gou she forgot how to fight and ask for help. Dumbing down a character to make plot move forward is not a good way of storytelling.Introducing Hanyuu in episode 2 and then not showing her for next 12 episodes was such a waste. And when she finally showed up, not even 5 minutes have passed and she disappeared again. She was very important character in prequel, but here she barely existed. All this damashi arcs would be a bit better to swallow, if only she at least appeared after every chapter to discuss events with Rika. This would also provide some great context to Rika's hopeless situation presented in ep 14.Mystery aspect was lacking. It became very obvious who was working behind the scenes since ep 8. Even another looper theory was formed during that time. Problem is the plot, which followed original for the most part and gave too few new scenes. Thus it was easy to work out theories that were later confirmed in second half.Horror aspects were hit or miss. I liked scenes with Rena coming upstairs or banging on the door in Keiichi's house, but disliked USODA and Mion ladder scene. Some of them had great atmosphere and looked creepy and others clearly lacked execution or build up.Soundtrack was unfortunately disappointing. Nothing really stands out. There were few new tracks, but most of them were lazily copied from the old anime. And for most scenes I had a feeling that music was too quiet. Too bad ost from visual novel weren't included, because it's great.That's my rating for first 3 arcs:Onidamashi 6/10Watadamashi 5/10Tataridamashi 4/10Let's move to Nekodamashi arc. Episode 14 showed something new and interesting. Finally Rika's perspective has been shown and her despair after earlier tragedies. It gave me high hopes, that second cour will redeem this show.And how I was wrong by episode 15. It was pointless episode with unnecessary gore. These scenes were supposed to make me feel bad for Rika, but instead it made me angry at creators for wasting what could be very good 4 or 5 loops, especially the Akasaka one. They just decided to speed run Rika's deaths. I would rather watch full versions of these arcs instead of previous three. And even though the rest of the arc was good, I was still bitter about what was wasted in single episode.But on the good note, it was also the arc, where most of my theories find confirmation and some clarifications have been made to what was actually going on. Satoko reveal as a looper was cool. Takano apologizing to Rika was something I always wanted to see. Some more club activity was a welcome.My score for Nekodamashi is 6/10. Could be better if not for ep 15Moving to the next one.I really liked Satokowashi chapter when it started. It felt like a propel sequel.

This is not a thriller anime.There is very little suspense.  There is rarely any build up to anything terrible that happens.  It's missing all the essential elements that make up a horror anime.This is a slice of life anime where once every few episodes someone's face gets smashed with a baseball bat out of the blue.  So it's slice of life mixed with gore happening to children.Granted this is Higurashi, I expected terrible things to happen to children.  And I am happy to hear more of the story after the original first two seasons,...but this was poorly executed.  Only watch if you've watched the first two seasons, and need to know what happens afterwards.Edit: The last arc of this series is actually really good, and sets everything nicely for the next season.  It's unfortunate the rest of it was pretty much wasted potential.  I have bumped my overall up to a 7 to account for this. but this was poorly executed.

It felt like deja vu but not quite. The story is the same until episode 2 but it leaves the watcher wondering what can they possibly add to this classic to make it better. Branching out from just Rika\'s character development made me feel more enjoyment in watching the series as it really took a HUGE turn in what Higurashi is. I don\'t want to spoil anything but for those who have dropped this please pick it up...and watch until Rika\'s loops ""end"".  You won\'t regret it. The art is consistent with anime from 2021 taking on that classic Higurashi aesthetic with updated designs and colors. The OST and BGM and OP and EDS are fantastic. Characters are the same overall but the voice acting and parts seem rushed but they improve as the series ends.

I usually don't write reviews on here but I'm kind of incensed.Okay, my experience with Higurashi Gou, as a long-time fan of the franchise: it starts out wobbly but generally competent. It really hits its stride in the middle, with some really effective horror. I was loving it at that point. I would probably have accepted it if this season was presented as, say, a look into some of the loops never seen in the original or something like that. Like, it wouldn't really be a sequel that could add anything, but at the same time, it wouldn't have as much scope...to do something stupid. And in my opinion, the way the last ~25% of Higurashi Gou plays out is pretty stupid.I don't think this sequel can justify its existence as a meaningful addition to the series, although to be honest that's par for the course with this franchise-- Rei, Kira and Kaku were all various shades from 'appalling' to 'meh'. I guess I put too much trust in Gou because it wasn't an OVA. That's on me.The thing that really grinds my gears is the characterisation, I guess. Avoiding spoilers as far as I can, I guess I'll just say one of the major characters does some pretty bad stuff, and the 'excuse' is a lot weaker than you usually see in the franchise. I don't think it meshes well with the image of the character presented in previous volumes, and I don't think this volume puts in enough legwork for it to be a legitimate development of their character. It felt more like a cheap 'wouldn't that be messed up' twist than a justified continuation of the story, adding no value and actually taking away from the whole.But, you know, that's all about the last arc. To be fair, I really enjoyed it up until then. It's got some pretty good scares, and even a few really clever moments. Even the parts that aren't spectacular are at least, like, fine. Sound is fine; nothing remarkable. Art is alright too, though a little too plastic for my taste, and sometimes it looks really off, but not often enough to be glaring. I also sort of liked some of the last arc before it all went off the rails way too fast to have the intended emotional impact.I'm sure there will be people who liked it, and that's fine, but it's absolutely not for me. to do something stupid.

Higurashi Gou starts with the first 3 story arcs of the original material, BUT each has a twist and a different ending. From episode 14 onward it's completely new material, so if you're an old fan and don't want to sift through old stuff, watch from then on. You will lose some clues related to the new villain however.Q: SHOULD I WATCH THIS, AS A NEWCOMER?A: Yesn't. The creators wanted to make this newcomer-friendly, BUT as a newcomer, you'll lose a lot of hints...along the way. Besides its slice of life and horror elements, Higurashi is first and foremost a puzzle MYSTERY. The mystery in Gou is a new one, compared to the one in the old anime/manga/visual novel. For it to work, it spoils some major plot twists of the original material ever since episode 2 (who the real main character is and why the plot keeps happening).In short: if you want the original Higurashi experience, then enjoy the old stuff. If you don't feel like going through 8 story arcs of the visual novel/manga or watching ~50 episodes of the old anime, no matter how good they are, then try Gou. BUT keep in mind that if you like Gou and want to enjoy more Higurashi, you will definitely go into the old material already spoiled and experience less fun.Q: SHOULD I WATCH THIS, AS AN OLD FAN?A: Absolutely, BUT only if you're ready to accept it for what it is: a completely new storyline. The old Higurashi dealt a lot with themes of hope and overcoming fate. Higurashi Gou is, simply put, a villain origin story, dealing with themes like growing apart, learning to let go, and the obsession that comes when you don't. If you don't feel like experiencing that, then maybe Gou isn't for you.Q: A LOT OF THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, DO WE EVER GET ANY ANSWERS?A: Higurashi (and the When They Cry franchise in general) has always been organized into question arcs and answer arcs. Whenever something seems off, like murders not making sense, or characters acting weird out of the blue, it's a deliberate part of the mystery. By figuring out the reasons behind these contradictions, you'll get closer to uncovering the answers. A lot of the fun in the When They Cry series comes from wrecking your brain to figure stuff out, either on your own, or through discussing theories online. If that's not your thing, then the franchise is probably not for you. If it is, hop online to Reddit, YouTube theories or something similar and get lost making sense of the puzzle. The first three story arcs get an answer in the latter part of Gou, BUT the entire season works more like a huge question arc in itself that will get an answer in season 2, Sotsu. (Hence why so many people are hating on this, because they're only seeing the question half of the riddle.)Q: IS THIS CANON?A: Yes, Ryukishi07 (the brain behind the original Higurashi visual novel) wrote the script. There are a couple of interviews on the Funimation YouTube channel about his vision for the series.Q: IS THIS RELATED TO THE OTHER WHEN THEY CRY SERIES, UMINEKO AND CICONIA?A: Yes, but in a meta/Easter Egg kind of way, rather than a crossover kind of way. You'll definitely enjoy Gou more if you know those Easter Eggs, but they're not crucial for understanding the series.That being said, if you are curious about the other WTC titles, Ciconia only exists as a visual novel right now and Umineko has a masterpiece of a visual novel and manga, and a shitty mediocre anime. Don't watch the anime. Try the VN (there are tons of YouTube let's play videos if you don't feel like buying it on Steam) or the manga.Q: IS THE ART ANY GOOD?A: It's either hit or miss. I enjoyed it greatly as it was very close to the visual novel with all the cutesy character designs and saturated colors, but your mileage may vary.Q: IS THE AUDIO ANY GOOD?A: Hell yes it is. The old voice actors reprissed their roles, they used Kawai Kenji's soundtrack from the old anime, and the new OP and EDs are god-tier imo. The first ending in particular has gorgeous art attached to a melancholic tune that will tug at your heartstrings.Q: ARE THE CHARACTERS ANY GOOD?A: The first half of the anime occasionally sacrifices characters for plot, but you still get a sense of depth to most of them. The second half gets into the meat of the story and fleshes out the two main characters in a wonderfully intricate way. The new villain in particular is hella fun to watch descend to darkness. BUT if you are an old fan who doesn't like their old characters getting an unexpected negative development, then you won't enjoy it. However, if you decide to play along, you're in for a hell of a delicious dynamic between these two.Q: WHAT'S THE PACING LIKE?A: I'll be honest, because Higurashi is made of self-contained arcs, if you watch one episode at a time, it might seem like it leads to nowhere. It's the reason I decided to wait after finishing the first 2 arcs while they aired, and binged everything from the start in 2 days. Seeing one arc at a time however and stopping to reassess the info you know and discuss it with others works really well, and so does just watching it all at once and then hopping onto theorizing.Q: IS THE STORY ANY GOOD?A: If you're in for one heck of a mystery where you're going to have to work your way around the puzzle pieces, as opposed to being spoonfed the answers, then yes. If you have a more passive approach, and only want to kill some time, it won't work for you. That being said, for me, the story was hella entertaining and I finished the season absolutely stoked for the sequel.Q: HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO THE OLD HIGURASHI?A: They're like apples and oranges, both amazing series that accomplish different things. If you want the same story with the same tone, just by a different studio, you will hate Gou. Gou is, like I mentioned, not a story of hope BUT a villain origin story that takes a dark turn from the midpoint onward. As an old When They Cry fan, I found it about as dangerously delicious as binge eating an entire jar of Nutella, and then having a brainstorming session to figure out what led me to do it in the first place. As a newcomer, you will be left confused at times, but might still get a kick.Q: WILL WE EVER GET A PROPER UMINEKO ANIME?A: Sotsu will certainly lead to that miracle. along the way.

Trust me.Overall: Fantano Style - Strong 8 to Light 9I like this series a lot, it is hard to get into, but once you do, since it\'s original content, it keeps you wanting for more. If you can handle watching the other two seasons, it\'s 100% recommended.', ""So, Higurashi went and made another bad sequel.  I'm not even sure why I'm surprised to be honest.The show has an animation budget this time.  In theory, I'd call that a good thing, but I suspect that's actually made the show worse somehow.  There's a couple of good side by side clips on YouTube that you can watch, but in short.  The new series doesn't seem to understand why certain scenes were creepy in the first place.The dialogue doesn't help.  For example when Shion chases away the ruffians in the first series, she says two lines...to the guys.  It's framed perfectly with her on the top of the stairs, and the three guys at the bottom.  As one of the guys starts to climb the stairs in order to approach her, a crowd starts to gather.  Every difference in that crowd with the new show is important.  There's elderly and even two little girls and everyone has a cold look on their face.  When the bad guys get creeped out, they leave and suddenly everyone pleasantly smiles at Keiichi.  That's what sells that scene.The new show drags the dialogue out, showing how Shion doesn't really have control over the situation.  The only people that show up are just young and middle age adults.  It's not really that creepy that a bunch of adults would show up to stop two teenagers from getting harassed by criminals.  Then, because of the poor pacing, the scene has to continue over to the next episode.This is a recurring problem in the new series.  Both the jokes and the creepy scenes involve way to much dialogue and ruin the pacing of the show.  The show gives off a feeling that it's rushing towards the new stuff, but the episodes I watched literally follow the original episodes and hit the same highlights.  The real reason is that the original knew how to bring the show to a screeching halt and emphasize when things were wrong.  The new studio doesn't seem to understand that, so we get glowing eyes, and way too many voice lines that don't actually say anything.  The stillness of the original anime was one of it's strengths because when the anime needed to make an impact, a character starring someone down was really all it took.  When the show needed to get goofy it could amp up it's cartoony aesthetic to make it easier to animate while still being cute.In the 7 episodes I watched there are other problems too.  Every character seems way to infatuated with Keiichi, bordering on a harem anime.  The writers also seem desperate to remind the old fans of everyone's character traits so they make sure to constantly bring them out, even when it's unnecessary.  I don't even remember if I heard any of the oppressive cicadas crying (which is in the name of the show).I won't spoil it, but I did look up the plot twist after episode 7 to see if this anime was going anywhere and it's not.  In all honesty I can't explain how dumb that twist is without spoiling the original, but you should just go watch the original and Kai instead.  Considering that most characters know what went down in the first two seasons after Kai ends, I find it pretty dumb that anyone could forget about all the murder they'd have to deal with. to the guys.

As they were made by people who had watched the original, It's hard to properly judge Gou without being a bit bias.There are things that's different for sure about this and the original one. That'd definitely give you a different experience. But It isn't as poorly done as people made it to be. I'd say it's great, but it's still hard to tell as there are still many episodes left.I think that many felt Gou isn't as good as the masterpiece that is the original simply felt that day because of nostalgic. Do...note that they're watching a second time, although different, it'll never feel like the original. As a rewatcher myself, I personally experienced this. I don't expect this to be just as good as the original, because I'd need to erase my memory to watch it again. It's simply impossible.Despite having already watched the original, I still felt the foreboding sensation that something bad will happen, and when something did happen, I'd feel terrified. The only thing from a rewatcher's perspective I don't get to experience is the mystery part of the Anime since I generally know where it'll go.So, don't let others deter you from watching this version.

Basically a full knowledge of the main storyline of every When They Cry VN.]In recent times, Higurashi Gou has quite possibly the highest barrier of entry for an anime series. Not only do you have to be familiar with the original Higurashi\'s plot, but you also have had to invest anywhere between 100 to 200 hours for the greater...When They Cry series as well. It\'s really a show only for the most dedicated and hardcore of fans, with almost no solace or respite for anyone in between in spite of the deceptive interviews by the anime staff and (especially) R07 himself. And I absolutely love Gou for this.Most of the animosity you see here, or even other parts of the web are understandable, given how this was initially marketed as a remake with ""SUBTLE DIFFERENCES"" only for R07 to pull the rug at Episode 2 for newcomers to the franchise and twice more at Episode 20 for people who didn\'t read Umineko and at Episode 21 for people who didn\'t read Ciconia. If you are at all interested in watching Gou, going through the original Higurashi story, as well as Umineko and whatever exists of Ciconia is mandatory. Otherwise, join me as I spend the rest of this review lavishly praising Gou. To the best of my abilities, I will refrain from spoiling too much, but certain plot elements are hard to talk about given how radical a change Gou takes at the midway point. Rest assured I will remove as much context from the scenes as possible to preserve the surprise.For me, Higurashi has never been a particularly effective horror anime. As someone who started the series with the DEEN anime (which naturally had a negative effect upon reading the VNs), the horror scenes are campy as they are schlocky, which isn\'t a bad thing since I ended up appreciating other aspects of the series more in different ways. I\'ve said before how the series blends multiple genres together in a blender to create something truly spectacular and wild without over-relying on a certain genre convention. Gou carries that torch effortlessly. As a canonical sequel to the original series, it is as wild and campy and schlocky as the original DEEN anime. Throughout most of the show, I had a dopey grin permanently plastered onto my face as events transpired onscreen. R07\'s wild ride knows no bounds, and I do not mean that lightly. That disclaimer in the beginning was not a joke, and once you get to the midpoint, every episode is just a maddening rush that makes you feel like you\'re a Theatergoing Witch.The comedy is superb, both intentional and unintentional moments. The Gilligan Cut in Episode 15 nearly broke me, and the show is easily the funniest of the Winter 2021 season. When I say Unintentional Comedy, I don\'t mean it as a negative dig on the show. I meant that in the most earnest way possible, as when a scene the staff clearly poured effort into making as serious as possible came out in the worst possible way yet wrapping around to becoming incredibly charming, which still holds incredible value to me (such as the infamous prison scene which came out of a miscommunication between R07 and the anime staff). It\'s fascinating on so many levels. Many moments in Gou easily hold a candle to or even exceed those from the DEEN anime in terms of memorability and impact. While DEEN\'s rendition of the ""USODA!"" scene can\'t be topped, the Chandelier scene will no doubt go down as the one of the Reiwa Era\'s most memorable anime scenes. It is that combination of pure-hearted intention and schlocky execution that makes these scenes so memorable as they are.In terms of plot progression, the first half is incredibly boring after about Episode 4. In a move not too dissimilar to Muv Luv Alternative, there is a rehash of the first 3 arcs from the original Higurashi albeit with subtle differences here and there. This is easily the most boring part of the whole series but it isn\'t without merit. Seeing familiar scenes rendered 15 years later by a different studio with a vastly improved art direction does makes things soothing to the eye. As well as seeing scenes not originally adapted by DEEN (such as the Tsubamegaeshi scene from Minagoroshi-hen) is a welcome addition. Moreover, it\'s fun to speculate what do the minor differences constitute in terms of foreshadowing, and how the plot will progress from here on out.The second half of Gou is magical. Many things you wouldn\'t expect to happen transpire in the latter 2 arcs, even certain plot contrivances and plot holes are discussed with an intention to be rectified in the future. If you are in any way a WTC fan who hasn\'t watched Gou yet for thinking it\'s just a remake, once you reach the second half of Gou, you will be in for a real treat. Satoko went from my least favourite character in the series to becoming my absolute favourite. While some may view the characterizations of the cast to be contentious, I find these changes to be a natural progression of their characters.Moreso than Saikoroshi-hen, Gou provides an intriguing outlook on what happens after the Happy End of Matsuribayashi-hen, and how it ties together with the greater WTC series. For this point alone Gou (and the upcoming Sotsu) does not and cannot stand on its own, given how reliant it is on one\'s knowledge of its sister/parent series. However, it is the glue that ties everything together. Whether that becomes a mess remains to be seen, but with the quality of Gou, I am confident it\'ll work out in both the best and worst possible ways, and that prospect is exciting.At the time of this writing, Gou has ended inconclusively with Sotsu announced to be released 4 months later. Therefore, with great confidence I fully expect R07 to deliver on a spectacular conclusion on the level of his other works with this sequel series. For now, we still have this wonderful series to look upon. The first 13 episodes may be looked back as a necessary evil to get the plot to going where it goes, and I am strapped on for R07\'s wild ride to wherever it takes me. When They Cry series as well.

The 2006 Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni adaptation and it’s sequel Higurashi Kai remains my favourite anime of all time. It made me love the horror genre and was the anime that got me properly invested into anime. Sure I was watching anime beforehand but Higurashi was the show that really got me into anime. It managed to tell an intriguing and well structured story with likeable but flawed characters and an ost that set the mood and tone while also being an unnerving horror experience. So naturally, hearing back at the beginning of 2020 that Higurashi was...getting a new anime adaptation, you could’ve imagined I was ecstatic to hear it was coming back; with signs pointing it to be a remake which I would’ve welcomed because while I would recommend that you go watch the 2006 Higurashi, the animation has not held up all that well.Then we find out while it started airing that this is not a remake but rather a remake/sequel hybrid with emphasis on sequel. While that intrigued me, it also worried me as the OVAs proved, Higurashi’s story is wrapped up, it’s done. There wasn’t really anything to go on from there. But it’s approach to it was interesting. But then it was that line that series creator, Ryukishi07, said after episode two aired that this would be a series that would satisfy old fans of the series but also be a jumping on point for new fans to enjoy. Which I say, bulls**t. A lot of it does require context to the original Higurashi and it straight up spoils the mystery of the original so you won’t have the same experience if you decide to go back and watch the original after watching this. So I will say this:IF YOU PLAN TO WATCH THIS SEASON FIRST, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON’T. WATCH OR PLAY OR READ THE ORIGINAL FIRST, THEN COME BACK TO THIS SEASON IF YOU LIKED IT.Okay with that cleared up, let’s talk about this new season of Higurashi and if I found to have lived up to the hype and my expectations.Sit back, relax and I hope you still have some laughing gas left to breathe manically with as I present to you the anime review for Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Gou. Let’s begin shall we?Also, some spoilers if you have not seen or played the original Higurashi or Higurashi Kai.Story: 3.5/10Set in June 1983 in a small Japanese village of Hinamizawa, Keiichi Maebara has just moved into this village and is already enjoying his life here with his friends being Rena Ryuuguu, Mion SonozakI, Satoko Hojou and Rika Furude. They go to school, hang out and play games with each another. All is well until Keiichi finds out about a series of murders and disappearances that occurred every night of the Watanagashi festival. With it happening again and his friends keeping secrets from him, he soon learns that there is more going on in this villagethan he realises.MEANWHILE…Rika finds herself awakening in one of the fragments between worlds without knowing how or why she is here. Only for Hanyuu to tell her that she is being sent back to June 1983. Annoyed but determined, Rika vows to get out the loop that is June 1983 and find out why she is sent back there in the first place.So like I said earlier, this is a sort of remake/sequel hybrid. So while it does take place after the events of Higurashi, Higurashi Kai and Higurashi Rei, it’s set in the same time period as the original with the similar arcs to previous entries, but with some subtle and not so subtle differences. And much like previous entries it is divided up into question arcs and answer arcs with question arcs laying out clues and mysteries only to be explained in the answer arcs. So the groundwork is laid out, the problem is in it’s execution. One of the dynamics to the original’s mystery was what the character’s see and what they believe to be true or not. Is it real or is it merely a figment of their imagination. Gou doesn’t use this to it’s advantage to screw with the viewer and throw them off the trail. Most of the time, it’s mainly used for shock value and have little meaning outside of the big picture and even then, it wasn’t really effective. I imagine it’s to try and not confuse viewers since two mysteries are going on. The mystery of the curse of Oryshiro-sama and how Rika got sent back to June 1983 and how to get out of the loop again. But the original mystery kind of gets thrown under the bus because while there are clues to the mystery of Oryshiro-sama, the full on execution of that mystery is done p**s poor here. It’s neglected and straight up spoils the reveal without the build-up or knowing how we got into this position to solve it, undermining it entirely despite its significance to the overarching story of Higurashi.No, the real focus is on this new mystery and how Rika ended up back in June 1983. This is where the changes in each arc happen with how the characters act and how scenes and events change due to those character actions, it does make things unexpected since we don’t what these subtle actions and changes will do the narrative. So when this new mystery does open up more and you get this feeling that multiple people are pulling the strings here. People who have watched or played the original would probably pick up on these (some obviously quicker than others) and it does make for a nice brain tickler to pick out these differences and what do they mean. But here lies my problem, while people with previous knowledge of Higurashi would understand it. But here lies a problem with this being a jumping on point for new viewers because the show is more focused on the new mystery, the Oryshiro-sama’s curse mystery is a complete mess that doesn’t properly get explained for a new viewer to understand. This is why I say you should start from the beginning with the original because on top of the half baked mystery from the original not executed nowhere near as well as the original and a new mystery that kind of needs knowledge of previous seasons for some much needed context. Yeah sure, the original obviously left clues and mysteries that puzzled viewers, but it was never in your face about it and again, this is a sequel that is also meat to be a jumping on point for new viewers. The narrative just fails and being a jumping on point for new viewers who haven’t seen, haven’t played or even read the original because of that poor execution.As for the arcs themselves, they serve their purpose but the pacing of these arcs is quite rough. This is because of the gradual descent from slice of life to psychological horror isn’t as well paced compared to previous arcs of the series. What made the horror work in previous seasons was that gradual descent into madness as things started to escalate until we reached that arc’s climatic point. Here, it kind of happens all at once and rushes through it, rather than it slowly escalating as the situation gets worse and worse. The mindf**kery isn’t nearly as effective as it doesn’t give it time to breathe and process what has happened? What is real? And what is merely a figment of the characters imagination? There isn’t that tension or that sense of uneasiness as our characters find more and more about what’s going on.It ain’t all bad though. Gou’s fifth arc, “Satokowashi-hen,” is easily the best arc of the season and captures what makes Higurashi great. Being this season’s prominent answer arc, It greatly captures the horror and tension while slowly revealing some answers to this new mystery at a great pace. I love it but I wish the other arcs were executed just as well for the other arcs of Higurashi Gou.Characters: 8.5/10Honestly, there isn’t much to complain here about the characters of Higurashi Gou. They are all pretty much how we remember them with their quirks and flaws that make them great characters. Well I say that, it is there but not as effective as previous seasons. Rika still is still the clear, over-arcing protagonist despite three of the arcs are from Keiichi’s perspective. Rika does give of this sense that she is tired of this and just wants to live a happy life that doesn’t end up with her being dead and repeating it again. I mean her constant death and rebirth makes Subaru’s a walk in the park. It wants to show that Rika is at her breaking point and make you sympathise with her and wish for her to live the life she wants. By seeing her gruesome deaths not just in Higurashi Gou but in previous seasons as well and it only escalating, you would naturally feel sorry for her and wish it would end. It doesn’t force you to make you feel pity for her, but rather just show her plight, even if we are not in her perspective in particular arcs.Then there is this seasons antagonist, the “Puppet Master” as it were. I won’t spoil it but let’s just say if you have a keen eye, you could pick up on who it is with the hints across each arc but the way it is laid out is that something is clearly going on relating to that person. The way it builds it up across the arcs to the reveal is pretty well done honestly as slowly becomes more and more obvious instead of it just coming out of nowhere, with it revealing just enough before the big reveal. The motivation is a bit out there but in the context of Higurashi and the reasons why people go crazy and irrational, it makes more sense than you realise.Animation: 4.5/10This is one of the areas that I was most looking forward to seeing how it was done. Previous seasons of Higurashi (specifically season one) have not held up all that well in terms of it’s animation. Despite the sloppiness adding to the horror at times, some scenes that were meant to be scary just look silly and the designs looked basic with disproportionate heads. Kai certainly improved it but not to an impressive standard. So I was certainly looking forward to seeing how this was done. But instead of Studio Deen doing it this time, it’s studio Passione who did the animation for this season. Odd choice since this is a studio more known for it’s fan service type shows. Heck, the previous anime that they worked on before this was the controversial but still enjoyable Interspecies Reviewers.So the animation for Higurashi Gou looks okay. The moe, slice of life art style does capture the lighter tone of the show before going full horror with bright colours to make it more vibrant and to help transition from these characters going from slice of life to psychological horror. But it’s that change of tone to horror where I do have some gripes. Firstly, as if they are trying to signify that we are in a horror scene, the screen gets darker in the corners and the visuals start scratching like in old movies, as if to change the tone visually. But it doesn’t work because it essentially is like flipping the switch to horror mode instead of it just slowly transitioning into that “oh s**t” moment. It adds artificial horror that this show doesn’t need. That’s not the only noticeable thing though as character designs also look sharper as well with a heavier black outlines that makes the scene more serious. This I don’t mind too much as while it does carry the same problems, it’s less jarring and actually adds to the unnerving nature of the scene much better than dimming the brightness of the scene.Speaking of character designs, well they certainly retain the designs that made them recognisable, some changes I’m not a fan of. Most notably, making character’s hair look shiny. For some characters, I do think it works, for others not so much. Mainly Keiichi as the shininess makes his hair look wet. It was a gripe that I had before the show aired and it still is as it just looks off. Still, his change in causal clothes to a thin, sleeveless vest from that flak jacket he had before looks more realistic.Then there is the violence and gore that this series is kind of disrespectfully known for. Sure it’s there but it was always used sparingly. Here, it’s still the same case as the violence and gore is still used sparingly. But this is certainly the most visceral Higurashi has ever been, even more so than the Outbreak OVA. Blood is everywhere, guts are exposed and heads are getting smashed or even cut off at times with more clearer visuals. It definitely has scenes that make your stomach churn. It definitely has the body horror element nailed down. But again though, most of the time, they do use it sparingly, barring episodes 15 and 16 but that was mainly due to story structure.The last thing I want to talk about are some of the scenes remade in this season. This being small part remake, some of the scenes were bound to make a return for narrative reasons and most of them worked out. The Mion ladder scene looks much better than it did before, even if they kind of cheaped out on the animation. But other scenes like Rena’s “USODA!” is just not as unnerving as it was before.Sound: 9/10Kenji Kawai remains one of my favourite anime composers to date, mainly for his work in previous Higurashi seasons, Gundam 00 and No Guns Life and thankfully, he has returned. Although saying that, a lot of the ost remains the same ost used before in previous Higurashi outings. Not that’s really a complaint as Higurashi’s soundtrack is one of the best and it’s still used in the right moments. There are some new tracks in there as well and they do stand out to be noticeably new. The most notable of which is probably the one played during the climatic point of episode four and the one played in the show’s second PV. It’s a great ost of a scene spiralling down into madness with no going back. Of course, we can’t forget the show’s use of cicada’s and their sounds used ominously to signify that something bad is has or is going to happen.Then there is the opening, ""I believe what you said"" by Asaka. Now, Higurashi openings have always seemed to match the tone of their respective seasons. Hell, even that abomination of an OVA in the form of Higurashi Kira has an opening that fits with the tone of the OVA. Here, it’s no different. There is a sense of mystery and desperation with how the OP sounds with a hint of horror to go along with it to make it a bit more chilling. Visually there is the visual scratching that plays throughout the op which is nice aesthetically but doesn’t really add anything tone wise. But it’s also littered with clues of objects that relate to the plot of Gou as if it is a visual hint of things to come; with also a character cloaked in shadow that Umineko fans were probably licking their chops at knowing exactly who it was.Then there are the endings which I think are the best in the series. Both “Kamisama no Syndrome” by Ayane and ""Fukisokusei Entropy” by Ayane as well are both good songs that carry a certain tone to them. The first one especially with it sounding rather depressing with gorgeous art in the background highlighting the friendship between these characters and their own personal burdens they face alone. The second one as well does similar things but I won’t say anything due to narrative spoilers.ConclusionI’m very indifferent about Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Gou. My feelings towards Gou gives the same feelings of how I felt about another favourite anime of mine, Code Geass: Lelouch of the Resurrection. Nice to have but completely unnecessary. While it does contain it’s own mystery that does get better as time goes on, it disrespects the original mystery by using it as merely a stepping on point. Spoiling it as well doesn’t help new viewers who might want to check out the original Higurashi and Higurashi Kai. It’s that line that Ryukishi07 said that this would be a great jumping on  point for new viewers to experience this series. In that case, it fails to deliver a satisfying note for new viewers to jump on to. Plus, not being fundamentally good as previous seasons as well doesn’t help. Having only one arc that delivers on the expectations set beforehand doesn’t make the series as a whole good. It ain’t bad as a whole and does have some good qualities but Higurashi Gou does not live up to my expectations when compared to what came before it. While we ain’t done yet, I think my opinion on Higurashi Gou is set in stone.For fans of the series, it’s serviceable enough to have some enjoyment but you have most likely seen better. For new viewers though, this is a stay away until you’ve watched or played the original Higurashi, it’s sequel Kai and even the OVA Rei to some regard but that one isn’t required as much.My Personal Enjoyment: 5/10Overall Score: 6.1/10 Recommendation: Consider itI think this has been my longest review yet. getting a new anime adaptation, you could’ve imagined I was ecstatic to hear it was coming back; with signs pointing it to be a remake which I would’ve welcomed because while I would recommend that you go watch the 2006 Higurashi, the animation has not held up all that well.Then we find out while it started airing that this is not a remake but rather a remake/sequel hybrid with emphasis on sequel. While that intrigued me, it also worried me as the OVAs proved, Higurashi’s story is wrapped up, it’s done. There wasn’t really anything to go on from there. But it’s approach to it was interesting. But then it was that line that series creator, Ryukishi07, said after episode two aired that this would be a series that would satisfy old fans of the series but also be a jumping on point for new fans to enjoy. Which I say, bulls**t. A lot of it does require context to the original Higurashi and it straight up spoils the mystery of the original so you won’t have the same experience if you decide to go back and watch the original after watching this. So I will say this:IF YOU PLAN TO WATCH THIS SEASON FIRST, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON’T. WATCH OR PLAY OR READ THE ORIGINAL FIRST, THEN COME BACK TO THIS SEASON IF YOU LIKED IT.Okay with that cleared up, let’s talk about this new season of Higurashi and if I found to have lived up to the hype and my expectations.Sit back, relax and I hope you still have some laughing gas left to breathe manically with as I present to you the anime review for Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Gou. Let’s begin shall we?Also, some spoilers if you have not seen or played the original Higurashi or Higurashi Kai.Story: 3.5/10Set in June 1983 in a small Japanese village of Hinamizawa, Keiichi Maebara has just moved into this village and is already enjoying his life here with his friends being Rena Ryuuguu, Mion SonozakI, Satoko Hojou and Rika Furude. They go to school, hang out and play games with each another. All is well until Keiichi finds out about a series of murders and disappearances that occurred every night of the Watanagashi festival. With it happening again and his friends keeping secrets from him, he soon learns that there is more going on in this villagethan he realises.MEANWHILE…Rika finds herself awakening in one of the fragments between worlds without knowing how or why she is here. Only for Hanyuu to tell her that she is being sent back to June 1983. Annoyed but determined, Rika vows to get out the loop that is June 1983 and find out why she is sent back there in the first place.So like I said earlier, this is a sort of remake/sequel hybrid. So while it does take place after the events of Higurashi, Higurashi Kai and Higurashi Rei, it’s set in the same time period as the original with the similar arcs to previous entries, but with some subtle and not so subtle differences. And much like previous entries it is divided up into question arcs and answer arcs with question arcs laying out clues and mysteries only to be explained in the answer arcs. So the groundwork is laid out, the problem is in it’s execution. One of the dynamics to the original’s mystery was what the character’s see and what they believe to be true or not. Is it real or is it merely a figment of their imagination. Gou doesn’t use this to it’s advantage to screw with the viewer and throw them off the trail. Most of the time, it’s mainly used for shock value and have little meaning outside of the big picture and even then, it wasn’t really effective. I imagine it’s to try and not confuse viewers since two mysteries are going on. The mystery of the curse of Oryshiro-sama and how Rika got sent back to June 1983 and how to get out of the loop again. But the original mystery kind of gets thrown under the bus because while there are clues to the mystery of Oryshiro-sama, the full on execution of that mystery is done p**s poor here. It’s neglected and straight up spoils the reveal without the build-up or knowing how we got into this position to solve it, undermining it entirely despite its significance to the overarching story of Higurashi.No, the real focus is on this new mystery and how Rika ended up back in June 1983. This is where the changes in each arc happen with how the characters act and how scenes and events change due to those character actions, it does make things unexpected since we don’t what these subtle actions and changes will do the narrative. So when this new mystery does open up more and you get this feeling that multiple people are pulling the strings here. People who have watched or played the original would probably pick up on these (some obviously quicker than others) and it does make for a nice brain tickler to pick out these differences and what do they mean. But here lies my problem, while people with previous knowledge of Higurashi would understand it. But here lies a problem with this being a jumping on point for new viewers because the show is more focused on the new mystery, the Oryshiro-sama’s curse mystery is a complete mess that doesn’t properly get explained for a new viewer to understand. This is why I say you should start from the beginning with the original because on top of the half baked mystery from the original not executed nowhere near as well as the original and a new mystery that kind of needs knowledge of previous seasons for some much needed context. Yeah sure, the original obviously left clues and mysteries that puzzled viewers, but it was never in your face about it and again, this is a sequel that is also meat to be a jumping on point for new viewers. The narrative just fails and being a jumping on point for new viewers who haven’t seen, haven’t played or even read the original because of that poor execution.As for the arcs themselves, they serve their purpose but the pacing of these arcs is quite rough. This is because of the gradual descent from slice of life to psychological horror isn’t as well paced compared to previous arcs of the series. What made the horror work in previous seasons was that gradual descent into madness as things started to escalate until we reached that arc’s climatic point. Here, it kind of happens all at once and rushes through it, rather than it slowly escalating as the situation gets worse and worse. The mindf**kery isn’t nearly as effective as it doesn’t give it time to breathe and process what has happened? What is real? And what is merely a figment of the characters imagination? There isn’t that tension or that sense of uneasiness as our characters find more and more about what’s going on.It ain’t all bad though. Gou’s fifth arc, “Satokowashi-hen,” is easily the best arc of the season and captures what makes Higurashi great. Being this season’s prominent answer arc, It greatly captures the horror and tension while slowly revealing some answers to this new mystery at a great pace. I love it but I wish the other arcs were executed just as well for the other arcs of Higurashi Gou.Characters: 8.5/10Honestly, there isn’t much to complain here about the characters of Higurashi Gou. They are all pretty much how we remember them with their quirks and flaws that make them great characters. Well I say that, it is there but not as effective as previous seasons. Rika still is still the clear, over-arcing protagonist despite three of the arcs are from Keiichi’s perspective. Rika does give of this sense that she is tired of this and just wants to live a happy life that doesn’t end up with her being dead and repeating it again. I mean her constant death and rebirth makes Subaru’s a walk in the park. It wants to show that Rika is at her breaking point and make you sympathise with her and wish for her to live the life she wants. By seeing her gruesome deaths not just in Higurashi Gou but in previous seasons as well and it only escalating, you would naturally feel sorry for her and wish it would end. It doesn’t force you to make you feel pity for her, but rather just show her plight, even if we are not in her perspective in particular arcs.Then there is this seasons antagonist, the “Puppet Master” as it were. I won’t spoil it but let’s just say if you have a keen eye, you could pick up on who it is with the hints across each arc but the way it is laid out is that something is clearly going on relating to that person. The way it builds it up across the arcs to the reveal is pretty well done honestly as slowly becomes more and more obvious instead of it just coming out of nowhere, with it revealing just enough before the big reveal. The motivation is a bit out there but in the context of Higurashi and the reasons why people go crazy and irrational, it makes more sense than you realise.Animation: 4.5/10This is one of the areas that I was most looking forward to seeing how it was done. Previous seasons of Higurashi (specifically season one) have not held up all that well in terms of it’s animation. Despite the sloppiness adding to the horror at times, some scenes that were meant to be scary just look silly and the designs looked basic with disproportionate heads. Kai certainly improved it but not to an impressive standard. So I was certainly looking forward to seeing how this was done. But instead of Studio Deen doing it this time, it’s studio Passione who did the animation for this season. Odd choice since this is a studio more known for it’s fan service type shows. Heck, the previous anime that they worked on before this was the controversial but still enjoyable Interspecies Reviewers.So the animation for Higurashi Gou looks okay. The moe, slice of life art style does capture the lighter tone of the show before going full horror with bright colours to make it more vibrant and to help transition from these characters going from slice of life to psychological horror. But it’s that change of tone to horror where I do have some gripes. Firstly, as if they are trying to signify that we are in a horror scene, the screen gets darker in the corners and the visuals start scratching like in old movies, as if to change the tone visually. But it doesn’t work because it essentially is like flipping the switch to horror mode instead of it just slowly transitioning into that “oh s**t” moment. It adds artificial horror that this show doesn’t need. That’s not the only noticeable thing though as character designs also look sharper as well with a heavier black outlines that makes the scene more serious. This I don’t mind too much as while it does carry the same problems, it’s less jarring and actually adds to the unnerving nature of the scene much better than dimming the brightness of the scene.Speaking of character designs, well they certainly retain the designs that made them recognisable, some changes I’m not a fan of. Most notably, making character’s hair look shiny. For some characters, I do think it works, for others not so much. Mainly Keiichi as the shininess makes his hair look wet. It was a gripe that I had before the show aired and it still is as it just looks off. Still, his change in causal clothes to a thin, sleeveless vest from that flak jacket he had before looks more realistic.Then there is the violence and gore that this series is kind of disrespectfully known for. Sure it’s there but it was always used sparingly. Here, it’s still the same case as the violence and gore is still used sparingly. But this is certainly the most visceral Higurashi has ever been, even more so than the Outbreak OVA. Blood is everywhere, guts are exposed and heads are getting smashed or even cut off at times with more clearer visuals. It definitely has scenes that make your stomach churn. It definitely has the body horror element nailed down. But again though, most of the time, they do use it sparingly, barring episodes 15 and 16 but that was mainly due to story structure.The last thing I want to talk about are some of the scenes remade in this season. This being small part remake, some of the scenes were bound to make a return for narrative reasons and most of them worked out. The Mion ladder scene looks much better than it did before, even if they kind of cheaped out on the animation. But other scenes like Rena’s “USODA!” is just not as unnerving as it was before.Sound: 9/10Kenji Kawai remains one of my favourite anime composers to date, mainly for his work in previous Higurashi seasons, Gundam 00 and No Guns Life and thankfully, he has returned. Although saying that, a lot of the ost remains the same ost used before in previous Higurashi outings. Not that’s really a complaint as Higurashi’s soundtrack is one of the best and it’s still used in the right moments. There are some new tracks in there as well and they do stand out to be noticeably new. The most notable of which is probably the one played during the climatic point of episode four and the one played in the show’s second PV. It’s a great ost of a scene spiralling down into madness with no going back. Of course, we can’t forget the show’s use of cicada’s and their sounds used ominously to signify that something bad is has or is going to happen.Then there is the opening, ""I believe what you said"" by Asaka. Now, Higurashi openings have always seemed to match the tone of their respective seasons. Hell, even that abomination of an OVA in the form of Higurashi Kira has an opening that fits with the tone of the OVA. Here, it’s no different. There is a sense of mystery and desperation with how the OP sounds with a hint of horror to go along with it to make it a bit more chilling. Visually there is the visual scratching that plays throughout the op which is nice aesthetically but doesn’t really add anything tone wise. But it’s also littered with clues of objects that relate to the plot of Gou as if it is a visual hint of things to come; with also a character cloaked in shadow that Umineko fans were probably licking their chops at knowing exactly who it was.Then there are the endings which I think are the best in the series. Both “Kamisama no Syndrome” by Ayane and ""Fukisokusei Entropy” by Ayane as well are both good songs that carry a certain tone to them. The first one especially with it sounding rather depressing with gorgeous art in the background highlighting the friendship between these characters and their own personal burdens they face alone.

I just wanna start by saying that i did not watch the original higurashi but i heard good things about it. Then an remake got announced, NOT.... Yeah, it turns out its actually a sequel to the original, but you don\'t actually need to watch the original to understand what\'s going on. Makes lots of sense right? Either way lets start the review.STORY: 6/10It starts off really really strongly, It\'s kinda creepy and fun but also manages to drop hints to the viewer as to what is actually going on. It\'s really good at keeping the mystery...up and for the first 10 episodes. Then, it just reveals what is going on. From there it just turns into a ""Oh shit this show is supposed to be gory"" (really tough, the first half of this show has less gore than a random family friendly show about a witch that game out in the 1st season). After the episode 10 the show just becomes boring. There is no big reveal, or slowly transitioning into what\'s actually going on. The show just goes: ""Yeah this is what\'s actually going on guys, so yeah, glad we cleared that up."". Im sure there was a better way.ART: 5Let me just say that I LOVE the Monogatari series so i wasn\'t disappointed when i heard that the person who did the character designs was working on Higurashi, and the fact that this show takes inspiration from the Monogatari series is obvious. The problem is that ONE:This is not the Monogatari series and TWO:Passione Studio doesn\'t have Shaft money to actually make the animation look good. The animation starts off pretty good but it just gets worse and worse as the show goes on. It\'s obvious that this was the studio\'s first ever 2 cour and i hope they can do better in the future.SOUND: 4/10Nothing too amazing. Here I can\'t even say it started of well because the music isn\'t really that good a lot of times being way too loud. The OP also isn\'t that good. The only things that are decent are the EP and the sound design.CHARACTER: 4/10The characters are a mess. The moment a character looks interesting and you start thinking that maybe this show is building to something the anime just says: ""hohoho, fuck you retard, we are doing something else, and everything that you know about that character? Forget it. Doesn\'t matter anymore.""; or they just move to the dumb fuck, boring side-plot. Disappointing.ENJOYMENT: 6/10I can\'t lie, even if i was never really impressed i was kinda enjoying myself for the first 5 episodes. It was fun and entertaining. But after that it just gets worse and worse.ENDING STATEMENT: High expectations, high disappointment. I was really expecting more. Either way, no one really likes this show. Fans of the original think it sucks, people who were expecting a remake were left disappointed. I don\'t recommend you watch this one.OVERALL: 5/10 up and for the first 10 episodes. Then, it just reveals what is going on. From there it just turns into a ""Oh shit this show is supposed to be gory"" (really tough, the first half of this show has less gore than a random family friendly show about a witch that game out in the 1st season).

I'm not sure what's going on with people or Mal that they think it is.THIS IS A SEQUEL NOT AN ADAPTION....(Please leave thoughts on my profile)The ending...... wtf is happening?!! Is Lambdadelta finally making her appearance now that Takano (pawn) is out of the game? Are they bringing Umineko into this now? What will Rika now have to do against her own bestfriend? This is certainly turning into something good and I can't wait! (Please leave thoughts on my profile)The ending...... wtf is happening?!! Is Lambdadelta finally making her appearance now that Takano (pawn) is out of the game? Are they bringing Umineko into this now? What will Rika now have to do against her own bestfriend? This is certainly turning into something good and I can't wait!"", 'FOR ANYONE WANTING TO START WATCHING THIS:This is not a remake of the original Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. This is the third season. I don\'t know why the creators did not make this clear, but whatever.If you want to watch everything you need to know before starting this, I recommend:1. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni2. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai3. (optional but I recommend) Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei~ extra: you can also play Umineko. I haven\'t actually finished yet, but I know there are a lot of connections you can make. This is definitely not needed, as I hadn\'t played the...game before watching these. Just something I recommend to do before or after watching this because you get more info and its just a really good game :)Now for the review!: NO SPOILERS(keep in mind I have not played the Higurashi games)For a while, I was a casual watcher of Higurashi, thinking it was a fine horror/thriller anime, but nothing more than that. After watching this season though; my whole mindset on the franchise has changed. This season, although not technically canon according to the games, makes the Higurashi universe so much more fun. Even if you weren\'t a huge fan of the first two seasons, try this one and I bet you will fall in love with the universe just as I have. For some, I can see how this would ruin the ""perfect"" ending of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, but honestly, I think it expands on so much explored in that season.I think we get to see even more sides to the characters than before. Also, I am really interested in if they explain some of the nods and characters that appear from Umineko. Although I have not gotten to that point in the game, I already know that Umineko has a lot of lore that already fits into the original Higurashi series, but it is even more connected with this new season.I wasn\'t a huge fan of the art style. Yeah, the early 2000\'s art style was stellar either, but everything looked strangely round and plastic. That being said, this did not ruin the show for me at all. If anything, it added to the gory/creepy scenes; showing the characters doing disgusting things while still being animated like a light-hearted shoujo. Great thinking on the creator\'s part.In all, as I have said before, I loved this season. I can\'t wait for Sotsu!!!! The only thing I would warn to others is if you are sensitive to gore. I don\'t think of myself as someone who is, as while I was watching even the worse parts of the prior seasons, I didn\'t flinch. But, in this season there are some particularly gory scenes that made even me sick. specifically episode 16, so if you are watching, please be warned and maybe skip through some of those parts. But, other than that, amazing work creators!! I can\'t wait to see how they finish this story up! game before watching these. Just something I recommend to do before or after watching this because you get more info and its just a really good game :)Now for the review!: NO SPOILERS(keep in mind I have not played the Higurashi games)For a while, I was a casual watcher of Higurashi, thinking it was a fine horror/thriller anime, but nothing more than that.

But, other than that, amazing work creators!! I can\'t wait to see how they finish this story up!', 'Higurashi Kai has a really completed ending that explains everything and doesn\'t need any continuation (except spin-offs, like Rei). Although I thought that, Gou could blow my mind with some of his twists and even really good characters development.Art: 7/10The art isn\'t what I and most of people expected to see in ""remake"" with its slight style, but still I regard it\'s better than shit-animation from Deen. Actually, the animation makes a great contrast in cruel scenes and it\'s looking really good especially uncensored. Some people can say it\'s disgusting but that is the point of Higurashi Gou for me.Story: 8/10I don\'t get it when...people are talking that the plot is illogical and stupid. I consider it has very much compability with with the original Higurashi. For example, I am still feeling warmth in characters like it was in original series. It has some differences but it is what Higurashi Gou about. It even has an episode which kind of tells us that Higurashi never won\'t be the same. It\'s a really good writing for story, I suppose. However, it has flaws in first half of this season. It\'s basically mashed up arcs from Questions arcs and Answers arcs with some little differences in them. But those differences are really small, therefore it\'ll good, if you see it not a long time ago neither immediately after Higurashi Kai. So, as you understand, it\'s quite complicated, and in the beginning Higurashi Gou didn\'t quite understand for whom it wants to be watched. Even though this part might be quite boring, the second part of Higurashi Gou is what makes this show must watch for Higurashi fans and just for people that appreciate Higurashi series. It has plot blowing your mind or, even if it didn\'t do that (and you\'re an umineko fan, hah), it would be satisfied to watch how your beloved characters struggle, manipulate, have fun, change in Higurashi Gou.Characters: 8/10Actually, the main basis of all characters was in original, so only two characters has a real development. However, It\'s still satysfying to watch other characters that you have already loved. For these two characters you would have a very contradictory opinion and that\'s what makes these characters awesome. I would say that is a really good chemistry between them. Even though one of them might annoy you, it doesn\'t make their plotline badly written.Enjoyment: 8/10I would say I enjoyed the story of this season. I\'ve even enjoyed first arcs, that was old arcs with cuts and small differences from original. The show goes slowly with attention to details. I liked how even bad characters changes and I sympathized them.Overall opinion:Higurashi Gou has its flaws, because of its direction, but I suppose this is must watch for anybody who likes first two seasons, manga or visual novel of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni. In spite of this, don\'t watch it if you just can\'t accept any continuation or differences from the original atmosphere, storytelling and etc. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou isn\'t just a third season of Higurashi, it\'s something totally new and different from others Ryukishi\'s works, so you might deny it. I will wait for Higurashi Sotsu and I think it would be even better than the first. people are talking that the plot is illogical and stupid. I consider it has very much compability with with the original Higurashi. For example, I am still feeling warmth in characters like it was in original series.

For these two characters you would have a very contradictory opinion and that\'s what makes these characters awesome. I would say that is a really good chemistry between them. Even though one of them might annoy you, it doesn\'t make their plotline badly written.Enjoyment: 8/10I would say I enjoyed the story of this season. I\'ve even enjoyed first arcs, that was old arcs with cuts and small differences from original. The show goes slowly with attention to details. I liked how even bad characters changes and I sympathized them.Overall opinion:Higurashi Gou has its flaws, because of its direction, but I suppose this is must watch for anybody who likes first two seasons, manga or visual novel of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni. In spite of this, don\'t watch it if you just can\'t accept any continuation or differences from the original atmosphere, storytelling and etc. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou isn\'t just a third season of Higurashi, it\'s something totally new and different from others Ryukishi\'s works, so you might deny it. I will wait for Higurashi Sotsu and I think it would be even better than the first.', 'To begin the review, I\'m going to start off by saying that I will not be providing any spoilers and will be writing this from the perspective of a new watcher of the Higurashi series. From many of the reviews I have read, it came from the perspective of already watching some of the past animes, but I was under the perspective that this anime was a recreation of the older ones to give it a new style and design.As a new watcher of the series, the story was very interesting, but also extremely hard to follow. The order of the episodes from a new...watcher\'s perspective is a bit confusing and there is little to no help from the actual anime in helping you understand what is going on.The anime was formatted in a way where it felt like it was reaching for the goal of ""things don\'t make sense now but they will later"", but it didn\'t feel like it achieved that for me. When I reached later episodes of the anime, I understood more what was going on, but I felt confused because of how jumbled up the episodes were previously. After finishing the anime, I felt that I would need to go back and watch the episodes again in a different order to fully understand the events that transpired in the anime.In addition, there were many characters that received a large amount of story and connection with the viewer, but other characters seemed to have a large role but did not have nearly the amount of support. The characters within the anime made it clear that these characters were important but the storytelling did not treat the characters as such, which created a large amount of disconnect.I felt this anime was reaching for something great and it possibly could have reached it, but the overall confusing nature of the anime left me disappointed when compared to other animes of the same genre. watcher\'s perspective is a bit confusing and there is little to no help from the actual anime in helping you understand what is going on.The anime was formatted in a way where it felt like it was reaching for the goal of ""things don\'t make sense now but they will later"", but it didn\'t feel like it achieved that for me.

There were many parts where the series shined, and I could say the massacre arc was probably a masterpiece due to the build-up and how the arc ended. After watching the 2nd season of Higurashi, I had a bit of hope that this would at least be good. People who are rating it higher than a 7 or 8 are just people with bad taste this season doesn't make sense.Story-3/10I'm laughing at how pathetic this season is. Out of all of the seasons, this is...probably the worst one. The build-up doesn't even make sense, and yes, it's confusing yet stupid. At least with the first 2 seasons, we get an idea of where the series will go since there's a time loop, but my gosh, this is just horrible.Art-4/10OMG, what did passione do to these characters? They look even worse than the original version. How can you make character design today look worse than in the past? The animation is okay but please at least make them look better; they look like plastic lmao.Sound-7/10In my opinion, the opening was very catchy, and the soundtrack was alright; the ending theme was ok.Character-7/10I liked some of the characters, but I disliked rika in the later episodes because she broke Satoko's promise, and she was pretending to be someone who was not her. I kind of disliked Satoko when she was acting annoying.Enjoyment-5/10The beginning was a bit slow-paced, just a bit, but later episodes were just confusing and boring and didn't really have much to offer; it's like they didn't even try with the adaptation at all.Overall-4/10overall this was very mediocre. I was laughing at the last episode just to know they'll adapt another season like it already feels like if they're milking the series already. probably the worst one.

The series begins in the same way as the first season, and then continues changing important events, only to notice that the loop has started all over again. The technical sector is excellent, from every point of view, direction, general direction of the episodes, the animations are of a very good level, and the design of the characters is spatial. Design conceived by Same designer of the Monogatari and Zaregoto series. I highly recommend everyone not to start the series from this anime,...being in effect a third season. The series arises as a psychological, horror, splatter, dramatic, comic and demented genre, each genre is developed and exploited to full levels, like the old series there is an excellent alternation between Slice of life moments, and dramatic moments of pure terror that lead to confusion in the viewer. being in effect a third season.

This review will contain a little spoilers!At first I didn’t really enjoy this new season. Half of it was things I had already seen in the previous seasons, but just slightly warped. It felt like a rushed through recap of the original and its sequel even though this season is completely new. But about halfway through it really picked up for me. The completely new scenes were absolutely amazing as well as the fantastic tragedies that happen at unexpected moments! It was great! It really felt like...the masterpiece that is the original! And the ending was an amazing set up for the next season! I can’t wait! But because of the expected first half it didn’t have that big of an impact until later. But it’s still really good! I give it a 8/10! the masterpiece that is the original! And the ending was an amazing set up for the next season! I can’t wait! But because of the expected first half it didn’t have that big of an impact until later. But it’s still really good! I give it a 8/10!', 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni GouA word of advice to anyone planning to watch this season: have at least already watched the DEEN seasons of Higurashi prior, if you have not read the visual novel.Simply for your own sake. If not, prepare to be mighty confused, especially later on down the line. I am sure you can watch it with no knowledge of the series whatsoever, but because this is not a simple Remake, it is not as easy to just start with Gou.On to the anime, I liked it a lot. Passione held nothing back in terms of gore, and obviously have knowledge...on the series. It does start to get a wee bit confusing around the middle, which is where things are much easier if you have already seen DEENs versions. This is not a full Higurashi story, it is like a weird kind of sequel, that has ties to Ryushiki07s following series.Overall, I love the eeriness and feel of this season, the studio did a wonderful job. I am excited to see where Ryushiki07 and Passione take this story starting in the summer. Higurashi Gou gets 9 stab wounds out of 10 from me. on the series.

I was open minded with the idea of a sequel, I was interested to know what happen to make everything go back, AGAIN, but going through every episode I started slowly to feel that the only point of this season was to bring back the characters, make a lot of gore and deliver a poorly excuse for what is happening, sorry but if you gonna make a sequel for a story that already ended, at least give us a good reason to do so.SPOILER FOR CONTEXT:After...the mystery is solve, the town, the people and every character got out of it alive, Rika, finally get her freedom from the loop and can live again like a normal kid, her dream is to leave the town that holds a lot of bad memories to her and she wants Satoko to go with her to a really high class school for girls only. Satoko and Rika study really hard, get in the school, but Satoko can\'t keep up and she feels how Rika fits better than her in that school living her feeling lonely.Satoko manages to get Rika\'s powers to get in to loops after visiting the old shrine from their town and tries to use it to repeat everything to make it so Rika doesn\'t go to that school, but Rika won\'t change her mind so Satoko looses her grip and starts going into loops to torture Rika until she submits to love the town again to live there forever with her.OPINION:I respect the work done in this anime, you can see an effort in the animation and the art, but I can\'t deny that in the future I will remember ""Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni"" for wat it was.

As a word of advice, If you want to get into the Higurashi series, don\'t start here. Go watch the Deen series first (that being Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei (Rei is optional)). I have another word of advice as well: If you have finished the original Deen series, stop where you are, and move on. This new series sucks.Now, before I go further, I need...to clarify something. When I say ""this new series sucks"", I am referring to Gou and Sotsu COMBINED, not Gou on its own. This review will cover my opinion on this season alone, and not my thoughts on the story\'s conclusion in Sotsu. You can read that review elsewhere.Higurashi Gou, in short is an.... interesting sequel. First of all, I find it strange and somewhat manipulative that this season was advertised as a remake and not a direct sequel to the Deen series. Just a heads up, it is 100% a sequel. Second of all, it\'s not often that a sequel completely undermines the conclusion of the work that came before it. Third of all, it\'s weird that Gou completely forgets certain concepts that made the previous conclusion possible. In other words, there are plot holes. All in all, there were some questionable risks taken in this season.The questionable risks taken here aren\'t only pertaining to the story, though. The whole show has had a drastic style change compared to the original Deen series. All of the characters are more rounded and bubbly, their skin looks strangely shiny, and the whole color palette is extremely saturated. This style change, in addition to how over-the-top the new killing scenes are, really takes away from the bleak tone and horrible events that transpire.In short, this season took a lot of risks and made a lot of interesting ideas, but in the end it came at the cost of a lot of strengths Gou could\'ve otherwise had. The horror is less effective and the mystery is less intriguing. But hey, at least it gave me the motivation to experience the thrill of the original Deen series. to clarify something.

At this point, I have a mixed opinion of it, but I won\'t know for sure until it ends.Given the framework of Higurashi, Higurashi Gou is a welcome sequel and should be watched only after you know the original story--reasons being that later down the line, the show spoils the big mysteries of the original. They may have annouced that it was a reboot, but it\'s not a reboot at all.On one hand, it takes the established ideas from the original series and provides an entirely...new direction with its new mystery, along with providing a decent production as well.On the other hand, I can\'t really tell what the big picture themes/message is with Higurashi Gou. The original Higurashi constantly builds up upon each arc and delivers a fantastic resounding message of ""the power of friendship"" and ""obtaining the willpower to defy fate"", but Higurashi Gou is a different story. I can put together bits and pieces but it feels disjointed at the moment.How it ends is going to imperative for the show.

But IMO the true unsolved mystery was this: What happens to the characters of Higurashi after the story has ended? One of the original series morals was all about the unbreakable bonds of friendship, and what it takes to forge true friendship....but how do friendships stay the exact...same when change is an inevitable force? What happens to friendship when friends each have their own different life goals? What potential conflicts can arise from this?Gou answers just that, but before that it poorly rehashes the first 3 arcs of the original series. Iconic scenes are reenacted in ways that just can't hold a candle to the original scenes. The arcs play out differently in the end, but with bad changes (excluding a moment at the end of the 2nd arc), and many characters go insane with very little hints or build ups, and not all the actions the characters take feel true to how they were portrayed in the original series....or so you'd think, but some of these scene do make sense when the curtain finally begins to lift more than halfway through the series. Still though, it doesn't excuse having to sit through all that to get to whats good, but when you do? Well all I can say is I applaud Ryukishi07 for having the courage to take some of Higurashi's characters in a bold new direction. I just wish Ryukishi07 had found a way to skip through all the filler and just write something for returning fans, because this series does a very poor job of introducing new people to Higurashi. same when change is an inevitable force?

Characters lack of a strong motivation, throw away important motivations they had before to embrace dumb new illogical ones, and also, if before the characters were victims or circumstances, in this new anime, they deliberately perform evil acts. Also, the pace is slow and the characters, specially Rika, act like they haven\'t learned anything during all the 9999 worlds they lived through, repeating the same mistakes.This new anime completly lacks from the impact and visual narrative the old adaptations had. The art in general (backgrounds and character design) have improved, but this is the example of good...looks but bad execution, since majority of the ""creepy"" scenes are boring and lacks from the tension and atmospher that the old adaptations (even with the low budged) magistrally performed.You just need to compare Rena\'s ""USODA!"" scene. The old one had a lot of tension transmited through the music, the camera angles, etc., while this new ""usoda"" scene have pretty static camera angles, lacks of background music and in general, completly lacks any tension, and even more, the bright colors usually are out of tune with the scenes that should be tense and sinister.But even like that, this new adaptation gives us some interesting violent scenes at the end of the arcs, but that only happens in the first arc and third arc (partially) since in the second and third arc, the final scene is some character telling some creepy things that happened, instead of showing the creepy things that happened. And you can argue that that also happened in the original anime, but that\'s not actually like that, since in the original anime they showed a lot of creepy stuff, and then and the end of the arc, they gave you more questions thanks to the details and new informations some characters gave.Also, the third act was really slow paced. They spend so much time showing a boring legal battle that takes two whole episodes. And during these episodes they also make the characters give dull speeches that feels kinda cringy, and uses the same cliche in two scenes with two different characters in the SAME EPISODE. And yes, I\'m talking about Keiichi blocking Shions path, and then Rika blocking Chie-sensei path, both with very generic speeches.In general, this adaptation is rather mediocre to this point, but hope it can change with the new incoming episodes, since the last arc at least ended with some event that wasn\'t in the original adaptation.

(But we all kinda know what happened anyways)', ""This review does not contain spoler:I'm a bit dissappointed with this anime; bare in mind i only have seen this remake and never the original works but i think the story is just not followable and enjoyable without prior knowledge.It's just a mess and in 24 episode didn't manage to give a sense of progression it came off as cryptic for it's own sake, and the owrst thing is that the story is indeed very intriguing in the beginning but then there's no resolution, no explanation and the major arc concludes in what i believe is the original anime from 2006?Anything else like art, sound..., etc. is not remarkable but not bad by any mean;gore is good tho. , etc. is not remarkable but not bad by any mean;gore is good tho."", ""I started watching Higurashi from the original, and I could say that Gou is just as good as the original with different touch, and obviously different artstyle that is way more modern and catchy.I think Gou is made for those who enjoys not only Higurashi, but also Umineko no Naku Koro Ni (it has good manga adaptation and the Visual Novel is just god tier, just consider the anime a bonus because it wasn't as great as the manga and the VN).Ryuukishi07 is definitely toying with our feelings and hopes here...... with absolute <certainty>.And a friendly reminder that THIS IS NOT A REMAKE, so YOU...HAVE TO WATCH THE ORIGINAL HIGURASHI first, and Umineko next for better experience.Y'know? For example, Like if you start watching Star Wars from Episode 7 to 9 it would make no sense, because you have to watch the original first (Episode 4-6) then continue to the prequel (Episode 1-3).

I was a first-time viewer of Higurashi and started watching under the impression that this series was going to be a remake, but after Episode 2, I paused viewing for a few weeks to watch the original series, and I think that was the absolutely right decision that made me greatly appreciate this sequel more. This review will contain mostly spoilers, so be warned.I honestly really enjoyed this fresh take on Higurashi. The same characters and events were there, but twisted slightly, which made me eager to...get into the mystery of this new series. My initial thoughts were that Takano was the looper, and while I was initially let down to know that she wasn't the villain of this new series, it made Gou all the more interesting. I was not carefully analyzing every episode, so Satoko being revealed as the looper was actually a shock to me and a welcomed new take for this series.Gou feels similar in form to the original two seasons of Higurashi, with the first half being an endless spiral of murder and the second half finally entering into some answers. While sometimes it could be tedious and annoying going through the first half, knowing again and again that the episode was only going to end in death, I absolutely LOVED the second half of this series, especially the last arc when it was revealed Satoko was the looper and would be the villain of this series. I never cared much about Satoko in the original series, but I have thoroughly enjoyed her character arc in this new series, and she has since become one of my favorite characters of Higurashi.For me, Gou doesn't feel like a thrown together cash grab sequel because it makes sense story-wise that 1. Rika would want to leave Hinamizawa after being trapped there for hundreds of years, and 2. this would affect Satoko in some way given her close connection to Rika. I commend the writing for making me initially sympathize with Rika for being trapped in a loop again and then later rather making me sympathize with Satoko after the way Rika treats her while attending St. Lucia's. The tensions between the two has thus far made for a great story, and I greatly look forward to the continuation of this conflict in Sotsu this summer.I know a lot of people had gripes with this series, and it's true it stalls a little in the middle, but quite honestly, I found Gou to be a lot of fun and a welcomed fresh take on Higurashi. If you're a Higurashi loyalist, then maybe this isn't for you, but considering Higurashi is characterized already by alternative storylines, I found this to be an adequate sequel. get into the mystery of this new series.

Some people think this is a remake but it's not. You'll be pretty confused if you haven't seen the original, not to mention you'll fail to appreciate some very smart twists. So whatever you do, watch the original first, it's still amazing to this day when it comes to mystery-horror anime. I would even recommend watching/playing Umineko no Naku Koro ni as well because it has a connection with Gou as well as the og.The creative team did very well in ''remaking'' a few story arcs first...to remind viewers of the stories before jumping in the continuation of the story. It's been 15 years after all for the people who only watched Higurashi once back when it aired. Very smart, but unfortunately it led some people to think this is a remake and judge it as such.I'm a huge fan of the og but honestly I didn't think I'd get so excited watching Gou. I was very pleasantly surprised. First of all they got the vibe exactly right. When the horror stuff went down it was just as awesome as the og. And they even got the same voice actors as the og for EVERY character!! 15 years later! That definitely was a huge bonus that added to my enjoyment of this show. Even the og OST plays at several parts. The art is close to the og but greatly improved.Now for the story. Up till episode 14 this could almost be seen as a remake. They did 3 of the og arcs again, keeping many parts exactly the same but changing some important elements that ended up having a huge effect at the end of these arcs.

I will not spoil anything, I loved what they did after ep 14, it kept things very interesting and it was highly unexpected too. I think the fans of the og will enjoy Gou, it's honestly a very good sequel and has many of the elements that we loved in og, plus we dig deeper into certain characters that were not as important in the og.Only reason I gave a 9 and not a 10 was that the first half of the anime was more intense, I would have liked some more tension in the last eps.

The first thing most people will notice is the overhauled art style which goes of this glossy, almost plasticly character aesthetic which made characters appear even cuter than past seasons to contrast to the dark and gruesome scenes to come later. Overall I think...the art style was a massive improvement on the original and Kais art but not perfect. Mainly the dark scenes are not as chilling thanks to the new art direction. I still would say Higurashi Kira had the best art direction for the series and wish we could\'ve saw it in the core series. While many people believe the When They Cry series is at its core a horror anime it is actually more of a mystery anime and this season delivers on the mystery however the pacing does not. If you are a fan of the old series you\'ll most likely be asking yourself ""This is boring, when is it going to change?"" This is due to the new form or story archs called the ""Deceiving"" archs which are archs from the old series with new endings. While the endings were great I was often bored with most of these archs since most of it is the same as before. Thankfully about halfway through the season we get brand new archs which drastically improve the overall pace of the story. If you have not read Umineko you\'ll be a little confused but hopefully things will be explained later on in the next season Sotsu. The twist this time was around was great and didn\'t feel cheap thanks to the subtle hints laid throughout the season which definitely warrants a rewatch once you\'re finished. Unfortunately most characters take a backseat this season even more than Kai the only time most get to shine is from the archs we saw in season 1 which treated every character well so this might disappoint certain fans. Unlike the ending of season 1, Kai, and Rei. Gou\'s ending is a lot more open ended which is most likely due to the fact they\'re jumping straight into another season this summer. The music in this season is at its best yet combining the old with the new. The opening and ending songs are fantastic as well as the music throughout the actual show playing well with the current atmosphere. Here\'s hoping Ayane also performs the vocals for Sotsu! This season was an emotional rollercoaster from start to end and I had a lot of fun. While Kai still stands as the best season, Gou is great for fans of the mystery of Higurashi and even Uminkeo this time around! 8/10 the art style was a massive improvement on the original and Kais art but not perfect.

But i still feel like watching the original series would bring a bit more context to certain minor characters and other rules set up.Also, what really made the story stand out was how the characters played into it.The way the story connected to the characters made me relate and empathize with them alot and I was super invested in the show. And one episode in particular almost made me tear up, Yea i said it. I almost cried watching an anime.But to be honest, that moment in particular was this shows writing at its best. But when it comes to the not so good things, most of that is in the first half. The first half is a super slow burn, it still has tension, and the story is told in multiple arcs ,but some of the arcs in the first half felt a bit aimless, also the conclusion of some arcs feel underwhelming, especially the one at the very middle of the show with the whole child care stuff. That arc not only felt aimless, but it dragged out for so long. I feel like some of the character introductions do have just a little bit of context missing, and i feel like this is where the original ties in, but then again, a second season just got announced so maybe we will get more context later on i suppose.I barely remember any of Higurashi when i first saw it, but i do remember some arcs, and this show does skim over some of those arcs which was a shame since those arcs felt like Higurashi at its best.But then again, the story of Higurashi is super complex so i don't really blame them for leaving some things out.If anything, the first half wasn't bad, but the ending of the first cour was pretty weak compared to the original Higurashi, and i really hoped that the second half would pick up, and at that moment, it felt like the creators heard my voice because the second half on this show was fuking amazing. It was engaging, thrilling,and felt very neatly tied together with the rest of the show. It almost becomes a whole new show entirely but it manages to still pull off being Higurashi by having the characters you know in love contribute so well to the plot.I just wish the first half was a bit better paced.ART/ANIMATIONI was a bit worried about the animation because studio Passione is a studio that only works on trash ecchi ,cute girl stuff, and Rokka no Yuusha. But the animation is not that bad.Its not mesmerizing but it does its job.Even if the art is very bright and highkey, i appreciate the charm and neatness of it. I also like how they don’t have the wacky ass Deen faces from the original. One thing i should point out, is that some of the art direction and background art was really really really gorgeous at times. And the visuals for the ending sequence-the second one in particular that only appears in like 3 episodes-are pretty impressive. In the second ed it uses this really freaky and surreal 360 degree camera view that I haven't seen that much in anime honestly.SOUNDThe voice acting for the show was top notch, probably because of the range that the characters have.This is the case with almost everyone but most prevalent with Rikka’s VA,Yukari Tamura.She can go from cute and cheery to very cold and desolate at the drop of a hat and I just loved how she pulls it off.And the opening and ending songs.I dont even want to compare them to higurashi’s original ones because they sound and feel so different.I do think that Higurashi’s op and ed are better,but being better at higurashi is not that easy.I do think the songs are really good though.They have a bit of a more theatrical and modernized techno approach to them, sure they arent as tense and foreboding as “why or why not”,but they are so damn catchy and nice to listen to.CHARACTERSAs much as I praised the characters, I think the main two that steal the show areSatoko and Rikka. Their role in the story is absolutely brilliant. I related to both Sakoto and Rikka’s situation on a relationship level,and since the harshness of both those things created such a huge conflict in the second half, I completely fell in love with the story at that point..Everyone else is kinda background noise.They do have their moments,but since the show resets their characters after each arc, I forget more and more about them.And in the second half, the show just stops focusing on Keiichi ,Rena,and Mion/Shion almost entirely.I might be in luck because the next season might deal more with them though.I think a case where a minor character shines, is the second to last episode.AKA the episode that almost made me cry.I don't know if it's just me being a human and having emotions, or how well written the story was at that point. But Higurashi came out of nowhere after experience so much gore and crying and death,and then just gut punches me so hard emotionally faster than I can say “Banana Fish”.At that point in the story it felt like everything just hit me on how fucked up this town and people were.ENJOYMENTIt may be me who knows, I have some pretty questionable tastes i know.But i enjoyed this show so much.It wasn't a constant enjoyment,some episodes where hits and others were duds for sure.And also i think people will still be turned off about where this story takes place in the timeline.Since everyone thought it was a remake and then an interview confirmed it...wasnt that.. But there are adapted moments in this show that feels like it is a rema-its confusing.I think some of the marketing should have been a bit more clear on what the hell this anime is.And telling by the score on MAL it has right now,i can tell its a bit divisive.But hell, i had fun.I anticipated each episode,and always wanted more.It sucks that the first half was a bit dragged out, because the second half was just awesome.And it makes me want to almost go back to the original and rewatch those.Overall-7If you are wondering if this is a sequel or not,don't,because i watched the original a long time ago, and...uh I still can't determine if its a sequel or remake.There are scenes in this show that are similar to the original but there are also different plot lines entirely.I think the best thing is to just fuck it and go in blind.And if you feel like youre missing some context ,go watch the original.Hopefully season 2 adds more context though. fuel.And it felt like a really bad fever dream.The main mystery of Higurashi was explained very well and made the tension pay off more,even if the whole mystery wasn’t explained, it still did a good enough job to explain it to someone who probably hasn’t watched Higurashi before.STORYAnd the way things started to connect together at the end felt a bit gratifying.

The first 16 or so episodes are mostly a remake of the first season of Higurashi, with a few important pieces that only make sense if the viewer has seen the first two seasons of the series. For the remaining episodes, Gou takes a hard turn into original content. Because two parts of the show substantially differ in quality, it's especially hard to evaluate the show as a whole.The first 16 episodes of Gou are slightly different retellings of the arcs from Higurashi's first season, but rely enough on the first two seasons of Higurashi that...a newcomer to the franchise would likely be confused. These episodes hit the terrible sweet spot where there are enough changes for a returning Higurashi viewer to have to watch them to understand the last eight episodes, but there's not nearly enough new content to justify spending 5+ hours watching them. Watching replays of previous story arcs for almost four months was so boring as to be borderline torturous.The final eight episodes are completely new content and are far more interesting than the first part of the series. Without going into spoilers, the story takes a large twist at the end of Episode 17, and the series gets a much-needed breath of new life. For dyed-in-the-wool Higurashi fans, these episodes are a must-watch. That said, it's hard to say if they justify the first two-thirds of Gou for the casually interested.Art and Sound:Part of the appeal of the original Higurashi was how its plain mid-2000s aesthetic clashed with the series's horror and gore. Gou gives the animation a much-needed update, but it's nothing particularly spectacular. The OP and ED2 are fairly strong, but aren't iconic like the original Higurashi's OP. Otherwise, the animation and music were fairly nondescript and inoffensive.Characters:The original two seasons of Higurashi were mostly Keiichi-centric, while Gou is almost entirely focused on Rika and Satoko, at the expense of its other characters. While focusing on Rika's psychological deterioration does have its merits, it hurts to not have further development of the full cast after over a decade since the last full season, Higurashi - Kai. I've seen preliminary reviews particularly criticize the one-dimensionality of Rena, which is entirely warranted. Hopefully, the coming sequel does a better job of including the rest of the cast into the plot, or at least gives them some meaningful moments.Overall:Usually, mixed-bag shows start strong and spectacularly combust as they conclude (see Darling in the Franxx). Higurashi - Gou upends this standard by having eight great episodes at the end of a mediocre 24-episode run. It's definitely not worth it to watch all of Gou, but with a sequel season on the way soon, true Higurashi fans will probably be forced to. A far better single-cour series exists somewhere in Gou, but it's sadly up to viewers to splice that series together for themselves. a newcomer to the franchise would likely be confused. These episodes hit the terrible sweet spot where there are enough changes for a returning Higurashi viewer to have to watch them to understand the last eight episodes, but there's not nearly enough new content to justify spending 5+ hours watching them. Watching replays of previous story arcs for almost four months was so boring as to be borderline torturous.The final eight episodes are completely new content and are far more interesting than the first part of the series. Without going into spoilers, the story takes a large twist at the end of Episode 17, and the series gets a much-needed breath of new life. For dyed-in-the-wool Higurashi fans, these episodes are a must-watch. That said, it's hard to say if they justify the first two-thirds of Gou for the casually interested.Art and Sound:Part of the appeal of the original Higurashi was how its plain mid-2000s aesthetic clashed with the series's horror and gore. Gou gives the animation a much-needed update, but it's nothing particularly spectacular. The OP and ED2 are fairly strong, but aren't iconic like the original Higurashi's OP. Otherwise, the animation and music were fairly nondescript and inoffensive.Characters:The original two seasons of Higurashi were mostly Keiichi-centric, while Gou is almost entirely focused on Rika and Satoko, at the expense of its other characters. While focusing on Rika's psychological deterioration does have its merits, it hurts to not have further development of the full cast after over a decade since the last full season, Higurashi - Kai. I've seen preliminary reviews particularly criticize the one-dimensionality of Rena, which is entirely warranted. Hopefully, the coming sequel does a better job of including the rest of the cast into the plot, or at least gives them some meaningful moments.Overall:Usually, mixed-bag shows start strong and spectacularly combust as they conclude (see Darling in the Franxx). Higurashi - Gou upends this standard by having eight great episodes at the end of a mediocre 24-episode run. It's definitely not worth it to watch all of Gou, but with a sequel season on the way soon, true Higurashi fans will probably be forced to. A far better single-cour series exists somewhere in Gou, but it's sadly up to viewers to splice that series together for themselves."", 'Now, I gave this show a 10 overall because I did not just watch the anime in the past but I as well played the visual novel and for me, it is indeed a masterpiece because Higurashi in general gives the audience that kind of ride with excitement and thrill that you will beg to have more when it is ended. The story is unique and excellent because it has that mystery vibe and combined with gore and a bit of a touch of horror just makes it excellent. The characters are also good and unique and have its big role in each arc. The...art, well the old Higurashi anime might not have the best art but it is still a must-watch if you are trying to get into the Higurashi series because if you start from here in Gou, you will probably be confused so much so I suggest watching the OG first, though about this season it has good art though I would really prefer it if studio deen continued the Higurashi series because, to be honest, I like their art style for the show, Studio Passion also did a good delivery of the art, that I can say. For the story, enjoyment, and overall. For me, it is indeed 10/10 for I believe it is a masterpiece, and also I want people to notice this series as well because it is such a waste for people to miss out on this series. art, well the old Higurashi anime might not have the best art but it is still a must-watch if you are trying to get into the Higurashi series because if you start from here in Gou, you will probably be confused so much so I suggest watching the OG first, though about this season it has good art though I would really prefer it if studio deen continued the Higurashi series because, to be honest, I like their art style for the show, Studio Passion also did a good delivery of the art, that I can say.

The first season was an exploration into horror, as well as a story about friendship and community in an idyllic setting. The second season was more about offering closure and a happy ending to the horror show, not necessarily a good anime on its own but exactly what I wanted to see after watching the first season.Gou seems to be meant as a story about growing up. However, the justification offered for the renewed horror seems so trivial and childish that I find the entire premise to...be ridiculous. [[[SPOILER: I think it would've been much more interesting if Satoko and Rika had grown to be adults and had some kind of falling out, rather than when they're basically still children. Something truly serious with real consequences might've had a much more powerful and meaningful impact on the characters and thereby justify their actions. As it happened in the show, it just feels ridiculous to me.]]]I'm also not sure how I feel about the new art style. I think it's meant to emulate something more like the original PS2 graphics, but frankly those sprites were kinda shit.I will say, it's very nice to see best girl Rena again. be ridiculous.

I watched the first two original seasons of Higurashi, and I wasn’t too impressed with the horror aspect of it.The first two episodes tricked me into thinking that the new version was just a retelling of the original anime, but with better animation. However, when shit hit the fan, I was in for a gory and brutal horror sequel to the first two seasons. I saw people reacting to each episode and there were certain gore scenes that they had to skip because of how horrific the gore was. For...me, I actually enjoyed the gore, although a bit disgusted. The original version had gores, but they were nowhere near this sequel. This aspect made me liked the anime more.Another great aspect was the story. It elaborated more on the arcs in the original version, and then diverged to a new direction that I enjoyed a lot.Overall, after watching this new season I’m a fan of the Higurashi anime now.

No complaining about not understanding what\'s happening.Now that that\'s out of the way... I couldn\'t quite believe that in the year of our virus overlord, we\'d be blessed with a new Higurashi anime. The original is one of my favourite psychological horror anime/pieces of media so to have it be revived with a sequel was heartwarming and terrifying.At first, the show comes across as a remake....We\'re thrown back into the village Hinamizawa, the first arc of the original series and we\'re are reintroduced to our favourite harem protagonist Keiichi Maebara who is more entourage. However, by the end of the very first episode, you\'ll start to see slight differences in the story\'s variables. Soon you\'ll be asking yourself what dark secrets and tragedies will befall our cast this time and when/how.The first half of the season is a slow burn. I didn\'t mind retreading old arcs with minor changes leading to different results, but leads to the first half of the season feeling slow and somewhat boring until you get to those moments which luckily are pulled off incredibly well. It\'s better to binge-watch than watch weekly. It\'s not until the end of the third story arc that the curtain is pulled back and the show chops you into pieces with a machete. The pacing escalates and leads to one of the best, most disturbing horror scenes I\'ve seen in a long time (I\'ll never look at gardening hoes the same way again). The story continues at this excellent pace and only escalates further later leading to one of the best episode endings (involving a chandelier) and ed reveals I\'ve seen in a while.I think I\'m okay with the rather jarring art style change now. I don\'t think Studio Deen is a very good animation studio, but there\'s an odd charm to their original art style which lends itself well to horror anime. Passione\'s bubblegum art style didn\'t have the same existential dread sown into it and I hate the character\'s weird cat mouths they all seem to have. Keiichi suffers the most from the art change.

I want to go into more of the story and explore why it works and what doesn\'t work quite as well. I especially want to talk about the main villain.There have been many critics voicing their opinions on this season. Some are understandable, some ignore situational/psychological context and some are just plain stupid.Series writer Ryukishi07 is a mad genius when it comes to his world of writing. His understanding of his characters and their psychological profiles is why they\'re so engaging to watch and why I personally really love them. It\'s why the big twist has gotten so many people raging.Even with its supernatural elements and neck-scratching parasites, Higurashi has always been a psychological series which always asks ""Considering *blanks* background what would this character think/feel/do when put in this situation?"" and that coupled with the main story hook is why it\'s such a captivating series.8/10 Great.

I'm going to preface this review with one thing.I believe this show was made more for people who read both Umineko and Higurashi, and enjoyed both, rather than those who watched the original Higurashi anime.  And I respect that people will not and do not like many things this anime chose to do.  Very likely, this will be a polarizing entry as it challenges many of the ideals that made the original Higurashi so appealing to a wide variety of people.That being said.I loved this so much more than I expected I would at the...start.  It even brought me back to the original Higurashi anime, which I'd begun to dislike after the sound novel and the manga, and made me appreciate it again.  As someone who loves both Higurashi and Umineko, this series /really was/ more than I could have expected or hoped for.I will admit that parts of this do drag.  I feel that is a marker of the fact that this was written with Ryukishi07 rather than adapting from a sound novel as the previous show had been.  It is also difficult to navigate similar arcs without the patience for what it may draw out.  This isn't interested in the same kind of large world story that the original series was - Gou is much more personal and much more intimate than that, which I understand can take away from some of the appeal of the original.  Where the original spent so much time on its many characters, delving into them and their individual struggles, Gou has decided - that's not what it is doing.This is the story of Rika and Satoko after Hinamizawa.  This is the story of two of the most traumatized of the original club clinging to each other as everything changes around them, for better and for worse.  This is the story of how they inadvertently and purposefully tear each other down on the way to escape the shadows of their own traumas and fears.  That's a bit of a fanciful way to describe it, I will admit, but that is why I like it so very much.What I enjoy so much about this is that it shows that the sense of fellowship and community that they obtained in 1983 isn't easy to hold onto.  I know people are disappointed that it feels like Gou is going against the bedrock of the original show - but I would argue it is only challenging what came before.  Those who have read Umineko, I'm sure, are familiar with how dark the series could be, and also how it also challenges and interrogates many of the themes presented by Higurashi.  In some ways, I feel this has allowed the writer to continue establishing the difficult road of survival and recovery after the immediate threat has passed.  When I was younger, I loved the story of Higurashi and Rika fighting fate in Hinamizawa because it resonated with me, and many others.  Now that I am an adult, and now that the team behind the original is older too, we're all seeking something more.  More meaning.  More answers, because as we move forward, things only become harder, not easier, than the individual moment that trapped us so.The art is unappealing, often, and there are tone issues that baffle me when looking back at the original anime.  I wish I had both more time and less time in this setting, because I always wanted to know more about Rika, and more about Satoko.  The meat of it.  People may become bored of the show's final arc, as it stands as a perfunctory Answer Arc for the 'deceiving arcs' that came before it, but I did find it both illuminating and enjoyable.The act of watching Satoko throw away her humanity with each time she kills herself, and how she compares to Rika, in their complicated emotional struggle.  Satoko has Fucked Around and will probably Find Out, but I appreciate that Rika is a flawed person, who has inadvertently hurt someone she never meant to hurt.  I enjoy the links between this and Umineko, and I love how much it reminds me of Battler and Beatrice's relationship in Umineko - that following thread of promises broken.  I find it funny that Lambda Delta is being linked with Satoko, and I understand why some may find it distasteful, but goddamn.  You guys.  I loved the evil witch gays in Umineko.  I can't lie.  I'm excited for more, and I am excited, always, for more messy terrible problems in Hinamizawa. start.

But it\'s apparently supposed to appeal to new viewers as well, and that\'s why I\'ll review this as a remake. If you wish to enjoy it to the fullest though, I recommend watching the original and it\'s sequel, although beware cause higurashi kai is unbearably boring after the first 2 arcs and is an overall bad anime, but this isn\'t about kai.The positives: Fantastic first episode, better art and animation, much better sound design and better pacing compared to the OG. Also the OP and ED...are really nice.Negatives: story and characters.Story: writing this after the 8th episode and for now the story is mixed with events from both the first series and higurashi kai. Problem with this is that new viewers miss out on some points that others will understand which are quite important, like how did keichi survive in the first arc and such. The second arc which is arguably the best arc in the series when coupled with the arc that explains what happens in it was executed really poorly in gou. The events were changed quite a bit and the ending was anti climatic. If gou is unable to tie up the lose ends in a good way then my opinion of it won\'t change. Currently it\'s terrible and I have a good idea of what the mystery is, but that just confuses me as to why they would bother changing the events at all. Unless ofcourse the mystery element has more that what meets the eye, which I really do hope is the case.Character: keichi is the worst mc in the history of anime. He\'s whiny, annoying and an overall brat. I know this sounds like 70% of male anime MCs, but keichi takes the cake as the worst one. Hell mirai nikki and akame ga kill have better MCs. Everything from the way he talks to the sound he makes when he has food is all annoying af. Moreover he\'s a complete loser too. Now, why is this ""bad""? Firstly cause every time he\'s on screen I feel like ripping off my sternum and raping my ass with it, secondly cause he\'s supposed to be an ""intelligent"" character as you\'ll see later in the series, which really makes no sense whatsoever. If you expect him to ever change, then turn away. Keichi is awful and will always will be.This ofcourse is not inherently bad as it\'s just a peeve that I have. What is bad is how they treated Rena\'s character.Rena has some SERIOUS development in the second arc of the original anime. It really shows us that she\'s more than just a crazy bitch, to the point where we question whether she was even a crazy bitch in the first place. In gou however, Rena is basically non existent for the entirety of the second arc, which adds to this arc being even worse than it already is, which ofcourse in turn hurts the fact that this is supposed to be the best arc of the franchise.Overall: I\'m not enjoying this show much. My expectations are still really high cause I still hope that they can blow me away when they reveal the mystery, but if it\'s just going to be what I\'ve predicted then I\'m going to be really disappointed.Tldr; an improvement over the original in the technical department, being animation and sound. But otherwise a bit of a letdown. Still to early to judge because, well, it is higurashi and it totally depends on what the mystery is and how the mystery is revealed. As an OG viewer, I would\'ve been satisfied if it followed the events of the orignal anime 1 to 1, but now that the events have been altered, I hope that there\'s actually a good reason for it and that the ending will be good. are really nice.Negatives: story and characters.Story: writing this after the 8th episode and for now the story is mixed with events from both the first series and higurashi kai.

I admit I was very disappointed in the story for the first half of this show, but knowing him, I held out hope that it would improve with a twist later - that hope was fulfilled and then some by the end. If you know your Umineko lore, this series becomes...incredibly interesting to dissect (as with most of his works). It adds depth to both the main characters, in providing us with interesting new facets of them that connect them to Umineko's lore. Also, Ryukushi07's style of writing has always been to use later works to analyze the characters and morals in his previous ones - Umineko is in many ways a criticism and analysis of Higurashi's characters, just like his next work, Higanbana, was an analysis of Umineko's. I see the way that this series re-addresses the events of Higurashi as an extension of this, and personally, rather than undermining the message, I felt it added depth and interest to an already very deep and interesting universe.I will admit that I'm not the most critical fan when it comes to analyzing plotholes and continuity errors, and maybe this series does add some complication to Umineko lore, but it's so interesting and excitingly presented that I can't really bring myself to care.

Bad, dull comedy. Moments of unsalted and unimportant relaxed that if cut would not affect anything in the story. However, a heavy and mysterious climate was building and I decided to continue, no one as much as I suffered. Then I realized that everything was not in vain, it was worth it. The few moments of terror that the series brings are well worth it because they are completely unique and complex. People die and come back as if nothing had happened, that's something to investigate. Then out of...nowhere the protagonist disappears and Rika takes his place, the anime changed for the better for sure, it seemed like he had taken on a new season, but seriously it just proved how irrelevant the male protagonist was. With no personality, he was only fit to own the harem. Rika is more human than he is, and it was interesting to follow how she became mature and bored and by God trapped in that hell. It was interesting. The anime was 8in its prime with much turn around until it threw its full potential away into the school arc. Like, the anime was supposed to be over when Rika broke the curse, it wasn't supposed to go on. I didn't understand why it was continued, it looked like a new lolis school anime. But it's okay, behold, suddenly, I repeat, suddenly even, Satoko becomes the villain. That took all the seriousness out of the story. For me it all ended there, the anime lost credibility and became a teen horror of the American series. I really do not understand why they decided to withdraw all love from the friendship of girls and turn into envy, jealousy, for reasons few justifiable.. And again, by God, those who in their right mind would be returning in time of their own free will, granting themselves the suffering of living the same thing for several years just because of some teenage conflicts. Like, that was really serious. The sweet and gentle Satoko turning yandere and killing the schoolgirl because of ended it all. Higurashi is a story with a good base, an interesting and essentially original climate. You don't find a story like that, she's going to mark me for a long time, so I didn't get the note too low. But its ending is cruel, its characters do not make any sense, except Rika, which is much more or less. Overall, it had several hits, but much more mistakes.... I think the other seasons should be better. nowhere the protagonist disappears and Rika takes his place, the anime changed for the better for sure, it seemed like he had taken on a new season, but seriously it just proved how irrelevant the male protagonist was.

I know MAL and it's marketing makes it SEEM like a reboot to the Higurashi anime but to keep this short THIS IS NOT A REBOOT. It is a continuation of the higurashi Visual Novel and some post content from there and also a prequel to the Umineko visual novel that comes after Higurashi in the When They Cry series. So in short do NOT watch SotsuGou if you have not completed the Higurashi visual novel and imo if you have not read the Umineko visual novel as that helps with...understanding these shows. understanding these shows."", ""Is it possible for a show to be completely pointless and a big mess but still enjoyable? That is how I feel about Higurashi S3.There was no need for Higurashi's story to be continued. Season 2 had a perfect ending and there was nothing else that needed to be told. That being said, the continuation that we got is decent overall even if it's incredibly flawed.The first half of the season is mediocre at best. It is just worse retellings of the stuff we saw in seasons 1 and 2 with a new ending to each arc. The story is rushed, important scenes get cut...and it only gets interesting when the new endings are shown and even then, they are worse then the original endings. I don't know why these were necessary. Just show that Rika is still in the loop and start with her on the last 5 loops. Not only would it skip the pointless retellings but it would allow the story to spend more time in each new loop rather then quickly jump through each one like what actually happened.That being said, once I reached episode 14 and started watching the brand new stuff, I found myself enjoying the show. I completely understand why some don't like the story's continuation along with the characters being watered down but that doesn't bother me enough to not enjoy what we have. For me, the characters are still enjoyable even if the depth isn't there and the mystery is captivating enough to keep me wanting to see what happens next. Rika and Satoko's relationship is really engaging and is the main thing that allowed me to stay interested in episodes 14-20.Then episode 21 hit and I was tossed back into the abyss. First, I will give the remaining episodes some credit. I was intrigued by the concept of Satoko becoming a looper and without knowing anything about her character, it is entertaining to watch her attempts in the loops but I do know her character and I don't like how it was handled. First, while seeing the crazy side of Satoko is interesting on paper it doesn't make any sense. She had been cured of Hinamizawa Syndrome before starting the loops so that means her normal mind is making the decisions to do all the crazy stuff to get Rika to stay in Hinamizawa which doesn't make sense. She has never been a person that would do stuff like that when not affected by HS. Second,seeing Satoko having such a sudden change in personality feels extremely jarring. Even if it makes sense within the context of the story, her craziness goes from 1 to 100 almost instantly, leaving no room to adjust and as a result it doesn't feel right to see her acting the way she does.In the end, season 3 is not necessary in the slightest and it is a big downgrade from seasons 1 and 2 but I find it enjoyable enough despite the mess. Even though I don't regret watching it, I wouldn't recommend it to the average Higurashi fan. I would only recommend it if you can handle a messy story and aren't attached to the characters. and it only gets interesting when the new endings are shown and even then, they are worse then the original endings.

But Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou disappointed me.Let's start with the positives, which is almost everything up until episode 17, these episodes really feel like the first two seasons of Higurashi despite being anime original. They start off feeling like a remake, but quickly make you realize that they are much more. The characters take actions that, in the original, would've made for a good world but here lead to disasters in this one. For example, in the original, Keiichi doesn't...trust Rena and Mion and ends up killing them while they never had ill intentions. Here, Keiichi decides to trust them, and ends up getting killed for it. It makes you think 'so this is how Rika was feeling' as you really think it should go right this time, but then something surprising happens that ends the world in a new brutal way. So the first 17 episodes are really good, i would probably give them an eight overall, why then did I give the entire season such a low score?That is for one big reason, Satoko. The last arc, which lasts from episode 18 until 24, completely ruins Satoko. Now, if this is your first shot at Higurashi, this probably won't bother you too much, but for someone who's spent this much time with these characters, it really sucks. I get where they were coming from, Satoko is the kind of character to never lose, she'll try everything she can to win, but she would never, in good conscience, kill Rika multiple times just to not have to go with her to school. I get that the first time at the school was a terrible experience for her, but this is just too much. Satoko in the VN's is meant as a smart, funny prankster who uses her traps to achieve victory in the club games, not to kill her friends. But in Gou, she does, she kills Rika time and time again, just to get her to not want to go to St. Lucia, which leads to a really unlikable version of a character I came to have a soft spot for in the previous seasons.This last arc kind of ruins the entire season for me, but since I did enjoy the first part, it'll still get a five. This season is by no means bad, it just ruined a character I really liked, I hope Sotsu fixes this because if it doesn't, the last two Higurashi seasons will have really bad aftertaste. trust Rena and Mion and ends up killing them while they never had ill intentions.

The first half of the show made me ask, ""why does this exist?” It seemed like the same stuff from the original Higurashi but with different deaths. This was kinda boring to me especially since they teased in the first episode that Rika has all her memories from the original Higurashi. I think it would have been more interesting to make her the protagonist to show her perspective on mostly the same events. Instead, we follow Keichi like normal...so it’s mostly the same up until the point where people die. That’s why the show made me ask “why does this exist?” since it seems mostly like a reboot but at the same time it’s very clearly a sequel.Around the halfway point it did start changing and it gave a reason why almost everything has been the same. It wasn’t a very satisfying answer, nor did it really excuse the show from just reusing content in my opinion. We did not need 3 arcs of almost the same thing to get to that conclusion. Now for the second half which is all mostly new content is where the whole thing starts falling apart a bit. It’s basically just Rika finding out who the villain is. Then is just switched to the entire backstory of why the villain is doing what they’re doing. It tries to get you to sympathize with the villain but their actions just come across as semi-stupid and really selfish. I really don’t like the motivations of the villain and I don’t think that character would do that. It never really got me invested in the actual plot and the mystery aspect is barely there.The villain also uses loops(return by death) way too casually in my opinion. I think the villain\'s treatment of loops(return by death) is really bad and is definitely their stupidest decision. If I had to rate the show just purely based on the mystery aspect I would give it a 4/10. My final score for this show is a 5/10 though just because I really enjoyed seeing these characters again, especially in the slice-of-life scenes. so it’s mostly the same up until the point where people die.

In order to watch this, you don't need to go over all of the OVAs and the movie that were released between season 2 and this one.

I have no idea what ryukishi07 was thinking recommending this to new fans, but there\'s a lot of context needed from the original Higurashi, and even a bit of Umineko for good measure in order to truly get the most out of this... sequel...?So what even is Higurashi Gou? It\'s obviously a sequel, but the way it presents itself is so half assed in the beginning that one really has to wonder what the writers were thinking. If you\'re going to continue the Higurashi plot...in a new direction, then there were much more efficient and effective ways to go about doing it. The likely answer is that 07th expansion wanted to attract new fans into the franchise through Gou, except that the second half of the season really requires you to know your Higurashi, and even Umineko lore to be interested in what\'s going on.With all that said and done, there\'s surprisingly a lot of interesting developments tackled in Gou. While I wouldn\'t go so far as to call it good, the second half is a hella more engaging than the first half, and ultimately after the final episode I was left with the most indescribably muddled feelings towards Gou. Without having seen Sotsu, I think I can summarise my thoughts with Gou as this: with every positive I have with the series, comes with two or more complaints. It\'s a sequel that\'s definitely interesting to discuss at least.PLOT: 4/10The original Higurashi had one of the most satisfying and complete endings in a story as comprehensive as Higurashi\'s. It tied up almost every loose end, gave every major character one last chance to shine and solidify the character arcs they went through, and was just a very conclusive final chapter. Saikoroshi-hen, the epilogue to Higurashi, also setlled Rika\'s arc in a very satisfying manner, and tied back in with Umineko with the birth of a certain Bernkastel.So what\'s left to tackle? How would Gou justify bringing back a story that ended almost 2 decades ago?Surprisingly, the direction Gou headed was actually...decent? Fine, I\'ll give it props; it got the Umineko fan in me practically squealing in delight once I realised what Gou was gonna tackle. The When They Cry universe has one of the most delightfully fascinating lore in all of anime, and strengthening the bonds between both Umineko and Higurashi, heck even Ciconia, is the best possible gift 07th expansion could have given to me.Except that, well, the execution kinda sucked. Without giving too much away, the first three arcs of Gou are basically three of the original vn\'s arcs all over again, except with a major twist in the respective final episodes of each arc. The problem arises when you realise that the show spent a whopping THIRTEEN episodes, a single cour worth of television, to achieve so little. The first thirteen episodes are essentially to lay out the different scenarios the villain used to trap Rika all over again, except that it\'s just so pointless.The first three question arcs of Higurashi are absolutely amazing precisely because of how little you know what\'s going on. You barely have anything to work with, and through the eyes of a terribly unreliable narrator of Keiichi you\'ll start sinking into this pit of paranoia and suspicion of the events happening. It\'s beautiful because once you get the answer, everything clicks into place and when you look back at how confused you were back then it\'s extremely amusing.The problem with Gou\'s new arcs, is that it\'s not even a mystery. The answers to these arcs can be found simply by using the answer in the original answer arcs as a key. Sure, the who-dunnit is pretty vague, but the how-dunnit is easy as cake to solve. A mystery is intriguing not just because of the who-dunnit, but the how-dunnit. And that just makes the first thirteen episodes an absolute slog to go through.The second half of Gou, however, is when things thankfully get interesting. Nekodamashi-hen is easily the most disgusting thing the entire When They Cry franchise has ever done, and it did get my attention, if anything else. Satokowashi-hen, at least its first few episodes, had also genuinely good moments that made me, strangely enough, touched. I never thought going into Gou after hearing all the negativity surrounding it that I would be touched by it, but it\'s surprisingly there.The problems lie with two aspects.Firstly, the shock value. The original Higurashi visual novel was definitely violent and disturbing, but there was a strange sort of respect and decency when handling the violence. It wasn\'t an overly gratuitous edgefest that shocked for the sake of shocking. I can\'t say the same for Gou. To be fair, I haven\'t watched the DEEN adaptation, but Gou just rubbed me the wrong way throughout. For example, the end of the first arc, Onidamashi-hen, has a character bleed so much blood, that I could not resist laughing at how absurd it was. It\'s so gorey that it\'s hard to take seriously. And then you have the infamous scene in Nekodamashi, which is right up there with one of the most unnecessarily disgusting and drawn out sequences I\'ve seen in anime.  The strange thing is that the original Higurashi did a really similar scene, but that was handled with much less sadistic connotations than this scene. It\'s sad that ryukishi07 who once criticised people who indulge in needless suffering in fiction is now one of those who fuels that, though I\'ll cope with the fact that he probably wasn\'t in the position to influence the anime in its portrayal of the ideas he presented.The other lies with the characters. I\'ll elaborate more in the other section.CHARACTERS: 5/10[SPOILER WARNING FOR HIGURASHI GOU]Oh boy, where do I even begin.I\'ve always liked Satoko ever since Tatarigoroshi-hen. I know she isn\'t as memorable of a character as Shion and Rena, as charming as Mion nor given as much screentime as Rika and Keiichi, but she\'s an incredible character none the less. The struggles she goes through, her tragic past and self-worth issues were very understandable, and I found the end to her character arc in Matsuribayashi-hen satisfying.Gou decides to head into a new direction with her character, exploring her relationship with Rika, how it ultimately collapses and falls apart, and her descent into madness.I\'ll give Gou credit where I think it\'s due. The second part of her development, the collapse of her friendship with Rika and her refusal to let Rika leave Hinamizawa, was handled well. As said before, the first few episodes of Satokowashi-hen with Rika asking Satoko to accompany her to St Lucia\'s were pretty great. It lacked the hyperviolence of the arcs before, had much more depth to its characters and was extremely bittersweet. I related to Satoko\'s struggle in accepting change in her life, and the somber fact that some friendships simply can\'t last forever. Unlike some, I can very much understand Satoko\'s resentment towards Rika, even if I don\'t find Rika to be at fault, and it made much sense for Satoko to be this attached to Rika. Growing up in a rather traumatic childhood with family abuse, it makes sense for Satoko to be this attached to her best friend who stuck with her through thick and thin, who was her family of sorts when her brother left her.What I didn\'t really enjoy was Satoko\'s descent into villainy. While it wasn\'t handled badly, it wasn\'t as good as I would have liked either. Sure Satoko was no saint back in the original Higurashi, but she was never this malicious either. Her reason to inflict such pain and suffering onto Rika boils down to having Rika never want to leave Hinamizawa, but I find it difficult to believe that a character who has received such abuse and suffering would ever do it to her best friend, even if the whole cycle of abuse thing is valid. Again, it\'s not handled terribly, but I found the intensity of Satoko\'s torture to be way too overboard. Hell, she even doesn\'t give a shit about Satoshi, something that genuinely makes no sense to me. Satoshi was the most important person to Satoko, and she wouldn\'t even use her looping powers to help him? One could argue that it shows how deranged Satoko is by now, but no matter how much she wants to possess Rika I find it harder to believe that that feeling is stronger than reviving and restoring the most important person in her life.We also get Teppei redemption. ...And it\'s not handled very well. Once again, the development is way too rushed. In like 10 minutes Teppei suddenly becomes the kind awkward uncle after receiving a lot of nightmares of him getting murdered. Even if the concept is somewhat believable, the task of redeeming arguably the scummiest character in Higurashi is impossibly high, and that episode did not do it for me.The other characters are mainly the same. Rika\'s more of a reactionary character in this one, so there\'s not a whole lot to say about her.Lastly, Featherin- I mean Eua. I\'ve always wanted more from Featherine in Umineko, so seeing her on the Higurashi game board without using Hanyuu as a piece was just so satisfying. She still doesn\'t do much other than lying on her couch and commenting as though as she was watching a television show, which is what I\'ve come to expect of Featherine, but I\'m excited to see more of her in Sotsu.ANIMATION: 4/10DEEN\'s adaptation is pretty infamous for its subpar quality when it comes to the animation department, but at its best some of the art that came from it was genuinely amazing. The lighting and colors of the original Higurashi nailed the creepy and unsettling horror vibe extremely well, as dated as it might look.I cannot say the same for Passione\'s work. The colors are far too saturated, there\'s too much polish on the facial expressions, and the face shape looks so... round(?) There\'s a desaturated clip of Gou somewhere out there that actually looks much better than the actual product, because god damn everytime I see Satoko\'s bright yellow hair it just feels wrong especially in the ""spooky"" scenes.However, it\'s not entirely bad. The slice of life scenes do look pretty good with the character design barring the colors, and the lighting of some scenes are genuinely good, though it still didn\'t capture the atmospheric charm of the original adaptation. The first ED also has some of the best art of the Higurashi cast out there, each capturing the struggles the cast goes through.SOUND: 6/10The music didn\'t stand out much, which is perfectly fine. However,  everytime the original Higurashi theme plays, or when the first opening first drops at the end of the first episode, while not being particularly clever, were still highly enjoyable. The opening theme of ""I believe what you said"", ED1 ""God\'s syndrome"" and ED2 ""Irregular Entropy"" were perfect choices for their respective roles, and just a bop to listen to overall.TL;DR: 4/10It\'s not good. It really isn\'t, the concept of Lamdadelta and Bernkastel\'s original battle is such an amazing idea, but it didn\'t work out. Even then, even then, the WTC fan in me really enjoyed the callbacks to Umineko, dug the emotional turmoil of Satoko (for awhile, at least) and did love all the ideas tossed around in Gou. With a massive overhaul and restructuring of the plot of GOU, this could have been an absolute masterpiece. A pity that probably wouldn\'t happen, but at least Gou did renew interest in When They Cry.And now we wait for a Umineko remake. in a new direction, then there were much more efficient and effective ways to go about doing it. The likely answer is that 07th expansion wanted to attract new fans into the franchise through Gou, except that the second half of the season really requires you to know your Higurashi, and even Umineko lore to be interested in what\'s going on.With all that said and done, there\'s surprisingly a lot of interesting developments tackled in Gou. While I wouldn\'t go so far as to call it good, the second half is a hella more engaging than the first half, and ultimately after the final episode I was left with the most indescribably muddled feelings towards Gou. Without having seen Sotsu, I think I can summarise my thoughts with Gou as this: with every positive I have with the series, comes with two or more complaints. It\'s a sequel that\'s definitely interesting to discuss at least.PLOT: 4/10The original Higurashi had one of the most satisfying and complete endings in a story as comprehensive as Higurashi\'s. It tied up almost every loose end, gave every major character one last chance to shine and solidify the character arcs they went through, and was just a very conclusive final chapter. Saikoroshi-hen, the epilogue to Higurashi, also setlled Rika\'s arc in a very satisfying manner, and tied back in with Umineko with the birth of a certain Bernkastel.So what\'s left to tackle? How would Gou justify bringing back a story that ended almost 2 decades ago?Surprisingly, the direction Gou headed was actually...decent? Fine, I\'ll give it props; it got the Umineko fan in me practically squealing in delight once I realised what Gou was gonna tackle. The When They Cry universe has one of the most delightfully fascinating lore in all of anime, and strengthening the bonds between both Umineko and Higurashi, heck even Ciconia, is the best possible gift 07th expansion could have given to me.Except that, well, the execution kinda sucked. Without giving too much away, the first three arcs of Gou are basically three of the original vn\'s arcs all over again, except with a major twist in the respective final episodes of each arc. The problem arises when you realise that the show spent a whopping THIRTEEN episodes, a single cour worth of television, to achieve so little. The first thirteen episodes are essentially to lay out the different scenarios the villain used to trap Rika all over again, except that it\'s just so pointless.The first three question arcs of Higurashi are absolutely amazing precisely because of how little you know what\'s going on. You barely have anything to work with, and through the eyes of a terribly unreliable narrator of Keiichi you\'ll start sinking into this pit of paranoia and suspicion of the events happening. It\'s beautiful because once you get the answer, everything clicks into place and when you look back at how confused you were back then it\'s extremely amusing.The problem with Gou\'s new arcs, is that it\'s not even a mystery. The answers to these arcs can be found simply by using the answer in the original answer arcs as a key. Sure, the who-dunnit is pretty vague, but the how-dunnit is easy as cake to solve. A mystery is intriguing not just because of the who-dunnit, but the how-dunnit. And that just makes the first thirteen episodes an absolute slog to go through.The second half of Gou, however, is when things thankfully get interesting. Nekodamashi-hen is easily the most disgusting thing the entire When They Cry franchise has ever done, and it did get my attention, if anything else. Satokowashi-hen, at least its first few episodes, had also genuinely good moments that made me, strangely enough, touched. I never thought going into Gou after hearing all the negativity surrounding it that I would be touched by it, but it\'s surprisingly there.The problems lie with two aspects.Firstly, the shock value. The original Higurashi visual novel was definitely violent and disturbing, but there was a strange sort of respect and decency when handling the violence. It wasn\'t an overly gratuitous edgefest that shocked for the sake of shocking. I can\'t say the same for Gou. To be fair, I haven\'t watched the DEEN adaptation, but Gou just rubbed me the wrong way throughout. For example, the end of the first arc, Onidamashi-hen, has a character bleed so much blood, that I could not resist laughing at how absurd it was. It\'s so gorey that it\'s hard to take seriously. And then you have the infamous scene in Nekodamashi, which is right up there with one of the most unnecessarily disgusting and drawn out sequences I\'ve seen in anime.  The strange thing is that the original Higurashi did a really similar scene, but that was handled with much less sadistic connotations than this scene. It\'s sad that ryukishi07 who once criticised people who indulge in needless suffering in fiction is now one of those who fuels that, though I\'ll cope with the fact that he probably wasn\'t in the position to influence the anime in its portrayal of the ideas he presented.The other lies with the characters. I\'ll elaborate more in the other section.CHARACTERS: 5/10[SPOILER WARNING FOR HIGURASHI GOU]Oh boy, where do I even begin.I\'ve always liked Satoko ever since Tatarigoroshi-hen.

So basically, this is an opinion from someone who just clicked on this anime and decided to watch it and give it a try. And I have watched all the episodes of this anime (or at least, all the episode of this particular season I guess). Just clearing that up so that ya’ll know what to expect when reading my review.First of all, this season of...this anime is not as ""new-viewer friendly"" as you may have heard. There were so many points in the anime where it was glaringly obvious that you needed to watch the previous seasons in order to understand what characters were talking about. I can\'t even express how frustrating that got to be, especially towards the end of the series.((SPOILERS AHEAD))Also, I absolutely hated how they made Keiichi in the first episodes appear like he was the main character. I hate when any show does that actually. I\'ve never seen the point in doing something like that. And I also have never seen it as being ""clever"" when I find out the character I\'ve been most curious about and rooting for is actually just supposed to be a side protagonist and nothing more. There literally was nothing supernaturally special about Keiichi. Not one thing. Why lead us on to think that? What was the point? Here I am, thinking that maybe he\'s like the Re:Zero guy: repeating at a spot in time over and over. But nope, instead its another character who I never really cared about until the writers decided to abruptly shove the fact that she was actually the main character down my throat. Don\'t get me wrong, Keiichi is a great character with a great personality, and I will always like him more than the so-called ""real"" main character, Rika. But this anime really made me feel robbed when they basically shoved Keiichi to the sidelines when I really thought he was a great main character.And another thing, this anime is much too slow for my tastes. The pacing was just all over the place. Now, I will admit, the horror scenes in this anime really are something. Very disturbing for sure. But the horror scenes themselves, especially in the beginning and middle episodes, just seemed way too spaced out.In conclusion, although this anime had great art, sound, and a great OP as well, it was not what I was hoping it\'d be. It was not ""new-viewer friendly"", as I had heard it was several times. But the biggest disappointment about this anime to me, was that it had so much potential to be great. In the beginning with Keiichi as the MC, although the pacing was still not good leading up to the scares and major plot points, the anime was actually pretty enjoyable. But the second they revealed Rika as the main character, I could no longer enjoy the show as well as I had been when I first started watching it. Mainly because of the fact that Keiichi was a much better MC that captured my attention in a way that Rika, with her dull personality, never could.If you are considering watching this anime, I urge you to watch the first seasons first. People may tell you otherwise, but trust me when I say that there are a lot of things you will be really confused about if you don\'t.I personally feel absolutely no desire to watch the previous seasons, having figured out that the one character I actually liked (and was tricked into thinking he was the MC for the longest time), is not actually the MC. this anime is not as ""new-viewer friendly"" as you may have heard.

Actually, Higurashi - GOU have many firsts for me personally.It is the first Fall 2020 anime that I started to watch, since it was the first anime to come out of that season. Since I'm watching it weekly along with JJK and King's Raid, Higurashi GOU is also my first ever anime that I will watch weekly with a 24 or plus episode count. And eventually it will be the first 2-cour show that I will finish by...watching weekly. Lastly, and I can consider it one of the greatest mistakes I've ever done on my history with anime, GOU is the first Higurashi series that I've started, since I thought that this was a remake.Sadly that broke my ass and viewing experience in the long run, but yeah Higurashi GOU is atleast one of the more special and notable title in my anime list. It was a special experience initially, until it didn't, and then it eventually become special again.It was certainly a rollercoaster, but in the end it was atleast a good ride and a good series. And since I've completed all the two seasons (plus Rei) in the middle of GOU's run, I can say that this Higurashi brought a lot of interesting ideas in the table. And it has certainly twisted what we already know from Higurashi. But I guess GOU's actual reason of existence is that if you're not yet satisfied with Higurashi after the Kai's ending, and if you want more interpretations and ideas to be explored on the series, then GOU has that for you.Overall after a bit of modification and some second thoughts, my score to this series is a weak to a near solid ?/10. The art definitely saved this anime from going lower. Music production, the theme song, and a very solid performance from the reprised cast was amazing. Although once again, I am still confused and some of the actions that happened in this series still doesn't connect with me. Characters are also changed along with the story, which left me more conflicted of it after coming out of Kai & Rei. And some of them were actually bad, so that stops this series from going up higher than a ?.Hopefully SOTSU will answer and continue the interesting storyline that is set up in GOU. And that's it for this review or I guess I can call this more of a reflection, I hope you had a nice read from my ramble.Final Score: 7/10 watching weekly.

If you\'ve looked at my score of the 1st Higurashi, you\'ll see I\'m a bit biased... towards the original.  It was my first horror/mystery anime, and few shows have compared to the complexity in its story, characters, and art IMO.  But this isn\'t a Higurashi 1 review, but a Gou one, so I\'ll digress and get to the point.My first impression was bad, like you tasting a meal them vomiting it but try to savor the flavor by swallowing the vomit bad.  I had hope for the modern art style...(hence the 8), loved the sound track (hence the 8), but believe this one took liberties with the characterization established in the previous series... Which, in this case, was a bad thing.  Some Homicidal-loli motivations made no sense to me from what I\'d previously seen from the characters, and some scenes made NO sense to me considering how much pain a person can tolerate and why people get butchered without defending themselves when they have an OBVIOUS totem to defend themselves with.  But then again, this is a horror show, so we can get away with characters being dumb for sheer terror and dark humor effect, right?Now, I will describe the biggest sin of this season, which has nothing to do with the art, sound, evil lolis, or the story (well... maybe the story some):  The Pacing.  I\'ve shouted this from the rooftops, but this season is paced MUCH SLOWER than the original Higurashi or its sequel.  When They Cry has always been a slow burner, but each episode used to distract you with slice-of-life goodness while a darker theme lurked in the background, one that would be built upon by the conclusion of each episode.  In Higurashi Gou... You didn\'t have a dark reveal happening each episode, and sometimes it took two or three episodes to happen, which had me in the Pacing Dilemma I previously never faced in THE BEST PACED ANIME SERIES I\'d spread my eye-holes upon:  If you watch an episode and say to yourself, ""Wow, I have to see the next one!""  You have good pacing.  If you watch an episode and say at the end, ""Huh, that\'s it?"" banging your forehead on whether you learned anything plot relevant or not, then the pacing sucked.  Most episodes in this season had me feeling the latter, which is a terrible sin in an anime I\'d considered the best paced series... ever.  I believe this bad pacing came from two things:  The show stuck inbetween being a soft reboot to introduce new fans to the series and a continuation of the old to satisfy the fanbase, and it trying to emulate the pacing of Re-Zero, another anime centering on a protag with a similar ability.  To fix the former problem, they should have just made the series a reboot OR a flat continuation, so they wouldn\'t have needed to slow things down for new fans while building near the series\' end for the old.  To fix the latter... just don\'t make the show ANYTHING like Re-Zero, please.  Don\'t get me wrong, I love BOTH shows for what they are, but what works for one will not work for the other, especially their pacing.Boy, that went on awhile.  In conclusion, do I think you should watch Higurashi Gou?  If you\'re a Re-Zero fan, you will love it.  If you\'re a fan of the original, you will hate it, but watch it anyway because it\'s Higurashi and Umineko isn\'t finished and Okamikakushi sucks.  Also, considering neither your opinion nor mine will influence whether it gets another season, which is set to air in July, that question is mute.  The true question is:  Is this anime a waste of time?  If you like mystery/horror anime, I would say it is not.  I disliked some of the changes this studio made (The art style is fresher but took away from the abstract horror of the show.  For the elitist among you who always think ""Moar of an animation budget is superior,"" take a dose of the original Evangelion and call me in the morning :P), but this season\'s conclusion had enough of a twist (for the series, that I wished they got to sooner...) to make me convinced I didn\'t waste my time watching it.  In light of this, I\'ll bump my earlier assessment of a 5 to a 7. (hence the 8), loved the sound track (hence the 8), but believe this one took liberties with the characterization established in the previous series... Which, in this case, was a bad thing.  Some Homicidal-loli motivations made no sense to me from what I\'d previously seen from the characters, and some scenes made NO sense to me considering how much pain a person can tolerate and why people get butchered without defending themselves when they have an OBVIOUS totem to defend themselves with.

You have good pacing.  If you watch an episode and say at the end, ""Huh, that\'s it?"" banging your forehead on whether you learned anything plot relevant or not, then the pacing sucked.  Most episodes in this season had me feeling the latter, which is a terrible sin in an anime I\'d considered the best paced series... ever.  I believe this bad pacing came from two things:  The show stuck inbetween being a soft reboot to introduce new fans to the series and a continuation of the old to satisfy the fanbase, and it trying to emulate the pacing of Re-Zero, another anime centering on a protag with a similar ability.  To fix the former problem, they should have just made the series a reboot OR a flat continuation, so they wouldn\'t have needed to slow things down for new fans while building near the series\' end for the old.  To fix the latter... just don\'t make the show ANYTHING like Re-Zero, please.  Don\'t get me wrong, I love BOTH shows for what they are, but what works for one will not work for the other, especially their pacing.Boy, that went on awhile.  In conclusion, do I think you should watch Higurashi Gou?  If you\'re a Re-Zero fan, you will love it.  If you\'re a fan of the original, you will hate it, but watch it anyway because it\'s Higurashi and Umineko isn\'t finished and Okamikakushi sucks.  Also, considering neither your opinion nor mine will influence whether it gets another season, which is set to air in July, that question is mute.  The true question is:  Is this anime a waste of time?  If you like mystery/horror anime, I would say it is not.  I disliked some of the changes this studio made (The art style is fresher but took away from the abstract horror of the show.  For the elitist among you who always think ""Moar of an animation budget is superior,"" take a dose of the original Evangelion and call me in the morning :P), but this season\'s conclusion had enough of a twist (for the series, that I wished they got to sooner...) to make me convinced I didn\'t waste my time watching it.  In light of this, I\'ll bump my earlier assessment of a 5 to a 7.', ""*Sigh* Welp....I'm at it again with reviews...here we go [SPOILERS BEWARE, I need to explain stuff, but that requires spoiling it!]:The Story:Now, this is rated lower than the rest because of just how...weirdly connected it is compared to the other entries in this franchise. There's times where the series connects back to the the original series (an example being all the Takano stuff) and then there's times where it just feels forced in (like with Keiichi remembering the first Arc from the original series.) The story is just...very inconsistent, other than that, it's fine. The story goes into some new but...really weird places (like wiith...Ooishi just randomly shooting people after falling victim to Hinamizawa Syndrome, it's shocking sure, but it doesn't do much for the story other than give us a 'twist').The Art:The art is meant to represent the visual novel and...I haven't played the VN, but comparing screenshots from those games to this, I see the approach they were going for with this. There are a couple of nitpicks I have with it however, 1. The characters always have these weird cat-looking mouths when they aren't talking and smiling it just looks...weird. 2. The grittiness of the original anime is completely gone and instead the visuals have to have sound and fillters (usually a grainy film-like one) overlaid on the footage to make it remotely creepy (this is seen in one of the earlier episodes when Rena tries to murder Keiichi and SOMEHOW he lives despite all of the blood he spilt all over the place.)The Sound:The music is...reused here and there, which disappoints me (except for when they reused the original Season 1 OP theme at the end of one of the earlier episodes, THAT was AWESOME), but I guess I can't be too surprised considering how big of a soundtrack the original show had and how much time it would take to remaster it all, still kinda sucks though. The OP and Ending themes are really good, I enjoyed all of Ayane's music they put in here. Voice-actors are all the original ones which is AWESOME and definitely helps with adding some 'nostalgic fan-value' to this show (at least to me.) Sound design is not bad, just...bland, nothing really special there.The Characters:Well...unforunately, Keiichi, Mion, Shion, Rena, and a lot of other characters got shafted in favor of Rika and Satoko (I could get down with Rika stuff just fine because of Season 2, but Satoko was...a weird choice in my book) stuff, which is...good enough, I suppose. I didn't get that the Academy connects to another part of the Higurashi, Umineko, (looks like someone needs to just binge through the VN at some point.) The characters all act like themselves I'd say...except for Satoko and sometimes Rika. Rika is still...herself, still stoeic, but has her emotional moments here and there with her and everyone else, she's an anchor to now antagonist Satoko. I...don't like how really acts in this show. She used to be just a cute smug girl who liked to make traps and was someone who had a kind heart and cared about her friends a lot and now she's just a cold-hearted murderer abusing her new god-given powers and just basically saying 'forget the world and my friends, I wanna be with Rika like a crazy obsessed yandere and destroy everything.' It just seems...immature to me, and while I think that it's meant to be that way since she's a child, I feel like Sotsu is gonna (hopefully) give her a dose of reality. This is just some Young Sheldon but Light-Yagami kind of stuff honestly.Overall:While I think the story is a little...off at times, the art is a little inconsistent at times, and there's not a lot of new music in the show,  and the characters act sometimes completely out of themselves at times, this was still enjoyable, if mainly just to see what insane stuff was gonna happen next. I'd only watch this obviously if you're a hardcore Higurashi fan and you've read EVERYTHING from the VN (or at least watched Umineko too), this a SEQUEL to the original anime NOT A REMAKE, it seems like that at first, but it's not, I can assure you.Now if you'll excuse me...I have to back to binging school for another week...and then probably finishing up Beastars Season 2 (No Furry, I promise), and watching Parasyte: The Maxim.

Higurashi Gou hit just the right spots it needed to be a perfect return too everything I loved about good old OG Higurashi anime back in my teens. I'd even say it's an improvement from the OG, though I guess that's not a high hurdle to cross - from the far more pleasant to look at visuals to the sound design.What I always loved about Higurashi was the sense of getting fun, over the top gore spliced in with legitimately well-written psychological horror and a heartfelt...story of unity. It's like eating trash food but instead of empty calories, it actually has some substance to it. While still retaining the delicious taste and the looks of a tasty hamburger.There was a point in my life where I felt embarrassed to admit I enjoyed stuff like Higurashi. I've grown since. I'm an adult now and I've learned to embrace the side of me that just yearns to watch edgy bullshit for the sake of watching edgy bullshit.And there's nothing wrong with that.Definitely a distressing, yet also entertaining watch.

Now let me begin when we see that rika and satoko are able to enter into the St. Lucia Academy being this last one having putted some much effort studying to being able to enter together supporting rika dream, we can see how more than gradually abruptibly in a way both start to get distanced just because of how big its the gap of both, being satoko not able to keep the studies as well as to fit into this new kind of environment and people in which in the other hand rika we can see fit completly perfect into it, this in a sense its not actually unrealistic or stupid and to me maked sense.As we saw in previous seasons as well as in this one in no moment could see an satoko like the one presented here after the revelation of his motives behind it, yes we are able to see some other facets of satoko along the series but this extreme just doesnt make any sense and even more after as i mentioned above in the episode 22 can see that satoko have the opportunity to actually see the thousands of worlds in which rika had to go throught to reach finally the one that allow her to break the bucle, we saw all this suffering, killing, dispair, hopelessness and how she almost surrender more than just one time to her *destiny* in this fourht seasons, and you are trying to tell me that even after having watched all that, satoko even if initially had his resentment after just a *couple* of times (taking into account the fact that she tried to correct it a couple of times before actuallly watch the fractments of rika and his worlds) she just came to the conclusion that she its gonna to make her surrender to keep staying in hinamizawa no matter how many worlds she has to loop into resulting in a attrition fight.I mean this is so stupid and why i say this?? just doesnt make sense if to beging with she wasnt able to see all the THOUSANDS of worlds that rika had to go throught, i could undertand the way she is to a certain extend (althought she never was portrayed in a facet so manictic and crazy, sure we see the dependency that she had in other episodes but this doesnt hold to anything) but she went throught experiencing all of that so just doesnt make any sense, leaving just one of two things, their friendship wasnt real to beging with (which actually wouldt make so much sense basing myself in how it was portrayed in previous episodes or even seasons) or just the author really didnt knew how da fuck to continue.Doesnt hold to the quality of the plot , characters and overall values that the series have, and way this is so important you could ask? well i mean this its an point of inflexion where the climax unwraps and the origin of bassicly all the events since the firts season that revolves around ,and the argument and reason behind it its SOOOOO weak compared to how it was taken until before that , just doesnt make me happy at all , some people argue the fact that she could possibly have the syndrome of hinamizawa but that doesnt make any sense based in the fact that the symptoms arent there as well as she was suppoused cured to certain extent. This its mostly just bad wrtting by the autor itselft that i wouldnt care if was some minor thing or something that generally doesnt have so much relevancy, but no its not the case, at least he could not give her the ability to see all those fragment so it could be more credible her actions because if not ended like this without no kind of argument that back up that kind of behaviour and change in his actions.I could enjoy the show and sure many can disagree with some things of it, but one that just doesnt deserved such bad treatment was the last course of the series in how was maneged , i will keep watching the last season called sotsu but i end up with an bad taste after such dissapointing unravel of events.RESUMEIf you are an newcomer interested into deepen in the series i could reccoment you to actually watch the previous ones firts ( you are not gonnna be dissapointed are freaking awesome in my opinion and such a cclasic of anime) and after that keep with this one, to those who watched the previous ones overall this one doesnt gonna dissapoint BUT here its the thing the inflexion point where the climax unravel and the revealing of the cause of all the events that we could experience before and just didnt hold to the expectations and the treatment that it should have received, its gonna be divided between those who actually are satificed with how it was handle and those who expected maybe the same level that the plot had previously.I was debating which puntutation i should give to the series, but no matter how much i think even if in general i could enjoy it i couldnt give it an 8 or 9 even if i wanted to, based in what previoulsy mentioned and consider was really important so an 7 it gonna make justice to the series which overall its not bad ,just maybe beloew the standart of the other ones. just by the fact that this one actually its an secuel to the other and you are gonna miss A LOT of things so its not reccomended to start from this one.This review its gonna contain spoliers mostly when i were metioning the bad point or the ones that i liked the less, so keep it in mind if you are willing to continuing reading.The series itselft you could

because according to them the firts ones are doesnt apport anything to the series and are just more of the same ( based on those commentaries) though if you ask me i could say you that actually its not the case and in fact those ones are in my opinion really important i mean its serves well to present us new routes as well to old watchers of the series let us remember some things of the plot and the characters also (at least in my case was like that due to the fact of how many years has been passed since the last time that i watched the previous ones).I need to emphasize that at the ending of the firts episode we can hear the op of higurashi no naku koro ni, giving me goosebumps and if you are like me an avid  older follower of the series its gonna take you an smile and really awaken those feeling that you had when you watched for the firts time the series, letting you awaiting for what its coming in the series in the next chapters.The op and end of the season wasnt so impactful or

other *yuuzuzumi * ( at least that cames to my mind now , it might be another one if researched more ).Now comes some spoilers that i need to mention because its the fact of why i feel this series  declined in a way that i really dont undertand or at least wasnt convencing based in how well until now the plot, characters and development of them was taken until the episode 22 where actually there were really discrepancies or rather i should say nonesense in the way that was aborded, before that when we actually discover that satoko its another time looper that its preventing rika to move

Until then it's played out to be just like the first season of higurashi but it really isn't. Just like a lot of people, I thought this was a remake of that but I do not mind at all that it isn't. Because for me, higurashi (the main storyline that is, all the fanservice spinoffs are gross) had been enjoyable but really nothing special.Tbh I was really not interested in satoko's character until episodes 15/16. I know this is a pretty unpopular opinion among...other fans, but I love her so much after that point. other fans, but I love her so much after that point."", 'Introduction:First of all I want to clarify for any unsuspecting person that this is not a 100% Remake of the old ""Higurashi no naku koro ni"" but rather a summarized version of all its previous seasons with an alternative / original perspective entering from chapter 16 (but bad I remember) and this is important so that they do not consume this title before all their old seasons, because they are spoiled a lot and it would largely lose the charm of suspense, plot twists and other things that were seen here far above or even They showed them, having said that, let\'s now pass the...review of the program ""Higurashi 2020""Story: 2I am not going to enter into a catharsis of recalling everything that happened during the first 13 chapters and that therefore we already know the old fans of the series, but it does not mean that I want to make a mention of how well the first Arcos del program, being quite subtle with facial expressions or strong scenes that were achieved to the letter and even improved with the new resources of the industry so I applaud. (Maybe the occasional scene will be cut but I have achieved everything necessary and main that Higurashi always transmitted) Now entering the new unexplored lands of this 2020 version I want to clarify that there are more negative than positive points.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS CONTINUED)When we started this new route I had my doubts about where the program wanted to go, but I never had something concrete to hold on to, since I did not let see any indication of where it was going in this second nucleus of the program (positive, something that always knew how to do Higurashi). Now that said when we entered chapter 16 but I\'m wrong, that\'s when we all realized that this adaptation was going to go to waste and not precisely because there were 2 time travelers like Rika but it is everything else and the purpose that this gets.At the moment in which we understand that the reason why this new loop debacle arises because it turns out that Satoko did not want to go to study with Rika or even let her study later, is that this title lost all possible dignity.It is so simple and absurd that at the same time I find it funny and even the same series laughs at itself, how are you going to compare the suffering that Rika had to go through living for 100 years seeing how her friends and herself were brutally murdered over and over again again for a curse (and a secret group), AGAINST A SATOKO BASE FOR NOT WANTING TO STUDY OR UNDERSTAND THAT HE SHOULD SEPARATE FROM RIKA !!! AND WHY IS THIS WILLING TO MAKE HER GO THROUGH ALL OF THE ABOVE OVER AND AGAIN !!!And do you know what is worst? If there is going to be a sequel in which we will have to continue smoking this ridiculous plot, it takes it completely out of the ass.Art 9.5 / Sound: 9.5Here the truth is that I have no complaints that the program is worth, it seems that it takes you about 15 years to the past when we all saw for the first time, the first steps of Higurashi, both in the setting, character designs, strong scenes with little censorship, dark music almost gloomy and suspense, a cast of Seiyuus totally identical to the one from the first adaptation, really these sections have been a 10/10 practicallyCharacters: 7.5The evaluation of characters in this program for me has always been something subjective, since these were growing their development and importance little by little through all its seasons, but this being a case that results as a ""reboot"" I plan to make a pure evaluation and exclusively focused on what I saw in this version and of which at first I do not have much to highlight the cast, it tends to recycle with each loop and you do not see great changes or progress and the only characters that really have a value within This season they have been neither more nor less than Rika and Satoko and although at the end of the day they end up playing the heroes and villains for nonsense, I must say that they are relatively well achieved to show their developments in the program.Enjoyment; 7I do not want to be much more extensive during much of the anime 3/4 of it would encourage me to say enjoy as a child who relives his childhood entertainment (my case of adolescence), the rest entirely forgettable and little to highlight I would even like to erase that I saw those last chapters, although there is more of everything with a new sequel already with the green light, I will be waiting to continue the program as a fan but my expectations will already be very differentGENERAL 7.1 / 10 review of the program ""Higurashi 2020""Story: 2I am not going to enter into a catharsis of recalling everything that happened during the first 13 chapters and that therefore we already know the old fans of the series, but it does not mean that I want to make a mention of how well the first Arcos del program, being quite subtle with facial expressions or strong scenes that were achieved to the letter and even improved with the new resources of the industry so I applaud. (Maybe the occasional scene will be cut but I have achieved everything necessary and main that Higurashi always transmitted) Now entering the new unexplored lands of this 2020 version I want to clarify that there are more negative than positive points.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS CONTINUED)When we started this new route I had my doubts about where the program wanted to go, but I never had something concrete to hold on to, since I did not let see any indication of where it was going in this second nucleus of the program (positive, something that always knew how to do Higurashi).

Begin started strong like previous seasons, and a feeling of suspense and hunger for knowing what was going to happen. But it felt empty once you started to know what was going on and left with ""is this all?"".Ending was a cluster fudge of ""am I even watching the correct anime?"". Huge disappointment they decided to end with a Touhou style battle between the two main characters. The...original higurashi would have never had anything like this because it was so out of place for the series. Also big disappointment the story is centered around a yuri quarrel, scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to storyline. original higurashi would have never had anything like this because it was so out of place for the series. Also big disappointment the story is centered around a yuri quarrel, scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to storyline.', ""(Sorry for the wall of text, I can't format this reviews :'( ) When watching this I had the strong question of 'what is the purpose of this new series?'. It's not a remake, and there's no real need to retell the story, when the nature of Higurashi is revisiting the same story over and over until you have all angles of it. I figured maybe we'd finally get a link between the Higurashi universe and the Umineko one, but... no, we didn't really get that. What we instead got, was them bringing to the forefront questions we left the original series with, tempting us...that we might get an answer, then just... not answering it, or worse providing such a poorly thought out vague idea of an answer that it brings up more questions and seems to be inconsistent with the world.                                        One of the biggest changes is in Rika and Satoko's personalities. They still talk the same, and act mostly the same, but their intentions and priorities are shifted a lot, and the explanations given are pretty bad. I found it hard to empathise with either of them, not only because they're acting horribly in most of this, but also their justifications were pathetic. The whole 'I'm laughing like an evil person, so now my justifications behind my actions are suddenly extremely 2D and vaguely sensual' is just so old and dry.                                            There's a lot to work with in this story that could make the projection work, but the explanation the story gives for going from point A to B is incredibly unsatisfactory. The original series was great because, especially with the game and books, you could effectively keep notes and realise innocuous scenes from earlier are actually crucial hints. In this new series, it feels like they're trying to hint at things we already have confirmed in the original, while skipping over the burning questions.                                            I slogged through this series hoping I'd get SOMETHING, and it just never paid off. If you cut out all of the scenes that have happened in previous series and only showed the new information or content, I feel like you'd only get 1 sentence per episode, maybe a drawn out exposition scene later on that doesn't actually tell you anything new, but reviews the information in a new setting... But that's not worth an entire new series. I'm now on my quest to watch the 2021 series and my question remains; what is the purpose of this? My answer right now is 'money'. They're just making bank off of a cult following and hoping if they tease us enough, and don't answer questions we'll leave confused, think the confusion is a sign it's so smart, and feel satisfied with such little sustenance. that we might get an answer, then just... not answering it, or worse providing such a poorly thought out vague idea of an answer that it brings up more questions and seems to be inconsistent with the world.

It definitely feels like it was made for people who have been long time fans of the series. The first 13 or so episodes are very similar to the first episodes in the og series but with minor changes to who does what and how the endings pan out, it’s a bit harder to watch these episodes and you’ll be sitting there like… I’ve seen this like 200 ughhhh. It will give you a tiny taste of what it’s like to be Rika for just a moment....And then boom the good stuff. I think this anime is a nice little love letter to fans who have played Umineko as there is a lot of plot points and references that hit much harder in both Gou and Sotsu with that context. You can still watch this without playing it or course but it might have you questioning how weird and out there some narrative choices seem.

A sweet friendship story. Smiley face.NOTE: Review is about both seasons, maybe some spoilers as well....#PROS+Voice cast remains the same pretty much and they still have excellent voice and voice acting+Characters are still very enjoyable (interesting & unique)+Story / gore content is still rather hard to digest as prequels+Satisfying finale+As Anime original sequel It was pretty enjoyable overall+Great music/ost+Great emotional value*More focus on fantasy and drama this time which I didn’t mind*Story main focus is on 2 characters.#CONS-Visuals & gore a lot milder than prequels.-Sotsu went towards trope that I’m personally not fond of (or the whole foreshadowing of first season)-Very “screw you” story content-Obviously, mystery element is much weaker than original series (because mystery is solved in prequels)#Review (comments/longer ver):Before I actually rant more about various content of Gou & Sotsu, let’s get few things out of the way.1.\tTHIS IS ANIME ORIGINAL SEQUEL. For sakes of normal human thought train. Watch from season 1 not pick this as starting point.2.\tI saw prequels A LONG TIME AGO, so I will be comparing them to these3.\tThis specific review will have spoilers as there are few specific things I want to rant about.4.\tHave a nice day. ~NIPAAHOkay, so let me elaborate about the pros and cons a bit for starters. I absolutely adored that pretty much most of voice cast (especially on main characters) were the same, they all have lovable, unique and interesting voices as in the old prequels. Plus, characters themselves are still as I loved them. Although, Rena felt a lot moronic here from what I had in my memories. Now with the whole cruel torture / gore element I felt Gou & Sotsu were a lot tamer. Prequels had very detailed and disturbing gore and torture scenes, this Anime had more of quick blood splatters and death scenes. Also Gou & Sotsu went towards fantasy element much stronger. Prequels extreme strong points are psychology, horror and mystery. Whilst Gou & Sotsu excel at fantasy twists and character drama. Character drama mostly about Satoko and Rika as they are main focus here.I do honestly remember a long time ago, when I first picked Higurashi series, one of my first 100 Anime I’ve watched when I started anime back in 2008’ish, was absolute disturbing horror element and constant feeling of unease and simply feeling depressed about characters.. Gou & Sotsu  do manage it, to an extent. Yes, it has some gruesome scenes, but the unease element was much weaker whilst feeling of “being depressed” was great. Each arc I finished I just felt “………can we have anything nice for them? Poor poor,  Rika…. Poor everyone” Shame that the details of deaths and torture sequences were that tame in comparison to prequels as that gave great shock element value to the prequels.Story itself is essentially bunch of same stuff we saw in prequels, but different time loops/worlds. While story itself takes this time around a different approach. Gou is essentially foreshadowing to Sotsu. Sotsu approaches timeloop from another perspective whilst unveiling of every loop cause and the twist. Overall Gou I quite enjoyed. Sotsu I enjoyed as well, but a bit less. I’m not fond if time loop is shown again but from another loopers perspective. Find this type of mystery / twist a bit dull. But in the end of the day, they were both enjoyable, just not as god tier as prequels.Now to more SPOILER part of review and mainly me ranting about characters and the story being presented in Gou & Sotsu. You know…. Rika probably has one of the worst fates ever when it comes to characters. Having to relive same period with absolutely hellish outcomes and dying in various manner on top of that is just absolute hell, especially when you have to witness death of close ones or insanity of close ones. But with Sotsu first part, I honestly somewhat hated Rika a bit, the whole dilemma of fulfilling your dream with your most loved/closest friend… being stuck for hundred of years in hell loops, trying to achieve “good ending” yet being screwed over… yeah. But why I hated her a bit? Mainly because once she achieved good ending and dragged her best friend Satoko to her dream, yet still by the end of the day she didn’t consider Satoko at all, eventually ignored and abandoned her… thus making Satoko feel extremely betrayed, hurt and lonely. And such thing makes a great plot element for Sotsu. Hurt Satoko becomes time looper herself. And obviously, her damaged state takes the turn towards worst and thus making Rika relive all hellish loops again. Because why not.  Although end became battle shounen for whatever reason, I still loved how both embraced their ability, fight in every loop and make it so dramatic and enjoyable… and how the whole thing got wrapped up, did honestly make me tear up a little bit. By the end of the day it was sweet friendship story I guess. Here though, it was sweet for them, but I personally felt really lonely, jealous and depressed when it came to Satoko and Rika relationship….but that to that.To wrap everything up. Prequels got their mystery unwrapped, explained, presented and given satisfying wrapping as finisher. Gou & Sotsu present new story twist, great nostalgia and fun times. (In a sense). It’s essentially “bonus round” for old Anime fans. I liked the idea of this Anime, I just wish they would kept up with the shock value the prequels had.#Total Score 7/10 #PROS+Voice cast remains the same pretty much and they still have excellent voice and voice acting+Characters are still very enjoyable (interesting & unique)+Story / gore content is still rather hard to digest as prequels+Satisfying finale+As Anime original sequel It was pretty enjoyable overall+Great music/ost+Great emotional value*More focus on fantasy and drama this time which I didn’t mind*Story main focus is on 2 characters.#CONS-Visuals & gore a lot milder than prequels.-Sotsu went towards trope that I’m personally not fond of (or the whole foreshadowing of first season)-Very “screw you” story content-Obviously, mystery element is much weaker than original series (because mystery is solved in prequels)#Review (comments/longer ver):Before I actually rant more about various content of Gou & Sotsu, let’s get few things out of the way.1.\tTHIS IS ANIME ORIGINAL SEQUEL.

I liked the idea of this Anime, I just wish they would kept up with the shock value the prequels had.#Total Score 7/10', 'tl;dr: A very different but solid Higurashi experience.Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gou is a sequel to the anime from over a decade ago. It’s done by a completely different animation studio who have a completely different art style and was also somewhat marketed as a reboot. But make no mistake, it is absolutely essential that one be familiar with the main story of Higurashi before watching Higurashi Gou, whether that be through the anime, VNs, or manga. As such, while this review will not have spoilers for Higurashi Gou it will have major spoilers for all that comes before it. I will also note...that Higurashi Gou has connections to the other titles in the When They Cry franchise, Umineko and Ciconia. It isn’t strictly necessary to be familiar with them to understand the key points of what’s happening in Higurashi Gou, but you will be missing out on some smaller details.As the synopsis of this anime describes, this anime starts off with Rika once again being thrown back into the eternally looping Hinamizawa of June 1983. She’s already managed to survive it once, so she’s much more optimistic about getting through it and intends to be much more proactive about guiding things to a happy future. However, things are proceeding very differently from how they were previously which makes things far more difficult than she expected, resulting in her having to go through multiple loops.While this is what’s important in terms of the overarching plot, what’s far more interesting during these portions is what actually happens during these loops. They are all incredibly similar to arcs in the original Higurashi, but with key differences that ultimately lead to a very different ending. As such, to a degree these might feel a bit like playing a game of find the differences. This might feel like somewhat of a slog at times, but it ultimately felt pretty worthwhile to pay attention. The reason for that is that unlike when going through Higurashi the first time, you should already know all the rules of the game. You know what Hinamizawa Syndrome is and how it works. You know about how everything rumored regarding Ooshiro-sama’s curse is nonsense, but that there really is a major conspiracy. And thus unlike with the Question Arcs in the original Higurashi, I feel that it’s actually possible to solve the core mystery of each arc while going through it. Thus, these are much more interesting if you’re actually watching them as mysteries that you’re doing your best to solve as you watch. Unfortunately, this does come at a cost, in that because things are much easier to follow the psychological horror aspect doesn’t work nearly as well. But on the flip side, Gou spends more time on the slice of life aspect and ultimately handled it much better than the original did. Overall, it’s an incredibly different experience from the original Higurashi, and overall I’d have to say a weaker one, but one that’s still pretty good.However, arcs like that aren’t all that Gou is composed of. Following these arcs, it switches to an arc that’s really focused on putting Rika through the wringer. I really didn’t like this arc. It felt like it was abandoning it’s psychological horror aspect and just delving into torture porn relying entirely on blood and gore. Ultimately, why it was handled in such a manner does become clear: it needed to go through a lot of suffering incredibly quickly so psychological horror wouldn’t really work. However, in that case I feel like each instance dragged on too long and it would have been better off just being a montage or something. Still, however much I dislike it, it does serve it’s narrative purpose.Following this, it reveals who the true antagonist is and then leads into an extended flashback where it explains why they came to be an antagonist and how they’re doing what they’re doing. This should also pretty much completely fill in any blanks left in solving the mysteries in earlier arcs. I feel opinions on this flashback arc will vary tremendously depending on how much you can relate to the antagonist, but I felt it was very well written. The antagonist is a mess and a complete monster, but I can empathize. The smartest thing would probably have been to just walk away when given the chance, but I can see how hard that would have been as well. Throw in that absolute power power corrupts absolutely, and it’s pretty clear how things progressed the way they did. Higurashi Gou ultimately ends by closing the loop on the flashback, but not progressing any further. Thus, there isn’t anywhere near a proper end to the overarching story yet. Still, it ends at a solid enough point and there’s another season so the ending is fine for what it is.The art and animation I felt were really good and overall I like the new art style better than the old, though I’m a big fan of Passione for whatever that’s worth. The horror aspect doesn’t work as well in the new art style, but the horror was much less of a focus from a narrative point of view regardless of the art style so it doesn’t matter as much. On the other hand the art style works much better for the slice of life which was more focused on, so I think overall while it wouldn’t fit all that well to the original Higurash it’s a much better fit for Gou. There definitely were some areas that I think could have been better handled though, for example some of the character designs look really weird, such as Tomitake and Ooishi. The OP and ED had pretty good songs and visuals that fit well. There’s only one OP despite there being two cours, but visually it changes somewhat to reflect the progression in the narrative so I was fine with it. I also liked how they used an OP song from the original Higurashi at times. The soundtrack didn’t really pop out much which I feel is pretty disappointing for Higurashi but on the whole it was fine. Also, the arc names were pretty clever for the modified repeat arcs. that Higurashi Gou has connections to the other titles in the When They Cry franchise, Umineko and Ciconia.

Higurashi Gou ultimately ends by closing the loop on the flashback, but not progressing any further. Thus, there isn’t anywhere near a proper end to the overarching story yet. Still, it ends at a solid enough point and there’s another season so the ending is fine for what it is.The art and animation I felt were really good and overall I like the new art style better than the old, though I’m a big fan of Passione for whatever that’s worth. The horror aspect doesn’t work as well in the new art style, but the horror was much less of a focus from a narrative point of view regardless of the art style so it doesn’t matter as much. On the other hand the art style works much better for the slice of life which was more focused on, so I think overall while it wouldn’t fit all that well to the original Higurash it’s a much better fit for Gou. There definitely were some areas that I think could have been better handled though, for example some of the character designs look really weird, such as Tomitake and Ooishi. The OP and ED had pretty good songs and visuals that fit well. There’s only one OP despite there being two cours, but visually it changes somewhat to reflect the progression in the narrative so I was fine with it. I also liked how they used an OP song from the original Higurashi at times. The soundtrack didn’t really pop out much which I feel is pretty disappointing for Higurashi but on the whole it was fine. Also, the arc names were pretty clever for the modified repeat arcs.', ""Before I get to reviewing, I should note that this is not a remake. At this point it should be obvious as MAL finally changed the anime relation but yeah, you shouldn’t be watching this without knowing the original Higurashi plot (I’d recommend either manga or the VN, the DEEN anime didn’t age well that much). In fact, for better enjoyment I would recommend familiarity with the plot of Umineko too.Ruyukishi is a great author. But I can’t decide if he’s a better author, or a better troll. He’s a master of playing with the audience, anticipating their reactions and subverting expectations to create a...glorious emotional roller coaster. Subverting expectations not in the destructive way that leaves nobody happy, as some western directors learned to use it (I'm looking at you, Disney Star Wars), but in a good way that is both unexpected and enjoyable. This time this is incorporated even in the marketing itself, as when this “remake” was announced, I don’t think anyone expected an actual sequel. This played into higher mystery and less predictability. Which is a great thing for a mystery genre. Unfortunately it led to some confusion as people not familiar with the franchise watched this not expecting the absolute boogaloo that is about to hit them, but such are sacrifices that have to be made to achieve such trick.The strength of Gou lies in keeping the elements that made the original story great, and adding in elements that explore it in new angles. This allows us to see plot points that we would never expect but still fit with the theme. This allows us to see some characters in completely new light that we would most likely not even consider when experiencing the original. It is a storyline where even seemingly ludicrous fan theories based on the scattered hints might actually come into reality (and they have). Which is another great thing about the writing style – it is not predictable, but if you put in some effort and “investigate” the story, you could come across an actual solution (though to be fair, Umineko is what does this more and better).For a brief comparison with the DEEN version - while I miss some of the terrific derpy faces, the absolute meme material that was the arstyle choice for the DEEN adaptation, overall Passione nailed it. Gou has much better pacing, and is using animation that isn’t pain to look at but still being able to create horror moments that are pain to look at.As this season seems to hint more about the connected universe/multiverse of Ryukishi’s stories, it is something that is targeted to a more “seasoned” part of the fanbase, so definitely not a good starting point for that, and even if you have seen the previous Higurashi anime, I would recommend delving more into authors other works before coming back to this. As a fan of Ryukishi, this was a great experience and one of the most underrated gems on this site. Gou isn't for everyone, but if you happen to be the right target audience, you're in for a ride. And I'm glad that producers took a risk to create something that is not certain to create a big commercial success but rather something tailored to a more niche audience. Did Higurashi *need* a sequel? Not necessarily. Is is good that it got one? Absolutely. glorious emotional roller coaster.

For someone that didn't watch GDS it might be comfusing and you will miss a lot!But i highly recommend this for those fans that want to refresh their memory of good times while watching GDS.I give this movie special a 10 because i belong to that group...of people and i loved it! of people and i loved it!"", ""It is not very often that a Gundam series gets a sequel. In fact, it almost never, ever happens. Not unless you consider all the Universal Century series to be prequels/sequels to one another. But for the alternate universes, sequels are extremely rare. SEED is one of few to get a sequel, one that it honestly did not need and really does nothing for it. SEED Destiny is not a failure or flop by any stretch of the imagination. It is, however, kind of a rehash of the original SEED. Many plot points feel very familiar, along with the returning cast of characters who basically...fill the same roles they did before. If I honestly wanted to, I could end the review right here. However, you all deserve an explanation so I will continue.The characters of SEED Destiny are mostly the same as before. You have Kira Yamato who has now settled down with Lacus Clyne, Athrun Zala who has secretly settled down with Cagalli Yula Attha, and the rest are kind of off doing their own thing. And this is the perfect time to introduce a new main cast, right? Right? Well yes and no. For this series, we have a new main protagonist in Shinn Asuka, an orphan who watched as his parents and younger sibling were blown to bloody chunks right before his very eyes. Gruesome isn't it? It's kind of the pedigree of the SEED series as this point. Along with him we have Lunamaria and Meyrin Hawke along with PLANT Supreme Chancellor Guilbert Durandal. So really everyone except the new cast are living peacefully in this post war world. That is, until a new war brakes out. And at first only Athrun, who has returned to ZAFT, and the new cast are involved. Then Kira eventually gets involved and the story begins to spiral out of control from there.The art remains largely identical to the original SEED in that it was all done by computer, though the CG does look somewhat better than before. The colors are nice and bright, the water looks great, the characters look cool. Everything is essentially still intact from the previous series. The only real difference being that the original cast now looks noticeably two years older as it should be. They look more mature somehow while still looking quite youthful and childlike. Their fashion sense is still kind of questionable though.The sound effects are all reused and the music is more or less the same as it was before. Sure, the soundtrack is entirely new, but it sounds the same none the less due to the fact that this is a SEED sequel. And that isn't a minus. In my SEED review, the soundtrack was one of the best parts, and this soundtrack does not disappoint. More Rie Tanaka, more T.M. Revolution, and more piano songs. What's not to love about the soundtrack?By this point you're probably beginning to wonder why I seem a bit agitated just talking about this series. Well, you already read my thoughts on the characters. They're pretty much the same in every aspect and the original cast honestly gets no further development. But what really grinds my gears with this series, is the fact that it did not stick to its guns AT ALL. It started out strong and showed a lot of promise by trying to tell a story about a new group of characters who were meant to be the successors to the original cast. However, that also required that they actually surpass the original cast. Which unfortunately did not happen because the writers wife was in love with Kira and Athrun, meaning that at the halfway mark of the series, when both characters were more or less supposed to(And sorry for the spoilers, but it is extremely hard to not emphasize my dislike without them) kick the bucket to let the new characters shine and have their own development... they didn't. Deus Ex Machina's be damned. The relationship between Athrun and Cagalli was also screwed up because the same person disliked Cagalli. It was just ridiculous how much of a mess the story became because of someone screwing around with it. It had a lot of potential to go big, but it chose to go home instead for no discernable reason.Ok, I'm done venting now. So before I blow a gasket, I'm gonna end this review so I can cool off and go to bed because it is 5:17am as of the time of this writing. It is hard for me to recommend this series to anyone, but the most diehard SEED fans. I can watch it on a whim, but I'm not really satisfied with what was given. And as you'll notice I skipped the Theme portion of the review, and that is because this series is dual theme, the second of which doesn't pop up until about the 75% completion point. And so its a big spoiler and thus will not be discussed. In the end, SEED Destiny is not horrendous. It is however, a series that did not need to exist. Perhaps the flaws of Destiny could have been corrected had the SEED theatrical film actually be finished as it was the third and final part to the SEED saga. However, it appears that said theatrical film will never see the light of day and thus the SEED story will remain unfinished. Unless you're completely okay with how SEED or SEED Destiny ended, in which case the point is moot.Addendum: While writing this review, I spoke of it as if it were the 50 episode television series. It is, however, the four part compilation film series. The films improve the storyline of Destiny to some extent, telling it from Athruns more neutral point of view, redoing some scenes, etc. So this gives Destiny some extra points in the story and character categories. If you must watch Destiny, I vastly recommend these films over the original TV series any day of the week because they are the undisputed definitive Destiny story. fill the same roles they did before.

Kakegurui Twin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50339/Kakegurui_Twin,"['I think If you liked Kakegurui, and honestly If you didn’t like Kakegurui then you should have NO reason to be here, you would also like this. Kakegurui Twin proves that Saotome Mary can carry her own show without Yumeko. She becomes a student in this school where gambling is everything and She tries to survive in it while protecting her friends and herself from becoming housepets or pawns in the games of two new third year character in this show. Just like the usual Kakegurui It is enjoyable to watch so once again If you liked the original I would highly reccommend this one...as well BUT also even If someone did not watch the original they can still watch and enjoy this without problem as This happens in the past.Anyway I also want to adress one thing and that is Mary’s Personality in this. I guess It is not unfair for people to say that Mary’s personality is “retconned” because She was not like how She is like here in the first episode of Kakegurui but I think the point people are missing here is that this show is NOT over. There HAS to be a reason why the girl here “Tsuzura” is not with Mary in the main show so the point of criticism about Mary’s personality difference is not exactly something wrong but something that is yet to be revealed. Tsuzura not being in the main show obviously has things to do with why Mary has changed so I think people are judging the series without understanding that It creates a mystery that will one day be answered but since they do not understand that they took the lack of Tsuzura in the main series and Mary’s personality difference as an error/retcon or the likes rather than something changing her before Yumeko arrived in the main timeline. So I think people should have tried to think a bit more here instead of jumping guns about how Mary is completely changed or why a character here is not in the main series….. despite the fact that this series is NOT over and their reasons of hate are just QUESTIONS that waits answers as well BUT also even If someone did not watch the original they can still watch and enjoy this without problem as This happens in the past.Anyway I also want to adress one thing and that is Mary’s Personality in this.

Then we get Hanatemari,...isn\'t it weird how a character so connected to Saotome was never mentioned in Kakegurui before Twin? Not only that, it feels like we are being somewhat mocked by the writer of the manga, because one of the most criticised characters in Kakegurui is Suzui and I bet the writer, as an evil genius, thought ""I bet you all won\'t be complaining if \'Suzui\' is a cute girl"", damn and he got us, Hanatemari is cute waifu material and she also has the Yuri bait for those that like that. Hook, line, and sinker. Saotome also has a second friend, Yukimi, from the literacy club and she is probably one of the blandest characters in Kakegurui. As for the main antagonist, she is settled early on as Juraku Sachiko, she is a Kirari Momobami rip-off and her pet, Sado Mikura (btw talking about her, why does she, as a mitten, act so rude towards Saotome? Kakegurui lore established that already or is it another retcon?), is a rip-off of Igarashi Sayaka, the bad side of her at least. To put it simply, it feels like Kakegurui Twin is retelling the events of Kakegurui if Saotome was the protagonist instead, sure she isn\'t gambling against the same characters Yumeko did, but I\'m talking about the essence here. Do you want another example? Kakegurui Twin has a pink hair girl called Kurume Kurumi, Kakegurui has a pink hair girl called Yumemite Yumemi (they were probably avoiding a copyright from themselves). Another character that becomes the antagonist is Mibuomi Aoi, his motives aren\'t clear yet and his ""organisation"" Full-Bloom seems suspicious these 6 episodes weren\'t enough to scratch the surface, there is also his fiancée, Miharutaki Sakura, which is also a rip-off of Igarashi, but the good side of her, the one that is concerned about fairness and justice.As for the story, it seems that at first Saotome wants to make friends and she quickly achieves that, so not that long afterwards she gets tangled with Mibuomi and she is introduced to Full-Bloom and his plan to take down the Council President. Miharutaki gets jealous because Mibuomi is so focused on Saotome and decides to gamble with her with a help from Sado because Juraku has also her eyes on Saotome making the mitten jealous as well. Saotome ends up winning the bet and Miharutaki is discarded like trash and you can\'t help but feel sorry for her - even though she acted cocky in the previous gamble and she had bet herself her own post if she lost.I was a bit sadden that the opening was only instrumental, when it started I felt like we would get a banger like Deal with the Devil, it is a good opening, but the lack of lyrics was disappointing. The ending was cute and alright, I think the animation will be more memorable than the song itself.The art is alright, if there is something that the manga is praised is the beautiful art it has, this anime didn\'t capture its beauty, even the ""ugly"" faces Mary sometimes do when she wants to mock others are kinda lame here, some other times it feels like character are stuck in time, which brings me to the animation being subpar also the way their mouths are as articulate as sock puppets you won\'t be able to stop noticing that. BTW what\'s up with the green-ish tone we have in some scenes?Overall, it\'s alright, I like Kakegurui even though Mary isn\'t my favourite, but I enjoy watching/reading stuff related to it, it is fun, but I can see this as not being something becoming that popular.Also, if you can look over Mary\'s retcon it will probably be more enjoyable, I couldn\'t so it wasn\'t as good for me. isn\'t it weird how a character so connected to Saotome was never mentioned in Kakegurui before Twin?

Also, it\'s incomplete.Though Kakegurui only had 2 seasons, I didn\'t wanted to watch given the slightly mixed reception it got and some scenes I watched on YT made me wonder if gambling is really the point of the show. But I was still curious to see what made Kakegurui one of the popular gambling anime as it is so I checked Twin and.. I have some mixed opinions.The story follows ""Saotame Mary"" in Hyakkaou Academy where not a single day passes without someone...in school loosing their shit. Money, virginity, dignity, anything can be a prize and nothing matters in this school, as long as it\'s an end result of gambling. What makes this is even more f-ked up is that ""cheating is allowed"", which is the biggest problem here. Because when you allow cheating, you\'re basically distinguishing the characters, not based how intelligent they are but based on how stupid they are. The moment you hear a character inner monoluging about their plan as an attempt to hook the viewer, it pretty much tells why the said character will end up ridiculed later down the game, and this basically what happens through out this Anime and so it does in many of these kind of Anime that have been lately popular. Now one would argue, ""Well, Kaiji also does the same thing"" for which I agree. Kaiji becomes predictable but there\'s an underlying theme in Kaiji, which what makes it a great psycological Anime, and one Twin didn\'t had. That is;""GAMBLING IS FUCKED""Kaiji draws you into its gambles, mainly because it constantly reminds you why gambling is so fucked and it takes a realistic approach to do it. Kakegurui Twin doesn\'t have this. Most of the \'Gambling\' part went into its mind games complexity which I applaud for but it doesn\'t work either because if you remember correctly, ""Cheating is a-OK"". The reason I repeat this is because the show repeats this too. ""No one said [insert convenient loophole in rule], so you lose/win"", that\'s the underlying structure of all explanations at the end of every game but it does have some interesting character antiques to look forward to. The underlying theme in Kakegurui Twin is just ""Gambling is fun, and hot-crazy-yurified chicks are cool"", that\'s basically it. But, Is Twin a bad show?With all my rambling about why Twin don\'t hold a candle towards my favourite Anime makes it seem like I\'m hating the show, which I don\'t because ""Kakegurui Twin"" is definitely a fun show. As I said, its underlying theme is ""Fun with crazy Anime girls"" and it does that part great. As over the top as it is, it is confident in its mind game elements, and it does with style. MAPPA trademark visual flair can be found in it\'s Jazzy opening, absolutely bop of an ending and the over the top characters does their job to deliver the fun you want to see. I personally thought characters weren\'t bad, they\'re pretty one dimensional except Mary, who\'s two dimensional (Wow, who would\'ve guessed your waifu is 2D xD) and the whole Yuri element is.. well, it is charming, except *that* pet, if you know what I mean.Want to watch some CGDCG (Cute girls doing crazy gambling) with some Yuri in the mix?Well, this is for you. in school loosing their shit. Money, virginity, dignity, anything can be a prize and nothing matters in this school, as long as it\'s an end result of gambling.

Kaiji becomes predictable but there\'s an underlying theme in Kaiji, which what makes it a great psycological Anime, and one Twin didn\'t had. That is;""GAMBLING IS FUCKED""Kaiji draws you into its gambles, mainly because it constantly reminds you why gambling is so fucked and it takes a realistic approach to do it. Kakegurui Twin doesn\'t have this. Most of the \'Gambling\' part went into its mind games complexity which I applaud for but it doesn\'t work either because if you remember correctly, ""Cheating is a-OK"". The reason I repeat this is because the show repeats this too. ""No one said [insert convenient loophole in rule], so you lose/win"", that\'s the underlying structure of all explanations at the end of every game but it does have some interesting character antiques to look forward to. The underlying theme in Kakegurui Twin is just ""Gambling is fun, and hot-crazy-yurified chicks are cool"", that\'s basically it. But, Is Twin a bad show?With all my rambling about why Twin don\'t hold a candle towards my favourite Anime makes it seem like I\'m hating the show, which I don\'t because ""Kakegurui Twin"" is definitely a fun show. As I said, its underlying theme is ""Fun with crazy Anime girls"" and it does that part great. As over the top as it is, it is confident in its mind game elements, and it does with style. MAPPA trademark visual flair can be found in it\'s Jazzy opening, absolutely bop of an ending and the over the top characters does their job to deliver the fun you want to see. I personally thought characters weren\'t bad, they\'re pretty one dimensional except Mary, who\'s two dimensional (Wow, who would\'ve guessed your waifu is 2D xD) and the whole Yuri element is.. well, it is charming, except *that* pet, if you know what I mean.Want to watch some CGDCG (Cute girls doing crazy gambling) with some Yuri in the mix?Well, this is for you.', ""- - SPOILER FREE - ------------------------------------------------------Kakegurui twin was easily the best entry in the series. As a whole, Kakegurui twin focuses on Mary Saotome as a First-year student at Hyakkaou Academy accompanied by her friend Tsuzura Hanatemari. This is a Canon prequel to the main Kakegurui series.Animation:The team was guided by Mappa and Netflix, and to be honest, the animation was a bit better simplified in Twin.The opening animation was by far my favorite in terms of looks. The color scheme, the matte look, it all looked really nice and pleasing. The ending animation was also very satisfying with its pastel colors and...smooth frames. They tried lip-syncing again as they tried in the opening in Kakegurui XX, and this time it actually works and doesn't look uncanny/creepy. Although, I was not a fan of the chibis that represent Mary and Tsuzura. They look like something out of Disney, which displeased me A LOT.  Altogether, I'm going to give the animation a 7/10.Music:The Background / Accompanying music had a substantial upgrade in Twin compared to the other entries. I don't know why, or how it got better, but it somehow fit the themes of the show and sounded very pleasing. The opening was much simpler, High tempo Jazz just like OP 1 of Kakegurui, but no lyrics. I saw that many people did not like the change of no lyrics, but I personally enjoyed it! I do wish that the opening was a bit longer, but all-in-all it was a very nice opening. The ending was also very enjoyable.  Queens Bluff by i☆Ris fit perfectly with the theme of the show and the pastel ending. With the upbeat tempo and bright melodies, this song was perfect for the animation.  I wouldn't say this is the best ED in the series (lay-on-the-line is literally perfect)  but it comes in at an EXTREMELY close second. I'd say that the music is a 9.5/10.Story:To keep this review Spoiler-Free I am going to keep this section short. The story was very solid for a six-episode anime. The first five episodes made perfect sense and even was better than the main Kakegurui series. The ending to the story though, not quite. This ending felt rushed. It did fit as a prequel and did end the story well, but still felt rushed and required a bit of brainpower to understand. Overall, I'm going to give the story an 8/10.Character Design:Oh my god. Ten out of fucking ten. Mary was so much better designed than how she was in the main series, her friends Tsuzura and Yukimi also seemed like amazing friends, and had really good development. What's also really good is that villains Like Inui and Aoi were perfect villains and just pissed you off in the right areas. Mary's character development also was really good, towards the end of the anime she seemed like her true self, just like in the main Kakegurui seasons. 10/10.I give Kakegurui Twin a 9/10.

Easily the best in the series."", 'So let’s start by stating this anime is entirely a stand alone, you do NOT need to watch the original series to enjoy the story, however it is fun to see the characters again in a new fashion. I really really enjoyed this after watching the main series some years ago. However I was a little disappointed in the lack of true “psychological terror” that was really prevalent in the main series. I personally feel that this is what gives the series it’s charm, since it’s so few and far between that you see something like that. However, there was still some very interesting gambling...events that made you think.I wanna talk a bit about the characters. I really enjoy seeing a deeper side to Mary’s story since it’s so brief when we encounter her in the main series. I like how they’ve made her more dynamic, starting her off when she was just at the school and beginning her first gamble. Tsuzura gave me those typical big chested not so bright vibes, but she was certainly cute and very devoted to helping Mary achieve her dreams. Trying to keep this spoil free so I won’t move into any other characters aside from those immediately introduced.I really love the modern edge given to the art style as well! It all looks very sharp and dynamic. It’s a nice change of pace from some of the less detailed animes out there right now. And it’s on Netflix, an easy place to find a quick watch. Six episodes makes that easy too!I think this series is interesting if you’re looking to have a little bit of a taste of the original show without the determination to sit down and watch the entire main series. It covers a lot of the interesting points of what makes Kakeguri interesting, and is amusing to watch since it’s short and sweet. I however recommend watching the main series for the thrills and terror that really makes this entire show pop. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it takes a lot for me to hate an anime so take my review with a grain of salt and watch it for yourself! events that made you think.I wanna talk a bit about the characters.

Mary Saotome is a well-written character though she isn't my favourite of this anime.The art of this ONA isn't up to expectations as the only decent looking character is Mary. The OPs and EDs were good though.For enjoyment I will give it a 7. There were some twists and cute scenes that can match up to the main story itself.So yep XD a 7. If you like Mary...Saotome a lot and you want to watch animes under this genre, you should watch it. Saotome a lot and you want to watch animes under this genre, you should watch it."", ""There is no such thing as gambling anime.In reality, shows people refer to as “gambling anime” are simply shonen battle anime with gambling characteristics - entertainment where the stories are all based around various characters resolving their conflicts with each other; only in these shows it’s not about superhuman martial arts masters or kids with superpowers fighting each other; but regular-ass human beings contriving more and more ways to play games of logic against each other, for the purpose of whatever plot-relevant stakes at hand at any given moment. Collective aesthetic dissimilarity, then, is what drives people to proclaim works like these to be in...a separate genre; but it’s best to regard them as fundamentally no different from your Dragon Balls, your Attacks on Titan, your Chainsaw Men; or even your Revolutionary Girls Utena or Kills la Kill; because it gives you a much better understanding of the plot mechanics these works utilize to entertain you, but also a much broader range of comparison between works, to understand WHY these stories work.Once you consider these stories not as part of a separate group of things that came out of nowhere but things with a lineage; you get to see what influences their creators had and where their ideas came from. All of which is to say that, generally, gambling anime are stories with the foundations of shonen battle manga with the mechanics of classical whodunnit murder mysteries thrown on top of them; except in these works the murder is turned into a game that the detective needs to win, and “figuring out the murderer by gathering evidence and deducing what happened” becomes “figuring out the true mechanics of the game/the moves the other player is making/the method the opponent uses to cheat by examining the game’s rules and the opponent’s actions and winning the game”. They are shonen battle stories because the protagonist faces a continuous stream of villains of ever-growing threat level; but they work like detective novels in that there is no violence and confrontations aren’t decided by who can overpower whom with whatever magic powers they have, but rather who can outsmart the other. It’s just that “gambling” is the best word we have so far to convey “murder mystery without the murder”; and “outsmarting” as a genre name sounds stupid.I’m explaining all of this upfront because I need you to believe me when I tell you that one of the primary reasons to watch Kakegurui Twin, the prequel series to its parent series Kakegurui; is because its main character, Saotome Mary, is one of the greatest, most unique shonen anime protagonists of all-time.So; Kakegurui. It’s that super popular cartoon series about all the kids of Japan’s rich and powerful going to the same elite high school to make connections with each other and definitely get into college, where all the kids are forced into playing gambling games with each other to win more money, because if they don’t have any, they become the slaves of the kids who do have money, to do whatever bidding they have. It’s a unique-enough setting and setup which even makes room for anti-capitalist messaging (if Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is the most libertarian anime ever made, this franchise is by far the most incidentally socialist), but more importantly it’s the perfect foundation for the utterly unique structure with which it tells its shonen battle manga plot, most of which structure is replicated in this spinoff series to a fantastic degree. As stated before, Kakegurui Twin is the prequel to mainline series Kakegurui: a one-off villain turned secondary protagonist in the main story, this prequel stars Saotome Mary, fresh-faced working class first year high school student looking to make it big in the elite high school she studied and lucked herself into attending alongside all the rich kids; forced to partake alongside her friends in a series of gambling games against rich and powerful students within the school in order to keep herself out of what is essentially human slavery.If you watched Kakegurui and its sequel series (or read the manga) and liked it enough to even be reading a review about its spinoff, rest assured that all the things that make Kakegurui what it is are found just as well here. A student somehow forces the main character to take part in a gamble, which if the main character lost would mean her becoming a slave to the school’s system, but the main character figures out how the game REALLY works/figures out how the opponent is cheating, uses the game’s mechanics/the opponent’s cheating methods against the opponent, the main character wins; the opponent cries, rinse and repeat until the end credits of the last episode whereupon you beg Netflix for another season on Twitter until the story is complete; but it’s the way this is done and everything around it that makes Kakegurui Twin utterly compelling and wildly entertaining (just like its progenitor).First, there are the gambles. These are not your everyday games that you would play in a casino (not that the kids in this school aren’t shown to be playing exactly those games all the time), but rather wholly unique and original games thought up exclusively for this story by original author Kawamoto Homura! You have your card and board games, sure; but nothing of its kind can touch Kakegurui when it comes to variety! This is a series where characters’ fates depend upon succeeding in games based on things as wildly diverse as speed dating and cryptic scavenger hunts! Every single one of these games has their rules explained in detail, and the show goes to great lengths to explain, step-by-step, every last decision made by every character involved in the game, oftentimes as a big dramatic reveal at the end. If you are smart enough, you can figure out the way to beat the game alongside Mary in real-time, but even if you aren’t, the explanations given at the end are always 100% purely logical - you can rewatch an episode after finding out how to beat it and see every character’s actions in a brand-new light! (And unlike certain other shows in the same vein, games here are far shorter than four real-life hours.)Then there is Kakegurui Twin’s supporting cast. Let’s not mince words: the Kakegurui franchise as a whole has one of the greatest casts of characters in anime history, and Kakegurui Twin’s cast is no exception. Internal monologue is the name of the game here (hehe); as not only are these used to explain what happens in the game, rather the games themselves are used as reflections of the characters participating in them! This allows the runtime to provide incredibly vivid and detailed insights into the personalities of these characters! There is barely a single throwaway named character in Kakegurui: every character in the series has his/her own unique view of the world, unique ideology, unique desires and unique relationship to every other member of the cast; and these relationships are in constant flux! Every single game is posed as a psychological battle between characters; where their entire personalities and worldviews are pit against Saotome Mary; and every game is mined for every last shred of possible characterization, be it a deep dive into one of the characters’ personality and beliefs, as reflected through their actions in games, or the character development that comes after a game is over. What puts it over the top is that, like I said, this is not a story about superpowered characters, these are regular kids who live the same lives as you and I do. And because we spend so much time with them during the games; because we are privy to every last one of their thoughts and feelings; few anime make the viewer so empathetic towards its characters as Kakegurui! From childhood friend Hanatemari Tsuzura’s unwavering admiration of Mary, to Mikura Sado’s sexual submission and unending idolization of principal villain Juraku Sachiko (an overbearing, domineering, sadistic presence matched by few other characters), you FEEL for these kids, their triumphs, their despair, their desperation! And because these kids ultimately have to still go to the same school once their conflict is over, you get to watch what happens to them in the aftermath! Other series have used this kind of device to have a recurring cast of villains before; that is true. But none of those series had a cast of characters this dynamic, none of those series make the viewer want to see what happens to the characters THIS much! When you start watching Kakegurui Twin, you think the main draw of the series is getting to see the games play out, once it’s drawn you in, you understand that what keeps you coming back is that you want to see what happens to EVERYBODY in this story!Finally; Saotome Mary. As I said, she is one of the greatest, most unique shonen protagonists of all-time. Other main characters facing similar challenges all have an intrinsic quality to them that is commonly associated with positive qualities. They’re generally protective of others, love adventure and having a friendly fight, they never give up and always trust their friends. They are never shown to have any vices, and even the very notion of them having any interest in the opposite sex tends to be verboten (stories like these never allow a main character to have any kind of sexuality). You know the type; you’ve seen a million shonen anime with main characters like this by now (at least it’s better than the milquetoast non-entities of the isekai genre). Even within its similar group of stories; as far as main characters go, Madarame Baku of Usogui fame is the smartest man in the world who has everything planned out years in advance, and Itou Kaiji of… Kaiji wins because of his indomitable will to survive. Even in the main Kakegurui series, protagonist Jabami Yumeko’s sole character flaw is her compulsive addiction to gambling; and even that is shown as mostly being a danger to herself as opposed to others.Saotome Mary’s strength comes from the pride she takes in herself.Throughout the series, Saotome Mary’s triumphs come not from a will to defend others, not from a need to save the world or all else is lost, not even out of desperate self-preservation, but simply from an utter and absolute refusal to bow to her enemies! In every gesture, in every frame, in every line of dialog, the audience gets the sense that this is a woman with infinite self-regard, who’s ingenuity, daring, inventiveness and brilliance stems out of her single-minded dedication to the idea that she. Will. Not. Lose. This is a character who becomes a gambling genius out of pure spite against people who think they’re smarter than her and want to fuck her over! Yet she never succumbs to petty sadism like her enemies, her infinite self-confidence is always secondary to her sense of righteousness! Where, if you were a villain, other battle manga protagonists would, after defeating you, offer you a helping hand and give you a speech about how you can turn over a new leaf and be a good person from now on; in Kakeguru Twin, Saotome Mary will publicly dress you down, utterly destroy your ego, call you a bitch, and essentially dare you to quit being a bitch! She will get you to start getting character development and become a better person through the sheer power of what can only be called weaponized smugness!It’s this sense of tempered ruthlessness that makes Saotome Mary stand out as one of the all-time great lead characters in anime. Whether it's her thinking hard about her next move in order to make it in her school, whether it's her being upset and exasperated over what the school does to it's students, or when she is panicking over betrayal, this is a woman impossibly admirable, yet more human and more relatable than most other lead characters in the entire medium; an absolute showstopper of a performance that few will ever forget! Here's a comparison that you will probably understand: Imagine if Seto Kaiba from the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series was gender swapped and given a show to star in, defeating villains who have no idea who they are messing with, and you will know what Kakegurui Twin is like.(Special mention must go to other principal villain Mibuomi Aoi; possibly the scariest, most horrifying sociopath in anime; a terrifying piece of shit who you get the sense doesn’t even live in reality, and only begrudgingly treats the people around him as humans because they’re easier to order around that way; one of the greatest anime villains, period.)And of course, the entire thing is gorgeous. The series trademark of making the characters faces extremely distorted and ugly in order to portray their deranged emotions on screen remains, but so much of this thing is infused with so much style, so many different styles of filmmaking and animation is used all throughout the show. The music is still the same freeform jazz, so that's still a plus. And in general, the drawings are superbly beautiful, and Dolby Vision gives the series top notch image quality.That is to say: Kakegurui Twin is more Kakegurui. It's one of the absolute best things on TV today, adapted from one of the absolute best things on shelves today; a new perspective and fresh addition to a group of the most enthralling characters you've ever seen. The only reason the overall rating is a 9 is because the story is not finished yet (this will be amended eventually, lesz the world should perish prior); but trust me: this thing is a fucking masterpiece! a separate genre; but it’s best to regard them as fundamentally no different from your Dragon Balls, your Attacks on Titan, your Chainsaw Men; or even your Revolutionary Girls Utena or Kills la Kill; because it gives you a much better understanding of the plot mechanics these works utilize to entertain you, but also a much broader range of comparison between works, to understand WHY these stories work.Once you consider these stories not as part of a separate group of things that came out of nowhere but things with a lineage; you get to see what influences their creators had and where their ideas came from.

Here's a comparison that you will probably understand: Imagine if Seto Kaiba from the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series was gender swapped and given a show to star in, defeating villains who have no idea who they are messing with, and you will know what Kakegurui Twin is like.(Special mention must go to other principal villain Mibuomi Aoi; possibly the scariest, most horrifying sociopath in anime; a terrifying piece of shit who you get the sense doesn’t even live in reality, and only begrudgingly treats the people around him as humans because they’re easier to order around that way; one of the greatest anime villains, period.)And of course, the entire thing is gorgeous. The series trademark of making the characters faces extremely distorted and ugly in order to portray their deranged emotions on screen remains, but so much of this thing is infused with so much style, so many different styles of filmmaking and animation is used all throughout the show. The music is still the same freeform jazz, so that's still a plus. And in general, the drawings are superbly beautiful, and Dolby Vision gives the series top notch image quality.That is to say: Kakegurui Twin is more Kakegurui. It's one of the absolute best things on TV today, adapted from one of the absolute best things on shelves today; a new perspective and fresh addition to a group of the most enthralling characters you've ever seen. The only reason the overall rating is a 9 is because the story is not finished yet (this will be amended eventually, lesz the world should perish prior); but trust me: this thing is a fucking masterpiece!"", ""Kakegurui Twin is certainly different in terms of plot and mood set up in this show in comparaison with the main Kakegurui show, but it gives a refreshing breath to the series. The ''dark'' mood and the psychological distress we know from the main show is softer in Twin but it still has its intriguing and entertaining side with dynamics games and the relationship between the different characters.Regarding the quality of this anime itself, several aspects can be highlighted here. The animation style is different from the main series but stays clean and detailed. The OSTs are nice and some of them are just jamming....The VAs did a great job, which isn't a surprise with that whole series.For people who are saying that Twin doesn't worth it just because Yumeko is not here, Mary genuinely carries this show and the way she is represented here makes that character even more likable now than in the main series.Of course, only 6 episodes is frustrating but we're talking about a manga spin-off that got an anime adaptation, which is pretty rare. Mappa got several projects and Twin maybe wasn't the main priority but it is obvious that they still put effort into this show, which is in their honor.

Some of the gambles were not as well designed as those in kakegurui imo, but it still follows the same kind of format, same suspense, same satisfaction at watching these girls overturn seemingly impossible odds. Plus, mary best girl. If you enjoyed the main anime series, and want more of the same taste, then you\'ll get it here. i would say most of the side characters are quite one-dimension, it has your typical submissive ""i-would-give-my-life-to-you"" sidekick, but for me it was worth it just to see mary prevail and outwit those that went against her. it was great to see her get...to where she was in kakegurui. to where she was in kakegurui.', 'Kekegurui, an anime that used to pop off around the late 2010’s but now its public reputation is basically summed up as that “dat one anime with the weird faces and the poker”No wait that\'s Kaiji.Kakegurui is the one and only anime that I know is not worth defending ,but I do it anyway. I know it\'s not a great show.But what bothers me is that it could be great. But it trips over itself a lot. And the OVA, Kakegurui Twin,I was excited for,but then it turned out……mmmm alright. It didn’t suck necessarily. I think it does some tiny little things here and there...better than its parent story,but goddammit.STORYWhat really sucks about this OVA is that it doesn’t do a good job of proving that Kakegurui can be good, if that makes any sense. I know one in every 3 anime watchers hate this show, and that is valid,can’t argue about it. But what sucks is that Kakegurui has soooooooooooo soooooooooooooooo much potential to be a great series. Some think that it’s just yuribait fanservice with kookie faces, and they aren\'t wrong. But they basically write the show off as just that while myself sees certain aspects about its worldbuilding, aesthetic, and characters that feel like breeding ground for something interesting. I love how Hyyakkaou Private Academy feels like a miniature version of the real world,where the rich basically have control over everything and the poor are deprived of their human rights and bodily autonomy.The fact that all of this is based around gambling as well shows that all humans are equal in the eyes of Lady Luck.However, some students are so desperate to win at all costs that they use tactics to win either by straight up cheating, or using psychological taunts. And what makes it interesting is when they try to figure this stuff out. And I think this set up leaves some strong characters,they arent the most well written,but their personalities are so warped and fucked up because of this predatory social class that the school perpetuates.And not to mention the antagonists in Kakegurui are so alluring and captivating.They’re the type of characters that can only work in anime. I say this because I watched a little of the live action adaptation and I almost died of cringe faster than you can say Rudeus Greyrat.The downside to all of Kakegurui’s elements are that they feel like a tease.Its like a fancy pinata that is eye catching,but when you cut it open, its just hollow paper.What Kakegurui needs desperately is a story, a story with stakes, and balls;a story that has the same amount of weight that backs up how dramatic the show acts.Its not like the writer doesn\'t have the competence needed to write because they sat down and planned out these convoluted as hell games. This season literally has a speed dating gambling game and it is ridiculous.But for some reason in this season along with the others, the story is just not up to par with everything else. S1 was just worldbuilding watching Yumeko walk around gambling with people, S2 tried to have a plot about a race to take the student council position but then it shits the bed by diving into different story arcs entirely,and while the story in this OVA is more cohesive than the others. Dude,come on, the story is basically Mary trying to secure the rights to some gambling den and joining some club. Its really lame tbh for something like Kakegurui. This is a gambling show, I want people to die, I want the mafia to come in, I want these snot nosed students to have actual life or death consequences,Its not like there are adults to stop them or anything.There are a shitton of expendable characters in Kakegurui and in season two the cast literally doubles in size. I WANT YUMEKO TO KILL SOME MOB BOSSES,IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK, HOMURA KAWAMOTO?ART/ANIMATION/SOUNDOn a technical aspect,Kakegurui does a lot of swings and hits, one thing that Kakegurui truly deserves praise for is its direction, the use of camera shots, 3d, and little tricks to play with the audience gives this show ""style"". Which is one thing I can never fault a show for. This is the type of show that has flashes of brilliance in the little moments. One scene could have some of the most fluid hair and fabric movement for a nanosecond, another scene could be an insane dance sequence. And I am really glad that they use visuals to explain these games and the thought process of each player. And also the staple of the series, the facial expressions, some say they’re kooky, I think they\'re effective depending on the tone of the scene. Twin is less ambitious, the facial expressions are toned down heavily because I feel like the animator they had for the previous seasons was busy or something. But this season isn\'t awfully animated,its alright. And the soundtrack of Kakegurui in general is lowkey one of the best anime soundtracks of all time. The most iconic track being ""Strange Visage"" which is so iconic that its literally labelled as ""The track from Kakegurui that you\'ve been searching for"". Its one of those soundtracks that make you really think, a sort of controlled chaos with erratic jazz and electronica. And yes the soundtrack invades my study playlist. It fits Kakegurui\'s vibe so well that it becomes the vibe. And it even gets better in season 2.I can\'t tell if TWIN has a new soundtrack, but it sounded great nonetheless, goes to show that the best thing about Kakegurui is its soundtrack.CHARACTERSThere are a lot of Kakegurui characters, but let\'s be honest, the only one that truly matters is Yumeko, she is bae.I literally had an entire paragraph about why I like Yumeko but had to cut it out since she isn\'t even in this season :(. And major bummer because the show could have had a cameo or something to tie all the seasons together but no. And with the protag of the series, Mary. I have no problem with her, she likes to take the piss out of people which is kinda entertaining but she is more “tame” than the other characters and I have to admit her ragtag duo of glasses girl and blue haired girl aren\'t that exciting to watch. They are basically the Ryouta of this season,but a bit more useful.Now for the antagonist of this series Sachiko Juraku,her character is not well developed but hubba hubba. I’m not the type of guy who falls for anime girls willy nilly,I\'m more of a personality rather than looks type of man. But holy shit. I love a girl who is a controlling dominatrix ,and with the red eyes and white flowing hair, woooo weeeee,put a collar around me,master,really embarrassing myself right now,but shit i already typed this, might as well own it. Her house pet SandM girl was an interesting case as well but she isnt as developed as i had hoped. I still enjoyed them because the two bounced off each other like a couple in a trashy porno.Goes to show that character development isn\'t always necessary, just highly highly highly highly highly recommended if you want your audience to care about things other than looks.THE KAKEGURUI CREATOR IS WEIRD LOLI don\'t know, at this point I probably should just call Kakegurui a mediocre franchise and be done with it but honestly…….I can’t. There is still something about it that allures me and it has so much potential. I just want a better story, But I doubt i\'ll get that because the creator is too busy making either card game anime, isekai manga, or isekai manga with card games in them. Speaking of them, I need to mention their portfolio of works,because its hilarious.This creator has a thing with card games, They were the creator of that Build Divide card game show no one cares about, and there\'s an upcoming anime called High Card that is about, you guessed it, card games,but the twist is that the cards have supernatural powers or something lmao.There is also that controversy where they made an isekai that ripped off real characters from other works in such a way that it felt like personal attacks against other authors,and it got to a point where the author had to apologize and the series was canceled. This is probably the funniest controversy I have seen online so far lololol.But moral of the story,the creator doesn’t have the time of day for this series anymore. They treat Kakegurui like their bastard child, ignoring them,focusing on their new children, and planning to send them to the wall when they get the chance. Sadly Kakegurui can never be the Lord of Winterfell because it\'s Kakegurui.ENJOYMENT?And as a mild supporter-not really a fan- of this series,I feel like defending this show is like a dog trainer in a circus trying to get the dog to do a trick but it just sits there and I just yell at the audience being like “ Just you wait, it\'s gonna do something amazing,just you wait!”. I don’t know how long this delusion can last,but each year I kinda feel the intrigue of Kakegurui fading away,and this OVA,while not terrible, does little to take me back to those days where Kakegurui was a fresh and exciting face in the world of anime. better than its parent story,but goddammit.STORYWhat really sucks about this OVA is that it doesn’t do a good job of proving that Kakegurui can be good, if that makes any sense.

Typically, when you have a canon spin-off like this, you expect it to be fun, but nothing too special. Perhaps more of the same, but with a bit of a twist. Kakegurui Twin definitely fits the latter description, but it surpassed my expectations in many ways. So much so, I'm just gonna say it - I enjoyed this a bit more than the main series and my scores reflect that!So how does Twin differ from the rest? Well, firstly it delivers on much of what makes Kakegurui in general appealing. Very high stakes gambling with a ton of...tension, very wild characters, expressive visuals and terrifice voice acting. However, it has some aspects that I definitely like more.For starters, the characters are way more...sane. I know that sounds weird, but if you know Kakegurui, you know what I mean. First of all, the absolute nutcases like Yumeko and Kirari aren't here yet, so that alone drops the insane-o-meter by several points. Besides that, Mary is as cerebral as any other key player, but has clear intentions and understandable goals, which makes you understand her much better and even root for her. She shows an unexpected amount of sympathy and compassion and the cast of likeable supporting characters manage to bring the best out of her. Even Sachiko, the de facto main villain of this story, is definitely cruel, but still in a reasonable and engaging way. The main Kakegurui story is like watching a car crash - it's euphoric mayhem that may end up costing lives, but it's an entrancing spectacle so you just cannot look away. Meanwhile, Twin is a more classic underdog story, the average but clever girls stepping into the lion's den and challenging the ones at the top.The moments of outsmarting also felt even more satisfying here. I can't quite put it down, but it almost felt as if the gambles were more like puzzles to be solved. They were very difficult, sure, but a solution exists if you're clever enough to find it. They felt more like intellectual challenges rather than the outlandish death games that they were portrayed as in the main series. The gambles also made sense and the stakes were high, but were also more real and had clearer consequences. It wasn't just different people flexing their wealth or their lack of concern for their own well-being or that of others, the characters gambled because they had specific goals and winning these games was necessary to achieve those goals. The crossing of these different ambitions is also a major driving force behind the conflicts in this story.Also, one more sidenote, the music in this series was the best in my opinion, in particular the opening and ending.So overall, this was a really nice surprise for me. It's really enjoyable from top to bottom and I highly recommended. Honestly, I was just bummed out that it was so short, this definitely had the potential to be a full season. Mary definitely makes for a compelling protagonist. Also, I wonder what happened to her in between this and the main story. She's surprisingly kind here but by the time we meet her again, she's become just as cruel and selfish as the others. But, I guess living with bloodthirsty sharks tends to rub off on you and your only choice to not get eaten is to become one of them... tension, very wild characters, expressive visuals and terrifice voice acting.

This review will be spoiler free, of course i will need to talk briefly about the story and characters but those will be very surface level and non-spoilery.Before...anything let\'s get the opening and ending out of the way... the opening is purely instrumental but the animations are unique for those interested in that, the ending on the other hand has a pretty good vibe at least in my opinion and animations are similar to the ones on the opening.Regarding the art and animations the show was made by MAPPA so of course they will be decent at minimum but nothing compared to there main shows like jjk or chainsaw man, this show clearly had less budget and less work put into it wich makes sense since it\'s a simple 6 episode ONA. It still has a couple of those crazy mocking faces the main show is known for but they seem to be toned down a bit (i didn\'t read the manga source so purely comparing to main show). Overall no jawdropping animation but nothing you can consider bad either.Now for the part everyone is probably reading this review the story and characters. For those who did watch the main show they will immediatly notice that Mary\'s personality is completely diferent she is basically a different character with the same name and design probably to fit better her new role as a main character in this ONA. this change in her personality is a bit hard to get accustomed to but if you don\'t constantly try and compare the two it probably won\'t be much of a problem or buzzkill, besides this her new personality as i said fits much better in her new main character role in my opinion and her character is one of the most enjoyable parts of this ONA (obviously for those who watch this ONA as a stand alone and don\'t watch the main show won\'t notice this change in Mary\'s personality so it\'s one less issue i guess). As for the other characters i will be much quicker to talk about them but here we go: Tsuzura is literally the main character of the main show but waifu version, she is a very weak gambler(in a bambling show) and is just constantly simping for Mary being basically Mary\'s personnal assistant(just like mc is to yumeko in main show); the other friend is basically a filler character i don\'t even remember her name; sado is a character with a vendetta towards Mary that simply comes off as extremely annoying; aoi is what i would consider a main antagonist in this show however we the main character doesn\'t really play against him to ""take him down"" so the show leaves an unfinished feeling on the viewer; Sakura will be one of Mary\'s adversaries in the show, basically a standard logical and rule-following character just average all around and not note worthy in my opinion; lastly Sachiko is neither a friend or fow to the main group and is more like a character that wants to watch the world burn, she is basically the character moving in the shadows and setting everything in motion from first to last episode, her character is more unique then the others in my opinion so she stands out but not a complex character by any means. The story i feel was already briefly explained in the intro to this review and throughout each character\'s brief explanation and i don\'t intend to go deep into it to not spoil it but basically as i said Mary enters this school where a person she knows from middle school is in her class, that person being Tsuzura, and she helps Mary understand the inner workings of the school, in return Mary decides to befriend Tzusura and help her improve her situation at school.While Mary is trying to gain status at the school she attracts the attention of some members of the student council (mainly Sachiko and Aoi) and the story procedeces with gambling games each episode with different adversaries. The games themselves were much more difficult for the viewer to undrstand at least in my opinion they were still very unique and out of the box just like the main show, but i feel the could\'ve been explained a bit better.Overall, many viewers seem disappointed in this ONA because they are constantly comparing to the main show wich obviously has much more story to it and feels underwhelming, however if you go to the game without expecting a masterpiece of storytelling and character depth and development then i find the show pretty enjoyable it is not an anime that incentivizes deep thought and is to be enjoyed on a surface level; if you are not an anime watcher that exclusively watches shows with deep story and character development, i can recommend this show as a small enjoyable show that can be easily watched in a single day. anything let\'s get the opening and ending out of the way... the opening is purely instrumental but the animations are unique for those interested in that, the ending on the other hand has a pretty good vibe at least in my opinion and animations are similar to the ones on the opening.Regarding the art and animations the show was made by MAPPA so of course they will be decent at minimum but nothing compared to there main shows like jjk or chainsaw man, this show clearly had less budget and less work put into it wich makes sense since it\'s a simple 6 episode ONA.

The story i feel was already briefly explained in the intro to this review and throughout each character\'s brief explanation and i don\'t intend to go deep into it to not spoil it but basically as i said Mary enters this school where a person she knows from middle school is in her class, that person being Tsuzura, and she helps Mary understand the inner workings of the school, in return Mary decides to befriend Tzusura and help her improve her situation at school.While Mary is trying to gain status at the school she attracts the attention of some members of the student council (mainly Sachiko and Aoi) and the story procedeces with gambling games each episode with different adversaries. The games themselves were much more difficult for the viewer to undrstand at least in my opinion they were still very unique and out of the box just like the main show, but i feel the could\'ve been explained a bit better.Overall, many viewers seem disappointed in this ONA because they are constantly comparing to the main show wich obviously has much more story to it and feels underwhelming, however if you go to the game without expecting a masterpiece of storytelling and character depth and development then i find the show pretty enjoyable it is not an anime that incentivizes deep thought and is to be enjoyed on a surface level; if you are not an anime watcher that exclusively watches shows with deep story and character development, i can recommend this show as a small enjoyable show that can be easily watched in a single day.', 'I was so excited to see Kakegurui twin the anime version, this was the first time watching an anime after reading the manga, I like the animation and the production, but they use a lot of green shadows.I was waiting for the 1st ep were they supposed to cover the first chapters I was waiting for Saotome first entrance to the school and her very first gamble with her classmate, but they just made it as a summary, -_- I was disappointed, I even thought I have started from ep2, not, ep1, also, why only 6ep, they could cover more from the manga -_- I...prefer waiting each week for a new ep rather than only 6ep.If I compare it with the original Kakegurui this one has less impact and less excitement :/ but I will be waiting for a second season :p prefer waiting each week for a new ep rather than only 6ep.If I compare it with the original Kakegurui this one has less impact and less excitement :/ but I will be waiting for a second season :p', ""While it is not great, and it is not downright awful. Kakegurui Twin doesn't fully live up to the expectations that the two main animes have had. It feels like a downgrade in some sort of ways, Mary is not strong enough on her own to carry a show even with some supporting characters she has that we have never seen in the two main animes. This stems from the problem, of how her role in the Kakegurui seasons one and two were that of as a supporting character. You can be a fanastic suppoting character, but if you have the lead role and you...are expected to do more it is not easy. Perception is key, and it was evident from the first two episodes,  that this show was going to be a rating of a 5.5 to a 6 for me. Then it hits you with the third and fourth episodes mainly to get it out of being stuck in first gear. Honestly, if this show was made first and had a transition phase of Mary and her character supporting crew I would have felt better about it. The show is ok, but it isn't in the form of hype that it should have been for a better overall presentation. are expected to do more it is not easy.

Alexandre desu.The PlotKakegurui Twin is a prequel for the main series and tells the story of Mary Saotome, and how she became one of the most feared players in Hyakkaou Private Academy. It depicts on how she was a transfer and didn't have any rich friend and how she uses her fast thinking to fool the other player during multiple games.The ConsThe story is abysmal. It is the same formula for every game in this anime. They explain how the game is played, and then they try to fool the viewer to think that Mary was tricked or has fallen for a cheater move,...and in the end of the game the roles reverse and Mary is a gambling mastermind. That threw me off a bit because it is not relatable, it is not organic. I understand if a player is experienced in a few games, like dice or cards but, she has the knowledge of every game and every bit of information that a new player like her shouldn't have. And then you have lesbian love because Netflix tries to be inclusive every time and a side character that is only used for Mary to win the gambling room and later for the couple's game. There is no connection between the three of them and that is barely spoked about during the episodes.The NeutralI don't think there is nothing neutral about this anime because the cons cancel the pros so it became a neutral anime.The ProsIf every anime had Mappa has a studio and the budget of Netflix, I think every anime would have this type of animation and music. It is fluid, it has motion, and the OST is appropriate for the theme.The ConclusionIf you liked the parent story, you should watch this. It is the backstory of one of the principal characters. For newcomers, I have mixed feelings because it is an introduction to the main theme of the anime that is gambling and hierarchy status, but I don't think it does enough to appeal and create curiosity to pursue the anime. and in the end of the game the roles reverse and Mary is a gambling mastermind.

I'm not about to spark a debate about who is best girl between Mary and the main show's protag, Yumeko - both are based choices. However, as Mary was always my favorite I absolutely loved seeing her in the lead. Her relationship and bond with Tsuzura is not so different from that of her later relationship with Riri in the main show. Mary serves as the outspoken protector of the shy girl to help them gain confidence. Which you might say is a overused trope, but written...well, is probably one of my favorites.This spinoff distiguinshes itself apart from the main show while also being similar in nature. You could say that only the setting and characters change, however, it still feels a lot different. And that is most likely due to Mary and Yumeko being two vastly different characters, and as such, their decisions and how they affect others around them is not similar in nature. Their only similarity being their love for gambling.In short, it's a good continuation to the show, a spinoff that both feels different but is more of what you love.Art - 10Characters - 10Narrative - 10Music and Sound - 9Finale Grade: 9 well, is probably one of my favorites.This spinoff distiguinshes itself apart from the main show while also being similar in nature.

Despite being excited that Kakegurui Twin being animated finally, I have quite a mixed feeling regarding the adaptation: overall it is okay, but it feels like at some part, the adaptation could have been better and thus been made more memorable.Comparing to the main series, the story provides a different perspective and contains gambles in which audience can hardly have chances to see in the main series, which is refreshing. For instance, both the coupling party and treasure hunt gambles have...interesting concepts and strategies, and it is entertaining to see how the participants (espcially the main trio) work out how to beat the game. You would never see Jabami Yumeko, the protagonist of the main series, get engaged in this kind of gambles. Outside of the story, the execution of animation is good with appropriate usage of CGI. The opening and ending are very memorable, in both the animation and music.Despite all these, there are still some main adaptation problems. One main problem is that the studio directly skips the first gamble, probably because it has the same nature as the first gamble (Yumeko vs Mary) in the main series, both of them featuring an over-confident bully who gets beaten by a transfer student. However, the first gamble is crucial in building up the bond between Mary and Tsuzura, the later one being the former\'s friend, showing that even if she is unfamiliar with the rules on new campus, poor and does not have good impressions on Tsuzura since she met her in primary school, she would still stand up and help her friend, encouraging her to be braver. Unfortunately, this part has been completely ignored by briefing with simple words, and Tsuzura is already calling Mary as her prince at the beginning of the anime, which feels both confusing and forced. If there were more building up between their relationship, it could feel less forced, and one of the main themes ""friendship"" could be emphasized.Building up of the atmosphere is the main problem of the adaptation, even for the gambles. As long as the main focus of Kakegurui Twin is different from the main series and it is meant to be made as a more typical Shounen friendship work with less stressing gambles, there should have been more tension in the adaptation. When I watched the anime, the scenes always reminded me of its counterpart live action adaptation, which has much more tension and the audience could really feel the threats of losing the games with the darker tone of environment as well as more exaggerating actions. In the anime, however, the tension somehow gets missed and most of the time, it feels like they are just playing a game without prices to pay. Even if they say there\'s a price after losing, the atmosphere does not feel so.And regarding inconsistence of Mary\'s personality between Twin and main series, since the Twin manga is still ongoing, we could not comment if the inconsistence is bad writing as the ending of the manga, which could change Mary\'s personality, is still unrevealed.Overall, I would still recommend Kakegurui fans watching this anime, but I feel that the live action adaptation does a better work in capturing the tension. As for non-fans, I do not think the anime is suitable as a starter to the franchise and they could watch it only when they are interested in the characters and gambles. interesting concepts and strategies, and it is entertaining to see how the participants (espcially the main trio) work out how to beat the game.

I’m not sure what other people were looking for when it came to the execution of this show, but I really enjoyed the prequel and how it gave us more insight into the world of Kakegurui. In regards to these “types” of programs I think it would benefit most people to go ahead and read the manga as opposed to watching the anime. It didn’t have as much as of the same eerie shock value that was in the first rendition we were exposed to and that might be the reason why it doesn’t score as high as expected. Our...protagonist, Mary Saotome, is still shrewd and discerning, but in this prequel you see her as more cooperative, strategic, and adorably doubtful. Something happened between the events of Twin and KKG. Something that made her lose hope, her small belief in justice and humanity, and her complete integration of herself into the system. Someone pointed out to me that in KKG she was holding the flower hair clip that her cute blue-haired friend, Tsuzura, had in Twin. So something must have happened to her between that time to make her become angry and unhinged.I have only seen the anime so I’m only making a guess here, but I remember a scene in KKG where the little lollipop loli (Runa) told Mary that if she doesn’t shape up then she’s going to receive a Life Plan. A Life Plan is when a student has taken on so much debt that the student council has to create a plan that does essentially bail you out, but you’ll be paying a grave personal price. Runa told Mary that she could be betrothed to some old, gross but insanely weather geezer that’s into little girls and could have her do all sorts of sordid things, but would absolutely wipe out her debt. The look on Mary’s face when she’s given the news is absolutely terrifying. She’s disgusted but at the same time horrified. What if Tsuzura got herself into so much debt that Mary couldn’t save her? What if Tsuzura had received that kind of fate so Runa reminding her was what made her so terrified? I have absolutely no idea so if this is truly what happens in the story, I’m sorry, my intention isn’t to spoil it for anyone.What really amazes me about this series is all the components that come together to make the games difficult and calculating. It’s not enough to just know math but it helps to know music, literature, history, science, and more. You couldn’t win a scholarship to this as a normal person like in Ouran Host Club and think you’re going to be okay. I enjoy watching the thought processes of these students and how they use their smarts and cleverness (two different things) to outwit one another. I wish I could be as crafty and witty as the young women in this show. Listening to them unveil how they win their games is like hearing how a detective solved a mystery.I encourage everyone to watch Kakegurui Twin and not to put so much pressure on it to be as “charged” as its predecessor. The mechanics of how the characters operate in Twin is because they are still operating under the status quo. Jabami’s involvement in KKG is likely more exciting because the status quo is attacked and the system is at risk of being destroyed. I’m looking forward to the second half of Twin (I wonder if they did that on purpose?) and I believe that by watching the series in chronological order instead of order of release more people can appreciate the story. protagonist, Mary Saotome, is still shrewd and discerning, but in this prequel you see her as more cooperative, strategic, and adorably doubtful.

Fortunately I found Kakegurui to be a great reintroduction to the series that reminded why I loved the franchise in the first place. The fanservice, the crazy face and the characters interactions are all great. The character are all entertaining and even though there is little backstory given to the characters, they are still great to watch. Mary Saotome does an excellent job as a main protagonist and, despite liking Yumeko Jabami, I never...found myself missing her. Another strong character was Sachiko Juraku who made for a deliciously sadistic antagonist orchestrating and manipulating affairs from behind the scenes. On the down side I do admit to finding Saotome\'s friends a bit lackluster. Amidst the entertainingly crazy bevy of rich Lesbians, like Juraku, Saotome\'s friends feel rather dull and run of the mill. They just fell flat.The story itself is a prequel to the main series ""Kakegurui"" however Kakegurui Twin never relies or overly references its parent story and so it did not feel like a series you could only enjoy if you\'d seen Kakegurui. In fact, the series even had a helpful explanation of the series premise and setting at the beginning. Kakegurui Twin is only 6 episodes and normally a series with such a low episode count would feel rushed. I never felt that  here and instead the series came across as enjoyable, to the point and not too long. As with the main series, the only major problem was that the gambles themselves, the main action of the series, are somewhat confusing. Fortunately the combination of crazy face and character interactions more than compensate.Finally, a note on the fanservice. Like its parents series, Kakegurui is somewhat fanservicey. In general, Kakegurui Twin lacks the gratuitous random nature that fanservice in most modern anime has. Instead, the fanservice fits in naturally into the story and, given the general crazyness of the story, setting  and characters, feels entirely natural.Overall, Kakegurui Twin was highly enjoyable, with a mostly good cast of characters, a fun compelling and to the point story and just as crazy as its mother series. It also feels like a good introduction to the series and very newcomer friendly. If you dislike fanservice however, this might not be a series you would like. found myself missing her.

Not quite as good as the original, I think Yumeko is a stronger character than Mary, but at least Mary isn't a clone of Yumeko. I think Kakegurui XX's games were a little too convoluted for the show's good. The fun of the show is having really simple games but then the characters unravel the complex ways their opponents rig or cheat them in order to gain an edge. Twin definitely returns to more of this original feeling and the games themselves are easy to follow.Side notes, the OP is...excellent and the English dub is pretty good. I watched half subs half dubs and while the Japanese voices are better I prefer watching the English dub.Overall I have no real complaints other than Twin is REALLY short. Worth watching! excellent and the English dub is pretty good.

Worth watching!"", 'If you want to see if you will like Kakegurui, watch kakegurui twin! It is honestly a good prequel and shows what the show will be like, but is even better. It is also shorter, so if you don\'t want to commit to double the episodes, this is a good option.Story - 6There is more of a story to this than Kakegurui. In Kakegurui, Yumeko basically just goes from person to person gambling with them. But in Twin, Mary has more of a reason to gamble, and we see her develop a bit. We see her character do things other than gamble, which is...nice to see compared to Kakegurui.The gambles themselves are also better. There is some ""cheating"", but the cheats are less annoying and still have a bit of mind games to them. I didn\'t like the last cheat Mary used, though. I did find that the coupling game ""cheat"" was a bit hard to understand at first, overall the game could have been explained better so that you understand how the cheat works. But, the cheat for the coupling game was actually smart.So, in short, the mind games are better in Twin, and there is more of a story instead of just episodic gambling.Art - 7I thought the art looked better in this season. Not as much hyper detail on the eyes, but generally more crisp art.Sound - 4I didn\'t like the opening or the ending, and the general soundtrack wasn\'t as good as the two seasons of Kakegurui, it was just okay.Characters - 6In my opinion, Mary is the best character in the whole series. She is smart, but not unrealistically able to solve everything and guess everything right like Yumeko. She also acts realistically and has a likeable personality. She is harsh, but it makes her character fun.There are two main side characters that are basically Mary\'s friends. I like them as well, they have actual personality traits and are likeable. We also see how the trio becomes friends, and a part of how they met is used in one of the gambles, showing how this isn\'t just an episodic anime,I didn\'t really like the girl who seems like she is the president and has a housepet on a leash, like what. Just more unrealistic and kind of annoying. But I did think some other side characters were good, like the two girls the trio works with for the coupling game.Overall, we don\'t have any characters who are simply unbeatable and always have a trick up their sleeve, which is refreshing. It allows for more realness and more mind games.Enjoyment - 6The anime still wasn\'t amazing. There was still some unrealistic parts, like the fact that they even have a coupling game at this school, like who is paying for this and what the heck are these rules. But it is still kinda fun to watch, especially since the characters are better.Overall - 6Not perfect by any means, but it is the best out of the entire series.

The few men that are represented in the six episodes they present them as evil.  Example 5 friends just hangout with one fat friend because of his money that is greed and sloth .  That fat friend like girls that act feminine the girls find him creepy and ugly(calling him an incell basically) they have him being some kind of pervert too that is lust and gluttony.  They bash men right up to the last scene when they show the main boy character being a...jerk to his fiancée and ""he will get his revenge"" that is envy, pride and wrath.  They gave men all the 7 sins LOL big PASS. jerk to his fiancée and ""he will get his revenge"" that is envy, pride and wrath.

You follow Mary as a starting nobody in the gamble school, and just as with Kakegurui, she (and others) try to win games or gain advantages through some kind of scheme or cheating. This is the first shave down in my opinion. I might have different impressions, and I don\'t know if it is just the source material for this prequel, but the games and the schemes are really not interesting. Sometimes they are...simple enough that the regular viewer figures it out if they think about it for a second, or the scheme/game is done at such a bullshit level that it doesn\'t even matter, the plot and story just move in favor of Mary by the power of bullshit.The second shave down are the characters. Although they use the same or similar characters from Kakegurui, Mary feels very different(as it should since she is yet to experience everything), but she is at the level of a boring average character in the anime\'s world with a little bit more braincells and desire. Supporting characters that become her friends are medicore as well. One is just simping for her all the time without much reason, the other is also an average character which has little depth. I hate to say it, but I think the character I found so annoying and over the top in Kakegurui such as Yumeko, carried that show. If the voicing is less energetic and dramatic, it doesn\'t work. They need to be full on crazy.The ""crazy"" shots are also shaved down. Where in Kakegurui you can see quite the number of dramatic close ups with sometimes glowing eyes and idiotic facial expressions, that is present in this prequel, but to a much lesser degree, and they are less dramatic. And that\'s a shame since those dramatic emotional moments went quite well with the ethically gray characters who would do anything to gain money when everything is on the line. Touching on that, that also slightly bothers me in this anime. Morals and ethics were almost nowhere to be found in Kakegurui. Yumeko was an addict that wants to satiate her lust for gambling, Mary was a bitch in it for herself most of the time, and you saw all that through the eyes of a wimpy MC. But in Kakegurui Twin, Mary has a feel of morality at times, a conscience for her friends, almost to wash her from the shit behaviour in Kakegurui. It\'s weird to see some good guys where first everyone had no moral compass, especially after you have seen regular Kakegurui. She and her one friend, maybe the other one too, for some reason have some kind of decency, but everyone else is just the worst, girls and boys, but especially the few boys in the show are just the scumbags of the earth.Is this anime for you? This anime might have one purpose, and one purpose only, and that is to please the cosplayers that overrated Kakegurui, and give them more material and characters to group cosplay as some pseudo lesbians with suggestive kinks. Otherwise, you are better of just watching Kakegurui, the Kakegurui in its full glory, rather than this shaved down version. simple enough that the regular viewer figures it out if they think about it for a second, or the scheme/game is done at such a bullshit level that it doesn\'t even matter, the plot and story just move in favor of Mary by the power of bullshit.The second shave down are the characters.

Kaijuu no Kodomo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37981/Kaijuu_no_Kodomo,"[""Breathtaking and seamless animation. I'm glad they translated Igarashi Daisuke's art to the big screen pretty well. The art and the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and I'm also a sucker for animes with the ocean/summer days/ fantasy aesthetic themes (reminded me of the anime Nagi no Asukara). Seeing it on the big screen gave me that same chest expanding feeling whenever I see amazing animation alongside moving soundtracks.Honestly, the storyline lost me a little bit but I'm not gonna say I wasn't entertained and absorbed. I would still highly recommend for the imagery. Can't wait until it is released in English to rewatch it! "", 'Let me tell you first off, tokyo movie theaters are not cheap!!! $20 for a ticket are you insane?! I\'d better be getting my money\'s worth if I\'m paying that much. Like this movie better change my life.Next I want to let you know that I\'ve never read the source, or heard of this title before watching this movie. So this review is my impression of the movie watching it blind.Story - 4SPOILER ALERTIt actually started off really great in my opinion. The premise of a boy who was raised in the wild is not something entirely new but still very interesting. And it...was going so well until somewhere halfway through the movie... UNIVERSE, COSMOS, GALAXY... Like WTF was I watching? I\'m sorry for all the people who liked this movie but it just felt totally random to me in terms of the story. I can\'t actually imagine how you make any sense of what I just watched. I feel like they literally let a 5 year old write the story and you might think I\'m joking but that\'s really how it is. Sure the animation is great but the story...Art - 10I don\'t think anyone can argue how breathtakingly amazing the art was. Watching this movie is like watching an animated version of the big book of marine life encyclopedia. Definitely watch this movie if you want to learn how to draw any fish. If nothing else, this is definitely one of the ""best animated"" movies (not to be mistaken with best ""animated movies"")Sound - 9Is the rubber band an instrument?Kaijuu no Kodomo would say: Yes, yes it is!Mysterious, eerie, a sense of wonder and excitement. Wonderfully orchestrated and beautifully directed. Who doesn\'t love this kind of music? One thing\'s for sure: they definitely spared no expense in the sound and animation budget.Character - 5The designs are really nice and unique. There\'s a lot of mystery with how the characters were introduced which I think is fine in itself. Unfortunately, the story is just so weird that it\'s hard to make sense of anything the characters are thinking, if they are thinking anything. You can\'t tell what the hell is going on and there\'s barely any explanation either.Enjoyment - 4As someone who\'s never read the source or remotely heard of the title before watching this I felt like a fish out of water (pun intended). Maybe they cut a lot of material from the source. Maybe the writing is just bad. Maybe maybe maybe... From my perspective, the story is just weird. At the very least, I enjoyed the animation.Overall - 6I would definitely recommend it, even just for the beautiful animation. But definitely not for anyone who\'s looking for any coherent story or emotional impact. was going so well until somewhere halfway through the movie... UNIVERSE, COSMOS, GALAXY...

But definitely not for anyone who\'s looking for any coherent story or emotional impact.', 'For those that are curious, this is an animated adaption from the manga with the same name, beautifully illustrated by Igarashi Daisuke. For starters, I think the film was definitely ambitious, but in honesty was all round lacking in a sense that the director could not successfully portray the clarity within the material of the original work.STORY: (7/10) Five whole volumes of plot, filled with existentialistic concepts, combining science fiction and folklore, delicate portrayals of the relationship between the characters and the panoramas of sea life- all of these are condensed into a mere 111 minutes, a little less than two hours. Nevertheless, I...applaud the teams\' effort in trying to follow the footsteps of the manga with their universal and surrealistic message; However, if you are a manga reader like me, I suggest that you don\'t keep your hopes too high that every detail would be the same. Some scenes were replaced and rewritten in order to fit in the time frame, while others, I really don\'t understand the choices for such replacements. I also felt that some of the more important and emotional parts were cut out as well, which really takes away the overall tone and message of the manga. (eg, Sora and Umi\'s backstory with Jim and Anglade, which would have provided a LOT more insight towards their relationship with one another, as well as the plot of the story).Kaijuu no Kodomo is a free form of expression, but Ayumu Watanabe doesn\'t seem to be able to grasp onto what is needed in order for the film to have become successful. Overall a promising story which was probably a little too much for the anime to handle and thus gradually lost it\'s original purpose towards the end.ART: (8/10) The character designs stayed true to Igarashi\'s indie, sketchy style, which I was very delighted to see. Precisions and details elaborating on the eyes of the characters give more emotional depths to our understanding of their roles within the narrative. I could also say the same to the way the ocean and the marine life had been beautifully animated, especially during the ""festival"" and Umi\'s ""birth"". Movements are smooth, possessing the sentiments of Igarashi\'s funkiness. The only slight nitpick I had was that ocean in the film makes everything seem all too welcoming and friendly, instead of haunting and dangerous as it were in the manga. Nevertheless, the animation is definitely something worth praising, and it\'s rare to see water, and movement in the water being drawn so well.MUSIC: (10/10) It\'s Joe Hisaishi, nothing can go wrong when it\'s him. He perfectly captured the vibes of the work.CHARACTERS: (6.5/10) That being said, major characters such as Jim, Anglade (ESPECIALLY ANGLADE!) and Dede were robbed of their spotlights in the film due to the limited time. They had their defining roles, but were reduced to such labels- Jim was a scientist who merely looked after Sora and Umi, Anglade cooked dinner and did some chores, and spouted some universal nonsense under the starlights, and Dede? She repeated the same 5 lines throughout the film, then drove away on a boat without contributing much to the plot. I was especially disappointed to see that they have taken away so much of Anglade\'s charm, since he was one of the most important and intriguing characters of the story. Like Sora and Umi, he was an outsider, he was intelligent, sophisticated and complicated- yet they have made him into a pretty insignificant person in the film.Likewise, Ruka\'s mother also did not get her backstory, which I felt would have helped a lot with explaining Ruka\'s natural attraction towards the water. I don\'t understand the reason for having Ruka\'s father replace Dede in the final scene when they went to rescue Ruka too. Perhaps this film focused a lot more on Ruka and her estrangement with her friends and family- but I guess I quite liked the idea of her reconciling with the girl she knocked over in the beginning, which is anime exclusive. It somehow added another kind of sentiment and changed the narrative (in a good way), as if to relay the message that life moves on. With the people Ruka met during summer gone, it\'s like she was being welcomed back to her ordinary life (which in this case, you may argue that it takes away her eccentrics and the fact that she doesn\'t get along with ""normal"" people in the manga).I had no major problems with the three protagonists, but somehow felt that they were all lacking the charm they had in the manga- the film took all their most obvious traits (Umi and his naivety, Sora and his otherworldliness, Ruka and her curiosity) and made them kind of one dimensional. Ruka in particular became more taciturn in some major scenes, instead of being her usual curious self regarding the two boys who, in the film, were a lot less preoccupied with one another.ENJOYMENT: (7 or 8/10) Again, this was a promising film considering that the manga was particularly a masterpiece. It\'s ambitious, it\'s creative, it could have created something new for the audience- but the choice of director has allowed it to lose its colour throughout the film. It\'s not as philosophical or complicated as the original material, but nevertheless attempts to recreate the same message and philosophy in a very condensed animated version. However, I overall thought it was still quite enjoyable. For those that may find the film confusing or constantly feel like it\'s missing something, I really suggest that you read the manga first, as it will help you understand a lot of aspects and ideas they don\'t mention and explain in the film. The characters in the manga are portrayed with such raw emotions, and Igarashi miraculously writes their relationship with one another through such vertiginous depths that you can\'t help but love every single one of their quirks.I do suggest the film to those that may be interested, but only if you decide to read the manga as well. Trust me, you won\'t regret it! applaud the teams\' effort in trying to follow the footsteps of the manga with their universal and surrealistic message; However, if you are a manga reader like me, I suggest that you don\'t keep your hopes too high that every detail would be the same.

""Duuuuuuuuuuuuuude the seas and the stars are one... We\'re all, like, totally connected.""  Without any hint of self-awareness, prattling on about romantic-sounding yet entirely vacuous germs of ideas about ""listening to the song on the winds,"" ""we\'re all made of the same matter... whoaaaaaa..."" and other such flowery, inconsequential drivel.  The characters and plot are superficially there to laboriously drone on about shallow musings on life and the universe.  What little there is in terms of...narrative in the first half entirely falls away for a second half of self-indulgent spectacle, pretty to look at but utterly devoid of any substance, yet completely oblivious to how pompous it is.I really can\'t stress how cartoonishly self-aggrandizing this is.  Don\'t bother watching it if you at all intend to pay attention.  There are nice visual sequences in here but it\'s only surface-deep.  This would be completely boring and unremarkable if it weren\'t for how outrageously pretentious it is. narrative in the first half entirely falls away for a second half of self-indulgent spectacle, pretty to look at but utterly devoid of any substance, yet completely oblivious to how pompous it is.I really can\'t stress how cartoonishly self-aggrandizing this is.

I\'d honestly like to get to know more about her relationship with Ruka.Second of all, why were the Americans even remotely relevant? Other than the scene of that old man deleting a 1GB hard-disk of whale ASMR -- in efforts to prevent the USA from stealing Japan\'s technology (ugh cliches) -- the USA never seemed to...have any impact on the prized possession that they so much value, SUPPOSEDLY.Third of all, the theme of ""chasing the secrets of the world"" makes this story extremely incomprehensible. I honestly wish for anyone who does this with their lives to1. Please define what you want to do and think about your consequences, like ""I\'m going to swimming and in order to not drown, I need nozzles sticking outside the water"". Don\'t burn down the whitehouse just because you want to. It\'ll get you into a horrible mess like Ruka\'s. Look what happened to her! She got pregnant with a sea child and was left drowning in the middle of the Ocean.2. Start working on things in life that you take for granted, like money, food, music, or the incredible computational power of your eyes. It\'s more fun to do things that will help you grow rather than chasing things that don\'t cultivate yourself, unless if you want to get good at long-distance running.Yes, going with the flow to find unknown wonders is awesome, but don\'t turn a blind eye to reality because of it. I know all stories are supposed to recharge you from reality, but they do not have to right to strip it away from you. You still gotta do you.(P.S. I honestly wish there were more animes like ""Samurai Champloo"" or ""Cowboy Bebop"").Art: 7The most beautiful part of all the characters is clearly their skin and 3D movement, which were designed similarly to that of Hanabi (2017), but I was also very intrigued to see layers incorporated into the animation.I\'m not sure what it was called, but I remember Hayao Miyazaki once used to animate oceans by using this machine that placed waves in layers and moved them around. This anime seemed to create a similar effect, and it looked very nice.I didn\'t really enjoy will-o-wisps tampering with my visuals, but apart from my opinion, I can\'t say too many bad things about the art here. It would\'ve certainly got a 9/10 if the overall quality of the movie was better.Sound: 5I\'m surprised Joe Hisaishi scored this anime. I didn\'t feel like his tracks stood out as much in this anime as his other masterpieces.Character: 2The premise of this entire anime was about love and friendship.** Very Minor Spoilers Below **So where on earth were the loving adults at? Why are they NEVER TAKING ACTION TO HELP THEIR KIDS? Like Mr.Maasaki, you daughter Ruka is running around like Mary Poppins in a typhoon and all you say is ""Oh? She\'ll find her way back"" and let her hitchhike on a petroleum truck?And also, why, just WHY SORA, would you feed Ruka ""the world"" without her permission. You just gave the entire world, and you expect her to carry it like Atlas? How irresponsible! Look, if you want a girl to be happy and see the world, you don\'t literally give her a seed that can destroy her. You take her out to coffee! God...Otherwise, the characters were all pretty boring. Umi and Sora acted just like kids, despite having sad backstories (I think people who are like this are trapped in their own depression and never grow. I come from an island, so I see a lot of people like this). Ruka was promising at first (she reminded me of ""Hamburger Spike""), but ""chasing secrets of the world"" really took away her personality, and everyone else\'s too, tbh.

THIS REVIEW IS NOT SPOILER FREE!!!!!!!Not gonna lie I originally posted this review/report in a twitter thread but it\'s so detailed it deserves to be a review here. Due to this though, it\'s not in the standard review form.Report: Children of the Sea (film)Aaaaaaa I loved the film so so much (non manga reader)...Overall it was a very solid movie (cont. SPOILERS)Disclaimer: this is all opinion!!! You can disagree!!! You can agree!!!StorylineThe story was easy enough to follow but I could tell they\'d removed a number of other plotlines in order to fit the main story into a short 110 minutes. The biggest example being the hinted abuse, exploitation and mistreated of Umi and Sora by the oceanographers. This missing plotline then tied in with the science of the boys\' deteriorating physical condition, Joe\'s actions and disappearance towards the end of the film, and  Anglade\'s relation to the happenings of the film, leaving many questions unresolved. The history of the ""festival"" is also left unsaid, adding more questions. Despite this, the movie still flows well and all of the things mentioned above come from my own observatory inclinations. Much is left out, but not enough to spoil the film for a non manga reader (me). The main story doesn\'t give quite enough information to become invested in the characters, namely the 3 leads. Sora and Umi (esp Sora) are gone almost as soon as they appear with how the film was paced. (Personal statement but Sora is a little shit and I love him for it).AnimationAnimation was above average but obviously not UBW level. The art (which is adapted well from page to screen) was the real breadwinner for this film. I will note, though, that the use of CG was done very nicely. CG is looking like the next big step in anime and this film is definitely a shuffle forward. That being said it could be thanks to the art and its compatibility to the medium.ArtIt must be said that the artwork and style of the film is absolutely breathtaking. The last 30 minutes of the film showcase some of the most gorgeous, detailed art I\'ve ever seen in the medium, and I\'d dare say that Children of the Sea challenged Itou Junji\'s oceanic masterpiece Gyo more than a few times, namely the deep sea shark that is showcased.Music (OST by Joe Hisaishi)Hisaishi composed for greats like Spirited Away, Laputa, other Ghibli classics and This Corner Of The World (drama). Unfortunately, his composition for Children of the Sea failed to capture me like it had countless times before. This was probably due to lack of ""That One Track"", that one work in the OST that manages to stick with you even after you\'ve left the theatre. The reason for this track not existing within the Children fo the Sea soundtrack is due to Kenshi Yonezu\'s Umi no Yuurei. Despite this, the soundtrack still serves its purpose, and quite well at that. Subtle changes in tone between land and ocean  made all the difference, and really added weight to the characters\' movements depending on the setting at the time and scenes where the two tones met were truly majestic.Theme songThe theme song of Children of the Sea is Umi no Yuurei (ghost of the sea) by Kenshi Yonezu, a song I\'ve been raving about since its release before the film. You can tell Yonezu put a lot of love into the song, and its relation to Children of the Sea is undeniable with the lyrics seeming to be the words of Ruka for Umi and Sora whom she\'ll never ""see"" again, yet is forever tied to.It\'s so hard for me to not go crazy analysing Umi no Yuurei as there\'s so much I could talk about, but in the end I feel the best way to understand my overflowing emotions towards this song even before watching the film is to listen to it yourself. The one comment I will make it that Thank God Children of the Sea was able to live up to Yonezu\'s song, I was quite worried after DAOKO and Yonezu sung the theme for Fireworks (not full title), which ended up as a flop of a film, but I\'m glad he wrote for such a good film.Final scoreIf I had to give Children of the Sea a score out of 10, I, personally, would give it a 9/10 as it hit all my good spots but generally give it a 7.5/10 as it\'s heavily philosophical and symbolic, which I know peeves quite a few people. Overall it was a very solid movie (cont. SPOILERS)Disclaimer: this is all opinion!!! You can disagree!!! You can agree!!!StorylineThe story was easy enough to follow but I could tell they\'d removed a number of other plotlines in order to fit the main story into a short 110 minutes. The biggest example being the hinted abuse, exploitation and mistreated of Umi and Sora by the oceanographers. This missing plotline then tied in with the science of the boys\' deteriorating physical condition, Joe\'s actions and disappearance towards the end of the film, and  Anglade\'s relation to the happenings of the film, leaving many questions unresolved. The history of the ""festival"" is also left unsaid, adding more questions. Despite this, the movie still flows well and all of the things mentioned above come from my own observatory inclinations. Much is left out, but not enough to spoil the film for a non manga reader (me). The main story doesn\'t give quite enough information to become invested in the characters, namely the 3 leads. Sora and Umi (esp Sora) are gone almost as soon as they appear with how the film was paced. (Personal statement but Sora is a little shit and I love him for it).AnimationAnimation was above average but obviously not UBW level. The art (which is adapted well from page to screen) was the real breadwinner for this film. I will note, though, that the use of CG was done very nicely. CG is looking like the next big step in anime and this film is definitely a shuffle forward. That being said it could be thanks to the art and its compatibility to the medium.ArtIt must be said that the artwork and style of the film is absolutely breathtaking.

Their movies often have a creative art style with realistic character designs and a light cold tone of color choices. Therefore, it's always a treat watching their works. But sadly, I can't say that the stories they offered are just as inspiring. And unfortunately, Kaijuu no Kodomo or Children of the Sea, as beautiful as it may look, is not an exception.Normally, this will be the part where I'm spoiling the story a little bit to help guiding the viewer into the anime. But this time, the story is just too incomprehensible...or quite frankly, a mess. And I really think that it's better for you to find out yourselves.For the length of a movie, the cast is reasonably rounded and works quite well. We got introduced to the 3 main lead and some minor side characters that doesn't leave much of an impression. But what I want to talk about is their dialogues, they always sound so vague and as invalid as possible. I figured that maybe the director wanted to remain the mystery to the end but even then, there's really no answer, no explanations of any kind and that really hangs me over the middle.As mentioned above, Kaijuu no Kodomo has one of the best animation I've ever seen. As comparable as Ufotable, Kyoani or Ghibli's works. Everything looks so fluid and beautifully detailed. Especially the characters' eyes and the scenery of the sea, they looks so lively but still remain the uniqueness of animated story. The music is also very reminiscent and bring a lots contribution in the overall tender and mysterious tone of the anime.Imo, no matter how great the animation can be, if its story fails to make the same impact, it's just such a shame because pieces of animation that's as beautiful as Children of the Sea is so rare to find nowadays.

You won't find a gripping plot or compelling characters in it; in fact, they are actually rather simple and barely worth a mention. You will never find yourself gripping the edge of your seat in anxiety or screaming in elation. Because this isn't really a film - it's a mission statement told through an audiovisual medium.The director, Ayumu Watanabe, and the author Daisuke Igarashi, have managed to express the vastness of our universe and the infinite potential it holds. They show us how they see the world: how we humans are but cells in an infinite...cosmic being, our roles as stewards of that universe rather than researchers who seek to split it apart down to the last atom; how to live is to communicate and how communication is how we are seen; the sanctity of creation; the beauty and wondrousness of the ocean and by extension outer space. And it culminates in one of the greatest, trippiest pieces of animation I have ever seen.This film will require a certain state of mind to full appreciate. It is heavy on the themes and symbolism and artistry, and light on everything else that makes a story compelling.

First off it\'s clear that the animation and artstyle is both beautiful and thoughtfully executed. However, the difficulty in reviewing Kailua no Kodomo mainly comes from its story. Here\'s a more precise explanation:Animation (8): A beautiful mix of 3D elements that don\'t feel too out of place and a well thought out charadesign makes this movie one of the prettiest ones to hit theatres the year of its release.Story (4): This is where it\'s really hard to have a concise opinion, at first I felt like maybe I didn\'t understand the thought process behind a lot of the...final 1/4 of the movie, with all of the classic maternal representation and space-related metaphors we get nowadays from Shinkai movies. But just like Shinkai\'s Kimi no nawa, this feels like a shoe-horned pseudo-deep storyline made the story seem deeper than it truly is, with convoluted forced metaphors that could dupe some into thinking Kailua no Kodomo is a deep philosophical statement. Similarly, after rewatching it another time, it became evident that a lot of the character introductions were non-sensical -- what happened to that handball girl ? Was it all just to show that the main character does not allow injustice to prevail ? How about Sora forcing the universe into Ruka ? How can this be justified ? This entire thing feels like pandering to the general public\'s lack of sensitivity when it comes to ""artsy anime movies"".Characters (4): No character\'s roles are ever explained, Anglade is such an ambiguous character whose role I wish was more explicited, similarly Dede and Jim just spit out some pseudo-deep crap about the universe in a supposedly mysterious tone. The rest of the supporting cast are forgettable at best which is a shame and the main characters aren\'t developped enough for anyone to identify themselves to them.Overall: Form over substance, pseudo-philosophy yet beautiful animation makes this the probable source for the next Instagram edits for beautiful anime, other than that if you\'re interested in a convincing story you can probably skip this one. final 1/4 of the movie, with all of the classic maternal representation and space-related metaphors we get nowadays from Shinkai movies.

Even for the people who do not really watch anime, I\'m still going to recommend watching this movie. Because for me, this is a masterpiece, with overall 10/10. The review might contain a personal interpretation of this movie, so I would like to apologize or you may correct me if I don\'t correctly interpret this movie, especially the message contains within it.[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER!]STORY 10/10: Firstly, there are a lot...of beautiful messages that this movie has delivered and it is being packaged in such a beautiful and poetic manner. For me, there is no scene that has gone to waste, every movement, action, and conversation is the way of the author to build-up the story. I realize when there is an actual connection with the first scene and the very last scene; the conversation between Ruko, Umi, Sora, and Anglade, which discusses the universe, and conversation with other scenes that lead up to something: the connection between human and the universe; that we are bigger than we think because we are connected to the universe. The story of this movie reminds me of Neil deGrasse Tyson\'s interview, which he stated: ""... It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe.  We are in the universe and the universe is in us.” It is superb. Indeed, one might argue there are some plot holes, but I believe the author considers to not include several scenes because it will–somehow–distract the point of the story.ART/ANIMATION 10/10: There is no doubt the animation and the art because it really helps the movie to convey the message of this movie. Every movement and action are well-portrayed in this movie. Can you even imagine a scene where the mc putting a can in a plastic bag and grabbing a pile of sand is animated in a very detailed manner and flawless? Even to the extent of reflection of water, movement of the school of fishes, the combination of colors, and other things that you can visibly see. I literally cannot see any weakness in anything related to the art and the animation, because it is so flawless and close to perfection. Truly one of a kind.CHARACTERS 10/10: Third, the characters, I personally believe the characters have their own important role to deliver the messages within the movie. Even without knowing that Umi and Sora were actually ""abused"" it needs not to show that they are abused, but there some scenes that have indicated that they have been ""abused"" by some people in the movie, in my perspective; for instance, then why they are so far away with the crowd and why they do not really mingle along with the people? Even if, one might say that there are some characters that supposed to have more role, but I think the author has the great control of the character development and try to make everything in control and not disrupting the characters to deliver the story from the very first start. Understanding this movie is not like reading academic books, it is like reading philosophical books like Nietzche that are very abstract or like reading a poem that is very thought-provoking and multi-interpretative. It is actually very difficult to deliver the story when there are a lot of various characters with different directions of developments for us to pay attention to, but the author pulled this off by picking which characters\' role that need to be emphasized in the movie so the message is well-delivered. That is why the characters in this movie are the best because their roles have successfully delivered the message as aforementioned.SOUND 10/10: No doubt with the sound, it is perfection. The sounds definitely help the movie to show which scenes that are intense and which one is not. I don\'t have much to say and clarify the sound because it is all perfect as a package.ENJOYMENT 10/10: I watched this in 2020 and I think this is the best anime that I have watched in the past years. I really love thought-provoking animes/movies such as ""Waking life (Non-anime)"" and ""Serial Experiments Lain"". So I think it is very interesting to watch Kaijuu no Kodomo and definitely will come back to watch it again!OVERALL 10/10: Definitely an anime that I will watch it again and again because it really satisfies your eyes, ear, and heart. It needs not to bring you tears but this is still the true definition of perfection in my honest opinion. I totally recommend everyone to watch this movie, and thus, you may share your own opinion and interpretation of this movie! of beautiful messages that this movie has delivered and it is being packaged in such a beautiful and poetic manner.

I\'ve read several reviews where people expressed disappointment with the storyline, but for me, it was captivating. The themes explored in the movie, like the parallels with birth and the poetic notion of us being part of the vast universe, were both romantic and inspiring.Regarding the characters, I did feel a tinge of longing for more depth in the side characters. However, this might be an intentional reflection of the transient nature of childhood and adolescence – friends coming and going, parents grappling with their children\'s emotional landscapes. It\'s a...thought-provoking perspective.Watching this movie was like experiencing the sea itself. At times, I felt a peaceful calmness, and at others, I was caught in a whirlwind of chaos and thunderstorms. This film isn\'t just a visual experience; it\'s an emotional journey.I would wholeheartedly recommend ""Kaijuu no Kodomo,"" but with a gentle note that it\'s best suited for those who are open to its unique storytelling and profound ideas.

The raw, complex lineart gives the depictions a real sense of texture, and the shear density of the aquatic wildlife in the frame is impressive. Much of that wildlife is rendered using CG, but it is generally integrated pretty well enough so that way that the high fidelity of the CG art contrasts with the more impressionistic traditional art reads as an artistic flourish. However, integration of CG is much...less successful during the myriad of cuts with extremely dynamic cameras moving through highly detailed 3d environments.The storytelling is pleasingly sedate, if extremely unfocused. I liked the relationship between the three lead children - the burgeoning friendship between the female lead and the younger brother and the significantly more antagonistic relationship between the female lead and the older brother.However, this story is frequently sidelined as characters that are barely introduced murmur about a ""festival"" (the aesthetic vagueness of their exposition does not make it any less clunky). They then wax lyrical about how the expansiveness of the universe relates to the interior of mankind or something, which is preposterous and burns time that could be better spent developing the characters and conflict. The fixation on pretty sounding nonsense also comes at the expense of following through on the existing plot elements (Why were the children rescued off screen? What happened to the pointless science team subplot?) which frustrates the film\'s own efforts to establish a sense of grounded magical realism.This culminates in a deeply surreal climax.

Joe Hisaishi’s atmospheric music. Acid-trip cinematography. Sublime art. A surreal plot that will bend your mind to the ends of the universe, but then back again to return perfectly to its origin, where everything settles beautifully.This will be a full interpretation of every plot-relevant event. Please use this review as a guide for your own thoughts, rather than a concrete explanation.Initially, Ruka is a young girl stranded on an island with the entire Pacific sprawling before her, stranded by her frustrations of growing up and communicating with others.She struggles with communicating her feelings...and understanding her own wants. She balls up in anticipation for a long, uneventful summer vacation.Soon after, in her father’s aquarium, Ruka meets Umi, a carefree spirit dancing in his own world. He tells her that “things that shine will always be found,” and Ruka is swept up by her fascination and the beauty of the will-o’-wisps, meteors falling from the sky. She clutches to Umi’s hand as he leads her onward, noticing his incredible warmth.Umi is a metaphorical representation of Ruka’s connection to others, her own tie to humanity. A physical expression of her desire.Umi takes her to meet Sora, his brother. We find out that he is sick, and will soon die. The three of them board the aquarium’s boat on a reckless journey out into the open sea, fueled by Ruka’s aversion to seeing her alcoholic mother, apologizing to the handball team, and frustration with herself.Sora is a metaphorical representation of Ruka’s appetition, her curiosity for the unknown.When Umi takes Ruka’s hands, she feels warmth and fulfilment. When Sora takes Ruka’s hands, he is pulling her into the unforgiving ocean water.The sea is omnipresent throughout the movie. The sea, space and the universe are representations of Ruka’s thalassophobic helplessness in a vast and unknowable world.After a storm, Sora gets lost and Ruka rides with Umi on a truck to a secluded area where she meets Anglade. Anglade is a marine biologist who isolates himself from society to understand the world around him.Anglade asserts that the sea and the space are one and the same, that we are made out of the same substance, and we are connected to people across worlds. There is an inexplicable vastness in the universe; 90% of it is made of dark matter that we can never observe. Yet, Anglade seems to suggest that we should be content in merely experiencing the wonder of creation. Nothing more.In a beautiful coalescence of colour, Ruka, Umi and Sora wade through the seawater. Blue plankton light up the world and warmly envelop the trio.Ruka wakes up in the middle of the night to a feverish Umi. She is surprised by Sora in the darkness, who leads her to the shore.Sora, before he disappears in a streak of light, kisses Ruka and forces her to swallow a meteor.The meteor is representative of Ruka’s appetition for the unknown.For an unknown number of years, Anglade and Jim have attempted to collect data to understand when the “festival” will happen, which will mark the end of the boys’ lifespans. After failing to “save” Sora, Jim deletes his research data and announces that his goals have changed: rather than to prolong the lifespans of Umi and Sora, he now strives to protect them from the interference of arrogant people. Self righteous adults have no place in imposing biases on a child’s self reckoning.Ruka, drunken and confused with the meteor inside her, rides out to sea with grandma Dede and Umi, where the former gives a speech about how we can never fully perceive things around us. We can only catch fragments of memories in the wind, as if we were sails. Through these fragments, we come to understand ourselves and the world we live in.Ruka dives into the water, driven by her appetition and curiosity. She is swallowed by colossal beings, constantly reminding us of our insignificance in the presence of the sea, and space. She meets Sora again inside a chamber, who tells her that her job is complete. She begins to ascend through space and the universe and the camera pans out to show galaxies, DNA, primitive life forms, and seemingly the fabric of the universe itself.Ruka, now a being made of stars, meets a fully material Umi, who drives himself through a shield of flames surrounding her, and grabs the meteor fragment burning in her chest.Ruka fights Umi for this fragment, as if to say “Umi, this drive is dangerous, you cannot have it.” Umi and Ruka somersault over each other for the possession of this meteor. In this process, Ruka comes to the realization that she must return to humanity, and this meteor will not allow her to do so. When Umi turns into an infant, in an act of her own volition, Ruka gives this meteor piece to Umi. This action represents her maturity; a willful choice to return to reality, now that her appetition has been sated, her job complete. It is her desire for human connection that brings her to chase Umi’s warmth. The two fall into the sea, and Umi begins to disappear.Ruka fights to hold onto fragments of Umi as his body loses materiality. She screams out “Umi, please stay with me,” grasping for his perfect personification of the warmth of love and connection. As the final piece of Umi bursts into a tiny fragment of the universe far away, Ruka, with tears in her eyes, is met with familiar voices: her parents. What is shining will always be found.She is pulled out of the sea by her desperately worried folks.In a conversation with Dede, Ruka tearily asks why she was chosen for this, and remarks that she wishes to see the boys again. Dede, empathetically tells her that she has experienced a beautiful boy by the sea as well. Dede explains that the journey to maturity is a path that all humans trek at some point in their life. “The most important things cannot be conveyed with words.” Ruka, having received solidarity from Dede, and a newfound trust in herself, runs forward into her life with a newfound spring in her step.Some time in the future, Ruka sloshes through crystalline waves on a golden beach. Under the gaze of the clouds, she is content to kiss the beauty of the everyday. Perhaps longing for days past, she looks toward the horizon where the blues are blurred and recalls an unforgettable time with those who changed her life. and understanding her own wants.

The three of them board the aquarium’s boat on a reckless journey out into the open sea, fueled by Ruka’s aversion to seeing her alcoholic mother, apologizing to the handball team, and frustration with herself.Sora is a metaphorical representation of Ruka’s appetition, her curiosity for the unknown.When Umi takes Ruka’s hands, she feels warmth and fulfilment. When Sora takes Ruka’s hands, he is pulling her into the unforgiving ocean water.The sea is omnipresent throughout the movie. The sea, space and the universe are representations of Ruka’s thalassophobic helplessness in a vast and unknowable world.After a storm, Sora gets lost and Ruka rides with Umi on a truck to a secluded area where she meets Anglade. Anglade is a marine biologist who isolates himself from society to understand the world around him.Anglade asserts that the sea and the space are one and the same, that we are made out of the same substance, and we are connected to people across worlds. There is an inexplicable vastness in the universe; 90% of it is made of dark matter that we can never observe. Yet, Anglade seems to suggest that we should be content in merely experiencing the wonder of creation. Nothing more.In a beautiful coalescence of colour, Ruka, Umi and Sora wade through the seawater. Blue plankton light up the world and warmly envelop the trio.Ruka wakes up in the middle of the night to a feverish Umi. She is surprised by Sora in the darkness, who leads her to the shore.Sora, before he disappears in a streak of light, kisses Ruka and forces her to swallow a meteor.The meteor is representative of Ruka’s appetition for the unknown.For an unknown number of years, Anglade and Jim have attempted to collect data to understand when the “festival” will happen, which will mark the end of the boys’ lifespans. After failing to “save” Sora, Jim deletes his research data and announces that his goals have changed: rather than to prolong the lifespans of Umi and Sora, he now strives to protect them from the interference of arrogant people. Self righteous adults have no place in imposing biases on a child’s self reckoning.Ruka, drunken and confused with the meteor inside her, rides out to sea with grandma Dede and Umi, where the former gives a speech about how we can never fully perceive things around us. We can only catch fragments of memories in the wind, as if we were sails. Through these fragments, we come to understand ourselves and the world we live in.Ruka dives into the water, driven by her appetition and curiosity. She is swallowed by colossal beings, constantly reminding us of our insignificance in the presence of the sea, and space. She meets Sora again inside a chamber, who tells her that her job is complete. She begins to ascend through space and the universe and the camera pans out to show galaxies, DNA, primitive life forms, and seemingly the fabric of the universe itself.Ruka, now a being made of stars, meets a fully material Umi, who drives himself through a shield of flames surrounding her, and grabs the meteor fragment burning in her chest.Ruka fights Umi for this fragment, as if to say “Umi, this drive is dangerous, you cannot have it.” Umi and Ruka somersault over each other for the possession of this meteor. In this process, Ruka comes to the realization that she must return to humanity, and this meteor will not allow her to do so. When Umi turns into an infant, in an act of her own volition, Ruka gives this meteor piece to Umi. This action represents her maturity; a willful choice to return to reality, now that her appetition has been sated, her job complete. It is her desire for human connection that brings her to chase Umi’s warmth. The two fall into the sea, and Umi begins to disappear.Ruka fights to hold onto fragments of Umi as his body loses materiality. She screams out “Umi, please stay with me,” grasping for his perfect personification of the warmth of love and connection. As the final piece of Umi bursts into a tiny fragment of the universe far away, Ruka, with tears in her eyes, is met with familiar voices: her parents. What is shining will always be found.She is pulled out of the sea by her desperately worried folks.In a conversation with Dede, Ruka tearily asks why she was chosen for this, and remarks that she wishes to see the boys again. Dede, empathetically tells her that she has experienced a beautiful boy by the sea as well. Dede explains that the journey to maturity is a path that all humans trek at some point in their life. “The most important things cannot be conveyed with words.” Ruka, having received solidarity from Dede, and a newfound trust in herself, runs forward into her life with a newfound spring in her step.Some time in the future, Ruka sloshes through crystalline waves on a golden beach. Under the gaze of the clouds, she is content to kiss the beauty of the everyday. Perhaps longing for days past, she looks toward the horizon where the blues are blurred and recalls an unforgettable time with those who changed her life.', ""this is my first review so sorry if there's a mistake.POSSIBLY LITTLE SPOILERArt-10In my opinion this movie has an art of indulging eyes throughout the scene presented with a details view on the beach and ocean as well as subtle movements in animatio so, no complaints in this art style.Music-10as well as the music that accompanies the story during a sea diving scene or when a character experiences something magical in this story, a background sound that really matches all scenes. I give a 10/10 score on music....Voice acting-8 (I hate the father, lol)while for voice acting there are no problems. All actors match the characters being played. except for one, the main character's father who will later be explained below.Character-7 (Is because side characters)all three protagonists have different personalities who are friends. The main character is said to have mischievous behavior that often acts at will and also she hates her mother, for some reason is not told why she hates her mother in the movie, even so throughout the story, we will see the development of this girl who will change throughout the story. While the other two protagonists are cheerful children who accompany the main character. This movie taught me about what friendship is and why it is valuable. That's what makes me like these three characters, because they help each other and get through the fun and sadness together. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about the main character's father who was very bland, he didn't have the characteristics in this story as well his voice acting, for example when his daughter wanted to go to the beach during a storm he was the only one who didn't panic while the mother  who does not look useful is only showed her feelings, unfortunately, this father  has an empty role until the end of the movie, applause for the mother.while for supporting characters such as the teenager and weird grandmother, their origins are not conveyed and why they are involved in the story so for supporting characters is very worse. While some other institutions in the story that might look like a bad guys are also not told what they are planning.Story-2the story in this movie is very ordinary and even confusing, in the beginning to the middle I enjoyed the story, until the end of the story will be a common thing for most anime in general. I can not tell because of spoilers. Honestly, maybe the story in this film is too hasty so it does not explain the details of what happened.Conclusionmaybe the art and ost in this movie is great but the story is meh.This anime is suitable for you who are :People who only care about unique art style, hachi's fans, People who are bored during pandemic and have free time.This anime is NOT suitable for you who are :People who care about the storyline, those who hate lazy storylines.

The most important promise isn\'t made with words"".I really enjoyed this movie, both visually and story-wise, so in short, do I recommend Children of the Sea aka Kaijuu no Kodomo? YES.It was a new adventure in a new style, I think. It was one of the best 3D movies I\'ve ever seen on the animation level. The animation was on point though in some scenes you can notice the CGI easily. Where in most of the movie I thought it was a Hand-drawing style. And it turned out to be that the producers...used mixed Hand-drawing and CGI styles in this movie, which is the style most known in Disney movies.I can see the effort they made in making this movie present a wonderful work with very detailed cinematography.Great work drawing characters and designing them and showing the facial expressions. Face zooms are the thing I enjoyed most.Drawing plants was perfect and realistic, animals though were drawn in a less realistic way.In the beginning, I thought it was a teen romance film but it was much more than that. The movie is weirder than you think.I highly recommend being open-minded about what you\'ll see in the second half of the movie, the movie took a really strange deep turn after chapter 11. It became more mythologic, more like spirited away. It\'s not something that is outrageous or unwatchable, On the contrary, it was beautiful and breathtaking, and the animation was smooth and seamless the whole movie but comparing the first part of the movie with the second part, it was a big turn-around.Note: there is a post-credit scene.[SPOILERS] !!!!!!!I had one problem with this movie, just one; the movie gave me an open ending and left me with so many unanswered questions. For example:- Who are Umi and Sora? What\'s their Origin? Are they actual brothers? Are they even humans?- We didn\'t get an explanation of why Umi and Sora are in danger of extinction and why they were dying.- Why was Ruka the chosen one to succeed Sora in holding the meteorite? Why did Sora have to sacrifice himself?- And what is this meteorite thing that has the size of a small rock but the power of a universe?Ratings:Plot: 7/10. Nice storyline but didn\'t understand the ending, and the synopsis doesn\'t really describe the movie perfectly.Characters: 8/10. Characters were well-written, not just the main 3 kids but also minor characters like Anglade, Jim, and Dede.Music: 7/10. Good music and sound scoring but what I liked most was the lullaby sung by Ruka at the end.""Go to sleep little one, little fish born in the sea, it\'s bedtime for you too, drink your milk and grow, and plant your feet firmly, one day, you\'ll reach the heavens and hunt for stars, stars that are captured will drop into the ocean"".Animation and Art-style: 9.5/10. The best thing in this movie, Hands down. You will be visually amazed watching this work for sure.Enjoyment: 9/10. I can calmly say that it\'s a very good movie, and I Assure you that you will be flabbergasted while watching it.Overall: 8/10.

This is a short review of the movie I watched, and here are the ratings:STORY: 5/10The story was decent the first hour, but after that, a lot of weird things started happening, and I still can not figure out what they were trying to tell. If you were to ask me about what the plot was then for the first hour I would say: ""Whale is having a party and is inviting people, including some special kids."" while for the other hour of the movie, I can honestly only say: ""Ruka is all over the place while yelling ""Umi-kun!"" every 5...minutes or so.ART: 11/10The art and animation style of this movie is so different from your normal animes. Everything looks stunning and everything constantly sparkles and moves. I have honestly never seen animation this good before, and I don\'t think I\'ll ever do it again either.The climax of the animation is definetly the last 30 minutes of the movie, and allthough I never knew what or why the hell everything is happening, it at least looked incredible. Out of this world, insane.SOUND: 10/10Sound was also some of the best I\'ve heard, and it definetly sprinkled on some quality together with the animation. I honestly don\'t know what more to say about, exept incredible!ENJOYMENT: 7/10Allthough I didn\'t understand what the hell was going on half of the time, I do have to say that the animation alone makes this worthy of watching, try to ignore the second half of the story and just enjoy it for its outstanding sound and animation, if you\'re more of a story prefering person, then I\'d not reccomend it, but in the end it\'s up to you.OVERALL: 7/10 minutes or so.ART: 11/10The art and animation style of this movie is so different from your normal animes.

The artistic visuals and beautifully composed music was the best part of the film. These two elements blended seamlessly to create such a vibrant and well-designed world, with use of colour and music really visualising different tones and environments perfectly.Ultimately though, Kaijuu no Kodomo was slightly disappointing. Leading up to this film's release in my country, I was pretty excited and anticipating a similar enjoyment to the first time I ever watched films like Wolf Children or Your Name. With their stunning...artistic styles and soundtracks, I was expecting Kaijuu no Kodomo to join these two fantastic films in glory. Unfortunately it did not.What this film lacks in comparison is in its story-telling. With an almost hyper-focus on the stunning artistic visual and sound design of this film, what gets left behind is the capacity to tell a story effectively. The pacing was uneven, and the events were never really explained or developed in ways that could actively engage me in the story of the film itself. I found myself greatly anticipating the animation and visual aspects more, rather than the events that unfolded. It felt messy and it ended messy.The characters were all played effectively, with no particular issues or key moments that arose. The voice actors all performed well for what they were given.Overall, it was a beautiful piece of artwork but just a mediocre film. artistic styles and soundtracks, I was expecting Kaijuu no Kodomo to join these two fantastic films in glory.

This is the sort of film that gently draws you in by the hand, stroking you with gentle breezes, lapping at your bare toes as the distant calls of whales echo by your ears.And then proceeds to faceplant you into the sand and screech like a dying seagull as you hallucinate from a lack of oxygen.For the first hour of the film I was completely hooked! Ruka, Umi and Sora are familiar but enjoyable archetypes, and no time is wasted in building a bond between the trio and getting into the mystery. The side characters have next to no...focus, but they work into the setting well enough to not take away from the story.

Did I miss all the obvious hints and signs because I was too caught up in the gorgeous scenery and facial expressions? Totally possible. Most likely. Did I genuinely attempt to follow every hint and sign? For sure. And yet there I sit, taking in the second hour of the film, jaw dropped because the sights and sounds are all I can follow, and even that loses any sense of direction in the final half an hour. It does sort of tie bits and pieces together at the end, but certainly not enough for me to ponder what I just saw.I can see the direction the story was going, and what it was asking the viewers to explore.

These really complemented the animation and overall story. It's unfortunate that character development was rather poor. The film spends almost all of its time focussing on the three main characters. It pretty much doesn't develop the relationship Ruka has with her parents. Any shift with the relationships with Ruka and her parents and the relationship between her mother and father, which happens in this film, feels rather jarring since there is a lack of backstory and character development to show how they got to that point and why their relationship is unstable and changing.

The only drawback to this movie is that the story lost me a bit especially at the end and the way it tried to wrap it up. Something about the birth of the Universe and being connected to the sea with some festival.The characters also felt very dull. There's clearly some drama introduced that got placed at the backend or resolved very quickly/abruptly so more time could be put to showcase the more surrealistic parts.

To preface, I have not read the source material and I watched the English dub, which I thought was decent. Or at least the dubbing matches the monotone dialogue of the film.STRENGTHS: The art style is incredibly unique and beautiful. A solid 10/10, besides the fact the eyes were...accidental jump scares to me at a couple points in the film lmao. I really thought most of the character designs were nice too despite the faces perhaps lacking in expression once animated. What it lacks in somewhat rough movements at parts, it more than makes up for with creative and fluid animation sequences at many parts of the film that are extremely rich, vivid, and pleasing to the eye to watch. The sound design with underwater noises and such I thought were really nice and the musical score I thought was good too, although I found it to be a little repetitive by the end, but perhaps it was because I was becoming bored with the action.- ART, SOUND, CHARACTER DESIGNSWEAKNESSES: I found the pacing of the movie to be off and startling. The beginning of the movie intrigued me setting up the main character as a realistic, human character and introducing an interesting premise showcasing a boy who was raised by the sea with a mysterious brother. However, by climax of the movie, I found myself feeling totally lost and confused as to how we ended up here. The movie completely ended up in a different direction than I expected; which is actually something I love in a movie, besides the fact that the climax felt... weird? confusing? impossible to follow? It is hard to put into words.In general, I think the biggest issue I have with this movie is that it feels superficial or as though it is trying to impart some grand message, but it kind of just comes off as just ""life is everywhere, the universe, wow"" and it makes you wonder, ""okay, and? what is the point of this?"" It was hard for me to take it seriously.- PACING, THEME, AIMLESS STORYMaybe I just have a smooth brain and there is some grand message to be found in this movie, but the story and theme of the movie falls flat to me. Besides this, the visual intrigue alone and the enjoyment you feel watching this movie is not bad at all and I\'d recommend it to a friend.

I’m also a sucker for symbolism and stories with philosophical and existential themes which this film wonderfully delivered.The animation and art style are absolutely GORGEOUS and the atmosphere is pretty immersive.There are just some scenes and elements that felt out of place for me, and some scenes that are really good but could have been an absolute masterpiece if it managed to completely pull you in.The small details in the film illustrated the reasons why I love the ocean so much, and showed what makes...me afraid of it as well.The story has depth and the dialogue is insightful, but I felt like the delivery was a bit messy which created a sense of disconnect. It can be vague and cryptic, drawing a thin line between purposive storytelling and clumsy execution, so it’s either you like it or hate it. It has the kind of story that you need to dive in deep (pun intended lol) and reflect on to truly appreciate. I personally liked it but then I learned that this was a manga adaptation. I can’t help but imagine that in the manga, the beautiful message of the story will have a greater impact. I want to check it out and hopefully I’ll be able to understand the story better.As for the characters, Ruka is someone whom I both relate and connected with, Sora is enigmatic and draws me in, but Umi just wasn’t as appealing to me as the other two.Overall, this film has a lot of potential but fell a bit short in leaving a lasting impression to me. Which is really frustrating because I felt like it really could have been exceptional. It’s honestly more of an 8.75 for me, but there’s no option like that here so I rounded it off to 9 lol. me afraid of it as well.The story has depth and the dialogue is insightful, but I felt like the delivery was a bit messy which created a sense of disconnect.

Any issues regarding story clarity may stem from film run time limitations and direction/production decisions and, from what I've heard, are largely not present in the source material. I'll give the movie a little leeway here. Similar issues appear to be present in Akira, also adapted from a longer manga.So, story. As I and many other reviewers have mentioned, the plot gets much more confusing at some point during the movie. The whos, whats, and whys are left mostly unexplained and make for a confusing experience. But i definitely enjoy the...concepts that were thrown out there.Art. By far the best part of the movie. This is not meant as a bad thing. The visuals are extremely impressive. It's one of the most (if not THE most)  well animated movies that I have ever seen, and I appreciate the work that was put into it greatly. The art really saved the more confusing parts of this movie, because although I wasn't sure what was happening, what was on screen looked phenomenal.Music composed by Joe Hisaishi, so you know it's gonna be great. Good enough to pull you out of the movie a bit to think about how nice it is.Characters were enjoyable but I felt like many of them weren't as fleshed out as they could've been so I was left questioning some of their motivations. The reasons for this probably tie in closely with why the story is unclear.I got a fair bit of enjoyment out of this movie, even though I didn't completely understand it. (Personally I just have a hard time understanding movies in general anyway...) Unless you can't stand unclear plot in movies, I think you will be thoroughly entertained the whole way through, even during the vague parts. And, if you are a fan of animation (or just have functioning eyeballs) the visuals are sure to leave you stunned and will make up for a few of the movie's other shortcomings. If there is ever a screening in your area, go see it on the big screen.I understand if you are hesitant to watch the film, but I still definitely recommend it. It's a nice way to spend a couple of hours, and if you'd like more clarity, it might inspire you to read the manga source material. (Which I am tempted to.) concepts that were thrown out there.Art.

I did understand some of the issues going on but we had a side plot with Ruka's parents that wasnt very clear, And than...the higher up people that the marina was working with and their greed plot that didnt really come to a clear conclusion either. You dont really end up understanding who Sora and Umi really are and why Ruka had anything to do with this whole thing. I feel like I have tons more questions than answers and the mean behind the film cant be something as simple as she needs to say sorry for hurting the girl in her class...seems a little much for her to go through all that for just that simple of a message?I have to at least give it something tho, I was so focused on know that answer and hear more and more about what was going on that it kept me there till the end...I just feel like the questions i had still werent answered by the end so with all its beauty and meanings it did kinda sour the movie a bit for me.Animation: 9/10I gave it a 9 because though the animation were so well done in some area and felt so really and was really nice for the most part, i felt like some of the animation at the beginning of the film looked a tiny bit off in some places, as the movie progressed tho I didnt see anything.Characters: 8/10Main three characters were nice. Ruka felt very realistic as the she were a really person dealing with teenage problems. Umi was super cute tbh, i just wanted to hug him. Sora although harsh and kinda a blunt jerk, I feel like that tried to make a polar opposite to Umi and thus he was the mean jerk characters.however with all the personality they gave too the main characters i felt like other characters like Anglade, Jim and Ruka's parents had no personalities at all? Anglade maybe had a few little moments where i could feel them trying to bring it out but like why does that rest of them feel blank.Music: 10/10Whimsical and magical, felt every note had feelings, but what can you expect from a great composer like Joe Hisaishi who has done music for ever the famous Studio Ghibli films.Enjoyment: 8/10I feel like despite the confusion and flaws I did enjoy the film, I wanted to see more tho and I felt like I didn't get what I wanted out of it, but maybe you will feel Different when watching it.overall: 8/10My conclusion is, maybe it was just me, but I feel like they were going for a deep mean here, and maybe there was a deep meaning. If there was it went over my head like a wave at the beach. The Main characters tho relatable and charming were over shadowed by a plot that lead to no real CLEAR conclusion. So unless your someone who looks into things deeply you might not understand it. It felt rushed like they could have explained more but because its a Manga adaption movie they had to squeeze everything into two hours. I think I may revisit this and make another review in the future after i re-read the manga, to see if any views have change on this matter, maybe the manga might make me less confused as well.Rewatch Value: 10/10 I really actually want to try to re-watch this again, to see if maybe I could  figure out more of the deep meanings and such. the higher up people that the marina was working with and their greed plot that didnt really come to a clear conclusion either.

I thought it might be a cute story about love and friendship, and I was hooked on it until I kept watching it and halfway through the movie then I quickly lost interest.

Strange things happen and the characters are at the center of it all.Story (7):• I'll be honest, I don't know what the f*ck was going on half of the time, but it was still very enjoyable nonetheless.• There was a major shift in theme around halfway through, where the story turns philosophical and spiritual. Similar to the End Of Evangelion.• Aside from that, we have a main character that is in love with the sea and finds companions that share her interest. Overall it is a wholesome and trippy...story. You won't find yourself bored while watching this at least.Art (10):• The main draw of this movie, the absolutely beautiful animation and effects. The effects are nothing short of eye candy. It is colorful, expressive, and fluid. On the other hand, the animation switches between 2D and 3D sequences which keeps things interesting. In both scenarios, it looks very fluid and realistic. Things in the background are constantly in motion as well and the use of CGI does not stand out at all.Sound (8):• Great sound design. Every little detail contains the appropriate sound and the scenes have good OSTs to compliment them. Pretty much as expected from a movie. Nothing in particular stood out to me, but I would still say this category is above average overall because of the abundance and quality of sound effects.Characters (6):• Weakest part of the movie, depending on if you think the story is good or bad. In my opinion, the story was a lot better than the characters.• There are 3 main characters and a few side characters. The side characters don't have anything interesting about them and aren't really developed at all aside from two of them.• The main girl is pretty average and doesn't really have anything unique about her, besides loving the sea. She is the type of character that is constantly yelling the main boys name in stressful situations, which can get annoying. One of the main boys does have a unique personality and seems to develop as a character. Starting off from edgy, he begins to open up slowly. On the other hand, the other main boy isn't interesting at all. He's always just running around everywhere and swimming.Enjoyment (9):• My personal enjoyment of this movie is a 9 even in light of the issues listed above. Mostly this score is due to the amazing animation and trippy scenes, which I thought were interesting.Overall (8):• Due to the issues with characterization and the story making little sense, I cannot give this more than an 8. The animation is definitely carrying most of the score in this case.Conclusion:• I recommend giving this movie a go. It won't bore you and will captivate you with the unique animation style.

I made a MAL account because of manga like Kaijuu and Made in Abyss and I really couldn’t believe that something that felt as obscure as this got a full movie adaptation. In my eternal struggle with Studio 4°c I was hesitant to pick this one up, but after seeing the official AMV I determined if the movie was poopy...at least we got a great single and music video out of the ordeal. Pleasantly to my surprise Studio 4°c seemed to hit a good mix with this one and I found this movie to be “good enough”.The visuals were overall a gorgeous adaptation of the inky realistic style from the original work. The animators worked a perfect stylistic adaptation of stills from the manga over the 3d scenes with only a few cg turtles and odd tracking sequences breaking immersion. Say what you want about their work but I feel like the studio really give it their all for each property they get their hands on.The sound work was also excellent. Whale sounds, loud booms, and tasty synth vocals were all great creating an experience deserving of the original work. Despite the beautiful additions of the audio element, I do feel that the story perhaps worked best in a purely visual format.The story was glacially slow, and a lot was left out. Characters like the oceanographer Jim had a much bigger role in the book and without the long narration from supporting characters like him and side stories between chapters the viewer is left in perfect empathy with Ruka when she says at the end of the film “I didn’t understand anything”.I feel sorry for any average viewer who went to this film in theatre’s expecting a “Your Name”, “Koe no Katachi”, or a Ghibli film. Without the context from the already relatively sparse manga dialogue this film probably will only appeal to the “arthouse” types.

I wouldn\'t think twice if you told me that clips of the movie can be seen in a museum.The problem of it looking like an art showcase is that the story feels like it\'s just there to somehow tie different pieces together. Don\'t get me wrong, the story is not horrendous or unimportant in scope, it\'s just that it delves too much into surrealism that it feels contrived and unimportant. At a specific point you will ask yourself ""what is happening?"" and let me tell you going back and rewatching some scenes won\'t help you.That\'s the...thing with this movie, you ask ""what"" but not ""why is this happening"" because they basically keep on saying ""why"" it happens. My statement may not make sense now but it will after you watch it.Although I cannot say that the movie is gonna bore you or something, which with its kinda long run time (at least relative to its.. thin story) is actually really impressive. I may be parotting my words but the visuals really do keep your attention to it.How about other aspects of the film? The sound design would be the next best element of the film. I almost regret watching it with my headphones on because the sounds of underwater and the visuals are reminiscent of my worst nightmares of being underwater and being approached by a gaping mouth. For those with fears such as mine the film has scenes like that so yeah good luck! Honestly if they made this into a horror film I would reckon it will be really effective, with its very surreal artstyle and themes will certainly invoke some existential nightmares within you.Overall, the film is a highly recommended watch, if this is how the technical aspects of future anime films be like then we got a good future ahead of us. thing with this movie, you ask ""what"" but not ""why is this happening"" because they basically keep on saying ""why"" it happens.

Although the character visuals can seem off putting at first, they end up working wonderfully with the breathtakingly fluid and unique animation which is the highlight of this film. Simple scenes of the characters in the ocean can make you forget what the actual ocean looks like. The score greatly amplifies the immersion and the unique atmosphere that it creates. If there was an anime film to trip to, it would be this one. The story itself is confusing and I am not going...to pretend like I understand it, as it was condensed from a manga that I have not yet read.

Umi - one of the boys, found near the coast of Philippines met Ruka - the shoujo mc, who injured a girl in the nose and ended the beginning of her summer, Restarted and said that her long long summer finally began. She met Umi in the workplace of her dad and she learned more about the sea and what is within it. Sora - one of the boys, is same as Umi but he is different in some ways like he carried...the meteor that Umi called ""Will-o\'-the-wisp"" and guided the whole sea towards the universe hiding within Sora.This anime is very underrated. It\'s underrated in every aspect. Let\'s talk about the animation. The studio who animated this also animated berserk movie which is a whole cgi and by watching the berserk movie, you could say the studio is trash. But in this anime, its like they dumped all of their budget to this anime. This anime surpassed the 1-10 rating system. The animation can be 11/10 or 12/10. Its on another level. The animation is like Kyoto Animation from 2050. Because the cgi animation on the train is flawless and they really animated how train turns when they encounter a curved rail. F i also like how they animated the rain because they really animated how rain does when dancing with the wind. Because the amount of water in every spot is not symmetrical because rain has a spot where it has more rain in the house than the streets. Because the winds changes the direction of the rain that make it move towards each other. I\'m not a science teacher and correct me in this review about science if I got any mistakes because I just described how rain actually looks like. The animation doesn\'t have any flaws in this aspect. The characters are also good. I like how the mother of Ruka acted when she went to find her, she acted like an Aloha Beach. I also like how Ruka and Umi acted when they are fighting for the meteor that Sora gave to Ruka. Ruka stopped Umi\'s hand when he is about to swallow it and in the end, Ruka finally let Umi after a few rounds of fighting for the meteor. Like bruh, ok lol.The story is good and unique, and it does seem a ghibli film story that make it seems they animated it but sadly no. The studio is not well known do it is infamous. The character design is also good. It is very unique. The eyes were reflecting the environment that they even have time to bother that little detail. The facial shape is also good. The eyesbrows when Ruka is like crying at the end is also good. I also like how long Sora\'s eyelashes when he is talking to Ruka when she is laying down front in the white bubble dimension. I like also how big their eye is and by not making random eye colors that almost everyone\'s eye color is blue. Everything about the character design is good but how much is even their budget? Where do they even got that many moneu jusy to make this anime. They also did a very good job on the sound effects. I noticed it when the humpback whales is playing un the sea because it kinda sounds like Rimuru\'s magic sound effects also Benimaru\'s famous sound effects vs. the demon wherein he finishes the demon by using a borrowed move from his close friend. I can just say that the sound effects is also good as the character designs. The art is also good. I\'m finding a wallpaper from this anime but they didn\'t they gave me a chance. I\'ll try to find if I ever rewatch this.Overall, its quite good I just didn\'t enjoy this anime as much as I would like to enjoy this. The story is just a bit bad that makes this hard for mr to rewatch. That\'s why people rate this lower than you expect. I hope the studio make another one with this kind of animation because I can\'t see any more anime with this kind of animation. Maybe they really all gave their very best in this one lol. If there is a manga of this, I would like to read it to make me understand this anime more because the story is a bit complicated that its just confusing that you don\'t know what is happening anymore. I will rate it like this because the story is the only flaw on this one that made the audience dislike this anime. the meteor that Umi called ""Will-o\'-the-wisp"" and guided the whole sea towards the universe hiding within Sora.This anime is very underrated. It\'s underrated in every aspect. Let\'s talk about the animation. The studio who animated this also animated berserk movie which is a whole cgi and by watching the berserk movie, you could say the studio is trash. But in this anime, its like they dumped all of their budget to this anime. This anime surpassed the 1-10 rating system. The animation can be 11/10 or 12/10. Its on another level. The animation is like Kyoto Animation from 2050. Because the cgi animation on the train is flawless and they really animated how train turns when they encounter a curved rail. F i also like how they animated the rain because they really animated how rain does when dancing with the wind. Because the amount of water in every spot is not symmetrical because rain has a spot where it has more rain in the house than the streets. Because the winds changes the direction of the rain that make it move towards each other. I\'m not a science teacher and correct me in this review about science if I got any mistakes because I just described how rain actually looks like. The animation doesn\'t have any flaws in this aspect. The characters are also good. I like how the mother of Ruka acted when she went to find her, she acted like an Aloha Beach. I also like how Ruka and Umi acted when they are fighting for the meteor that Sora gave to Ruka. Ruka stopped Umi\'s hand when he is about to swallow it and in the end, Ruka finally let Umi after a few rounds of fighting for the meteor. Like bruh, ok lol.The story is good and unique, and it does seem a ghibli film story that make it seems they animated it but sadly no. The studio is not well known do it is infamous. The character design is also good. It is very unique. The eyes were reflecting the environment that they even have time to bother that little detail. The facial shape is also good. The eyesbrows when Ruka is like crying at the end is also good. I also like how long Sora\'s eyelashes when he is talking to Ruka when she is laying down front in the white bubble dimension.

I was just so fascinated with everything concerning the visual aspect of the story.STORY 5/10I honestly want to know what happened. In the beginning, Everything was just very intriguing and i was a little interested. But then halfway thru the movie everything is just so confusing. They were talking about a FESTIVAL, then The GALAXY/UNIVERSE whatever the heck they were talking cause i wasn't focused. Honestly i only really stuck around becuz of the art. They didn't really explain anything which was what made everything confusing. I really wanted to know what the hell was going on.ART 10/10Like...everyone else says the art is so amazing and fascinating. The close up animation looked weird but still so fricking nice and very pleasing to look at.  My fav part of the movie.SOUND 9/10The background music was also very pleasing to listen to. Awesome as well. Not the kind of person to care much abt the music but had to give credit where it was due.CHARACTERS 6/10Idk what to say really. I was so confused while watching this I just needed explanations so I don't have much to say abt them.ENJOYMENT 5/10I mean, i did enjoy it but then not really. I was mostly fawning over the art. The story made absolutely no sense so...yeah.OVERALL 7/10Ngl, everything except the story was perfect. I would def recommend if u like beautiful art.

It was different than most other things I've ever seen but it was absolutely beautiful. The animation was also just awesome. Then comes the MUSIC, Joe Hisaishi... need I say more (It's amazing). Also the Theme song called Spirits of the Sea by Kenshi Yonezu is sooo good it gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it. The CHARACTERS were interesting, personally wasn't too attached to any of them but I was interested in all of them. Then we get to the ENJOYMENT. I don't think there were many dull moments...in the show, I was always invested and interested in the movie and I was just starstruck by the amazing visuals and sounds. Finally the STORY. It has the tags: drama, mystery, supernatural. It was all of the above. The last 30 mins or so of the movie I was pretty clueless at the time, there was a lot going on, but I did enjoy it all. The visuals in the end were just intense, it was a great experience. It's not every day that I'm confused and just thoroughly enjoying it all. I'm not too picky when it comes to some anime like some people, I don't usually dive too in depth and nit pick things that I didn't enjoy. All I'm going to say is I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful art and animation throughout the movie and the sounds and music were so fitting and really well done of course. The story is also pretty interesting and the characters were very unique.

I couldn’t connect with any of them at all.Enjoyment:3/10I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone to be brutally honest, like you can watch if you like but, you will just be confused.The only thing I enjoyed would be the artwork, that’s it really.

Maybe I'm just dumb, but at first, I sort of had a clue about what was going on, but for the rest, I was just feeling muddled. The story begins with introducing two boys to this young girl, and the boys were apparently raised in the sea, and therefore aren't exactly humans. Throughout the movie, the three kids are trying to find a meteor rock or something to make a sea festival happen, and when this happens, one of...the kids dies and turns into multiple galaxies?? I'm sorry, but this was just too confusing for me.Art - 10Story aside, the animation was just outstanding. I would definitely say the art was very unique - but I also feel like the directors were just using the animation as a way to distract the audience from the confusing storyline. But nonetheless, this movie has one of the most beautiful animation styles I have ever laid my eyes upon.Sound - 10I feel like the directors put a lot more money into the music and animation, but I would still like to congratulate the sound producers for the amazing music. They did a really good job with the whale songs, and the background music really was on the same level as the animation.Character - 4Honestly, the characters were boring. The only reason I didn't give them a 1 for the character writing is that I kind of thought Ruka was pretty interesting. I could at least relate a tiny bit with her, but with Umi and Sora, they were just bland as uncooked pasta. It is pretty cool that they added a black character and actually portray him with a nice art style, but they were just too boring. It felt like they could have had a chance at being interesting characters in the beginning, but it just seems like that was too hard for the directors to do.Enjoyment - 6I know I talk really bad about the character writing and storyline, but I really did enjoy the animation and music, so I would say I fairly enjoyed this film.Overall - 8This is the type of movie you can put on in the background for your kids, or if you just wanted to watch a movie without having to really use your brain. The animation really does capture the beauty anime can hold, and I believe this movie was very good - characters aside.Alright, that's my review! Hopefully, it shed some light on your opinion, or not lol. Thanks for reading this though! :^D the kids dies and turns into multiple galaxies??

Thanks for reading this though! :^D"", ""I'm aesthetically confused about every part of this movie.It's confusing and I can't really grasp the storyline of it.Everything's a mystery. But that's partly why I like it.The story progresses really... fast and it kind of feels rushed, but as I said everything is a mystery. It gives a spark in our imaginations.The faces look way too realistic for my tastes but the eyes are on point.Also, I love Sora, and that's all I can say. He's so beautiful.Also, the art and animation are amazing I could literally use every single scenery in this movie for a background picture. I actually have a portfolio...just for this anime's aesthetically pleasing visuals. just for this anime's aesthetically pleasing visuals."", ""The animation and musc were wonderfully done but I gotta say the characters and story was a let down. We didn't learn a lot about the characters and many of them seemed one dimensional as the movie emphasised one trait and the story lost me in the last third. Ruka, Uma and Sora were the main characters but i didn't care about them as much as I could have. You could feel that a lot of it was cut out from the source material. A good experience nonetheless. The visuals and sound truly carried the film. Probably won't rewatch tho. A light seven. "", 'The Children of the Sea is a film I would recommend a friend to watch by themselves at 2-3am with little to no explanation.The film is very alluring and captivating even with visuals alone. Some of the best animated sea life there is. From ribbon eels to false killer sharks the scenery is illuminating and stunning.Very good at keeping your attention by going from a melancholy sunny scene to something darker and more fast paced.Some of scenes were genuinely so intense (not content wise but by use of sounds and visuals) that I was taken aback or caught off guard.If you are not...a fan of films that are more emotional in nature rather than literal than this may not be your flavor of tea. There is a lot of fantastical elements that can be hard to attach to in terms of a plot. At times it often feels more like a visual and auditory experience than it does a concrete story.  So that looseness and lack of rigidity in terms of story can be a fault if that is what you are wishing to derive from a film.The characters themselves serve as devices to explore the world in which the film is set in and everhthing works together to propel the film forward in that way. The change of pace from a typical summer childhood adolescence animation was personally a treat for me, so if you like odd tasting candy maybe try it out yourself.🐋 \U0001fabc 🐟 a fan of films that are more emotional in nature rather than literal than this may not be your flavor of tea.

I get the girl and...2 boys being friends and everything I just don't get who's the bad guy or good guy.One more thing the whole movie is building to this climax and well it look good I still can't make heads or tails of it really what happen was it a good thing or a bad thing.So good visuals and the rest well let you see for your self. 2 boys being friends and everything I just don't get who's the bad guy or good guy.One more thing the whole movie is building to this climax and well it look good I still can't make heads or tails of it really what happen was it a good thing or a bad thing.So good visuals and the rest well let you see for your self."", 'Kaijuu no Kodomo is a beautiful drawn & heavily metaphorical journeyIf I were rating this strictly on Animation/Art, this would probably be a 10/10 hands down, as this movie had some of the most awe inspiring visuals that seen. They really went above and beyond creating the art here and animating it. The scenes and style have a very saturated palette, with complex yet often times creepy/mysterious graphics, which is akin to how the ocean is in general. The OST was also just as beautiful, they did a wonderful job making eerie scenes, beautiful visuals, and chilling moments just due to their choice of scores/sounds....Plot: Ruka is a troublemaking student who is simply looking forward to her summer break. She is growing up taking care of herself essentially as she has a rather broken home life and acts out accordingly. After an incident at her school sports club, she succumbs to the fact that her summer is ruined and decides to take a visit to the aquarium that her father operates, which she loved so much as a child. At the aquarium she is befriended by a young boy, Umi, who was raised in the ocean by dugongs, and soon his \'brother\' Sora as well. As Ruka has these intense visions of whales and a ""festival"" that is soon to take place, the sea creatures of the ocean begin congregating into one spot, and Ruka begins to learn slowly the connection between these sea-born boys & their connection with this festival.This is a film that will have you thinking hard about the meaning of each scene, as like I stated, it is HEAVILY metaphorical. On topics like: Not knowing where you belong, The strive to reach something bigger than yourself as well as being part of something greater, Yin & Yang and the balance of the universe. I think the graphics and art did a wonderful job of trying to convey the ideologies they were touching on, it\'s just that it didn\'t feel like the story/commentary followed along as much, so much so that it felt like it got left behind and was being strictly carried by the art part way through the film.The story really begins getting detached from itself once they start delving deeper into the whole ""festival"" that is happening in the ocean. It doesn\'t help much that everytime any explanation is attempted to be given by a character, it seems that they only speak in riddles or MORE metaphors, so much so that it ends up getting convoluted. I\'m not sure if this is because of the amount they left out of the manga (I have not read it) or if it was just a simple mistranslation, but there was a lot that seemed to turn kind of messy just due to lack of explanation which made you kind of just guess the reasons for certain things happening. Again, am not sure if this is a loss of detail from manga to movie, but I feel like there were certain characters that got snubbed of screen time that would have played a significantly more important role had they decided to add the extra details (Jim, Anglade, Dede).The ending itself had me a bit confused, as the final visuals were breathtaking and really next level, but it all felt like a confusion of what it was trying to allude to. I enjoyed it, but I didn\'t enjoy having to try and go super-sleuth to attempt and make a conclusion for myself because it felt like the writers weren\'t able to. I understand that Dede says at the end, ""Children of the sea come and tell the secrets of their world and ours, and where we are going"", but beyond that, I feel like something more happened that either went over my head, or I just wasn\'t privy to at all.I do respect the fact of Umi and Sora (meaning Sea and Sky) are clearly metaphors for that exactly. How they are one in the same, and how the worlds intertwine together. This is a point struck on many times throughout the film, like when Ruka says ""It looks like we could swim in the stars\'. I thought this to be a pretty forward but rather beautiful metaphor, as well as the baby being born at the end symbolizing a rebirth of their lives and being able to move into the future ahead of them.This movie is definitely a great watch for the visuals & soundtrack alone, but the story itself, could have used a little extra hand holding in trying to help guide the viewer to a conclusion, rather than leave them guessing and wondering.Art: 10/10Animation: 9/10Characters: 8/10Plot: 6/10Voice Acting: 7/10 Plot: Ruka is a troublemaking student who is simply looking forward to her summer break.

The story seemed complex, beautiful and as mysterious as the ocean is deep.The art and the music were beautifully timed. The randomness of Umi and Sora's different nationalities when the story was set on an island in Japan was strange, but the art was beautiful. What was really interesting was that each frame when there were eyes, the eyes were...drawn incredibly detailed and reflective to mirror the emotion of the scene. It was great, whether it was the crystal clear blue of Sora's eyes or the rich depth to Umi's eyes, you really felt the connection with them.

Ling Qi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33605/Ling_Qi,"[""This is based on a chinese Manga(Manhwa). It is actually really good(THe manga) but the anime adaptation kind of is not really good because of the voice actors and the weird art and the change in the original plot. this anime can be qualified as Shounen-Ai but it is more on the relationship of a master and his servant though they do have to kiss sometimes for the special skill to work on the servant(Can't say it or I will spoil it). But if you are interested in this, I advise you to read the manga because Chinese manhwa are colored and it is really...awesome. (But it is kind of hard to find it, since not much of it has been completely translated.)But of course, this is a Chinese version of the now Japanese version of Spiritpact. The animation is still the same except the voice actors are Japanese.  If you want to give it a try, you should go ahead. The anime did kind of cut out a few important parts of the manhua, especially some parts where they honestly should not have.... awesome.

And a good one on top of that!I thought I'd start with that as the genre is not listed on MAL.As probably most of you have figured out by the name, this is a Chinese animation, the second in my life, but I have to say definitely not the last one!Overall Ling Qi is a beautifully drawn anime with a deeper story from what you'd expect of 20 short episodes. It engages the viewer straight from episode 1 with its perfectly proportioned combination of sweet humour, action, art, BGM, few parodies of other anime and unexpected development.While the...story left many things unexplained(which probably the manga will explain), this did not really ruin the pleasure of watching Ling Qi, I did not feel it left me hanging and questioning plot-holes or scratching the back of my head wondering what it tried to convey.The Chinese setting/language was a very refreshing break from the good ol' Japanese anime and the characters' behaviour or way of speaking is something I enjoyed immensely as it (especially the voices) felt much less forced than most Japanese animes.I do pay a lot of attention to voice actors, way of talking etc and I can't hide how much I hate forced voices like in many animes (no normal Japanese person talks like that) and speech in Ling Qi did not strike me as forced or overreacting (I did live with and communicate with a group of Chinese for a whole year)Overall, 8 from me, very pleasant animation, beautiful artwork, nice BGM, engaging story, and most of all a Chinese shounen-ai. story left many things unexplained(which probably the manga will explain), this did not really ruin the pleasure of watching Ling Qi, I did not feel it left me hanging and questioning plot-holes or scratching the back of my head wondering what it tried to convey.The Chinese setting/language was a very refreshing break from the good ol' Japanese anime and the characters' behaviour or way of speaking is something I enjoyed immensely as it (especially the voices) felt much less forced than most Japanese animes.I do pay a lot of attention to voice actors, way of talking etc and I can't hide how much I hate forced voices like in many animes (no normal Japanese person talks like that) and speech in Ling Qi did not strike me as forced or overreacting (I did live with and communicate with a group of Chinese for a whole year)Overall, 8 from me, very pleasant animation, beautiful artwork, nice BGM, engaging story, and most of all a Chinese shounen-ai."", ""If this anime aired in the early 2000s, it'd probably be pretty okay.

I do not know why myanimelist deleted the separate entry when they already had it set up on their site, but whatever.Honestly, Spiritpact was kind of annoying, but it's not the worst I've seen.  The main story is basically that Tanmoki makes You Keika his spirit shadow after You dies.  You is the person who now will fight along side Tanmoki as he faces evil spirits and other people that come after him.  There's more detail that you can learn about the plot, but...I'd be spoiling a bit of the anime if I included that information.  Overall, the plot was a mess though.I guess the art and animation were kind of average.  Nothing really bugged me about either aspect, but at the same time, neither one was necessarily good either.The opening, ending and background music were kind of bad.  I personally don't like the opening and ending themes.  The background music didn't do it's job of getting me, the viewer, more excited about what was happening.  Most of the music scores are kind of just there.The characters are really bad too.  None of them really have a special personality trait and a lot of them can get on your nerves really easily, especially  You at the beginning.  2 or 3 of the main characters, like You and Tanmoki got some development, but no one else really did.  Most characters were just present with no real purpose for being there and they didn't add much if anything to the plot.Like many others, I didn't really enjoy this.  Some episodes were ok, but more were boring and seemed pointless to even include.  There's some ok action and other things from time to time so  it's not the worst I've seen;  I'd still rank this above many other anime I've watched, but I definitely wouldn't say this quit lived up to being average either.   I don't recommend Spiritact, but some people reading this may decide to check it and like it. I'd be spoiling a bit of the anime if I included that information.

I started reading Chinese light novels such as Quan Zhi Gao Shou (waiting for the anime this month!) but other than that, not much else. Recently however, I was impressed by Shuangsheng Lingtan and decided that I wanted to see what Chinese anime is like. So, I picked Ling Qi by random (I think it\'s recommended if you like Shuangsheng Lingtan) and started watching. I was not disappointed at all.Story (7/10) - Good: The story is not particularly fascinating or unique, however the...way the characters are portrayed made it worth following. I liked seeing some of the Chinese traditions and customs to honor the dead/death. There were some points where I felt like I\'d missed something though. A character would mention something and events would take a direction that seemed like it came from nowhere even though I\'d given it my full attention. Whether this is me just being stupid or the story actually missing pieces is something you can decide for yourself.Art (8/10) - Very Good:The colors are nice and vibrant and the shading seems more in depth than in most anime. I was impressed by the detail that was put into it and the special effects were great. Every so often though there were some minor problems with continuity; sometimes certain details would be omitted but then reappear later. Overall though the coloring felt more sophisticated than typical anime.Sound (8/10) - Very Good:Since this is technically the first Chinese anime I\'ve watched (completed) then I don\'t have much experience with judging Chinese voice acting, but basing it off what I hear in Japanese voice acting then I\'d say they\'re pretty consistent. I didn\'t hear anything I thought was particularly awful to say in the least. The soundtrack was cool for sure though. If there is one thing that can surpass language and culture barriers, it\'s music and I really enjoyed Ling Qi\'s soundtrack.Character (8/10): Honestly, I liked all the characters and how they were portrayed. There were a lot of silly moments that were just kind of nice to see and it didn\'t ruin the story or break the pace. It felt natural and seemed fitting for the show. If I could see this same cast in another season, I don\'t think I\'d mind.Enjoyment (9/10) - Great: For my first completed Chinese anime, I had a lot of fun watching and comparing it to Japanese anime and it\'s fun to see and compare the cultural differences. I\'ve been trying to branch out into other anime media such as manwha (the Korean webcomics) and manhua (Chinese manga) and I plan on continuing and learning more about Northeastern Asian culture from every point. Even though a lot of it may be romanticized.Overall (7/10) - Good:Ling Qi isn\'t the best show I\'ve ever seen and I wouldn\'t say it particularly stands out from anything I\'ve ever watched but it\'s still enjoyable. I wouldn\'t call the series ""deep"" or poignant in any way, but there were moments that were very touching and I recommend watching it for a quick source of fun. Even though I give it an average score (to me- 7=70%/C/Good), I actually do think very highly of it.As a quick side note though, it is worth knowing that Ling Qi is considered a shounen ai (homosexual romance). There is nothing ""heavy"" or explicit, but it is apparent that the main characters have romantic feelings for each other and is implied and shown in a few ways. I, myself, actually did not find out about this fact until after I\'d already started the series. I\'m not against shounen ai at all, but it isn\'t exactly a genre that I pursue or have at the top of my priority list. There\'s nothing too explicit like in Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi or Junjou Romantica, but if the topic makes you you uncomfortable even in the slightest, then it might not be the show for you. (You\'re missing out though.)Bonus: Oh yeah, there is one Attack on Titan (ep 7) reference and one Sailor Moon (16 ep) reference so if you find sightings/references of other shows funny, you\'d most likely be amused by it. way the characters are portrayed made it worth following.

I have always been a fan of LGBT+ works, and I have enjoyed many Shounen-Ai, Yuri, and Yaoi anime. This one, however, was just bad. There were too many problems with it that even if I tried to shut my brain off, I just couldn\'t overlook it. I haven\'t read the web manga, and if it\'s better, props to it.Beware, there might be ""spoilers"" in this review, but it\'s not all that important. Most of what I talk about happens in the first episode, and the rest of the ""spoilers""...are so easy to guess because of the show\'s predictable nature. Anyways, without further ado, let\'s get on with this.Story- 5Okay, this is where almost all of the major problems are. The show starts off with You Keika (Yang Jinghua) living his life as a savage fortune teller. His life has pretty much hit rock bottom and then he suddenly dies by good old truck-san. When he wakes up, he meets the oh-so-cool and good-looking Tanmoku Ki (Duanmu Xi) and is informed that he is dead. For some reason, Tanmoku Ki wants to hire him to be his ""Spirit Shadow"" which is a fancy word for a supernatural bodyguard.You Keika rejects his request, but after a cliche run in with a darkened spirit or whatever, he decides to take the rings (yes, rings) and become his Spirit Shadow.Pretty typical plot, right? One could easily overlook this as just an average show, and it is. However, unlike other average shows, I literally felt insulted as a member of the audience. The story continues with giving fangirls bits and pieces of the good gay stuff, while also making Tanmoku Ki have a fiancee. My biggest gripe with the show is that it doesn\'t know what it wants to be. It goes far enough with the yaoi to leave fujoshi\'s squealing, but not far enough to make the character\'s relationships feel natural. The tone is constantly shifting from edgy, to ""funny"", to romance, to edgy and funny again. I am aware these tone shifts are natural for any story, but the pacing in this show is so bad it makes it feel awkward and cringe-worthy.The pacing is really awful and it\'s a major gripe I had while watching this. There are these awkward pauses in animation, the dialogue feels like a 13 year old wrote it, and the relationships are so forced for the sake of the plot. Keep in mind 90% of the show takes place in a week. A WEEK. And you know what happened in like the 4-5th episode? A montage.A f**king montage of all the time the two mains spent together, when at the time, they had only known each other for FOUR DAYS.The story is constantly trying to make it seem deeper than it is and make their ""bond"" known to the viewers, but it just doesn\'t work. You can\'t throw montages in our faces or little cute moments here and there and expect us to go along with their relationship. Why they\'re even so close in a week is beyond me, and it\'s one of the biggest turn off points in the show. How am I supposed to get invested when the two main characters have such a forced bond? If you start off trying to instantly make them close after an episode or two, you lose the aspect of them growing to like each other. You lose their development, how they change their view of each other, and why they become close. If you slap it together with force at the beginning, you get a relationship that\'s completely empty.Also, the show does the cliche tie ins to past lives and reincarnations and all that other stuff you\'ve seen a million times. The sudden relevance to that in the show is so cheap it\'s almost laughable. Literally, everything about the story has been done before, but better. Much better.In conclusion, the story has choppy pacing, weak characters, and cliches all around. There is literally nothing special about the story. If it weren\'t for the fujoshi bait, I don\'t think anyone would\'ve continued watching this. And trust me, the creators know that. That\'s why they barely tried to produce something decent. It\'s an insult to the audience\'s intelligence.Art- 7I mean, the art wasn\'t anything great, but it was passable. I can\'t be too hard on it; it served its purpose. As I mentioned earlier though, there were parts with choppy animation or where they looped it. You could sometimes see through the cracks of where they made budget cuts, and it would only increase the awkward feeling of the show. The awkward pauses with the dialogue following a tad behind happened way too often to be an accident. I did like the opening, but I felt it could\'ve either calmed down some, or been more action packed. The sound didn\'t fit the animation at all sometimes, which brings us to our next category.Sound- 6Okay, I actually like both the opening and ending. I even like some of the piano tracks in it. The soundtrack on its own is pretty decent. However, the creators have no clue where to place their tracks in the show. It ended up having the weirdest background music for some scenes that either required softer or heavier tones. Sometimes there would be random songs with a vocalist just thrown in there for the hell of it. This is the first show I\'ve seen where I\'ve actually noticed that the sound doesn\'t fit. And it wasn\'t just once, it was throughout all 10 episodes. Sometimes they\'d get it right, but most of the time it was just weird.Character- 3This is the worst part guys. I already mentioned that the two mains had such a forced relationship, and it really shows. The main guy can be pretty obnoxious. The creators think having him ramble off random sh*t is comedy gold, so he does it every. Single. Episode. He\'s a weak attempt at a comedic character. Not to mention they try so hard just from the beginning to make us feel bad for him.Alright, ladies and gentlemen, time to pull out your anime tropes checklist! What do we have for You Keika?Dead parents! Check!No relatives! Check!Living poor and on his own! Check!Ties to a supernatural past! Check!Gets hit by a truck! Check!5 in a row makes a winner! Stand up and claim your prize you sack of sh-So anyways, I didn\'t enjoy his character. I tried to, but the writing didn\'t make that possible. I remember in like the 3rd episode or so he got in a fight with this flame lord and umbrella loli, and his special move was calling for help. Then immediately after that, with no explanation, he was suddenly like ""I can\'t rely on others and cry for help anymore! I have to fight for myself!"" He gets that weird determination out of nowhere and decided to be a badass at random moments for the hell of the story. Sometimes he powers up because of his past life or whatever and becomes a boss that can defeat this blind master, then other times when he\'s in his power up mode he\'s completely useless. There\'s no consistency with his strength or character whatsoever. Speaking of that, there is literally a magical girl transformation of him changing into that form. I\'m not kidding. I\'m really not. It happens. A f**king magical girl transformation. It\'s not funny. Nothing in this show is funny. It\'s just a bad attempt at reference humor. It\'s so bad. IT\'S SO-~We\'ll be right back after these messages!~Okay, I\'m back. I\'m not sure if this review is coherent or not, but I hope that you see what I\'m getting at. Before I get any more triggered, let\'s move on to the next main character. Tanmoku Ki,  is the cold, calm, and collected stereotype.Pull out that checklist again, ladies and gentlemen, it\'s time for round two!Cool, handsome, and rich! Check!Supernatural powers that are super special! Check!Head of some family of exorcists or whatever! Check!Dead parents and possible illegitimacy! Check!Cold to everyone except the main character cause plot! Check!There\'s not much I can say about his character, because he really doesn\'t have one. He gets randomly worried and worked up over You Keika\'s safety for reasons that aren\'t explained until the last episode. Even when they are explained, it doesn\'t make it any better. He\'s a walking trope of every cool rich guy that came before him. His character is so bland that if it weren\'t for his powers and social placing, there would be nothing special about him. So yeah, not much I can say.Enjoyment- 4Not gonna lie, I had a few laughs while watching this insanity. The montage part and the magical girl transformation both made me lose it because of how bad it was. Even with some of the stuff being so bad it\'s funny, most of it was just bad. I cringed more times than i can count.Overall- 5It\'s average. Average and insulting. Don\'t waste your time on this. If you want to see boys in love, go watch Doukyuusei. They actually, you know, TRY.If you just want some ancient supernatural stuff with good action, go watch Moribito. Good characters, interesting plot, and plenty of action to keep you entertained.So yeah, pass this show  if you value your integrity. There are better things out there to watch. Don\'t waste your time here. are so easy to guess because of the show\'s predictable nature. Anyways, without further ado, let\'s get on with this.Story- 5Okay, this is where almost all of the major problems are. The show starts off with You Keika (Yang Jinghua) living his life as a savage fortune teller. His life has pretty much hit rock bottom and then he suddenly dies by good old truck-san. When he wakes up, he meets the oh-so-cool and good-looking Tanmoku Ki (Duanmu Xi) and is informed that he is dead. For some reason, Tanmoku Ki wants to hire him to be his ""Spirit Shadow"" which is a fancy word for a supernatural bodyguard.You Keika rejects his request, but after a cliche run in with a darkened spirit or whatever, he decides to take the rings (yes, rings) and become his Spirit Shadow.Pretty typical plot, right? One could easily overlook this as just an average show, and it is. However, unlike other average shows, I literally felt insulted as a member of the audience. The story continues with giving fangirls bits and pieces of the good gay stuff, while also making Tanmoku Ki have a fiancee. My biggest gripe with the show is that it doesn\'t know what it wants to be. It goes far enough with the yaoi to leave fujoshi\'s squealing, but not far enough to make the character\'s relationships feel natural. The tone is constantly shifting from edgy, to ""funny"", to romance, to edgy and funny again. I am aware these tone shifts are natural for any story, but the pacing in this show is so bad it makes it feel awkward and cringe-worthy.The pacing is really awful and it\'s a major gripe I had while watching this. There are these awkward pauses in animation, the dialogue feels like a 13 year old wrote it, and the relationships are so forced for the sake of the plot. Keep in mind 90% of the show takes place in a week. A WEEK. And you know what happened in like the 4-5th episode? A montage.A f**king montage of all the time the two mains spent together, when at the time, they had only known each other for FOUR DAYS.The story is constantly trying to make it seem deeper than it is and make their ""bond"" known to the viewers, but it just doesn\'t work. You can\'t throw montages in our faces or little cute moments here and there and expect us to go along with their relationship. Why they\'re even so close in a week is beyond me, and it\'s one of the biggest turn off points in the show. How am I supposed to get invested when the two main characters have such a forced bond? If you start off trying to instantly make them close after an episode or two, you lose the aspect of them growing to like each other. You lose their development, how they change their view of each other, and why they become close. If you slap it together with force at the beginning, you get a relationship that\'s completely empty.Also, the show does the cliche tie ins to past lives and reincarnations and all that other stuff you\'ve seen a million times. The sudden relevance to that in the show is so cheap it\'s almost laughable. Literally, everything about the story has been done before, but better. Much better.In conclusion, the story has choppy pacing, weak characters, and cliches all around. There is literally nothing special about the story. If it weren\'t for the fujoshi bait, I don\'t think anyone would\'ve continued watching this. And trust me, the creators know that. That\'s why they barely tried to produce something decent. It\'s an insult to the audience\'s intelligence.Art- 7I mean, the art wasn\'t anything great, but it was passable. I can\'t be too hard on it; it served its purpose. As I mentioned earlier though, there were parts with choppy animation or where they looped it. You could sometimes see through the cracks of where they made budget cuts, and it would only increase the awkward feeling of the show. The awkward pauses with the dialogue following a tad behind happened way too often to be an accident. I did like the opening, but I felt it could\'ve either calmed down some, or been more action packed. The sound didn\'t fit the animation at all sometimes, which brings us to our next category.Sound- 6Okay, I actually like both the opening and ending. I even like some of the piano tracks in it. The soundtrack on its own is pretty decent. However, the creators have no clue where to place their tracks in the show. It ended up having the weirdest background music for some scenes that either required softer or heavier tones. Sometimes there would be random songs with a vocalist just thrown in there for the hell of it. This is the first show I\'ve seen where I\'ve actually noticed that the sound doesn\'t fit. And it wasn\'t just once, it was throughout all 10 episodes. Sometimes they\'d get it right, but most of the time it was just weird.Character- 3This is the worst part guys. I already mentioned that the two mains had such a forced relationship, and it really shows. The main guy can be pretty obnoxious. The creators think having him ramble off random sh*t is comedy gold, so he does it every. Single. Episode. He\'s a weak attempt at a comedic character. Not to mention they try so hard just from the beginning to make us feel bad for him.Alright, ladies and gentlemen, time to pull out your anime tropes checklist! What do we have for You Keika?Dead parents! Check!No relatives! Check!Living poor and on his own! Check!Ties to a supernatural past! Check!Gets hit by a truck! Check!5 in a row makes a winner! Stand up and claim your prize you sack of sh-So anyways, I didn\'t enjoy his character. I tried to, but the writing didn\'t make that possible. I remember in like the 3rd episode or so he got in a fight with this flame lord and umbrella loli, and his special move was calling for help. Then immediately after that, with no explanation, he was suddenly like ""I can\'t rely on others and cry for help anymore! I have to fight for myself!"" He gets that weird determination out of nowhere and decided to be a badass at random moments for the hell of the story. Sometimes he powers up because of his past life or whatever and becomes a boss that can defeat this blind master, then other times when he\'s in his power up mode he\'s completely useless. There\'s no consistency with his strength or character whatsoever. Speaking of that, there is literally a magical girl transformation of him changing into that form. I\'m not kidding. I\'m really not. It happens. A f**king magical girl transformation. It\'s not funny. Nothing in this show is funny. It\'s just a bad attempt at reference humor. It\'s so bad. IT\'S SO-~We\'ll be right back after these messages!~Okay, I\'m back. I\'m not sure if this review is coherent or not, but I hope that you see what I\'m getting at. Before I get any more triggered, let\'s move on to the next main character. Tanmoku Ki,  is the cold, calm, and collected stereotype.Pull out that checklist again, ladies and gentlemen, it\'s time for round two!Cool, handsome, and rich! Check!Supernatural powers that are super special! Check!Head of some family of exorcists or whatever! Check!Dead parents and possible illegitimacy! Check!Cold to everyone except the main character cause plot! Check!There\'s not much I can say about his character, because he really doesn\'t have one. He gets randomly worried and worked up over You Keika\'s safety for reasons that aren\'t explained until the last episode. Even when they are explained, it doesn\'t make it any better. He\'s a walking trope of every cool rich guy that came before him. His character is so bland that if it weren\'t for his powers and social placing, there would be nothing special about him.

It gives you a character who\'s entire life has been filled with hardships and struggles. A total underdog. Usually those are...the types of characters that I love, the type I want to cheer on for. However quickly such a plot line for Spiritpact proves to be boring and reusable, viewers get met with the same basic tropes that a lot of anime seem to keep recycling: the good looking guy, a prestigious household, a fiancee with multiple aspects of her personality that change with the drop of a pin. A couple episodes in and that\'s all that Spiritpact seems to prove itself to be. There\'s nothing in it, that makes it standout or distinguishable from any other anime that is has the same troupes as it and quite honestly in my opinion, it\'s what makes this anime so forgettable.ART (6): I will admit that the animation for this anime is quite good, I have yet to see any major flaws in it. Each episode keeps a consistent style of animation. The art isn\'t really all that special in terms of other works that Half H.P Studio has produced, but it\'s bearable and if you\'re looking for an anime that doesn\'t have terrible or low quality art then Spiritpact has it.SOUND (5): The music and scores used throughout the anime aren\'t really standalone. I wouldn\'t find myself singing the opening or ending out at a night of karaoke or randomly when I feel in the mood to sing something. The sound doesn\'t have anything that really pulls at the viewers feelings or hypes them up for certain scenes. It just...exists. I will also admit that having a Chinese song for the opening was quite jarring as this is a Japanese anime and the subtitles lyrics are in Japanese. It was a little weird for me to hear the Chinese pronunciation of the lyrics as I was reading them in Japanese.CHARACTER (1): Where do I even begin? The characters of Spiritpact are a bunch of the most easily forgettable characters I have ever encountered. The main characters don\'t have anything redeemable about them, they\'re trapped in the tropes they are given and don\'t seem to make any attempts to break out of them.Keika You is characterized as this sort of underdog that we all want to cheer on...but...after a few episodes I came to be really annoyed by his character. He was too pitiful, there were more times than I can count in the anime that he spent lamenting about his situation and waiting for someone else to save him than him taking actions into his own hands. He\'s also given the same old boring troupe of never being in a relationship, but yet hounding after women to the point that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and becomes annoying.Ki Tonmoku is the stereotypical ""hot bishounen character with a tragic backstory that we have to wait until close to the ending of the series to unlock."" Throughout the few episodes I\'ve seen, he repeatedly comes across as cold, and nonchalant towards the people that are involved with his life, yet is hailed as a powerful character with thousands of people around him attracted to him in some capacity that leaves you wondering: ""why?"" at several points. He feels like a rehash of so many of the same type of characters that you just shrug your shoulders and accept begrudgingly that he\'s on your screen.The rest of the characters are quiet forgettable, to the point that even after 10 minutes of watching all available episodes I could barely correctly name any other characters besides the main two...barely.ENJOYMENT (2): Honestly, I\'ve encountered series that were better than this and had the same sort of genres. I\'ve considered and am still considering dropping this series as I haven\'t enjoyed a single episode that has come out so far. It feels like watching one episode only to move on to the next whilst having a faint idea of what you watched in the previous episode.OVERALL (2): There are far better anime out there that beat Spiritpact by a punch, especially if you\'re looking for a shounen ai and supernatural anime. Spiritpact doesn\'t have anything that sets it apart or makes it stand alone compared to the magnitude of other supernatural/shounen ai anime that exist. The story is decent, the art is ok, the characters are bland.

It won\'t fly high if you hold it too tightly. Loosen your grip too much and it falls, and when you pull strongly on a kite flying high in the sky, the string will snap and it will never come back.""I wish I could like this anime. I wish I could write nothing but good things about it, especially since it seems to have a cult following with fans. But I can\'t.I\'ll start with the most glaring issue - This doesn\'t feel like Shounen Ai. This feels like queer baiting...and people clutching at straws. This was produced in China, which you probably know has a strict censorship law over gay relationships being shown in the media. I believe this show only got away with what it did show because its producers were Tencent - a very well-known Chinese conglomerate. But even they had their limits.Let me start by saying every kiss in this has a purpose. Much like Mahou Sensei Negima!? and Yamada-kun and the seven witches. Each kiss is an ""exchange of energy"" or forming a contract between the two characters. There is never any mention of love and each kiss has a clear purpose to it.Which is fine. We\'re watching Shounen Ai, not smut, right? But that\'s where it falls apart. The characters are unlikeable and never really develop from their initial introductions in season 1, and therefore their emotions never really develop. They\'re never shown to love each other beyond this sould connection, and it\'s never even explained why Ki makes the connection with Keika in the first place. ~Sure~, we\'re given backstory and how they\'re fated, but Ki doesn\'t know this at the time he makes the pact and he never shares this information with Keika.And sadly, there is no season 3, so we can expect to never know past the webtoon as this anime has been cancelled. If there was a season 3 - I might\'ve spared this anime such a harsh review, but the entire plot was just all over the place. There was no pacing, scenes felt awkward, places that were supposed to make you cry just left me sighing and wishing I could fast forward to the resolutions. I couldn\'t connect with these characters or their emotions, and the emotions felt by most of them seemed flimsy at best - or had overarching, massive conversations and conflicts between them go unspoken or even straight up forgotten about and ignored.So I couldn\'t even go ""at least this is a good anime, even if there\'s not any real romance."" Because there wasn\'t any real plot, and any plot was quickly abandoned for the new, shiny plot line they decided was better the next episode. In fact, 5 episodes in the second series were dedicated purely to a flashback between a character introduced 4 episodes into the season within these flashbacks. And the 5 episodes weren\'t even needed - it was two perspectives of the same events, and by the second run-through, I really didn\'t care anymore.I think a portion of this criticism can also be attributed to the Japanese dub. They tried to match the lip animation to what the original Chinese dub said, but Chinese is incredibly fast compared to English and Japanese, and I feel like a lot of what was ~supposed~ to be said was lost in translation and lost it\'s impact. Instead, scenes flew by unnecessarily fast, littered with sentences and statements that made me go, ""uhh, and?"" where I\'m sure they were supposed to shock you and add tension.I was going to let this all slide, because ""at least the art is good"" but it\'s very sloppy in some frames and scenes, and for some reason, Keika\'s eyes are retconned and made purple in the second series instead of yellow. Which really doesn\'t help when Ki and Shouken also both have purple eyes, so every important character just looked the same in the flashback scenes. I wouldn\'t have cared if they\'d even explained it. But there\'s zero explanation, and Keika\'s eyes are purple in flashback scenes, so the fan theory that they ""changed when he got closer to his ancestor\'s power level"" is redundant because he has them as a child.I feel like this entire show was trying to do too many things at once, and spread itself too thin as a result. It prolongued the scenes it should\'ve shortened and missed the big picture involving the things it should\'ve prolongued instead.I can\'t hate it. It has guys kissing in a CHINESE piece of media. That\'s nigh impossible to achieve ordinarily and I\'m certain Tencent\'s production was the only reason this was given a second series. It\'s paving the way for more acceptance in a culture that desperately needs it. And it wasn\'t a horrific anime. There was semblance of a plot here, and it tried. It just didn\'t try very hard. and people clutching at straws. This was produced in China, which you probably know has a strict censorship law over gay relationships being shown in the media.

"", 'This 10-episode shounen-ai anime is the Japanese edit and dub of the Chinese anime Ling Qi (Soul Contract).In it, a young You Keika is living in poverty as a fortune-teller when he is hit by a bus and killed. In death, he chooses to become contracted to the human demon-hunter Tanmoku Ki as his spirit shadow, a partner to protect Tanmoku and give him strength. Unbeknownst to both of them, they are connected more deeply than they realized. Along with Tanmoku’s ignored fiancée Shin Shiyou, the three team up to uncover the sinister plot going on at Tanmoku’s family home.The anime packs a...lot into its 10 episodes with lots of supernatural hurt/comfort elements and a gentle shounen-ai between You and Tanmoku, with some humor and very pretty art and character designs as well.While the supernatural elements are a bit stereotypical and aren’t explained well, and the characterizations are a bit one-note, it’s interesting to see the different motivations of the characters, particularly the “evil” ones who are all vying for power behind the scenes and constantly testing Tanmoku and You’s relationship.Tanmoku is difficult to read as a typical tsundere, but You makes for an appealing lead with his innocence and occasional frustration with his situation.

She seems to have more meaningful interactions with You than with her fiancée.Where the anime really shines, though, is in the evolving relationship and powerplays between Tanmoku and You. The two have great chemistry, the light fan-service moments are fun, and it’s wonderful to see how they slowly get to know one another and how they react to seeing each other in danger.

Would love to see more!', ""At first I'm just going to give this show a standard 7 but after considering other important aspects and comparing it to other good anime, I decided to lower the score to 5.Plot: 4/10I like the spirit-master relationship. The power portrays at the beginning of the story got me excited and anticipated for more. However, as I watched episode by episode, it did not meet my expectation. There are parts of the plot that are predictable. The flow of the story for the first few chapters are too fast paced, deducting the realistic point of this story. The way the characters respond to certain...situation seems unnatural. There are plot holes especially regarding the first line of Tomanku and his spirit servant. I wish to know about them better. The last few episodes of this anime are very slow paced to the point I think it was a waste of episodes.Characters: 4/10You Keika- I'm just gonna say that I am flat out disappointed with this character. I'm expecting his powers to be much more impressive that what was portrayed in the last few episodes. He was supposed to be a powerful spirit, matching his master's, Ki, powerful spiritual energy. However, in most of the episodes, it was him being protected by Ki when in reality it was You Keika's job to protect his master. He is funny, that's the only positive point I see in this character.Tanmoku Ki- This character is your typically cold but kind hearted, powerful and respected by all character. He's nothing special really.Over all: 5/10This anime is definitely not the best anime I have ever watched. It's mediocre, fits your typical anime mold. The only wow element of this anime is the hint of Shonen-Ai in this anime which I definitely enjoy. Perhaps, those who are new to anime would enjoy and appreciate this anime better than I do. situation seems unnatural. There are plot holes especially regarding the first line of Tomanku and his spirit servant. I wish to know about them better. The last few episodes of this anime are very slow paced to the point I think it was a waste of episodes.Characters: 4/10You Keika- I'm just gonna say that I am flat out disappointed with this character. I'm expecting his powers to be much more impressive that what was portrayed in the last few episodes. He was supposed to be a powerful spirit, matching his master's, Ki, powerful spiritual energy. However, in most of the episodes, it was him being protected by Ki when in reality it was You Keika's job to protect his master. He is funny, that's the only positive point I see in this character.Tanmoku Ki- This character is your typically cold but kind hearted, powerful and respected by all character. He's nothing special really.Over all: 5/10This anime is definitely not the best anime I have ever watched. It's mediocre, fits your typical anime mold.

Perhaps, those who are new to anime would enjoy and appreciate this anime better than I do."", ""This series is all over the place.My first thought after finishing this Anime was exactly that.Don't guess though, I love this Anime despite all the chaotic flaws it presented me.Ling Qi began fairly simple:Two interesting characters have an encounter and thus their story begins. One of them dies in an accident and thus becomes the other one's Soul Contract / Partner.These are supposed to aid their contractor in their battles against evil spirits.Up to this point everything seemed fairly okay.However, following 20 Episodes (China dub) (10 on Jap Dub), this anime goes all over the place, really.It jumps from one setup to...another and confuses you in it's purpose. From the get go, you might think it's purpose is for the two of them to fight together against evil Spirits.. But that's not really what they do.You might get confused and lost because you don't know where this anime is going, what it is trying to show or tell. It has no absolute and clear aim.It is confusing, and to my end it was even a bit frustrating and annoying.. But, nonetheless, it's positive traits kept me captivated, so let's get to them.Their characters are simply charming, both have faults and virtues and their development is actually nice to look at, considering the small amount of time this anime covered. You will find yourself charmed and mesmerized by their strange bond and loyalty.This series is strongly focused on the two maincharacters and their unique... bond. However, any other character merely serves it's purpose to help develop that bond/give backstory or whatever you need to make an anime interesting at all.The atmosphere is.. fresh. I like the art style, as it is both soft and comfortable to look at, yet typical anime. You have the cool guy, the cute guy. They complement each other and both benefit nicely from this artstyle. It's not unique, not too much, and fitting it's supernatural theme.Although Evil Spirits seem a bit lackluster. The whole appereance of the anime, the whole setting and picture of the anime is underlined an emphasized by fitting soundtracks. They provide another layer of immersion and do their job properly. It's nothing outrageous, but it's neatly done nonetheless.I recommend watching this anime if you are a fan of shounen ai/yaoi, as you are the most likely to love this anime. Anyone looking for something with good fights or awesome characters will have their fair share... but it's not what makes this anime fun to watch.I did not think this anime was mainly focused on Shounen Ai, but reversely it's most fitting for those who like to watch this genre.Thank you for reading, have fun watching. :) another and confuses you in it's purpose.

I enjoyed it. It moved me in a way not many have. I have never felt such bliss from anything this precious, nor been swayed to tears...so easily. However, I also was confused as to who was involved with who, and what schemes had been set, for the first eight episodes I mean. The last couple cleared everything up. If queerbaiting is an issue to you, so be it. I like the mystery. All in all, story gets a 7/10.Okay. I have never seen a Chinese anime before, so the scenery was a nice change of pace. The attention to detail, both in the architecture, and flashbacks, is phenomenal. Each character (excluding Jiun and the Shito lady) each had a unique appearance that set them apart from everyone else on the show. While not every character is wholly original in the looks department, it still helps the anime to be more rounded with the cast, and I 100% would love to cosplay as Huayu Yin/ Kau(the leaf girl) if given the chance! The rain always gives it a nice touch (sorry, biased?) and the props had some time to detail as well. Shading, top notch in most scenes as well. Art gets an 8/10.Sound sets the tone, and Ling Qi's soundtrack spares no one. Episode 5 in particular was the high for me, what with the soul contract, and episode 6 showing a moment of weakness. Or maybe I am talking about the 10 episode TV show where it patches two episodes into one? Probably that. Action scenes with intense music, touching scenes with more delicate ambiance, and the voice actors almost take the cake. Maybe it's the Japanese dub to blame, but from the tone of voice, I didn't hear such raw emotion that I expected the scene to bring to the table. This was especially apparent in the scenes Ki's fiancee was furious with Keika, as I thought she sounded mildly perturbed, rather than seething with rage at the fact he chose Keika over her. Sound gets a 7/10 from me.Character... Keika is the one I see the most growth from, but that is understandable considering he can't take his money with him to the afterlife. He starts off as materialistic as a human could be, maybe even more. Over time, he starts to lose the sentiment he once held for such things, and eventually, choosing Ki over all else. I wouldn't say he is completely changed, but I see a new passion inside him he never quite had before. I can relate to Shiyou way better though, but I have my anger under control, I promise. :) While she is definitely jealous of Keika, she learns to care for his safety despite Ki's favoritism towards him. She eventually accepts the anger she is ashamed of, and shows initiative in troubling times. I feel like Ki has more time to grow in the following season, and I might review that too (but no promises). I was unclear of Yinzhe/Intetsu's intentions for the longest time, but in the end, he is just a strict teacher after all. I kind of wish I didn't hate him so much before. I also desire to learn of the others in time. I guess I just was not satisfied. For season 1, I give Character a 6/10.Now, watching this was the best Sunday afternoon I've had in awhile. It may even rival Gunslinger Girl's enjoyment level (unbeknownst to you as of yet). There was never a dull moment for me. I said before that episode 5 was a high for me, but I feel that episode 9 is to be my favorite. Enjoyment is a 9/10 for me.The characters are enjoyable, the story is wholesome and somewhat original, the setting was a nice change from the modern school anime, a memorable ending theme, and an enjoyable tale that touched my heart on more than one occasion.

There is barely any depth to the characters, there's no real story, and it doesn't have any other redeeming qualities. The art isn't horrible, but it's definitely not above average. The opening as well isn't that good. It's boring, I watched it recently yet I can barely remember what happened. And if you were going to watch it for the shounen ai tag, then you'll be disappointed to know that there's little to no romance.However, I would say it's worth watching only because I really like season 2.

The scandal, the delicious scandal of it all!! I can\'t wait for season 2.', 'This review is based off the Chinese version, because the Japanese version of the show combines 2 episodes into 1 episode, making it very rushed and cutting scenes out. I tried to watch the JP version, but it doesn\'t really feel the same as all of the cultural references made in the OG Chinese version. The plot has potential to be good, but the execution of it really fell flat with me. Not sure if it\'s because each episode was only 15 mins long, but it really deserved more time on screen. Although I suppose that may be an issue with budgeting.STORY: 6/10 -...Could be better execution from the directing side, but again, budgeting issue I guess because season 2 is LOADS better in terms of storytelling and art even though it\'s the same guy directing the show. Most dialogues and events felt rushed and I got confused with how fast paced it was going.ART: 7/10 - I love chibis. They\'re cute, but the art isn\'t anything that\'s too consistent with frames missing.SOUND: 9/10 - THE CHINESE OPENING IS A BANGER SOUNDTRACK. I LOVE IT. I HAVE IT ON REPEAT. IT IS POPPIN. IT IS SO CATCHY. You\'ll come to understand that it describes Jinghua and Duanmu Xi\'s relationship quite well. On another note, the ending theme is nice and soothing, also another one of my favourites from this show. Battle theme 2 is also very hype with the rapping in the background.CHARACTER: 7/10 - Bruh everything was so rushed that it felt forced in the show. Couldn\'t find an attachment to the characters until ~season 2~, but that\'s excluded from this review. Jinghua is a bundle of joy and makes so many cultural references. I love his energy. Can\'t say much for Duanmu Xi though, since he\'s your typical stoic, mysterious MC (TBC in Season 2 hahaha). The side characters are shallow at most without much screen time, and Qin Siyao is just cast aside as a third wheeler for the majority of the show. With that said, I couldn\'t feel much of Jinghua and Duanmu Xi\'s bond. Their motivations are skimmed over real quick. Heck, I have more interest in Luoyue and YangNing\'s past instead. So. Many. Unanswered. Questions.ENJOYMENT: 8/10 - Despite all the issues with animation, quality, storytelling, this was honestly so FUNNY. The comedy is great. Random insertion of various languages in Korean, Japanese, English, LOL references, Song Joong Ki, crossovers from other donghua like Fox Spirit Matchmaker, and our favourite quote ""YOU CAN YOU UP. NO BB"". Serious. This gets better. The minor fanservice we get is nice too. Like, literally this series has KISS scenes! It\'s a donghua too! Absolutely wild to see how loose the censorship laws back then when it came to media. RIP. Maybe that\'s also why season 3 is bust.OVERALL: 7/10. I would just watch the show if you enjoy the comedy aspect. I recommend the Chinese version if you can still find it, despite how obscure it is. The drama gets touched upon briefly and continues in season 2. Or if you enjoy BL/Danmei, you may or may not like it. They kinda remind me of Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji with their own twist.

Ni Tian Zhizun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49448/Ni_Tian_Zhizun,"['Against the Sky Supreme S1 Recap (Spoilers)Tan Yun was a god (they are called sky supreme in this series) that protected the inner universe from demons with his comrades. Unfortunately, few of his comrades betrayed him and colluded with the demons by setting them free in the inner universe and killing Tan Yun forcing him to reincarnate into his past self to exact revenge. Tang Yun has long been regarded as a trash or useless person in the Tan family which supposedly led to his family\'s downfall. However, with the knowledge of his past, Tan Yun prevents an assassination attempt on his parents with poison...wine, cultivates and then slaughters the Wang and Liu families when they return a month later after Tan Yun\'s protection time is over. (the Liu and Wang family are two of the major families in Wangyue City) After this, Tan Yun decides to go to the Sacred Sect - an ancient sect with powerful backing - to gather information from his Wang and Liu family disciples. On the way, Tan casually slaughters the Mayor of Wangyue city\'s son and is crushed by a rock from his senior disciple, cultivates to Stage 1 level 9 and slaughters literally all the enemies chasing him, and has an affair with his wife-to-be.Story: 7/10Against the Sky Supreme is an ambitious cultivation donghua that ticks a lot of boxes that many other series are missing. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve seen a competent, logical main character that doesn\'t leave traces behind. Throughout the story, Tan Yun is tempted to forgive his pursuers and time again we see him mercilessly kill them for revenge. In the first 7 episodes alone, he manages to kill two major family patriarchs and their families without a second thought and instead of waiting in Wangyue City for the powerful disciples to fight him, he goes into the Sect and cleans them up. The story is straight to the point and rational as expected of the decisions of a fallen god.Art & Sound: 6/10The art style and animation quality is pretty similar to your average donghua released in 2020/2021. They lack crowd control abilities and tend to use wide shots in fight scenes which show a lot of empty space or 4-5 characters in a single scene. I look forward to when crowd control animation isn\'t a problem so we can see crowd density which is lacking in many other Chinese CGI donghua.Sound is pretty average.Character: 6/10Tan Yun is too overpowered and it makes sense. As a fallen god, this series doesn\'t hide his abilities or boast it either; He reserves it for when he needs to fight against pursuers or people in his way of revenge. The character love interest is very controversial, Tan Yun went from wanting to politically marry into the Liu family to wanting to marry his mother\'s adopted daughter and finally wanting to marry his senior disciple. It makes sense since his memory from the event was wiped out but still highly controversial which other Chinese series don\'t really explore.The cultivation levels are unorthodox, it might just be translation but the cultivation level starts at Fetus spirit Level 1 - 9, then Fetus Soul Level 1 - 9. The spirit beasts also follow a similar cultivation level and Tan Yun\'s mount has an even more unorthodox ""2nd stage adult phase"" cultivation level system. It expects us to understand the hierarchy of cultivation levels from episode 1.Overall: 7/10I\'ve got to keep an eye on this, not much plot has been revealed to us yet. I presume the series has 3 main arcs in the 60 episodes: The Liu & Wang Family destruction, The Sacred Sect Entry Exam & Life in the Sacred Sect and the Meteor Valley arc. If you haven\'t seen this, it definitely deserves a watch since MC doesn\'t dwell on small fry characters. wine, cultivates and then slaughters the Wang and Liu families when they return a month later after Tan Yun\'s protection time is over. (the Liu and Wang family are two of the major families in Wangyue City) After this, Tan Yun decides to go to the Sacred Sect - an ancient sect with powerful backing - to gather information from his Wang and Liu family disciples. On the way, Tan casually slaughters the Mayor of Wangyue city\'s son and is crushed by a rock from his senior disciple, cultivates to Stage 1 level 9 and slaughters literally all the enemies chasing him, and has an affair with his wife-to-be.Story: 7/10Against the Sky Supreme is an ambitious cultivation donghua that ticks a lot of boxes that many other series are missing. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve seen a competent, logical main character that doesn\'t leave traces behind. Throughout the story, Tan Yun is tempted to forgive his pursuers and time again we see him mercilessly kill them for revenge. In the first 7 episodes alone, he manages to kill two major family patriarchs and their families without a second thought and instead of waiting in Wangyue City for the powerful disciples to fight him, he goes into the Sect and cleans them up. The story is straight to the point and rational as expected of the decisions of a fallen god.Art & Sound: 6/10The art style and animation quality is pretty similar to your average donghua released in 2020/2021. They lack crowd control abilities and tend to use wide shots in fight scenes which show a lot of empty space or 4-5 characters in a single scene. I look forward to when crowd control animation isn\'t a problem so we can see crowd density which is lacking in many other Chinese CGI donghua.Sound is pretty average.Character: 6/10Tan Yun is too overpowered and it makes sense. As a fallen god, this series doesn\'t hide his abilities or boast it either; He reserves it for when he needs to fight against pursuers or people in his way of revenge. The character love interest is very controversial, Tan Yun went from wanting to politically marry into the Liu family to wanting to marry his mother\'s adopted daughter and finally wanting to marry his senior disciple. It makes sense since his memory from the event was wiped out but still highly controversial which other Chinese series don\'t really explore.The cultivation levels are unorthodox, it might just be translation but the cultivation level starts at Fetus spirit Level 1 - 9, then Fetus Soul Level 1 - 9. The spirit beasts also follow a similar cultivation level and Tan Yun\'s mount has an even more unorthodox ""2nd stage adult phase"" cultivation level system. It expects us to understand the hierarchy of cultivation levels from episode 1.Overall: 7/10I\'ve got to keep an eye on this, not much plot has been revealed to us yet. I presume the series has 3 main arcs in the 60 episodes: The Liu & Wang Family destruction, The Sacred Sect Entry Exam & Life in the Sacred Sect and the Meteor Valley arc. If you haven\'t seen this, it definitely deserves a watch since MC doesn\'t dwell on small fry characters.', ""At the begging:it was good until i got up to like around eps 155-164 because it was pushing my boundaries of acceptance our MC is basically over 1000 years old guys i just realized that this MC might be a pedophile. wait comes to think about it all his so call women have been with him since their teenage years don't you think this will fall under grooming? furthermore, i wouldn't have a problem if he ended up back with his first wife in his first life because they are at the same age. idk anymore this isn't for me i'm dropping this cause like...i said this is so not for me.

Ojamajo Doremi Sharp Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2947/Ojamajo_Doremi_Sharp_Movie,"[""Story [7.0]The story is a bit of a disappointment. Of course, this is just short of 30 minutes, so everything has to wrap up in that time. However, I felt that it could have been extended longer, mostly in the flower-caused mischief. It could have started to be small things and escalate to much serious things, but it wasn't meant to be. The best was arguably the moments that Doremi and Pop spent together and things are revealed about the main character of the series. However, before you know it, you're at the end, which is rather predictable but still has a few hidden things...that may require a second look. In short, okay story but had the potential to become extended and deeper.Art [8.75]The art is pretty much the same that you would see on the TV series, except for a smoother frame rate that are typical of animated feature films. However, these moments are not constant, but it was a treat to see them when they appeared. [UPDATE] Apparently, my computer has fixed the video to its original widescreen format, so I bumped up the score just for that.Sound [7.0]Copy + paste from the show, but the ending song had a Latin vibe (like the OP), so I enjoyed it.Character [6.5]The focus on the movie was on the two sisters, so they were pretty much the characters. Everyone else is just...the same from the show. It was very nice to see the oft-quarreling siblings have a nice talk (and revealing interesting secrets) and looking out for each other...but how long will it last?Enjoyment [6.5]If you watch the series, you'll like it, but probably not more than the show. If not, you're going to pass it.Overall [7.0]An okay attempt but it feels like it should have had more involvement in the story and characters.

It very much feels like a missing episode also because of it´s length (27 minutes). The story is mainly focused on the character of Pop but we also get a look into Doremi´s character and a nice moment between the two sisters. Because it´s a movie the animation qualitity is higher compared to the animation in the show and it looks very nice.In Conclusion:Tecnically it´s...not necessary to watch the movie to enjoy the show but if you are a fan of the characters (like me) then I recommend to watch it. not necessary to watch the movie to enjoy the show but if you are a fan of the characters (like me) then I recommend to watch it.', ""Ojamajo Doremi Sharp Movie is a great supplement to the main series. Themes the main season supports (such as flowers and caring for others) are still present while Hana takes a back seat in focus; this allows the film to appropriately focus on Doremi and Pop's relationship. Up until now, the viewer has seen a bit of their relationship. Such as the facts that they're caring sisters who argue; however, I'd argue the movie goes into depth about their relationship the best, seeing as it's centered around a fight which reveals many insights about Doremi. Pop was also sympathized as the focus and we saw...her perspective for a change, which was a great way to not let her be overshadowed by the other main characters. I believe the Witch Heart Flower worked very well as a plot element; it could be seen as a comparison for maturity and innocence, which may occasionally fade but can be restored by remembering precious things. It's also a great reminder of how easy it is to accidentally hurt others feelings, coming from both sides of the argument. While I can't condone the characters' actions in the story, I do believe they acted realistically for their ages and had a true bonding moment, which are very rare. It's telling that Doremi, usually played as the light-hearted or nonchalant friend member, was the one who lost her patience with Pop, and reveals that despite her apparently casual attitude, she still cares greatly for her sister. The ending of the movie unfortunately raised a few questions; for instance, if the Queen knew about the Witch Heart Flowers. If so, why would she leave them unguarded to where Hana and Pop could simply pick one? Furthermore, why did she seem to be awaiting its return? Why does the Queen have an entire garden of such seemingly dangerous flowers? If she didn't know, then why was she looking at the flowers? I'd like to give the movie an 8/10 for its great morals and above-average animation (for the main series' standards). her perspective for a change, which was a great way to not let her be overshadowed by the other main characters.

Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3467/Nogizaka_Haruka_no_Himitsu,"['Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is the most fun and just plain entertaining series I have watched this year.  I don’t like to throw out 10s to shows that often and maybe I am rating this show a little high in comparison others.  But this is one of the few shows that had me from episode 1 and never let me down through the end. While the overall concept of this anime is not anything new and groundbreaking (though really what is anymore?), Nogizaka does everything exceptionally well.At its heart, Nogizaka is a romantic comedy with some mild echiiness and a few harem elements....The story starts out with our protagonist Yuuto accidentally discovering the schools most idolized girl Haruka Nogizaka is a closet otaku when he bumps into her in the library with a manga called Innocent Smile.  After a bit of an overreaction on Haruka\'s part, Yuuta promises to keep her secret from everyone else.  Personally I thought this was an excellent concept for a story but in one of the few things that this series fails at a bit because it doesn’t quite deliver.  By episode 3 she’s already exposed her secret at school herself, but there doesn’t seem to be any consequences or reaction to this revelation.  The romance elements then take over as the story becomes more about Yuuto and Haruka developing their feelings for each other than her secret obsession.The series also features a number of anime and manga references, mostly to Shakugan no Shana.  If you have seen that series and especially if you’re a fan like I am you will get some extra enjoyment out of Haruka cosplaying Shana.  One of my favorite moments was Haruka saying Shana\'s trademark ""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"" and replying that she had always wanted to say it (Haruka\'s voice actress played Hecate in the series).  Plenty of other references provided a lot of laughs such as a yaoi doujinshi featuring Inukami! characters Keita and Karina.  I also found the cameo by manga loving Japanese prime minister Taro Aso humorous.As leads, Haruka and Yuuto are very enjoyable and fun to watch.  Yuuto reminds me of other anime males I like such as Tomoya and Yuichi from Clannad and Kanon.  He feels like a real guy to me, he isn’t perfect but he stands up for his friends and acts like a man.  One of the few anime males I would actually want to date myself.  Haruka is a bit more stereotypical of anime girls, she is very beautiful and seemingly unattainable on the surface.  She’s shy, clumsy, clueless, and very moe.  Despite this, I don’t think anyone will not find something to relate with her and she is just so funny and cute that you can’t help but love her.  Several of the supporting characters manage to be entertaining as well, in particular Haruka\'s younger sister Mika.  Though she is the most stereotypical of the group as the perverted wise above her years younger sister.  The Nogizaka house maids also provide a number of laughs as do the mother and father.  Yuuto\'s sister and her teacher friend are pretty boring though as they are the fairly boring half naked drunkards.  Shiina is a classmate who could be considered a rival for Yuuto but she never develops as a serious contender (rightly so I must say).  The characters are also kept to a minimum as well so we get to know most of the supporting characters pretty well.The show really shines in the art and music.  The characters are beautifully rendered and the series as wonderfully vibrant colors and detailed backgrounds.  The voice acting is stellar and features a great overall cast.  I can’t say enough good things about the music.  It captured the charm and the tone of the series perfectly.  The OP/EN songs as a pair are probably my favorite anime songs to date.Overall there is little for me to complain about, because I found this show to be exceptional.  The length was a bummer because I didn’t want it to end!  While not everyone will find this show to be as great as I did,  I recommend it to all fans of romantic comedies and Shana lovers.

This anime doesn’t offer anything remarkably different to your average Rom/Com; however it certainly has a refreshing feel to it.Yuuto Ayase is a fairly normal guy and Haruka Nogizaka is the school idol but their separate lives soon intertwine when Yuuto discovers Haruka’s secret hobby (Anime). Hardcore anime fans may enjoy the concept because it’s easy to relate to the stigma that may comes along with being an ‘open anime fan’, even though it does go a bit overboard. Though...what makes this anime worth watching is the sweet romance that develops. The story moves at a steady pace, dealing with one issue at a time however the problem with this is that the episodes feel very disjointed, as there’s no real flow between one episode and the next. Also once the major issue about Haruka is resolved, this ends up becoming yet another typical romance anime.Like in most romance anime, this one centres on the characters in the main relationship. Well unlike most protagonists in these kinds of Rom/Coms, Yuuto is quite the appealing guy and acts how a guy is supposed to be and is a welcome change from all the spineless loser-kuns. Then there’s the main attraction, Haruka who is seemingly perfect and has a cute timid personality, however she also comes with her own problems. The supporting characters do an alright job providing some comedy, but can be a real nuisance when it comes to the story.Just from looking at this series’ picture, anime fans can expect this anime to go for animation and music that we are used to. The art style is very typical for this type of anime, with very simple big-eyed character designs but the way it is animated is certainly better than some similar looking anime (Myself; Yourself, H20, etc.). On the other hand this series doesn’t perform too well in the sound department. The music is subpar and can easily go unnoticed during the non-dramatic scenes and the only thing that helps to bring it to a satisfactory level has to be the great voice actors (Mamiko Noto, banzai! ^^)Overall Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is one of the decent Rom/Com of its season, though I feel that there can be an unnecessary amount of fanservice (i.e. pantyshots). The comedy is okay, especially on the rare occasions that it includes some obvious anime references but it does get stale after a while.

ZONG! And now, ladies and germs, the actual review:Actually, I wouldn't argue that the problem with this show is that it's a substance-less, extra generous heaping of Otaku wish fulfillment as some claim, because let's face it, KissxSis and Chocotto Sister REALLY have no critical quality to them, and instead only show me just what I want to see, and yet I'm still entertained by them. No, instead, I find that there are three major problems that...cause Himitsu to fall short of it's potential.The first is that for an Otaku-centric comedy, Himitsu feels as though it were written by a non-Otaku. While many of the stereotypes and experiences that we have all become accustomed to through real life and other shows are present, they lack the personality that shows such as Genshiken capitalize on. For example, in Hayate no Gotoku, there's an extremely short scene (Not but a single panel in the Manga) in which Nagi exits the room in order to watch an anime DVD boxset she purchased on a whim. Every fan can relate to the scenario of buying (Or downloading) anime which we have never heard of, simply for the sake of owning it, or because the cover art looked cool. You can also take Genshiken, and the strained relations between the Otaku characters and the &quot;Normal&quot; characters. Undoubtably each viewer has had an experience of their own with someone who was less than accepting of their hobby. Through these shared experiences, the watcher relates the characters, and connects to them. However all of Haruka's adventures feel as though they went through a game of Bohemian Telephone before they were scripted into the show. Oh sure, all the major hallmarks of an Otaku life are there (Comiket, cosplaying, Akihabara, figurine obsession), but the personality and small details have been lost in the process. This lack of a personal touch makes the series seem like a second hand story, as though the author had heard about such experiences from a friend.The next aspect holding the show back was that the secondary characters are better developed than the main characters. Yuuto, for example, is a total blank slate. While I understand that often lead male characters in such series are made bland so that the watcher can impose their own personalities on the the character, Yuuto has absolutely no personality at all. The only noticeable aspect of his personality is that he seems to mildly care about Haruka. Haruka herself, claims to be an Otaku, but shows a forced interest in everything Otaku related. Her character is just an amalgamation of various &quot;Moe&quot; characteristics, without any new flavoring. At the same time, the trio of Haruka's little sister Mika, and the family maids provided more entertainment and laughs than the rest of the characters combined. They were fresh and original, and quite entertaining to watch. However, this trio was given far less airtime than they deserved, and instead the focus of the series lied with the blander characters. Obviously it would have been absurd if these bit characters became the focus of the series, however I just wish that the same amount of love and dedication went into formulating the other characters.At the same time that this show tries to be an Otaku-centric comedy, it also plays up romantic elements, which I have no problem with. My troubles however, lie with the fact that neither party seems to make any real effort at making the other like them. This may be due in part to the fact that for half of the show Haruka shows a mild, dispassionate interest in Yuuto, while the other half of the time she seems totally unaware that there are two genders.In closing, while this series did provide me with a little fun, at best it was disposable entertainment, not to be remembered after it's 8 month relevancy.One more thing: For an Otaku-centric comedy, I only picked up on like three references (The blatant Shana one from the Hazuki episode, the Doujin that they buy at Comiket was drawn by the person who illustrated the original Light Novels, and the person who voice Gento voiced Gendou from Evangelion, if that even is a reference.).

There...are also some harem elements, but they don't overshadow the main relationship. The show does contain some ecchi-ness, but it's not constant enough to be much of a problem. The show generally moves along at a swift pace, and manages to get quite a bit done in each episode, but it doesn't feel rushed.There are a fair few characters, though quite a few get swept aside before becoming anything more than a couple of lines of dialogue. The regulars are familiar sorts, including the loud drunks, and the teasing, adult-minded loli.So yes, it has all the typical elements, but, I often got the feeling that something was different. I don't know for sure, but perhaps the show is focusing that bit more on the central relationship than is usual. Sure, there's a lot of noise, and silliness, but it just doesn't seem to be as overpowering as other shows, leaving more room for the main attraction.So, the final verdict: Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, is a nice, typical, romantic comedy, that just nudges ahead of the pack, thanks to being just a little bit calmer, and more focused. Also, it differentiates itself somewhat via the otaku angle. If you're a fan of high-school romantic comedies, then this is definately worth a look. are also some harem elements, but they don't overshadow the main relationship.

Therefore, whoever though of making a series where a classy, rich girl loved by all is actually an otaku in secret was a genius.This is where Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu really flourishes in its delivery. The story, focusing on Haruka\'s love of anime, manga, and otaku culture is not merely another ""girl likes anime"" series, but rather a...tale of otaku empowerment. The series demonstrates the societal taboo by immersing ""normal"" people into Haruka\'s hobby, thus creating a window that gives the potential to both celebrate and/or villify the various extensions of the culture, which allows for many poignant moments in coming to understand why Haruka likes anime and manga, and why the taboo against anime fans is so unjust.Outside of the titular ""himitsu"", the series is a fairly average romance between the two leads. Misunderstandings happen, obstacles occur in predictable ways, but what keeps it moving is its incredibly likeable cast. You might think for a series where a guy and a girl are trying to get together there might be loads of rivals on both sides, but Haruka plays it surprisingly upbeat in that just about everyone in the main cast wants Haruka and Yuuto to be together and help them out with whatever trials come their way. This refreshing viewpoint really makes for a much more enjoyable cast where characters aren\'t driven by their love interests and can thus be utilized in multiple different ways that focus on who these characters really are.The animation is gorgeous, coming from a very small but very underrated studio, Studio Barcelona (now Diomedia). The character designs are very cute, and the animation itself is smooth (especially in the ED sequence). Sound is kind of a moot point, because while all the characters sound great and have solid performances, the BGM is meh and the OP/ED songs are completely mediocre.Overall, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu was a welcome surprise in the latest flood of pro-otaku anime, taking a very hard look at the societal issues that being an anime fan consists of. It looks beautiful, sounds okay, and really sells itself not as just another otaku moe comedy, but as something with lasting value. Here\'s hoping the second season is more of the same.Overall, I give Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu an 8 out of 10. tale of otaku empowerment.

It starts out strong but by episode 6 or 7 the main reason for the story has been mostly wrapped up and the following episodes become an everyday romance story, except that even that is badly written.Art - 5The art is generic and bland, with very little to distinguish characters in this anime from characters in others.  It doesn't have any particular flair to it and doesn't grab your attention, but on the other hand, it is also not bad to...look at.  It's just... average.Sound - 4The OP and ED songs aren’t memorable or catchy at all, and have very little staying power.  They’re just... there, and that’s it.Character - 2The characters in this series are horrible.  In the first couple of episodes things seem as though they will be interesting, but as early as episode 4 things start getting hard to watch.  The main characters are extremely bland and their romance is more of the 'oh look, they're in love because the animators say so' rather than there being any real reason for them to be together other than the initial premise, and there is no chemistry between them.  This makes this series extremely hard to watch.  I found myself in the middle of episode 6, and having such a hard time watching the two mains that I closed the video and didn't watch it for a few days.  I found myself having to do the same thing for every episode after, because all of them had scenes that I found excruciatingly painful to watch.  There aren't really any redeeming characters in the series; they're all bland and hard to watch most of the time, making it extremely hard to sit through an episode, let alone this series.Enjoyment - 2As I stated in the above section, I had to spend days away from this anime to get the bad taste of certain scenes out of my mouth.  There were a few (make that very few) redeeming moments, but they were instantly washed away by the lack of good story, bland art and annoying characters, and there were nowhere near enough of them to make the series enjoyable.Overall - 3It's a bad anime, I didn't like it, and I honestly can't see why people would think it's good.  The romance is forced, as is the dialogue and situations, and it's got next to nothing in it that could redeem itself.

Don't expect any serious harems from NHnH.Story (8/10)The story for NHnH is very simplistic and very predictable. However, this is, rather than a disappointment, the best point in NHnH. From the beginning, we are told of the main character's (Nogizaka Haruka) secret. The series does not show any signs of surprising us or...portraying an impressive plot twist. It just piles up cute, predictable scenarios which you will find in any Romance Comedy Harem anime you've seen. surprisingly, this is not a turn-off, because it's portrayed in a very cute and romantic way which will make you blush at every scene, even if you already know exactly what is going to happen next. The only thing different in NHnH's story is the anime-lover(otaku) point of view. if you love animes, but are always made fun of by friends, you would be able to relate to this anime a lot.Art (7/10)The art for NHnH is also very simple and not so impressive. It does show brilliance in the variation of character designs, however, since we usually see the main characters in casual clothes rather than only school uniforms. It's also beautiful enough to make you blush, so it's not really so bad even though it looks plain.Sound (8/10)The OPED is not the most impressive I've seen, but it does its job in symbolizing the series. the bgms and effects are also quite plain.Well, to be honest, the main reason I watched NHnH is because of Nogizaka Haruka's Voice Actor(seiyuu), Noto Mamiko. For Noto fans, this series is absolutely a must watch. The other seiyuus also perform very well and fit their characters perfectly. so there's no complains about the sound, and plus Noto Mamiko, it's worth it.Character (8/10)There are quite a few unique characters in NHnH, but don't expect much character development from them. The standard harem characters are all there, but it's safe to say that, other than the two main leads, the others are all side characters. Well, thanks to that, the series focuses on how the main leads develop and grow in their relationship, and this is very nice to watch.Enjoyment (9/10) and Overall (7/10)As i will say for any series, enjoyment really depends on mood and expectations. If you want to enjoy NHnH to the fullest, remember that this is more to a slice of life anime, so watch it with a light heart and don't expect too much from it. If you do, I'm sure you will be laughing at the jokes before they even happen, and blushing as much as the characters are.On the other hand, this anime is definitely not recommended for critics and those who prefer more dramatic romances. This is the only reason I lowered the overall rating to 7 for the review. It's not really a series which everyone will enjoy. portraying an impressive plot twist.

It's not really a series which everyone will enjoy."", ""Story:  Not much to mention here, basically just your standard romance/comedy/harem kinda of plot, where one guy is surrounded by a bevy of perfect girls all vying for his attention.  I will mention though that while the basic plot is unremarkable, it doesn't become too cliche with too much fan service or ridiculous situations (there are some which stretch the imagination, but try watching say, Nagasarete Airantou, without wondering where reality went).  Anime's poking fun of otakus seems to be the &quot;new&quot; thing in anime recently, and Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu does it as well, but the series quickly abandons the whole...akiba-kei stigma thing for a more lighthearted depiction of otakus.Art: Characters and backgrounds are drawn with a lot of detail, but frankly are unremarkable.  This isn't because the art isn't any good, but rather because it seems like the quality of the artwork has improved drastically for most of the newer anime, so nothing really pops out (as opposed to say the backgrounds for Mahou no Tsukai ni Taisetsu no Koto ~Natsu no Sora~).  I haven't had a chance to compare the artwork from the anime and the manga; but overall, very decentSound:  I really have to give props to Haruka's seiyuu; it is kinda of refreshing to hear a different voice from the &quot;standard&quot; high-pitch female voice.  Haruka's pitch is considerably lower and mellower than most of the other girl's voices, and there this timbre that is a little gritty that I really like.  I think it also fits Haruka's personality perfectly.  Both the OP and ED are catchy, but I can't help but think that the ED is trying to emulate Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu's ending with the dancing bit.Character:  For once, a guy who is not a total loser.  It seems like one of the foundations of this genre is that the dude must be a complete and abject loser, probably to contrast the perfectness of the girls (I really hope its not to relate to the fanbase o.O) Yuuto is just a regular guy who is pretty compassionate, so its not impossible to see why the &quot;perfect&quot; girl (Haruka) would fall for him.  The other characters are also very developed; Mika's character in particular adds a lot of humor and a little bit of ecchi-ness.Enjoyment:  Heart-warming sums up this anime.  Unlike many anime's in this genre which are wholly forgettable, there is actual chemistry between the characters and while yes, there is a fair amount of the obligatory fan service, most of the story revolves the relationships between the characters.  I definitely will keep this anime and probably will watch it again.Overall:  Basically, this is kinda of a &quot;fluff&quot; anime in the best sense of the term; if you really like a deep story, go watch Ghost in the Shell or Evangelion; if you like harem anime, then go watch love hina or Goshuushou-sama Ninomiya-kun; but if you want to watch an anime which is predictably heart-warming and just plain fun to watch then I would recommend this anime. akiba-kei stigma thing for a more lighthearted depiction of otakus.Art: Characters and backgrounds are drawn with a lot of detail, but frankly are unremarkable.

If not the best, in the top 2-to-3. And here\'s why:Here I am, in America, thinking that anime, manga, etc. was watched on a nationwide scale, and didn\'t hold any social repercussions for doing so. Well, I might be wrong. Although I don\'t know the social acceptance or tolerance of the aforementioned hobbies, this show\'s culture of Japan looks down upon the hobby itself, as well as the people who enjoy that hobby. Now, like above, in actual, real-life Japan, the mood could be quite different from what\'s given to us in the show,...but this key change of normalcy in regards to the storyline had me reeling... in a good way.Now, if you\'ve seen this and have read the above paragraph, and thought to yourself, ""Well, it\'s the typical \'normal boy-meets-girl\'"", type of storyline. And to that I respond, yes; but how they get these isn\'t done through the overused plot we see so much in romantic animes. This one was different: they weren\'t childhood friends, (an encounter doesn\'t count! It had nothing to do with the progression of their relationship!) there wasn\'t an over-the-top ecchi moment in which they met, etc.In reference to story arcs, the main one created in the first episode encompasses, is referenced to, and plays into, if not all, but a vast majority of the 12 episodes. The longest separate arc I saw was 2-episodes-long, which involved the final 2 episodes of the series. The lasting affect is pleasant and you walk away from each episode feeling like the story progressed in one form or another; and that\'s what a story should do: move the characters, plot, time line, etc. FORWARD with each passing episode - if you don\'t, that\'s when the viewer becomes bored. I, for one, was never bored. 10/10.I want to take the art director out for a dinner and just smother him/her with gifts of gratitude. It was that good. Every character is so exquisitely drawn, especially Haruka. But where my complements will ultimately hang their hat on will be the portrayal of Yuuto.Too many times have we seen the hero in animes be drawn as frail, insignificant, and completely shy. We see characters drawn like this because the creators of the anime want to attract more male viewers who think, ""Hey! He\'s just like me!"" Well, I feel, probably for the first time, that they captured (more-or-less), an average, high school fella. One who isn\'t arrogant in his womanizing abilities, looks like he could bench 400 lbs., but a guy who isn\'t either TOO frail or TOO weak. They somehow found one of the best balances between the two I\'ve seen yet in a romance anime. 10/10.I really enjoyed the voice acting. If I had to give one of those big checks you see given out at golf tournaments to the voice actor of a character in this anime, I would somehow try to find a way to split it between Haruka\'s and Hazuki\'s voice actors, respectively. A job well done. 9/10.The characters are, and always should be (I don\'t know why some haven\'t realized this, yet), an anime\'s (and all forms of media, for that matter) strongest point; the most enjoyable aspect.Here, I found a show which is so enveloped, and literally hinges on the success of the characters. Whether that be due to the fact that the show only lasts for 12 episodes may be a relevant factor, but who cares; it passes with flying colors.Each character falls into a relative category that you unconsciously create while watching the show: ""Oh, Hazuki, the soft-spoken funny one; Maki, the raunchy, over-the-top kid; etc."" And it\'s so nice to have these characters that are so consistent with their roles that you don\'t get any unwelcome surprises or revelations.The two mains\' really shine here. Yuuto and Haruka seem to be a perfect couple and the show plays to that aspect: you know it, they know it, the characters know. There isn\'t a time they spend together that doesn\'t add a new layer to their relationship; it contains so much substance and viability that I\'m extremely excited to start the next season as soon as possible. If you can create engrossing characters, that every moment spent together doesn\'t seem like a moment lost, means a huge success on behalf of the show\'s staff. 10/10.If you couldn\'t tell already: I adored watching this show. A lot of romantic animes out there try to stray away from there own genre and have completely irrelevant episodes regarding some random, irrelevant secondary characters plopped together to work on helping each other how to cook. I don\'t care! I want as much time as possible focused on the reason I chose to watch this show in the first place: the love story! And they do such a good job of ""keeping the pedal to the metal"" and it\'s the best thing ever to finally get my prayers answered. Finally! 12/12 episodes (from what I can tell) that are majorly geared to the love story between the two main people that the love story is about. It just makes me want to send a memo to all the other future/past creators and say, ""Look - this is how it\'s done.""The only detriment to the series is the fact that there are no confessions of love. Sure, ""I\'ll be with you... forever"", is close, it doesn\'t hold the same resonance in the heart\'s of a viewer than saying, ""I love you."" Although it may seem nit-picky, you find yourself waiting for the line to be uttered every time there together and it never happens is some sort of letdown. But! Thankfully this show has a second season! 9/10.This show was spectacular. Period. I would love to defend my position over someone who, like me, enjoys romance animes more than any other genre, because, let\'s face it: maybe an sci-fi/action fan coming off of something like Cowboy Bebop to watch this show probably won\'t agree with me. Anyway, my overall grade is based on all of the previous main categories, but I\'d like to leave you with one last complement of the series:The show borrows from a lot of sub-genres out there (e.g. ecchi, harem, comedy, slice-of-life, etc.), and is so well balanced in each that the show is molded together virtually flawlessly. There are a few ecchi moments, but not too much to make uncomfortable a casual watcher, a harem aspect can be chose to be seen as present and relevant or not present and irrelevant, and there are a few comedy gems in there that got me to laugh and smile as I watched the next scene.You can do no wrong here in picking up this series if you\'re a romance fan. I wouldn\'t be surprised if it acted like a transitory series for first-time romance watchers to get into the genre, either. It\'s so close to perfection. Literally three words away. I leave you with the words of an early Puritan coming to the shores of America; as this show has become something of a benchmark that all romance animes should strive for. 9.99/10.In the words of John Winthrop: ""I envision this country, a city upon a hill.""Feedback is appreciated! but this key change of normalcy in regards to the storyline had me reeling... in a good way.Now, if you\'ve seen this and have read the above paragraph, and thought to yourself, ""Well, it\'s the typical \'normal boy-meets-girl\'"", type of storyline.

It just makes me want to send a memo to all the other future/past creators and say, ""Look - this is how it\'s done.""The only detriment to the series is the fact that there are no confessions of love. Sure, ""I\'ll be with you... forever"", is close, it doesn\'t hold the same resonance in the heart\'s of a viewer than saying, ""I love you."" Although it may seem nit-picky, you find yourself waiting for the line to be uttered every time there together and it never happens is some sort of letdown. But! Thankfully this show has a second season! 9/10.This show was spectacular. Period. I would love to defend my position over someone who, like me, enjoys romance animes more than any other genre, because, let\'s face it: maybe an sci-fi/action fan coming off of something like Cowboy Bebop to watch this show probably won\'t agree with me. Anyway, my overall grade is based on all of the previous main categories, but I\'d like to leave you with one last complement of the series:The show borrows from a lot of sub-genres out there (e.g. ecchi, harem, comedy, slice-of-life, etc.), and is so well balanced in each that the show is molded together virtually flawlessly. There are a few ecchi moments, but not too much to make uncomfortable a casual watcher, a harem aspect can be chose to be seen as present and relevant or not present and irrelevant, and there are a few comedy gems in there that got me to laugh and smile as I watched the next scene.You can do no wrong here in picking up this series if you\'re a romance fan. I wouldn\'t be surprised if it acted like a transitory series for first-time romance watchers to get into the genre, either. It\'s so close to perfection. Literally three words away. I leave you with the words of an early Puritan coming to the shores of America; as this show has become something of a benchmark that all romance animes should strive for. 9.99/10.In the words of John Winthrop: ""I envision this country, a city upon a hill.""Feedback is appreciated!', 'Nogizaka Haruka no HimitsuNogizaka Haruka No Himitsu is an anime about two people from different classes.  On one hand you have Yuuto Ayase who is average and plain in every way, and on the other you have Haruka Nogizaka who is rich, famous pianist, and the most popular and sought after girl in the school.  These two cross paths in a set of unlikely coincidences at which time Yuuto discovers a deep dark secret which could crush the popular lifestyle of Haruka.  Haruka is an otaku.  To Haruka’s relief Yuuto, though average, is a very honest and caring person and...he promises to keep her secret, and support her with her hobby as anunwavering friend.If the discription of Nogizaka Haruka No Himitsu sounds familiar it is becuase you are right “Ore No Imouto” has a VERY similar plot aside from the fact that Haruka and Yuuto are not blood related and the fact that “Ore no Imouto” was a far better series.  Though it is a generic plot at this point the series did have a sweet feel which makes you root for Yuuto and Haruka through all their ordeals.  The characters were well drawn, though the backgrounds felt stagnent and a little dreary for a slice of life romance anime.  Character progression was focused on emotional developments betwen the characters which left a linear feeling, until the end when these emotions were fully realized.  What was really lacking in this series was a love rival, which I originally thought would be played by Shiina Amamiya, however I was dreadfully disappointed.Overall the series was light hearted, sweet, and funny at times, but overall average for an anime.  Some competition, and perhaps earlier conflicts in the budding relationship would of added to the excitement around this series.  Due to this I give this anime a 5/10.

It was interesting, but average all around.@GameJok3r', ""&quot;Nogizaka Haruka No Himitsu&rdquo; is a romantic comedy based on a series of light novels with the same title.The series focuses on the relationship of its two main characters, high school students Haruka and Yuuto, how they meet, form a bond of friendship and perhaps more, all in a mix of comedy, romance and some fanservice type ecchi situations.As the title suggest, the main plot centres around Haruka's secret, she's an otaku. While this would not be so shocking by itself, Haruka is the eldest daughter of an extremely wealthy and renowned family, she possesses great beauty, has excellent academic skills and is a talented...piano player, which makes her a star and the object of admiration at the prestigious private school she attends. If such a person were to be exposed as an otaku, they would be ridiculed and ostracised, something that already befell Haruka at her previous school. Hence she carefully hides her hobby from the outside world.This is soon undone when Yuuto bumps into Haruka at the library and discovers she's secretly borrowing anime magazines. Fearing her secret is exposed, Haruka is distraught but eventually  relieved when Yuuto tells her that he does not mind her being an otaku and will keep her secret safe.With Yuuto now sharing Haruka's secret, hence forms the main plot device to allow them to interact daily and become friends. Along the rest of the series both Haruka and Yuuto are faced with challenges that threaten their happiness, from Haruka's strict father, to a potential love interest for Yuuto, to the difference in status that comes with Haruka's wealth. Seeing this is a comedy, most of is done with plenty of funny scenes and off course it all ends well.One of the series' strong points is also its weakness, namely its characters. While most of the supporting characters are rather two dimensional and not much fleshed out, both Haruka and Yuuto are a paradoxical combination of some interesting traits as well as more generic character traits.Haruka being of wealthy descent, blessed with great beauty and academic skills and having several moe character traits such as shyness and clumsiness that are solely aimed to cater to the audience is nothing new in terms of character design. That such an unrealistically perfect persona has a passion for which one is ostracised in Japan, yet stands up for her beliefs and isn't free of normal human emotions such as doubt and jealousy makes her a more three dimensional character. A welcome surprise.No chance is missed to display Haruka's moe character traits and truth must be said, she is quite moe.Yuuto too is such a mixed case, he has many traits of the classical romantic comedy or harem male protagonist, such as being shy around women yet desiring them, he is indecisive and well, he's rather plain. Nonetheless, Yuuto is also shown to be a very level-headed and open minded person, who accepts people's different interests and who will not ostracise anyone, even if he does not understand the things they are passionate about. Having such an adult, open minded character that does not succumb to blindly following the group mentality is interesting, especially if you see the majority of his peers will ostracise and judge someone like Nobunaga -Yuuto's otaku friend- or Haruka without any second thoughts.While being rebellious is surely not an unknown phase to any young person, being open minded, willing to form one's own opinion that may not align with the public one in a positive fashion is more rare I gather.I also found Shiina to be a quite refreshing character. Transferring into Haruka and Yuuto's class, she develops a liking to Yuuto, but once she discovers that Yuuto and Haruka care deeply for each other, she takes a very adult stance and doesn't really fall prey to the usual anime clich&eacute;s.Throughout the series some dramatic moments or events are generated but rarely does one have the impression anything really bad will occur, due to the colourful and comedic atmosphere the series carries. Everything is usually very upbeat and positive.Even though the theme of otaku being ostracised and publicly shunned is often mentioned, it's used more as a plot device and never really deeply delved into. Haruka and Nobunaga are shown to be normal people who just happen to be passionate about anime, manga, figurines,... but that does not make them any less human or valuable people than you and me. It's nicely brought on screen but lacks the depth, subtlety or realistic tone a series like &ldquo;Genshiken&rdquo; carries with it.Animation in &ldquo;Nogizaka Haruka No Himitsu&rdquo; is good, with most of the focus being on the girls like Haruka, with fanservice scenes and shots getting the best treatment. I did notice that some full body shot scenes where characters are in their regular appearance do look more simple and less elaborate, but this is never bothersome.The soundtrack is quite nice, it supports most scenes well and the opening and ending theme songs are upbeat tracks, though the opening animation sequence leaves little to no doubts about the series' general direction.So for those looking for a cute romantic comedy that has a positive overtone and a moe female lead character, then you may certainly enjoy &ldquo;Nogizaka Haruka No Himitsu&rdquo;. piano player, which makes her a star and the object of admiration at the prestigious private school she attends.

However, I like this show.Beyond the slick production values, this is a believable story.  There's a girl who has a lot of trouble opening up her emotions, and she meets a decent guy who happens to get past her defenses.I don't think I'll end up liking this as much as &quot;Zero no Tsukaima,&quot; but the basic ambiance seems to have a lot of similarities. "", ""I thought this was a very well done anime, but everytime haruka and yuuto were about kiss each other, someone would just barge in and just interrupt their kiss alone and i just hated that and I like said again a pretty well done anime with a very pretty voice from the actress playing Haruka. I want this anime to go on for a 2nd season or even a 3rd season. So i'm giving Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu a 11/10!!!! "", 'Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is an anime that focuses on the peculiar world of interpersonal relationships and the misunderstandings of every day life. It is an oddball in that it has the capacity to be a masterpiece but due to the forced and often exaggerated drama it falls short of its true potential.The central couple of the show, Yuuto and Haruka, go to the same school but seem to be on two different ends of the social spectrum. Yuuto is a plain and completely uninteresting guy with the resolve of a pigeon dropping. He\'s indifferent in life and often pushed around by his peers like...a leaf in the wind. This personality supplemented by his plain looks make him unpopular with the ladies or just about anyone, to say the least. On the other hand we have Haruka, the beautiful highly accomplished student and a prodigy in various subjects and disciplines. And of course unlike Yuuto, she\'s from a rich and noble background. So you can pretty much see the massive disparity here.So how is it that they get acquainted? They end up sharing a secret when Yuuto finds out that Haruka - the model student, is in fact a bit of an anime otaku. Forced to keep his mouth shut and make sure her secret is not revealed, the two get closer and various shenanigans begin to take place.Now this is not an inherently bad story, I\'m all for the idea of a powerful girl falling for the average member of society but I personally felt that the romance component in this anime was lackluster. Despite the fact that we see some progression in the relationship of the two main characters, as they do go on numerous dates, the atmosphere surrounding them is way too infantile. They nearly faint at the idea of even holding hands and that\'s months after their initial meeting. So the makers tried to supplement this obvious cock up later on in the series by making them ""accidentally"" trip on each other every 5 minutes and it\'s so blatantly obvious they\'re trying to force this down your throat that you feel like throwing up. Same goes for the ""drama"". Haruka getting wobbly feet and nearly losing consciousness because a few books got sold out or Yuuto blowing his stack because he felt ""useless"" after carrying his pseudo-girlfriend all the way back home is so teeth-grittingly fake you want to beat yourself with a wrench to make the memory go away. They also try to make it look serious and authentic which only worsens the situation.On the other hand there are moments of sheer brilliance in this anime such as the accurate portrayal of what goes on in a teenage boy\'s head when he\'s around girls. Yuuto often ends up thinking about perverted things at the most inappropriate moments and that\'s something I could actually relate to because it used to happen to me too when I was a teenager. Whether it\'d be looking down a woman\'s cleavage or getting funny ideas while alone with a girl - that\'s all part of growing up and it was funny to step aside and see my own adolescent years from 3rd view. I\'m sure some people will share the same sentiment.Another great thing here is the supporting cast and the good execution of humour. Haruka\'s family is made up of the most hilarious bunch of eccentric individuals. Neurotic maid with a passion for chainsaws, perverted sister, overprotective father who happens to be carrying a katana everywhere... the list goes on. Now that in itself wouldn\'t be anything unusual because we see that in anime pretty often - but it\'s the way these characters interact that really makes you grin all the time. Though in the end they are motivated by the same thing - poking their eyes through the key hole to see if Haruka and Yuuto are not doing anything questionable.And then we have Yuuto and Haruka\'s classmates. These characters I felt were nothing more than cardboard cut-outs and there\'s not much to talk about them. A couple of perverted guys, an otaku and of course every romance anime needs one - another female character with an interest in the male lead. However they all contributed in some way or another to the story and did their jobs as background characters pretty well.Now with most stuff out of the way we come to the art and sound departments. Personally I felt that the art was very good and precise with emphasis on the eye candy effect, especially when it came to female characters (being kinda obvious here). Sound was absolutely amazing, in part because the OST features piano/classical music and partly because I\'m a sucker for classical-themed pieces. However there are also regular pop pieces too (opening; ending) so I suppose a wide range of viewers will be satisfied.As for the enjoyment, strangely, I got a lot of it out of this anime. Despite the infantile romance, the forced and at times absolutely fake drama - I still think there is a lot to enjoy here. Whether it\'d be the nostalgia inducing fantasies and day-dreaming of the male lead in the presence of other girls, the all too familiar shyness associated with interpersonal relationships or the refreshing humor provided by the supporting characters; there are plenty of points of interest here for the casual anime watcher. If one watches this not as a thought-provoking masterpiece but rather as something that\'s meant to provide entertainment, which is how it\'s meant to be, then enjoyment will be there.Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu gets 8 points from me. a leaf in the wind.

When i watch this for  the first time, i know that this anime will entertain me. Yeah, that' s absolutely right. Well, lets reviews it step by step.Story (7/10)Not so new in anime world where the MC (Yuuto Ayase) is a roundabout person and he meets the princess of his highschool that fits the perfectness (Nogizaka Haruka). But, eventually he accidentally know her secret as an otaku. The story itself is rather slow at first but faster when it comes to an end. But i think the supporting characters in this anime are rather too ordinary. Their...appearance are made like NPC in some game that needed to progress the story. Like for example, Amamiya Shiina. Her role as the main female character love rival is quite weak. But from episode 1 to the end, i was able to enjoy it and there are some episodes that will show you a cosplay of other anime. Shana fans must see this series :)Art (8/10)The Art is smooth and the BG is nice. I like the art of nogizaka haruka, she's so cute and seiyuu mamiko noto fits really well for herSound (7/10)Well, not so much to be reviewed here but the sound itself is okay. But, it just can't bring the atmosphere of the scenes to the viewers.Character (8/10)This is a reason why you will like this series. You will like the characters of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. You will like haruka, shy but actually a honest and kind person. You will like Yuuto Ayase, honest and caring person especially to haruka. And Yuuto not a harem type MC that like to do ecchi things even to defenseless haruka (yeah, she beat the annoying guy to yuuto so bad). The downside is, i just see a little char development among the characters of this show.Enjoyment (9/10)Well, its also a reason why you will like this series. The enjoyment of this series is gonna to haunt you per episode. Although i was annoyed because the the progress of Yuuto and haruka's relationship were bothered by some trivial things. But to me, this show was entertaining.Overall (8)The story itself is not so original, with good characters, beautiful art, comedy, fine sound and a sweet love relationship. Overall Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is a decent anime. For those who hate a lot of fanservice anime, they can relax and enjoy this anime. Because this anime has a little fanservice (not zero). Hope you find your enjoyable time watching this anime as i found a lot of enjoyable time watching this. And again, for Shana lovers, i recommend it for you to watch this anime :) appearance are made like NPC in some game that needed to progress the story. Like for example, Amamiya Shiina.

The only good scene was the Shana reference. This whole anime is just retarded beyond hope. It's so retarded that it's not even funny, I'm crying tears of blood from how bad this is. For anyone like me, browsing for anime to watch, I have some advice: DO NOT WATCH THIS! Try something else, seriously.Students are learning to swim in the school pool and then suddenly there are maids with a watermelon and the main girls sister with a beach ball there to have fun. Also, the protagonist's sister is having a BBQ next to the pool. Etc etc etc. What...is this I don't even is this I don't even"", ""DDAAAMMNN! This anime turned out to be much better than i expected it to be. I had this anime on my ' to watch list' for a while now, and i kept adding new anime just so that i can avoid watching the ones that seemed boring and average. I thought that i was going to get an anime that was tediously average but instead i got a hard boiled romance between Yuto and Haruka. Yeah sure we might have seen the average story but don't judge every thing by the cover. You might actually find that this anime can be quite enjoyable. The two...things that set this anime apart from the average anime was the the enjoyment(10) and the flowing relationship between the to main characters. Some romance anime skip the growth of relationships and try to force it in at the end. This anime made their relationship grow in every episode and you actually enjoy watching them go through all these embarrassing moments and conflicts.The art was done okay for the time it was made and the story was actually fine. What annoyed me in this anime though was how poorly the side characters where developed and even the main characters at times. Even for an average story, they should have at least developed the side characters a bit more. some characters are only in for about 5 or 6 episodes and that was really annoying to me. I knew almost nothing about yuto's sister and his sensei other than they like to drink a lot. I would have loved to know more about yuto's sister, especially because how unique i find an alchoholic character to be. The next thing that kind of pulled my nerve was the character of Amamiya. We see a great development at the beginning but after she was introduced, it felt like she just started to fade away. She had a role to play after but i never understood her. i thought she was a character that needed a lot more development.My last problem in this anime is something that not everyone get. When you watch a certain amount of anime it becomes easy to predict things in average stories. After i watched the first episode i already new what would happen at the end and i new almost all the conflicts that they would have to face. The most predictable was Haruka's father. I would literally just watch an episode and call out scenes like every minute. Having said this, i would suggest this anime to veterinarians and not to people who have watch dozens of anime unless you're super into growing romance like me. Although i had many concerns this anime, i still very much enjoyed it and to me that is the key factor to an anime and that is why i gave this anime an overall rating of 8/10 things that set this anime apart from the average anime was the the enjoyment(10) and the flowing relationship between the to main characters.

it may be a typical slice of life but it touches sensitive topics related to otakus especially that of discrimination and i gues that's the reason why i got myself hooked since the start of the series.although there are some cliched events troughout with the aspect of first-love and destiny and romance, i still liked how they developed every episode neatly. some episodes entertain the viewers with factual akiba-ke information while other deal with how people are to deal with their inner demons and...face conflicts with society.as a general premise, yuuto would be haruka's knight in charge of protecting her secret from the rest of society so as she wouldn't be humiliated as what she experienced before when she was in middle grade. even though the story's plot revolved around that, it's fun that they still focused on fanservice rather than being serious all of a sudden. at the very least, they maintained consistency in their episodes.artthe story's not that to brag about but it's still worth mentioning that it mixes very well with the harem and fanservice theme. lotsa sexy characters from time to time and frilly clothes that would definitely pick on cosplayers everywheresoundthe opening and ending wasn't that catchy. it was entertaining but it was just at that. the slice of life an ero ero scenes are properly paired with BGM so i have no qualms regarding those things.it is to note however that some character singles are amusing. they dont give me the last song syndrome but still have an enchanting effect especially haruka's single, sung by mamiko noto. i also liked kana ueda and kaori shimitzu's duet.characterthis is definitely a typical romance where boy meets girl few years back then boy meets girl few years later and boy must protect girl at all costs. despite being a fanservice anime, everyone has still attitudes that's worth mentioning such as the imperfection of the perfect haruka in terms of clumsiness, yuuto's laid back attitude but determination, mika's abuse of her innocent look which definitely leads to various echi echi moments and other forms of chaos. yuuto's drunk sister and teacher which definitely services a complete set of incest harem.enjoymenti really enjoyed the otaku fanservice though (episodes relating to otaku life) and has grasped the idea of otaku discrimination and oppression quite easily thanks to their episode conflicts. some episodes are simply senseless however yet still manages to progress in terms of plot developmentoveralleven though nogizaka haruka didnt give me a thrill in terms of action, i suppose slice of life fanatics wouldn't be disappointed watching this one. the same goes for those who love romance flicks and some ecchi here and there. however, if you really like to look into otaku popculture effects in the society, then nogizaka haruka wouldn't fail to boot face conflicts with society.as a general premise, yuuto would be haruka's knight in charge of protecting her secret from

You may pick another anime. the first impression of this anime.Well, this anime isn't quite good. You may pick another anime."", '(SPOILERS)When I went into this anime, I did not expect it to go the way that it did. Besides having one of my favorite Japanese voice actresses as the lead, I was not too optimistic about it at first glance. I will keep the synopsis a little short since there\'s not too much to write about anyway.The anime starts off with Yuuto, your everyday nerd character with glasses to boot, stumbling around and trying to avoid his otaku friend that insists he try out the hobby. He hears about a girl named Haruka, who is wealthy, popular and talented. Naturally, he fears he won\'t get...anywhere with her as a friend, so he backs off from the idea right away and things go about normally. But, obviously we all knew that was not going to happen since her NAME is in the title of the anime.Anyway, the prim and proper Haruka (as the viewer currently knows her as based on the description given about her earlier) overhears that a certain manga is in the library by a loudmouthed Nobunaga (the otaku friend of Yuuto), stands straight up from her desk in an overbearing fashion, blushes in embarrassment over the ruckus and stumbles to the library. Naturally, our male lead has to get to the library for his own reasons as well.So on, so forth, some plot stuff happens some more and, naturally, she bumps into Yuuto. Now, by this point, the viewer is well aware she is an otaku since she did walk over to the library earlier after hearing of the manga. The way that Yuuto finds out, however, is just bizarre and it feels so much like a plot device that it hurts to watch. She manages to trip around him several (yes several) times before they both fall over and knock all the books in the library down. Oddly enough, there was no comedy gag about the librarian making Yuuto clean it up, which I anticipated as soon as that occurred. Haruka naturally freaks out when Yuuto sees her manga and runs off. And through a chain of events, Yuuto promises to keep her secret and the rest of the anime begins as the romantic comedy you were waiting for.Okay, maybe that took a bit longer than I expected to elaborate on, but there you go. I will come clean here and say that this anime will throw a ton of ""romance"" moments at you that will go absolutely nowhere, so don\'t get your hopes up at all of them establishing a relationship here, cause it is only friendship in this season. Speaking of, right as I finished this up, I found out it had another season. Otherwise, I was fully ready to write them off as friends, but now there\'s more to look forward to since their relationship has built up from this season. And as such, I simply can\'t write anything concrete here. I was a bit surprised this even lasted another season, considering how bare boned the plot is.And speaking of, I would like to go over that for a bit. I do admire that this anime takes a very real approach on how fans of anime and manga would be treated if they go to a rough school and their hobbies are discovered. I still question how Nobunaga was never mistreated, considering how enthusiastic and loud he is about his hobby, but maybe he will have more development later on, so I can\'t judge for sure.One thing is for sure, though, when the other classmates did find out that someone liked these things, things got really dark. As in, dark even for a comedy. Tons of insults, disrespect and treating their hobbies, as well as the individual, worse than trash itself. I was quite surprised at how dark it got, but only one episode truly got this bad. The other ones that did cover the topic in this manner simply did so in explanation, so it is mildly dark at most. I have to give them credit for tackling the hobby in such a serious fashion, since it reminds me of how I felt before my friends discovered I loved the stuff. I really did think they would demoralize me similar to how Yuuto\'s classmates disowned him when rumors spread about him being an otaku.Other positives about the anime are that it had a real good flow of comedy, characters were bubbly, yet simple enough to be very likable. I wound up liking Ruko the most, despite how she came off as being a stereotype that I dislike in anime the most at first. That being the kind that just has their way all the time without punishment. But, she is always wasted, so it\'s easily forgivable. For the fewer times that she is sober, she actually works a very high-class job and is quite intelligent. But of course, she comes off as dopey most of the time cause she is always wasted. She also has that hairline that I love so much, which earned her immediate bonus points on her character, even though I\'m well aware that\'s a pretty poor bias to judge a character on.The other characters may take too much time for me to explain here since they were all unique in their own way. Of course, they also had their fair share of stereotypes, but their personalities weren\'t as overbearing as I expected them to be, which was nice. I never felt like any of the female characters were a bother to me, which is very rare for me to experience in anime. They normally always treat the male characters like garbage a lot of the time, even when they do things on accident. And speaking of, he had quite a few of those with Haruka, but she somehow respected him regardless and did not mind.Though, I do dislike how the other women treated this, as they called her ""dense"" for not being angry with him, further reminding me how Japan treats men. It irritates me that an accidental sexual situation is considered punishable and that you\'re ""dense"" for simply acknowledging it as an accident. And no, Haruka is not the one that is fell on top of. She is the one that witnesses it, though, and considering the placement of one of the hands, she had every right to run away in confusion.And speaking of these situations, I would just like to point out that this is the very first anime I have ever seen where the usual ""male falls on female"" accident happened and the girl did not get upset at all. I am not kidding, this actually happened and everything was fine. He even had one of his hands land on one of her breasts, clearly grasping it, and she was okay with it and treated it as an accident. Just take that in for a moment.No ""I am going to exploit this,"" no ""you are a pervert"" followed by her running away and misjudging the boy for the rest of the anime. None of this occurred after the accident. And to clarify, yes, it was the kind where he somehow landed a hand on one of her boobs, grabbing it, and nothing happened. Sorry for bringing so much emphasis on this one scene, but for many anime fans out there, it\'s quite significant for the scene to end as what it originally was in the first place. You know, an accident. I clearly spoiled this whole scene for you, hence my warning earlier, but if you have already seen it, then you must have been as shocked as I was.I could cover this season a little more if I want to, but I feel I should save those thoughts for after I have seen the entire anime. And, you know, I clearly dedicated a good chunk of it just talking about how it treats sexual scenes. And I may not even be done with that yet. And if you are reading this after watching, and I am assuming you are since I have a visible warning on the top; and you enjoyed this season, then I suggest watching the next. That is the plan for me since I actually enjoyed this anime quite a bit. I liked the music, the backgrounds and the setting is strangely relaxing. I love how Haruka, alongside most of the women in this anime, follow the usual stereotypes in a less chaotic manner.Very few ""misunderstandings"" that are treated with arbitrary punishments. In fact, I can\'t recall a single time where Yuuto received a punishment for any of his accidental sexual acts. Haruka just said it was alright and they moved on. Even for a comedy, it is quite unusual for them not to milk those scenes, but I am happy that they did not since it may have effected how I felt about the anime. I appreciate it more for not going through those comedy measures and I very much look forward to the next season and hope it retains the style of the first and does not try to etch in unnecessary comedy elements that it did not do before. Or at least, I hope they try to make it original if they do go about this path. Preferably, no ""you glanced at my panties once, prepare to receive an awful punishment"" moments.

Very few people know about it except for her little sister Mika and her two maids who completely support her until one day by accident the MC of the show, Yuuto Ayase discovers her little secret. The story is as generic and inconsistent as it gets. It contains some allusions to other animes like Shakugan no Shana and Bokusatsu Tenshi Dokuro-chan. The main issue that is presented on episode one gets resolved more or...less rather quickly. Like at first Haruka is being very  secretive of her hobby in school but around episode 3, some fuckboy tries to hit on her and bullies Yuuto wrongly accusing him of being a dirty Otaku. Much to Haruka\'s anger who ends up picking up and slamming the fuckboy against an electric post knocking over a trash can. She then proceeds to reveal to everyone that being an Otaku is actually her hobby, and not Yuuto\'s. We never hear from him again nor do we ever find out what the repercussions for Haruka doing that in front of half of the students in her school were. The next episodes focus on them hanging out, nothing in particular happens, there\'s this girl that appears out of nowhere she becomes Yuuto\'s classmate, they\'re learning how to swim or something she sprains her ankle and after some emotional talk becomes infatuated with Yuuto but that never goes anywhere. Next episode Yuuto and Haruka are hanging out at some event called the summer comiket where Haruka tries to buy some manga but some fat guy gets in the way and buys the last unit after her and Yuuto wait in line for hours but one of Haruka\'s maids kicks his ass and gives the comic to Haruka instead. So you get the point, the story is random, the continuity of it is there but it is shaky, and the episodes are nothing that, if you\'re a usual anime fan, you haven\'t seen before.For an anime in 2008 I\'d say the art quality is standard to subpar, the characters look very generic especially the MC as always, nonetheless it is not bad. Haruka and her little sister Mika are very cute despite looking generic.I don\'t remember any soundtracks at all because nothing particularly caught my attention.You got your average normie wimpy anime MC who does absolutely nothing but normie wimpy anime MC stuff. Haruka\'s your average cute moe anime girl who\'s into air headed and is into things way below her age range. Mika\'s a cute, fun but also generic genki loli who flirts with MC-kun and it is hinted she also develops a crush on the MC. Shiina\'s this weird tomboyish girl that comes out of nowhere and gets transferred to MC\'s school where the story tries portray her as the rival to MC\'s main love interest which is obviously Haruka. You got two maids in the Nogizaka household, one is what is looks to me almost like a Nagato Yuki clone from Haruhi Suzumiya, the quiet but very caring and disciplined Hazuki-san and the other is like, this crazy genki maid who drives really fast. MC lives with his older sister and for some unexplained reason his crazy 23 year old teacher whom he lets get wasted in his house and crash the place for who knows why. Then there\'s Haruka\'s dad. An unrealistically strict father who thinks that because her daughter actively engages in watching anime and collecting figurines she will fail school, and goes very over the top about it. Then there\'s Haruka\'s mother who\'s like the flexible ara ara type and voice of reason of the Nogizaka household. That\'s all the characters I can think of, the rest are over the top unrealistic normies, who are disgusted by the idea that there are people who are into anime, or as they call it, Akibahara culture. None of these characters really stood out for me, but the way this series plays with romance, which by the way, on the last episode of the first season it ALMOST gets somewhere is a little refreshing as elements like the constant slapstick abuse of MC aren\'t present whenever the awkward ""lewd"" situation gag occurs, and Haruka isn\'t a bitchy main girl who treats MC like shit so I gave it some props for that. Also, while I do know it\'s generic, I do like Mika\'s character.It\'s a generic show but overall it\'s not unwatchable either. It has some nice things I liked like the art and some aspects of the characters, their interactions were fun, albeit one dimensional because all the characters are more or less that, but overall everything else is nothing you haven\'t seen over 100 times in different animes before. Therefore for someone who\'s seen a considerable amount of anime, a good portion of it would just make you feel boring or indifferent unless you have some kind of connection with shows that are like this.The overall score I\'d give this series is a 4.6, but because I rate on enjoyment alone, I have it as a 6 scored on my MAL. less rather quickly.

Pui Pui Molcar: Driving School,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51986/Pui_Pui_Molcar__Driving_School,"[""Molcar Driving School is a sequel to the surprise hit of 2021. However, its setting being constrained to a single location does squander its potential for creativity. The show is still entertaining, don't get me wrong. But most scenarios involving the Molcars are unfortunately predictable and lack that insanity, that spark, that madness that drove many fans to loving the original series.Most scenarios presented in the episode are fairly standard fare with the Molcars showcasing various levels of (in)competence as they go through driving school with a strict drill instructor. With a few exceptions, like that VR episode or that space episode,  Driving School...is a fine, but disappointing sequel to one of the most imaginative shows out there.

Doing a fairly grounded and normal sequel is not how you follow up on grand expectations."", 'Season 2 of Pui Pui Molcar is a cute but lacklustre follow-up to a bizarre(ly) excellent first season.Almost the entire season takes place in a ""driving school"", which is part of why it doesn\'t feel as interesting, as the set doesn\'t change and the situations begin to feel too-familiar - however, it\'s really only the first six episodes that drag slightly, and later episodes change up the formula by utilising the set in interesting ways or having episodes focused around the driving school in a different location (such as the water episode).But this doesn\'t mean it\'s not worth watching. Just like the first...season, it\'s got excellent (and adorable!) sound design, eye-catching and fluid animation, and there are enough hilarious/heartwarming/ridiculous moments to keep your attention. (Predictably, at least one moment made me seriously teary-eyed, which is absurd for a kid\'s show about guinea pig cars).If you liked the first season you\'ll still like this one, and since the entire season is just over thirty minutes long, there\'s no good reason not to binge it. season, it\'s got excellent (and adorable!) sound design, eye-catching and fluid animation, and there are enough hilarious/heartwarming/ridiculous moments to keep your attention.

Every episode brought unique premises, varied locations, and briskly paced jokes that were presented entirely visually in the unfortunately dying medium of stop motion. As such, I was excited when I heard a new season was coming. All I really hoped for was more fun situations, but this season took a different direction. Nearly every episode is housed and framed in a driving school for the Molcars.Now, this is just speculation, but it's certainly possible...that this approach was taken to save on resources. It's definitely not entirely practical to build a desert set for a single episode like they did in the first season. However, it's undeniable that this season is far more monotonous, both in writing and location. Aside from two shake-ups, the entire series takes place in this school. And that aside, most episodes are pretty conventional and straightforward, which was rarely true of season one. As such, even the episodes that live up to that season one quality are far less memorable.At the end of the day though, it's still good. Aside from the nearly singular location, the visuals are still great, the series is still pretty great at silent comedy, and no episodes outstay their welcome.

Sport movies/series genre in general are about underdog story. It’s almost impossible to deviate from this trope. Because of this, many sport anime become predictable. RE-MAIN didn’t stray away from this trope, but to my surprise I actually enjoyed this anime more than I expected.The reason for this is the character. The dementia aspect helped making our main character interesting and conflicting, not just within himself with also in other people around him. Although his character transition near the end was a bit rushed...due to the runtime, I was invested and felt satisfied at the outcome. Other characters also have decent backstories, although they are more generic than the main character’s.It took me 5 episodes to realize that RE-MAIN was animated by MAPPA. The characters have less texture than compared to other MAPPA’s works that I have watched like AOT and Jujutsu Kaisen. Still, the coloring was refreshing. Each member of the underdog water polo team has a distinct color that reflected their personality.The animation for the water polo games was on point. I could see the field clearly and aware of the positions of the players. Each game only took one episode, but they were pretty intense and entertaining.The opening of this anime gave me good vibe. The song and the vibrant colors of the characters and the swimming pool made me feel refreshed and calm whenever I start a new episode.Overall, a great and different sport anime with a twist in the character arc. 8/10 due to the runtime, I was invested and felt satisfied at the outcome.

I'm not being honest putting an 8.

I loved it so much. it has made me bloom many beautiful emotions. There are many anime that I would recommend before Re-main, but if you have time and want to see a nice story of a group of students who become friends playing a sport, give it...a try! a try!"", ""once again, this cour has presented yet another sports anime, and this time about water polo. Not everyone knows a lot about water polo, so it did pique my interest. Not to mention Mappa was the one animating it, so i thought wow, looks good, let's give it a try. This is what I can say:Story: 7.4/10. A lot of sport animes, such as Haikyuu, always take up the beginning eps to explain and emphasize the individual stories of the teammates. So far they've taken up 4 episodes doing this. Not that I'm complaining, but since they used up 3.5eps in a 12ep cour, I'm...hoping for some good pacing throughout the entire anime. Especially hoping that they don't rush the end or something.The story does have potential though, and I like how the title 'Re-Main' is explained in the anime. It's unique name makes me think this show does have potential. Hoping that I'm not wrong for this.Art: 9/10. I mean, sasuga Mappa. The intro is beautifully animated, and the water animation feels very real.  No complaints here.Sound: 8.9/10, but it rounds up to a 9. Water splashes are fine. I've seen a discussion about the voice actors though, saying how the mc's voice doesn't really fit his appearance. It sounds fine for me, but I do admit it may sound weird 1st time hearing it. But after the 1st ep my ears got used to it so it's fine for me now.Character: 7.6/10. Very loveable cast, goated voice actors too. Everyone's distinct, distinguishable, and I love the chemistry between all of them. I'm just giving it a 7.6 because it's stereotypical, but everyone's likeable.Enjoyment: 8.4/10. I'm new to water sports, and water polo is just the thing to get me interested. Besides that, it's also interesting to see how they train for the sport, and how their practices work out. With the Olympics going on right now, it's the perfect time to be learning about water polo and seeing it happen in real life.I also really love how Mappa chose Enhypen to sing the op. The vibes match the anime perfectly, and it is a whole bop. I'm not even a kpop stan or anything, but this song might make me be one.Overall: 7.8/10. The rivalry between our main team and the other teams seem worth watching for. I would say this gives off the same vibes as Bakuten. Really hoping they don't mess up the ending or rush it!! Might bump it up to an 8 if it gets real good. hoping for some good pacing throughout the entire anime.

And now, Re-Main is his 2nd self-directed series, and imagine someone like him has to manage all...of these positions: Chief Director, Original Creator, Series Composer, Scriptwriter, Sound Director. That\'s 5 main staff roles all burdened into one for some creative control, and I feel that while Masafumi Nishida might\'ve overworked himself to the core (as with MAPPA\'s inhumane work standards), with the upcoming Ex-Arm ""successor"" lookalike show that is Tesla Note (which is also written by this guy), I\'m not sure if Nishida-san is able to cope with the backlash that was the full-on CGI abomination when the anime comes out next season in Fall (trying to futureproof if it does look like Ex-Arm, which I hope it\'s not).Back to the anime, Re-Main tells the story and plot of water polo from the perspective of Minato Kiyomizu, who was a prolific water polo player in his middle school days, until a traffic accident led him to comatose and being an amnesiac. Exactly 203 days later (which I really find it very specific, anyone can tell me why), Minato is awakened, but he loses 3 years worth of his water polo memories in exchange, both skill and expertise. The challenge is that with his ""newfound"" brainwash of a memory, Minato remembers that he has done water polo before (at the slightest hint), and that everyone idolizes him because he was part of a winning team, so much that they tried to recruit him. Nonetheless, he would come back to water polo being the newbie veteran that needs to jog his memories every so now and then, abetted from a fellow girl athlete that challenged him to be Japan\'s top water polo athlete. Win, and they\'d be boyfriend-girlfriend; lose, and 110,000 yen (taxes inclusive) would be paid out from Minato\'s hands to her. If you can\'t tell already, Minato has a lot of things going for him at the height of his passion for water polo garnering fame and popularity, but alas the accident would tell a different story about a handsome guy like Minato, wearing a facade that breaks all expectations and reveals their true colours.Since this is a sports show, no doubt that the characters will have to play the most important aspect of the anime: sell their characters of their teamwork, camaraderie, and objectively their likeness reflected towards us the audience. But this is where Re-Main shows it\'s Achilles Heel of characters that are nothing more than one-note motivational spokespeople, while having their backstories as simple as possible to fit into the context of the entire anime. That\'s not to say that it\'s bad though, it\'s just that there was something missing towards the overall execution that kinda hampered my watching experience of watching so many sports shows come and gone, using them as bookmarkers of comparison. Maybe it\'s the idea of knowing who is your rival, should at least help to have a goal for yourself, that the anime failed to focus on what\'s important at certain scenes.Starting off with the MC Minato himself, the first thing you\'d see him of is the cheerful and innocent young boy look who kinda resembles the mentality of a 6th grader. And you\'d be right because of the loss of his memories that exhibits his youthful self to others. Turn things up a notch, and you\'d see a darker side of Minato, which is nothing like who he was initially. And take everything that I said about the ""Light"" Minato and turn it on its head to see a boy who is quite proud, arrogant, spiteful and full of ego because of his accomplishments, thinking that it\'s all a one-man show (which is painfully, obviously not). Minato, maybe you should learn this adage not to ""take things too far"". Minato\'s ""stalker"" Eitarou Oka is a spirited, bubbly boy who is like a walking encyclopedia about all things Minato related and not to mention water polo as well. But like Minato himself, Eitarou bases on lies and deceit just to follow the icon around in his tracks and acts whatever is appropriate to be like the water polo ace in every regard.I\'ll touch on the other players in a lightning round (because there isn\'t much to say about them):- The fellow Yamanami High players of Captain Jo Jojima, Shugo Amihama, Takekazu Ejiri, Yutaka Babayaro Inomata and Yoshiharu Ushimado, along with Minato and Eitarou. Captain Jo has to bear the beginning grunt of recruiting members into the water polo team. Shugo has a beef with his older brother, Shogakukan\'s Keita Kakihana, because he always felt that as much as he is a fellow sibling, he\'s also a rival that Shugo looked up to in swimming, before Keita\'s tonal shift to go water polo broke his momentum and gave up swimming altogether. It\'s the efforts of Jo and the rest that brought him back to water polo. There\'s the hot-tempered Ejiri, the sweet-making Inomata and the soft-spoken Ushimado, and that fits the 7-men water polo team.- The ""rivals"" that are all against Minato because of his expertise: the Rikka Academy\'s ""Hokuriku Three"" of a hilarious trash losing joke team (Takeshi Toyama, Akihisa Fukui, Norimichi Ishikawa) and the serious contenders from Minato\'s former rival team Shogakukan High (Riku Momosaki, Koki Toguchi, Akimitsu Bizen) which gives them a real challenge.- The girl at the very beginning, Chinu Kawakubo, she\'s just there to fill in where the plot breaks are to ""smoothen"" relations between herself and Minato. Like she\'s a LITERATE plot device, and that kind of characterization is always a no-no when it comes to AniManga, especially an original series like this one. To say the least, she acted out of sympathy and spite towards Minato, so she\'s no love interest or anything. What a sad thing to squander her character like that.I\'ll give credit where it\'s due: whether you\'d think that MAPPA is turning into the modern Madhouse where it used to be quality over quantity (and now the other way around), you cannot deny that there\'re some good production artistry within Re-Main. All of these are still heralded by Masafumi Nishida, who devoted himself to research about water polo, even the effects that you see in the anime are all actually based off from real-life water polo sports, add in the effects for some colorful visuals that\'s culminated in the show\'s OP. MAPPA always pumps out some good animation and visuals, and Re-Main adds itself into the catalogue of being artistic more than anything for a nice touch.Music, top-notch. The experimentation of K-Pop bands resurging in anime has been a popular choice to break away from the usual J-Pop stuff that becomes more stale overtime, and look no further than ENHYPEN\'s debut into the J-Pop scene with the OP song ""Forget Me Not"" I find it quite the fascination that while I\'m not so much of a K-Pop hypebeast fan or anything, this inclusion (which is slowly becoming the norm) is a great one to diversify the music scene in Japan and for good reason. But to me, Shuugo Nakamura\'s ED was a pure winner because of one main reason: it\'s pellucid tones and lyrics (which foreshadows Minato\'s character development in the entire show) which makes the song a lot more enjoyable, one of my absolute favourite EDs of the season worth the listening repeat loop. In the backdrop of Summer shows of pretty mediocre OSTs, Re-Main managed to stick the landings for both songs.I don\'t know about you, but while Re-Main isn\'t bad (or good for that matter), both the base and its foundations are quite shallow-thinking if you sum the anime up altogether as a whole. It\'s interesting if you\'re a pure Yaoi fangirl to gleam at the guys\' naked 6-pack bodies with sporty underwear to cover privates, but as a sport, Re-Main falls short of something that is prevalent in most sports shows: consistency and good build-up, not rando situations that feel off and doesn\'t transition well with the core themes of the show. It\'s great for eye-balling naked bodies, but it\'s not on a story-character level, and the potential was there that sadly didn\'t get developed much. A shame, really. of these positions: Chief Director, Original Creator, Series Composer, Scriptwriter, Sound Director. That\'s 5 main staff roles all burdened into one for some creative control, and I feel that while Masafumi Nishida might\'ve overworked himself to the core (as with MAPPA\'s inhumane work standards), with the upcoming Ex-Arm ""successor"" lookalike show that is Tesla Note (which is also written by this guy), I\'m not sure if Nishida-san is able to cope with the backlash that was the full-on CGI abomination when the anime comes out next season in Fall (trying to futureproof if it does look like Ex-Arm, which I hope it\'s not).Back to the anime, Re-Main tells the story and plot of water polo from the perspective of Minato Kiyomizu, who was a prolific water polo player in his middle school days, until a traffic accident led him to comatose and being an amnesiac. Exactly 203 days later (which I really find it very specific, anyone can tell me why), Minato is awakened, but he loses 3 years worth of his water polo memories in exchange, both skill and expertise. The challenge is that with his ""newfound"" brainwash of a memory, Minato remembers that he has done water polo before (at the slightest hint), and that everyone idolizes him because he was part of a winning team, so much that they tried to recruit him. Nonetheless, he would come back to water polo being the newbie veteran that needs to jog his memories every so now and then, abetted from a fellow girl athlete that challenged him to be Japan\'s top water polo athlete. Win, and they\'d be boyfriend-girlfriend; lose, and 110,000 yen (taxes inclusive) would be paid out from Minato\'s hands to her. If you can\'t tell already, Minato has a lot of things going for him at the height of his passion for water polo garnering fame and popularity, but alas the accident would tell a different story about a handsome guy like Minato, wearing a facade that breaks all expectations and reveals their true colours.Since this is a sports show, no doubt that the characters will have to play the most important aspect of the anime: sell their characters of their teamwork, camaraderie, and objectively their likeness reflected towards us the audience. But this is where Re-Main shows it\'s Achilles Heel of characters that are nothing more than one-note motivational spokespeople, while having their backstories as simple as possible to fit into the context of the entire anime. That\'s not to say that it\'s bad though, it\'s just that there was something missing towards the overall execution that kinda hampered my watching experience of watching so many sports shows come and gone, using them as bookmarkers of comparison. Maybe it\'s the idea of knowing who is your rival, should at least help to have a goal for yourself, that the anime failed to focus on what\'s important at certain scenes.Starting off with the MC Minato himself, the first thing you\'d see him of is the cheerful and innocent young boy look who kinda resembles the mentality of a 6th grader. And you\'d be right because of the loss of his memories that exhibits his youthful self to others. Turn things up a notch, and you\'d see a darker side of Minato, which is nothing like who he was initially. And take everything that I said about the ""Light"" Minato and turn it on its head to see a boy who is quite proud, arrogant, spiteful and full of ego because of his accomplishments, thinking that it\'s all a one-man show (which is painfully, obviously not). Minato, maybe you should learn this adage not to ""take things too far"". Minato\'s ""stalker"" Eitarou Oka is a spirited, bubbly boy who is like a walking encyclopedia about all things Minato related and not to mention water polo as well. But like Minato himself, Eitarou bases on lies and deceit just to follow the icon around in his tracks and acts whatever is appropriate to be like the water polo ace in every regard.I\'ll touch on the other players in a lightning round (because there isn\'t much to say about them):- The fellow Yamanami High players of Captain Jo Jojima, Shugo Amihama, Takekazu Ejiri, Yutaka Babayaro Inomata and Yoshiharu Ushimado, along with Minato and Eitarou. Captain Jo has to bear the beginning grunt of recruiting members into the water polo team. Shugo has a beef with his older brother, Shogakukan\'s Keita Kakihana, because he always felt that as much as he is a fellow sibling, he\'s also a rival that Shugo looked up to in swimming, before Keita\'s tonal shift to go water polo broke his momentum and gave up swimming altogether.

A shame, really.', 'Look, I absolutely love sports anime, so seeing Re-Main, a show about water polo of all things, I was so excited for some fun, tense, and hype stuff that even I enjoyed, but in the end, I was ultimately let down by some of the most outrages bullshit plots and *some* terribly boring or basic characters. Re-main has been a pretty forgettable experience as an anime.Plot/Story: 4/10 ""So how do we make an interesting show WITHOUT any of the steps to get there or making it airtight whatsoever"", well just do what Re-Main does. Basically, the main character gets in a fucking car crash, lands...himself in a coma for about 200 days or so, and on top of that just to the cherry on top, he loses 3 YEARS WORTH of memories. Which personally by my standards is a really big thing that should have a decent weight on the character\'s family and himself but no. They really just gloss over it all and honestly, I feel like it was brought up to some level of importance and does make some impact, but they all weep over it for like half an episode, and then oh it\'s straight back to water polo. They could have done this so much better, at least some resistance from a family member may be being tormented over almost losing their child to make it for real in a sense. but in the end, it feels like they put the most minimal effort into itCharacters: 5/10 honestly not much to say here, the main character isn\'t that bad whatsoever, and neither are any of the other characters, they all have something they want to strive for and work towards, and a really like that because it shows some level of care (unlike in some places). But this is where the compliments end for the cast, half the team at least which there are 7 of are the blankest, basic dead characters I\'ve seen in a while. if you go look up the tall \'cant play basketball\' guy, his description is that he\'s a gentle and soft person, mother fucker they are all like that seriously there\'s nothing to hate about them as people but come on something juicy at least. hit me hard with some of these guys. sadly on like 3 of them did, the main protagonist, the coach/senpai of the team, and the guy who really wants to surpass his brother.Art: 8/10 Mappa puts in work, the strongest point of this show IMO, Never ever thought was per say lacking in some points, so good job Mappa, very well done here truly.Sound: 7/10 Does just fine, sound doesn\'t really affect an anime for me unless it is actually unbearable at some points, but almost 95% of the time it honestly does not pose a problem at all. This is no different.Overall: 4/10 I was hoping for so much more from Re-Main but it\'s not a manga-based piece,its a collab with Mikasa the sporting goods brand so I guess I shouldn\'t have hyped myself up, but I did and were here now. and who knows maybe this opinion is subject to change but this is how I feel currently at this point in time himself in a coma for about 200 days or so, and on top of that just to the cherry on top, he loses 3 YEARS WORTH of memories. Which personally by my standards is a really big thing that should have a decent weight on the character\'s family and himself but no.

It feeld a bit like Minato is manipulated back into waterpolo by Chinu for about 22000 Yen (2000 or so euro) this just makes it feel cheap it would be better if Minato was trying to build a normal school life and then regain his passion after watching waterpolo. Plot wise ill give it a 5.Characters, I dont know what to say here the characters dont realy leave a deep impression on you even tough every episode in the begining of the serie was basicly im quiting for reason xyz and the rest of the team trying to make him stay with every ep being another character trying to get out. Ill give the characters a 7.Sound some people might like it but is wasn\'t anything particularly notecing for me, which tbh is not bad the sound is average not bad not good, its just there. Ill give the sound a 6.The art, im a bit split on it some parts where solidly done amazing animation and or clearly drawn what they where trying to express. Some parts however where not great to be frank. The 3d parts where also quite painfull especialy the field shots where it everyone was just 3d animated. I get why they might have done it but it just looks off. All in all ill give it a 7.Now last part my enjoyment, why do i still rate this show highly? Well i used to play waterpolo and this show had a ton of moments which where way to relatable because i have actualy experienced those moments it just hits diffrent for me. At some points i was screaming hoping the players would move as i wanted or swim faster. It felt like i was actualy spectating a match and honestly the feeling of wanting to jump into the pool and play the game was so nostalgic for me. And i will give the show a lot of bonus points for giving me this feeling of wanting to play again.But saying that there were plenty of moments that just felt off. I want to go ep by ep and just point out weird things(and also good things). That I noticed when watching so the next section will be SPOILER-extravaganza, in this section ill just point out specific things i liked or think are wrong. Ill put a disclaimer here this show is Japanese and im not so it can be that in Japan they just play under diffrent rules and or im misremembering stuff. Ill try to be specific and thus ill ad in the ep and time of what im trying to point out. The timings might not be acurate if the version you watched war crammed down or had something extra so take the timings as indicators.======Spoilers======Ep1--at 18:30 Oki commes up to Minato asking about waterpolo. I find this to be a bit weird since doesnt Oki understand that Minato just lost 3 years of memories thats a ton of school work he has to re do also Minato has to get his life back up and runnign so it would be quite understandable that Minato just does not have the time to spend on playing waterpolo.this bacticly contunues around 21:30 it just werids me out, let Minato rebuild his life and see if he still wants to play dont chase him for it.The sequence at 22:30 (which continues into ep 2 till 6:05) is just dumb. In this sequence Minato is basicly manipulated into playing again what would have been better is if he had seen his old teammates play or something other that would reignite his passion to play. Also why does he even trust her for all he knows she is just making up an amount of money to scam you. He should have just walked away from Chinu.Ep2--7:10 The fact that Joe put out those flyers, like that just would not fly. Joe should know that Minato had an accident or wasnt playing, since Minatos teammates are plastered on basicly every wall but mysteriously Minato isnt on those flyers like Joe you should know Minato might not be that good anymore.14:10 Joe says that keeper is the only thing you can train when your alone which is weird since how are you supposed to become a good keeper if there is no one to throw balls at you? like sure you could do the stamina and jumps ect. but keeping is about keeping balls out of the goal if there is no one to throw them then well.. It would be better if he said that he trained to be a regular player since you can train that on your own.15:00 its weid that Oki throws Minato under the bus here, like he clearly knows that Minato just spend 2/3ths of a year in bed no matter how amazing where your muscles are they will not survive a bedstay that long.16:40 The water apparantly is dangerous? Like at 11:48 they made it clear that they use wetsuits when the water is too cold. Allright so if the water is dangerously cold then why not use the wetsuits? (they will not be using wetsuits and will not even mention them in the rest of the show, so its just a bit weird that they got mentioned in the first place. Also there are 6 dudes still on solid ground atleast one of you can fish up Minato if he actualy gets into trouble.17:03 Yes a waterpolo ball is surprisingly big, lightweight, slippery and hard.17:16 Im going to nitpick, the fact that Minatos shoulders are out of the water is unrealistic. It takes quite a bit of effort in getting anything below your neck out of the water on a consistend basis, and Minato who doesnt even remember waterpolo should not be this much out of the water. This also aplies to Eijiri, since this is probably Eijiris first time playing in water.17:39 Got to give credit here, since Minato knows nothing of waterpolo his first instinct in keepign himself afloat would be this peddling. You can also see him peddle in shots at 17:23 and 17:37 its such a trivial point but its done beautifully. Why should you not peddle like that? well its because peddling does not keep you stable Minato should be going up and down like a bouy. This is in part why i hate the shot at 17:16 because Minato should either barely be keeping his head above the water or be going up and down quite some bit.at 18:00 Minato is going to use both his hands, he should be sinking like a brick when he does this since you use your hands to create additional upward thrust so taking both your hands and trying to throw a ball should sink him. But instead he remains steady and even rises a bit out of the water.18:15 beautiful jump, but then a bit later why is Oki impressed? did he think that lowly of Joe?19:23 just me nitpicking Minato without using his armes going that far out of the water is just so unrealistic lol.19:27 Yes cramp hurts like hell got to give credit here XD19:37 beautiful, just beautiful. I love this shot. In waterpolo you can push off from the sides so this technique lets you push off without a wall. this technique is also used when jumping out of the water in 18:15 altough they didnt bother to explain it. Also Eijiri does not know how to do this since this is his first time playing, i like that tiny detail.Ep3--Basicly this entire ep is just to convince Amihama to join and well he has his own reasons to not join and they probably should net be as persistend and just look elsewhere lol17:08 That should hurt lol, it should be pretty obvious how to dive right? Or is it just me thinking that everyone inately knows how to get into the water without hurting themselfs?Also side note for this ep since they arnt telling you it. But a standard swimmingpool is 25 meters by 12,5 meters so yes they can do 25 meters in one lap on the long side of the pool.19:57 nice technique. (they dont teach you this in waterpolo) Also i want to note that Amihama is probably used to an olympic sized swimmingpool which is atleast 50 meters long. So hes doing a lot more turns and push offs which should improve his speed compared to his personal record.at 20:03 you can see how much a good puch off can do basicly a dive or push off should be able to carry you 8 a 12 meters in a couple seconds, which is a lot faster then when you try and swim it instead.at 20:51 you can see Ushi trying to claw at the water, keep your fingers together so you can peddle with them and get more thrust out of them. Its weird that no one metnioned it to him since it can help your speed.21:09 those last 2 centimeters to the edge of the pool are allways the hardest love that small detail.Ep4--8:05 decent explaination ofcourse there is a whole lot more, but this is the case with every sport. Minor nitpick but the goal does not have to float there are goals you can plugg into the sides of the pool, maybe this is just a Japan thing? But floating goals take up like 2ish meters so this limits the play area to about 20 meters instead of the standard 25.8:11 i havent actualy seen a player formation like that the generic setup is 3:3 3 players somewhere inbetween 2 a 5 meters from the goal and the other 3 anywhere between de middle and 7 meters from the goal (i dont know the exact location since there are not that many distance markations on the field lol), again might be a Japan thing. Also that magnetic bord brings back memories lol.8:40 i never did the eggbeater on pavements lol but it gets the point across.8:49 is a good shot of the eggbeater in action. And right after see how everyone has dificulty in keeping their shoulders above water? Thats how it looks when your not doing it properly but practice makes perfect.9:20 i never practiced with weights like that and i would not recomend doing it especialy for beginers like Ushi, Baba, Eijiri and Amihama. What might be better is just holding a ball above your head it sounds easy but keep it up for a minute or 2 you will start to feel your legs lol.9:35 might be me but why was the swimmingpool build on like the 5th floor? a pool is heavy as hell so the unerlying structure better be beefy.10:15 i know the feeling XD11:25 Ill just make a note here about why you would want to be out of the water with your shoulders in the first place. When throwing the ball you will use your entire upper body or atleast that is how you are supposed to do it. Since water give a lot more resistance then air you want to get your arm, shoulder and upper body out of the water (as best as you can) so you are free to put all your energy into the ball so it will go faster, instead of putting your enery into moving your arm through water.16:10 it looks as if they have a toothache lol.16:36 His statement of dont barf actualy makes sense since if you eat too much before a match you will feel bloated, combine this with the fact that you will drink a sip or 2 of chlorinated water so make sure not to stuff yourself before a match.18:00 i googled this one lol, Hokuriko is a subregion in japan and contains the prefects of Toyama, Ichikawa and Fukui.Side note before they start the match, its customary to check if everyone cut their nails since people will be clawing away at eachother it is important for every player to have short nails its weird that they didnt show this maybe in Japan you can play with long nails? (Same goes for later eps btw)19:10 the traffic cones mark the 2 meter 5 meter (weirdly enough they use 3 cones i dont know the meaing behind the middle one in this situation), also the cone marking the middle is missing.20:50 amihama grabs the ball and then casualy lifts it up to throw, if you do this in a real match the opponent who was gunning for the ball will quite literly be on you, so what you should do it just shove the ball to the second or third player who sould be a meter or 4 behind you.20:56 This is a bit weird as there seems to be no contact between Oki and the kid when Oki drops the ball. So its weird that a foul was called.21:16 Ushi letting his guy go it a rookie mistake and someone should have told him to chase after your guy. And well why you should chase your guy is explained not in words a couple sec after the fact.21:30 we use goals with a rubber wall at the back so if someone throws a ball into our goal is will make a boom sound, it would have sounded a lot more dramatic if they had done that.Ep5--15 sec it says you cant punch the ball, i didnt think there would be a rule like this.  As far as i know you can youch or throw the ball with your entire body and its does not matter weather you hold the ball with a flat hand or punch it. But do mind that if you start swinging your legs or fists around the arbiter might mistake that for you trying to punch or kick someone and there is a severe penalty on that kind of behaviour.Also side note but since they are playing against grade schoolers the rule where your team can only hold the ball for 30 seconds is probably not used since you cant expect children to switch from defence to offence (and actualy setting up a proper attack) in under 30 seconds.45 sec it says you are allowed to grab onto swimwear, i was under the impression that was not allowed but well the arbitter cant see everything lol. So people will hold you down there. It does happen that your swimwear gets pulled of so this is the reason most waterpolo men wear 2 speedo\'s just in case one gets lost. Also an additional point this is also why waterpoloers dont wear jammer\'s (the swimmingpants Amihama wears) and swimshort\'s beacuse this provides extra fabric for your opponent to grab onto. Also women dont wear bikinis in waterpolo since such a flimsy thing will quite literly be ripped off, women instead wear a bathingsuit (the one chinu wore when looking at our team) which you cant rip off.1:05 Yes 12 yearolds can be ferocious lol, also Minato is holding the ball the opponent should be drowning him atm not pushing him, also about this opponent he is holding both hands out of the water you cant do that as a player.1:43 The kid is defending with the wrong arm. And Minato is just twidling his thumbs lol1:55 idk whos responsibility it was for defending player 8 but that guy is nowhere to be seen lol.2:32 Eijiri catching with one hand and throwing with another is probably a nod to his baseball past which i appreciate. but he should have learned by now that you catch and throw with the same hand. Also long distance shots usualy dont work since the keeper has plenty of time to anticipate the ball so throwing the ball at that range is just wasting it.5:10 yes a loss can sour the mood quite a bit but i guess its the same in every team sport.5:20 looking at the distance between defender en attackers, there was plenty of space to pass the ball also it seemed like a 3v1 so you should have easaly outplayed that one defender, and lastly why is the defender holding up his arm? is he blocking the way to Jupiter?6:37 ""we just lost to gradeschoolers"" i googled it again and they should be 15 a 16 years old the grade schoolers are probably 11 or 12 years old so there isnt that much of an age gab tbh.6:45 Yes you should seriously be looking for an 8th player, since its exhausting to play an match so getting a reserve who you can switch out in times of need is supper handy. Also its bound to happen that one of you is sick or late or injured or removed by the arbitter (it happends when you do 3 severe fouls or if you punched someone) if you dont have an 8th player when that happens you will be playing a permanent 6v7 until the end of the match, so getting an 8th player is a pretty big deal.7:33 see my point in ep4 16:36 ^^7:39 if you had let go of the ball he would be making a foul also letting go of the ball isnt the same as giving it to the enemy. Place the ball infront of you away from the opponent.The sequence at 9:40 is a bit creepy, you can judge this yourself lol. Also im under the impression that the team had so many reserve players that Oki never got the chance to play. but if a team has that many reserve players its better to just establish a new team and place them in a lower league. This way more people can play so no one is an eternal bench warmer. also reserve players are utilised in waterpolo since the sport is quite tiring it is common for everyone to play atleast a minute or 2 per match even if the team brings 7 reserve players (the maximum number of players a team may bring is 14 so 7 players 7 reserve). If Oki was an eternal benchwarmer i think he would be like the 8th reserve player(?) so it would be better to establish another team but i guess Japan just works diffrently.12:34 Yes this is basicly how far you want to get out of the water when shooting at the goal.14:35 getting the weight above your head is nice and all but you will need to strech your arms not have them be bendy, this is just so it increases the difficulty of holding the weight.18:50 This is just me but i hate Mikasa balls, because they are quite smooth and have little to no grip so they would always slip out of my hand XD, it might just be that every mikasa ball i ever handles was just old and worn.19:30 This, putting in more effort allways gives better results. I like this sequence since it just highlights why Minato was so good he put in a ton of effort to get there ofcourse it would seem like it was genetic or something since a lot of practice took place at home.20:05 This is kind of a plot hole, since i have pointed out a lot of simple mistakes that should have been vetted out by either Oki (who was on a top team and did train with the top team) or by Joe (who played this game alone for a couple years)Ep6--48 sec Baba is blocking with the wrong hand. Also im going to say it now but they keep wearing blue throughout this series, in waterpolo you switch between white caps and coloured caps (colour does not matter aslong as it isnt white or red the generic colour is blue) Home team plays in white and the away team plays in a coloured cap. Maybe this practice is diffrent in Japan?1:13 Minato should be cosplaying a submarine atm since hes just casualy holding the ball.4:25 The shampoo prank lol, its these small details that this show brings that realy make me want to keep watching, i will not be mentioning most of them since this ""review"" is allready getting way to long and i stil have 6 more eps to go.6:47 is this a real worry? I havnt watched many amnesia stories so i would not know.9:20 swimming 8 Km in 3 hours sure you can do it but i would expect that Ushi, Baba, Eijiri and Minato to be basicly dead after those 3 hours.9:54 Just stopping the ball straight up will make it bounce away fro myour hand to catch it you need to make your arm give way, this way your arm is allready in position to throw the ball once your one with catching it. (also this point might be unnesasary since it might have just been the angle at which we are looking at Oki)10:09 It happens and it will sting a bit but its not that big of a deal to take a shot from the ball atleast its better then getting a soccerball in your face.11:40 Ushi wanting to keep up with his teammates is relatable, please keep it up Ushi you can do it!As for the rest of the episode they just try to build Ushi\'s confidence and this is one of the shows highlights for me atleast.Ep7--20 sec i think he means concrete? asphalt is the blackstuff they use op highways and roads.1:04 here Baba is blocking with the correct arm.7:35 that backshot is beautiful21:20 Yeah its possible this can happen after a loss especially when its a game that you should not have lost. Still doesnt excuse you for being an ass.Ep8--Is just a solid episode it fits in with the logic that was built uit in other episodes.Ep9--The first 11:50 minutes are just an continuation of Ep 8 you get to know why Minato is the way he is and also why he doesnt want to play anymore its solid and it works in the story.17:35 Minato getting his memories back is probably the best thing that happend to this team since he can actualy guide them (something that Oki should have done tbh), its also good to see Minato failing, and not just having a power up because he got his memories back.18:35 they are allready keeping their shoulders dry on a consistent basis before Minatos feedback lol this might have been a better point if they werent allready doing it.22:00 i count 20 players, since the maximum number of players on one team is 14 it must mean that shoukakugan has 2 teams so its weird that Oki didnt get to play even on the weaker team.Ep10--3:50 finaly a bit of structure in their training scedule, it is good to have everyone focus on points where there is still room for improvement, alltough Amihama and Oki on swimming? i would put them on passing or shooting since they should allready have the stamina to go for a couple rounds.4:10 its better to have them learn how to defend, just keeping your hand up is very passive and passive wont give you the ball.6:35 blocking with the wrong arm.the training sequence is solid altough they only focus on stamina and strenght they dont seem to be doing any game practice.Ep11--4:55 i allready made a remark about Amihama\'s jammer in Ep 5, they dont restrict your movement at all tbh.Again the side note its weird that no one checked if everyone cut their nails, additional note in official matches there are allways 2 arbiters you will see them a bit later in this ep.5:30 The periods being 8 min long is a bit weird for me personaly since i only played 5 min and 6 min long periods, i allways thought 8 minutes was only for the olympics. Also im guessing here but they should be able to call for atleast one Time out, to change strats and or take a small breather during the game. You usualy cant call for a time out in a 5 min game but you are able to do so in a 6 min game so im guessing that you should also be able to call for a timeout in an 8 min game.6:00 the game potentialy being a hour long might sound odd but it realy depends on the arbitter if there are a lot of fouls the game will be stopped a lot, also if the arbitters disagree on a penalty they will start discussing it ammong themselfs the game will be stopped for this ofcourse but it can realy add to the match lenght, so a match that should only last 32 minutes could take an hour or maybe 2 if your realy unlucky, ofcourse the opposite is also true some games there are barely any fouls so the game will be done a lot faster.6:03 you can actualy touch the bottom this is ofcourse only possible if the pool isnt too deep. You can stand on the bottom of the pool when you dont have the ball, altough pushing off from the floor is  forbidden. And yes you can play waterpolo in pools that are only 1 meter deep, even during the game you can stand on the bottom alsong as you dont have the ball and dont push off, about the pushing off you can actualy do this aslong as the arbitters doesnt see you doing it :p6:10 yes the game wont start until both sides have 7 players in the water.6:44 here are the 2 arbitters (one on each side) you can also see the 2 meter and 5 meter marks as the coloured zones. I am however missing a middle marker.7:00 That is an dumb strat tbh, if all 6 of you are around Minato then that just means the 5 of you are free to do whatever you please, so Amihama and Eijiri should just be swimming to the goals and take potshots at it lol. Also with 6 players around Minato it also means he can kick and just be very annoying to the 6 of you. Its a shame that this anime does not show the underwater gameplay as much as it should, i recomend you search on youtube for ""Waterpolo ladies underwater"" those vids will show you the true meat and bones of this sport the underwater gameplay. (Also for if you are wondering why look up the ladies? Its because ladies are a lot more ferocious underwater then men are.)7:10 you can see Minato being pushed around a bit but honestly he should be pushing and pulling all 6 of them. Dont just stand there Minato do something lol.7:35 this is just where experiance shows the opponent knows the clock is about to run out and our noob team isnt paying attention to it.The following sequnce is just our team getting outplayed, our team just isnt reacint fast enough and isnt following their target. This is more about not ever having actualy practised offence and defence. Also the crowd is awfully quiet in real life the crowd will loudly inform you that you should be chasing your opponent XD, same goes for the coach but then again the coach doesnt relay understand the game.9:10 Ushi should not realy be so sad, the opponent is clearly outplaying him, if you are getting outplayed make sure someone will take up that slack.9:20 this i want more of this, also this is very tame underwater gameplay lol9:38 our pro Minato is blocking with the wrong arm XD9:45 Baba should be all over this dude giving him that much space to work with is just asking for trouble9:54 love this strat altough in the areal view there seems to be way too much space between the one Amihama is chasing and nr12, when screening you want to physicly block your opponent from following and yes expect your opponent to try and keep on swimming.9:58 Ushi just looking at a passing enemy is such a rookie mistake Amihama should be shouting out to him that he should follow nr9.10:00 Baba should be all over this dude the fact that he can leasurly hold the ball without him cosplaying a submarine is just beyond me, then again they did not practise defending so :/10:13 here you can see the point i wanted to make at 7:00 Amihama and Eijiri can just go around and get a 1v1 with the keeper, we know they can throw a decent shot so why arnt they trying atleast?10:18 yesits not legal to punch someone thats why you kick its far less conspicuous ;)10:30 someone should be on nr7\'s ass the fact that he can pick up the ball and throw means someone isnt following him close enough11:00 its unconventional that you try to break a strat like this by just going higher but fine it works i guess11:32 what is nr 12 blocking the way to Pluto?12:00 amazing shot, and it failing damn thats just way too relatable XD12:54 an 8th player would come in handy Ushi and Baba are beat and it would do wonders if you could bench them for like a minute or 213:10 thats the spirit! in the moment you will always think about how poorly your doing but honestly it could be a whole lot worse13:35 finaly changing the strat, minor point tho but you guys could have changed the strat between the first and second period.15:35 pulling away your opponent like that is a nice move, when you are in nr2\'s shoues well there is no right awnser for you in this situation since if he swam towards Amihama then that would leave Minato open and if he followed Minato that would leave Amihama open. In this instance i think its the right call for him to follow Minato since their team knows that Minato would be the bigger threat, since if he gets a free shot its bound to be a goal.15:55 This strat is a lot better then surrounding Minato with all 6 of your players lol, it still is a bit much at most you want to use 2 players to block the heavy hitter of the opposing team. one in between the keeper and minato and another infront of him so Minato cant be given the ball by his teammates and even if he got the ball he would still have to face the opponent behind him. One nitpick the guys sandwiching Minato are giving him too much space. as you can see in 15:59 Minato has been given enough room to manoeuvre this is unacceptable when sandwiching someone.16:03 blocking with the wrong hand16:30 what is Amihama blocking the way to Mercury? Also no one is on nr 7 hes completely open and can either do a backshot or just a normal throw if he was given the ball. You seriously need to be ON that guy if you want to neutralise his threat.16:44 pushing the ball under water is a foul.17:58 Minato and nr 7 should be cosplaying a submarine, also Baba is blocking with the wrong hand18:37 nice block but Baba should have been on this dude.18:48 if Minato turned around for a sec with a backstroke then he could have recieved the ball and just pushed onwards to the goal. Since as you can see later his opponent isnt able to catch up to him, then again they did not practis this so :/19:05 nice push, if you can do the eggbeater faster then your opponent you will just be able to body him away like you see here.19:17 as you can see Oki is left handed, being left handed is actualy quite an advantage since its decently rare and people usualy focus on defending against the right arm of an opponent, being left handed can throw off a lot of defenders.20:05 Joe\'s dad being the coach for next season (?)At the end of the match its customary to shake your opponents hand and say well played, or atleast thats what we where i played waterpolo.It might seem like im hating on this ep a lot but actualy most of what i said can all be choked up to rookie mistakes since they have been playing waterpolo for only 3 months and this is their first match, and hell all those rookie mistakes are very familiar to me since i know that i made them when i started playing.Ep12--2:39 This might be a Japanese thing, i never did this.3:45 ususaly the coaches of the teams are the ball handler, there will be a couple balls under the benches of the reserve players, ready to be thrown in whenever the ball leaved the bounds of the pool.4:30 usualy you have 1 hand on the line or wall of the pool so show that your ready, its also to prevent you from wandering too far forward and giving yourself a false start.5:00 finaly some solid pushing, but since Minato has the ball in his hand he should actualy be cosplaying a submarine XD. About pushing you can push someone with your body aslong as you arnt using your hand, also the point in pushing for a defender is so that the distance between the attacker and your goal is increased this should give your keeper a couple miliseconds so he can better react to an incomming shot, also an increased distance will mean that it is harder to accuratly land a shot for the attacker. So as an defender it is a priority to push the heavy hitter away from your goal. The inverse is true for the attacker, the closer you get to the goal the better your chances are at landing a goal, thats why you want to push the defender back.5:12 thats some good underwater work, altough that ball is way too deep underwater that will be a foul, also Minato holding the ball should lead to him being pulled down under water by the defender.5:15 nice back shot5:28 the fact that all of the blue team can keep ahead of the white team just means the pros arnt giving it their all lol, someone who is supposed to be the best will be faster basicly 100% of the time.5:32 Baba doing the waterpolo breststroke is nice, but his head isnt above the water so he cant actualy see the game around him. If he wanted to get to his home turf as fast as possible he should be using the regular breststroke, if he wanted an overview of what was going on he should be using the waterpolo breststroke and get his head out of the water. It might also just be the angle at which we are looking so i might be nitpicking too much.5:45 nice that Amihama contested that, but nr9 should not be sitting this out and go straight after him6:03 Minato attemting to get the ball back is such a smal detail i love it.6:12 Amihama is out of position he should be in between those 2 white players, baba should be going to the guy that is fast approaching him. The rest of the team needs to pick up speed but against the pro\'s thats going to be difficult.6:20 everyone just swimming away is weird atleast one white player should be contesting Ushi and Amihama6:24 this is one reason why you dont throw hand to hand but instead you throw it a bit in fron of Eijiri so the ball inst instantly grabbed away.6:32 luring out a foul finaly we get to see it, those arbitters have been way too passive lol.6:59 getting your hand out of the water is nice and all but if you do that you are pretty much stationary, the opponent will just go around you and find an open spot.Also they dont show it but the ususal attack formation in a man more situation is 4 players on the 2 meter line 2 on the 5m line with the defenders in between constantly switching between who they are defending.7:07 nr8 just letting Baba have the ball is quite nice of him.7:34 so close yet so far away :(8:00 this is a good example on what Baba should have done at 5:32, with this Minato can look around him and see where the opponent is and where the ball is, both are crucial.8:06 good sandwich, alltough you are giving him too much space Baba needs to be ON that guy, also 2 hands out of the water is a foul.8:27 Yes goign 0-0 is good but it cost them a ton of stamina, keeping up with pros just eats away at your stamina you might be teir equal in the first period but you sure as hell wont be in the last period.8:52 you have a full bench of reserve players dont even think of sending out the injured guy, also a stern talking will make the gloves come off.9:04 its weid seeing only Eijiri drinking usualy everyone brings a drink, you get thirsty from chlorinated water lol.10:37 Amihama is trying to grab the ball with the wrong hand, what you want to do is use the hand closest to the edge of the pool and shove the ball with that hand towards your second player.10:40 Riku just holding the ball menacingly, in reality Amihama should be goign full speed ahead and crash into him trying to pry away the ball lol10:50 Another instance of Baba not being agressive enough, hes just letting that guy walk all over him.11:25 look this is what should be happening to the heavy hitter, and what follows dont get too invested in pushing as you opponent can just use it against you like what happens in 11:3012:45 Baba get on him!12:56 hes using his hands on Minato which is a foul.13:50 as if the other team isnt using teamwork XD15:25 Yes the arbitter can penalize you when you use abrasive language. But making an entire team forfeit the match is a bit weird.15:42 a reminder to A, pay attention and B, only pass the ball to people who are currently looking or asking for the ball.16:22 Yes you can defend like that, its unconvensional but it stops Minatos team from passing the ball to him, it comes with risk however since Minato is not within your line of sight he can just silently swim away and also if he does manage to get the ball then there is nothing in between him and the keeper.Again no shaking hands. :/ but then again this is Japan======END OF SPOILER ZONE======Anyway i might seem annoyed at this show with all of these mistakes but i can chalk most of them up to rookie mistakes and or differing culture.Honestly during the last 2 episodes of this series i was shouting and creaming and rooting for Minato\'s team, for every play and every mistake brought back memories of when i was in that situation. Honestly at some points i wanted to jump through my screen and hop into the pool to do it myself, this is the first anime that tries to depict the sport i used to play and i fucking love it. I can see a lot of effort went into making this show and i hope there will be an second season ^^Yes i know most of this review isnt a review but i needed to get it off my chest lol, If you managed to get this far i hope you now understand waterpolo a bit better and i do hope you will atleast watch it a bit in real life (for example by watching the olympic livestreams or your local club they can be real fun)Im sorry for my crappy grammar and spelling, to create the spoiler part of this review i rewatched Re-Main and went over it bit by bit this ate up like 8 hours and MAL is starting to lagg because of the size of this review so im not going to do an extensive spelling check i hope you can understand. years of his memory.When he regains consciousness (about 2/3ths of a year later) he is faced with friends who he does not know and is also burdend with the image of him being a waterpolo champion which he just isnt after his accident.This premise was good but the execution was meh. It feeld a bit like Minato is manipulated back into waterpolo by Chinu for about 22000 Yen (2000 or so euro) this just makes it feel cheap it would be better if Minato was trying to build a normal school life and then regain his passion after watching waterpolo. Plot wise ill give it a 5.Characters, I dont know what to say here the characters dont realy leave a deep impression on you even tough every episode in the begining of the serie was basicly im quiting for reason xyz and the rest of the team trying to make him stay with every ep being another character trying to get out. Ill give the characters a 7.Sound some people might like it but is wasn\'t anything particularly notecing for me, which tbh is not bad the sound is average not bad not good, its just there. Ill give the sound a 6.The art, im a bit split on it some parts where solidly done amazing animation and or clearly drawn what they where trying to express. Some parts however where not great to be frank. The 3d parts where also quite painfull especialy the field shots where it everyone was just 3d animated. I get why they might have done it but it just looks off. All in all ill give it a 7.Now last part my enjoyment, why do i still rate this show highly? Well i used to play waterpolo and this show had a ton of moments which where way to relatable because i have actualy experienced those moments it just hits diffrent for me. At some points i was screaming hoping the players would move as i wanted or swim faster. It felt like i was actualy spectating a match and honestly the feeling of wanting to jump into the pool and play the game was so nostalgic for me. And i will give the show a lot of bonus points for giving me this feeling of wanting to play again.But saying that there were plenty of moments that just felt off. I want to go ep by ep and just point out weird things(and also good things). That I noticed when watching so the next section will be SPOILER-extravaganza, in this section ill just point out specific things i liked or think are wrong. Ill put a disclaimer here this show is Japanese and im not so it can be that in Japan they just play under diffrent rules and or im misremembering stuff. Ill try to be specific and thus ill ad in the ep and time of what im trying to point out. The timings might not be acurate if the version you watched war crammed down or had something extra so take the timings as indicators.======Spoilers======Ep1--at 18:30 Oki commes up to Minato asking about waterpolo. I find this to be a bit weird since doesnt Oki understand that Minato just lost 3 years of memories thats a ton of school work he has to re do also Minato has to get his life back up and runnign so it would be quite understandable that Minato just does not have the time to spend on playing waterpolo.this bacticly contunues around 21:30 it just werids me out, let Minato rebuild his life and see if he still wants to play dont chase him for it.The sequence at 22:30 (which continues into ep 2 till 6:05) is just dumb. In this sequence Minato is basicly manipulated into playing again what would have been better is if he had seen his old teammates play or something other that would reignite his passion to play. Also why does he even trust her for all he knows she is just making up an amount of money to scam you. He should have just walked away from Chinu.Ep2--7:10 The fact that Joe put out those flyers, like that just would not fly. Joe should know that Minato had an accident or wasnt playing, since Minatos teammates are plastered on basicly every wall but mysteriously Minato isnt on those flyers like Joe you should know Minato might not be that good anymore.14:10 Joe says that keeper is the only thing you can train when your alone which is weird since how are you supposed to become a good keeper if there is no one to throw balls at you? like sure you could do the stamina and jumps ect. but keeping is about keeping balls out of the goal if there is no one to throw them then well.. It would be better if he said that he trained to be a regular player since you can train that on your own.15:00 its weid that Oki throws Minato under the bus here, like he clearly knows that Minato just spend 2/3ths of a year in bed no matter how amazing where your muscles are they will not survive a bedstay that long.16:40 The water apparantly is dangerous? Like at 11:48 they made it clear that they use wetsuits when the water is too cold. Allright so if the water is dangerously cold then why not use the wetsuits? (they will not be using wetsuits and will not even mention them in the rest of the show, so its just a bit weird that they got mentioned in the first place. Also there are 6 dudes still on solid ground atleast one of you can fish up Minato if he actualy gets into trouble.17:03 Yes a waterpolo ball is surprisingly big, lightweight, slippery and hard.17:16 Im going to nitpick, the fact that Minatos shoulders are out of the water is unrealistic. It takes quite a bit of effort in getting anything below your neck out of the water on a consistend basis, and Minato who doesnt even remember waterpolo should not be this much out of the water. This also aplies to Eijiri, since this is probably Eijiris first time playing in water.17:39 Got to give credit here, since Minato knows nothing of waterpolo his first instinct in keepign himself afloat would be this peddling. You can also see him peddle in shots at 17:23 and 17:37 its such a trivial point but its done beautifully. Why should you not peddle like that? well its because peddling does not keep you stable Minato should be going up and down like a bouy. This is in part why i hate the shot at 17:16 because Minato should either barely be keeping his head above the water or be going up and down quite some bit.at 18:00 Minato is going to use both his hands, he should be sinking like a brick when he does this since you use your hands to create additional upward thrust so taking both your hands and trying to throw a ball should sink him. But instead he remains steady and even rises a bit out of the water.18:15 beautiful jump, but then a bit later why is Oki impressed? did he think that lowly of Joe?19:23 just me nitpicking Minato without using his armes going that far out of the water is just so unrealistic lol.19:27 Yes cramp hurts like hell got to give credit here XD19:37 beautiful, just beautiful. I love this shot. In waterpolo you can push off from the sides so this technique lets you push off without a wall. this technique is also used when jumping out of the water in 18:15 altough they didnt bother to explain it. Also Eijiri does not know how to do this since this is his first time playing, i like that tiny detail.Ep3--Basicly this entire ep is just to convince Amihama to join and well he has his own reasons to not join and they probably should net be as persistend and just look elsewhere lol17:08 That should hurt lol, it should be pretty obvious how to dive right? Or is it just me thinking that everyone inately knows how to get into the water without hurting themselfs?Also side note for this ep since they arnt telling you it. But a standard swimmingpool is 25 meters by 12,5 meters so yes they can do 25 meters in one lap on the long side of the pool.19:57 nice technique. (they dont teach you this in waterpolo) Also i want to note that Amihama is probably used to an olympic sized swimmingpool which is atleast 50 meters long. So hes doing a lot more turns and push offs which should improve his speed compared to his personal record.at 20:03 you can see how much a good puch off can do basicly a dive or push off should be able to carry you 8 a 12 meters in a couple seconds, which is a lot faster then when you try and swim it instead.at 20:51 you can see Ushi trying to claw at the water, keep your fingers together so you can peddle with them and get more thrust out of them. Its weird that no one metnioned it to him since it can help your speed.21:09 those last 2 centimeters to the edge of the pool are allways the hardest love that small detail.Ep4--8:05 decent explaination ofcourse there is a whole lot more, but this is the case with every sport. Minor nitpick but the goal does not have to float there are goals you can plugg into the sides of the pool, maybe this is just a Japan thing? But floating goals take up like 2ish meters so this limits the play area to about 20 meters instead of the standard 25.8:11 i havent actualy seen a player formation like that the generic setup is 3:3 3 players somewhere inbetween 2 a 5 meters from the goal and the other 3 anywhere between de middle and 7 meters from the goal (i dont know the exact location since there are not that many distance markations on the field lol), again might be a Japan thing. Also that magnetic bord brings back memories lol.8:40 i never did the eggbeater on pavements lol but it gets the point across.8:49 is a good shot of the eggbeater in action. And right after see how everyone has dificulty in keeping their shoulders above water? Thats how it looks when your not doing it properly but practice makes perfect.9:20 i never practiced with weights like that and i would not recomend doing it especialy for beginers like Ushi, Baba, Eijiri and Amihama. What might be better is just holding a ball above your head it sounds easy but keep it up for a minute or 2 you will start to feel your legs lol.9:35 might be me but why was the swimmingpool build on like the 5th floor? a pool is heavy as hell so the unerlying structure better be beefy.10:15 i know the feeling XD11:25 Ill just make a note here about why you would want to be out of the water with your shoulders in the first place. When throwing the ball you will use your entire upper body or atleast that is how you are supposed to do it. Since water give a lot more resistance then air you want to get your arm, shoulder and upper body out of the water (as best as you can) so you are free to put all your energy into the ball so it will go faster, instead of putting your enery into moving your arm through water.16:10 it looks as if they have a toothache lol.16:36 His statement of dont barf actualy makes sense since if you eat too much before a match you will feel bloated, combine this with the fact that you will drink a sip or 2 of chlorinated water so make sure not to stuff yourself before a match.18:00 i googled this one lol, Hokuriko is a subregion in japan and contains the prefects of Toyama, Ichikawa and Fukui.Side note before they start the match, its customary to check if everyone cut their nails since people will be clawing away at eachother it is important for every player to have short nails its weird that they didnt show this maybe in Japan you can play with long nails? (Same goes for later eps btw)19:10 the traffic cones mark the 2 meter 5 meter (weirdly enough they use 3 cones i dont know the meaing behind the middle one in this situation), also the cone marking the middle is missing.20:50 amihama grabs the ball and then casualy lifts it up to throw, if you do this in a real match the opponent who was gunning for the ball will quite literly be on you, so what you should do it just shove the ball to the second or third player who sould be a meter or 4 behind you.20:56 This is a bit weird as there seems to be no contact between Oki and the kid when Oki drops the ball. So its weird that a foul was called.21:16 Ushi letting his guy go it a rookie mistake and someone should have told him to chase after your guy. And well why you should chase your guy is explained not in words a couple sec after the fact.21:30 we use goals with a rubber wall at the back so if someone throws a ball into our goal is will make a boom sound, it would have sounded a lot more dramatic if they had done that.Ep5--15 sec it says you cant punch the ball, i didnt think there would be a rule like this.  As far as i know you can youch or throw the ball with your entire body and its does not matter weather you hold the ball with a flat hand or punch it. But do mind that if you start swinging your legs or fists around the arbiter might mistake that for you trying to punch or kick someone and there is a severe penalty on that kind of behaviour.Also side note but since they are playing against grade schoolers the rule where your team can only hold the ball for 30 seconds is probably not used since you cant expect children to switch from defence to offence (and actualy setting up a proper attack) in under 30 seconds.45 sec it says you are allowed to grab onto swimwear, i was under the impression that was not allowed but well the arbitter cant see everything lol. So people will hold you down there. It does happen that your swimwear gets pulled of so this is the reason most waterpolo men wear 2 speedo\'s just in case one gets lost. Also an additional point this is also why waterpoloers dont wear jammer\'s (the swimmingpants Amihama wears) and swimshort\'s beacuse this provides extra fabric for your opponent to grab onto. Also women dont wear bikinis in waterpolo since such a flimsy thing will quite literly be ripped off, women instead wear a bathingsuit (the one chinu wore when looking at our team) which you cant rip off.1:05 Yes 12 yearolds can be ferocious lol, also Minato is holding the ball the opponent should be drowning him atm not pushing him, also about this opponent he is holding both hands out of the water you cant do that as a player.1:43 The kid is defending with the wrong arm. And Minato is just twidling his thumbs lol1:55 idk whos responsibility it was for defending player 8 but that guy is nowhere to be seen lol.2:32 Eijiri catching with one hand and throwing with another is probably a nod to his baseball past which i appreciate. but he should have learned by now that you catch and throw with the same hand. Also long distance shots usualy dont work since the keeper has plenty of time to anticipate the ball so throwing the ball at that range is just wasting it.5:10 yes a loss can sour the mood quite a bit but i guess its the same in every team sport.5:20 looking at the distance between defender en attackers, there was plenty of space to pass the ball also it seemed like a 3v1 so you should have easaly outplayed that one defender, and lastly why is the defender holding up his arm? is he blocking the way to Jupiter?6:37 ""we just lost to gradeschoolers"" i googled it again and they should be 15 a 16 years old the grade schoolers are probably 11 or 12 years old so there isnt that much of an age gab tbh.6:45 Yes you should seriously be looking for an 8th player, since its exhausting to play an match so getting a reserve who you can switch out in times of need is supper handy. Also its bound to happen that one of you is sick or late or injured or removed by the arbitter (it happends when you do 3 severe fouls or if you punched someone) if you dont have an 8th player when that happens you will be playing a permanent 6v7 until the end of the match, so getting an 8th player is a pretty big deal.7:33 see my point in ep4 16:36 ^^7:39 if you had let go of the ball he would be making a foul also letting go of the ball isnt the same as giving it to the enemy. Place the ball infront of you away from the opponent.The sequence at 9:40 is a bit creepy, you can judge this yourself lol. Also im under the impression that the team had so many reserve players that Oki never got the chance to play. but if a team has that many reserve players its better to just establish a new team and place them in a lower league. This way more people can play so no one is an eternal bench warmer. also reserve players are utilised in waterpolo since the sport is quite tiring it is common for everyone to play atleast a minute or 2 per match even if the team brings 7 reserve players (the maximum number of players a team may bring is 14 so 7 players 7 reserve). If Oki was an eternal benchwarmer i think he would be like the 8th reserve player(?) so it would be better to establish another team but i guess Japan just works diffrently.12:34 Yes this is basicly how far you want to get out of the water when shooting at the goal.14:35 getting the weight above your head is nice and all but you will need to strech your arms not have them be bendy, this is just so it increases the difficulty of holding the weight.18:50 This is just me but i hate Mikasa balls, because they are quite smooth and have little to no grip so they would always slip out of my hand XD, it might just be that every mikasa ball i ever handles was just old and worn.19:30 This, putting in more effort allways gives better results. I like this sequence since it just highlights why Minato was so good he put in a ton of effort to get there ofcourse it would seem like it was genetic or something since a lot of practice took place at home.20:05 This is kind of a plot hole, since i have pointed out a lot of simple mistakes that should have been vetted out by either Oki (who was on a top team and did train with the top team) or by Joe (who played this game alone for a couple years)Ep6--48 sec Baba is blocking with the wrong hand. Also im going to say it now but they keep wearing blue throughout this series, in waterpolo you switch between white caps and coloured caps (colour does not matter aslong as it isnt white or red the generic colour is blue) Home team plays in white and the away team plays in a coloured cap. Maybe this practice is diffrent in Japan?1:13 Minato should be cosplaying a submarine atm since hes just casualy holding the ball.4:25 The shampoo prank lol, its these small details that this show brings that realy make me want to keep watching, i will not be mentioning most of them since this ""review"" is allready getting way to long and i stil have 6 more eps to go.6:47 is this a real worry? I havnt watched many amnesia stories so i would not know.9:20 swimming 8 Km in 3 hours sure you can do it but i would expect that Ushi, Baba, Eijiri and Minato to be basicly dead after those 3 hours.9:54 Just stopping the ball straight up will make it bounce away fro myour hand to catch it you need to make your arm give way, this way your arm is allready in position to throw the ball once your one with catching it. (also this point might be unnesasary since it might have just been the angle at which we are looking at Oki)10:09 It happens and it will sting a bit but its not that big of a deal to take a shot from the ball atleast its better then getting a soccerball in your face.11:40 Ushi wanting to keep up with his teammates is relatable, please keep it up Ushi you can do it!As for the rest of the episode they just try to build Ushi\'s confidence and this is one of the shows highlights for me atleast.Ep7--20 sec i think he means concrete? asphalt is the blackstuff they use op highways and roads.1:04 here Baba is blocking with the correct arm.7:35 that backshot is beautiful21:20 Yeah its possible this can happen after a loss especially when its a game that you should not have lost. Still doesnt excuse you for being an ass.Ep8--Is just a solid episode it fits in with the logic that was built uit in other episodes.Ep9--The first 11:50 minutes are just an continuation of Ep 8 you get to know why Minato is the way he is and also why he doesnt want to play anymore its solid and it works in the story.17:35 Minato getting his memories back is probably the best thing that happend to this team since he can actualy guide them (something that Oki should have done tbh), its also good to see Minato failing, and not just having a power up because he got his memories back.18:35 they are allready keeping their shoulders dry on a consistent basis before Minatos feedback lol this might have been a better point if they werent allready doing it.22:00 i count 20 players, since the maximum number of players on one team is 14 it must mean that shoukakugan has 2 teams so its weird that Oki didnt get to play even on the weaker team.Ep10--3:50 finaly a bit of structure in their training scedule, it is good to have everyone focus on points where there is still room for improvement, alltough Amihama and Oki on swimming? i would put them on passing or shooting since they should allready have the stamina to go for a couple rounds.4:10 its better to have them learn how to defend, just keeping your hand up is very passive and passive wont give you the ball.6:35 blocking with the wrong arm.the training sequence is solid altough they only focus on stamina and strenght they dont seem to be doing any game practice.Ep11--4:55 i allready made a remark about Amihama\'s jammer in Ep 5, they dont restrict your movement at all tbh.Again the side note its weird that no one checked if everyone cut their nails, additional note in official matches there are allways 2 arbiters you will see them a bit later in this ep.5:30 The periods being 8 min long is a bit weird for me personaly since i only played 5 min and 6 min long periods, i allways thought 8 minutes was only for the olympics. Also im guessing here but they should be able to call for atleast one Time out, to change strats and or take a small breather during the game. You usualy cant call for a time out in a 5 min game but you are able to do so in a 6 min game so im guessing that you should also be able to call for a timeout in an 8 min game.6:00 the game potentialy being a hour long might sound odd but it realy depends on the arbitter if there are a lot of fouls the game will be stopped a lot, also if the arbitters disagree on a penalty they will start discussing it ammong themselfs the game will be stopped for this ofcourse but it can realy add to the match lenght, so a match that should only last 32 minutes could take an hour or maybe 2 if your realy unlucky, ofcourse the opposite is also true some games there are barely any fouls so the game will be done a lot faster.6:03 you can actualy touch the bottom this is ofcourse only possible if the pool isnt too deep. You can stand on the bottom of the pool when you dont have the ball, altough pushing off from the floor is  forbidden. And yes you can play waterpolo in pools that are only 1 meter deep, even during the game you can stand on the bottom alsong as you dont have the ball and dont push off, about the pushing off you can actualy do this aslong as the arbitters doesnt see you doing it :p6:10 yes the game wont start until both sides have 7 players in the water.6:44 here are the 2 arbitters (one on each side) you can also see the 2 meter and 5 meter marks as the coloured zones. I am however missing a middle marker.7:00 That is an dumb strat tbh, if all 6 of you are around Minato then that just means the 5 of you are free to do whatever you please, so Amihama and Eijiri should just be swimming to the goals and take potshots at it lol. Also with 6 players around Minato it also means he can kick and just be very annoying to the 6 of you. Its a shame that this anime does not show the underwater gameplay as much as it should, i recomend you search on youtube for ""Waterpolo ladies underwater"" those vids will show you the true meat and bones of this sport the underwater gameplay. (Also for if you are wondering why look up the ladies? Its because ladies are a lot more ferocious underwater then men are.)7:10 you can see Minato being pushed around a bit but honestly he should be pushing and pulling all 6 of them. Dont just stand there Minato do something lol.7:35 this is just where experiance shows the opponent knows the clock is about to run out and our noob team isnt paying attention to it.The following sequnce is just our team getting outplayed, our team just isnt reacint fast enough and isnt following their target. This is more about not ever having actualy practised offence and defence. Also the crowd is awfully quiet in real life the crowd will loudly inform you that you should be chasing your opponent XD, same goes for the coach but then again the coach doesnt relay understand the game.9:10 Ushi should not realy be so sad, the opponent is clearly outplaying him, if you are getting outplayed make sure someone will take up that slack.9:20 this i want more of this, also this is very tame underwater gameplay lol9:38 our pro Minato is blocking with the wrong arm XD9:45 Baba should be all over this dude giving him that much space to work with is just asking for trouble9:54 love this strat altough in the areal view there seems to be way too much space between the one Amihama is chasing and nr12, when screening you want to physicly block your opponent from following and yes expect your opponent to try and keep on swimming.9:58 Ushi just looking at a passing enemy is such a rookie mistake Amihama should be shouting out to him that he should follow nr9.10:00 Baba should be all over this dude the fact that he can leasurly hold the ball without him cosplaying a submarine is just beyond me, then again they did not practise defending so :/10:13 here you can see the point i wanted to make at 7:00 Amihama and Eijiri can just go around and get a 1v1 with the keeper, we know they can throw a decent shot so why arnt they trying atleast?10:18 yesits not legal to punch someone thats why you kick its far less conspicuous ;)10:30 someone should be on nr7\'s ass the fact that he can pick up the ball and throw means someone isnt following him close enough11:00 its unconventional that you try to break a strat like this by just going higher but fine it works i guess11:32 what is nr 12 blocking the way to Pluto?12:00 amazing shot, and it failing damn thats just way too relatable XD12:54 an 8th player would come in handy Ushi and Baba are beat and it would do wonders if you could bench them for like a minute or 213:10 thats the spirit! in the moment you will always think about how poorly your doing but honestly it could be a whole lot worse13:35 finaly changing the strat, minor point tho but you guys could have changed the strat between the first and second period.15:35 pulling away your opponent like that is a nice move, when you are in nr2\'s shoues well there is no right awnser for you in this situation since if he swam towards Amihama then that would leave Minato open and if he followed Minato that would leave Amihama open. In this instance i think its the right call for him to follow Minato since their team knows that Minato would be the bigger threat, since if he gets a free shot its bound to be a goal.15:55 This strat is a lot better then surrounding Minato with all 6 of your players lol, it still is a bit much at most you want to use 2 players to block the heavy hitter of the opposing team. one in between the keeper and minato and another infront of him so Minato cant be given the ball by his teammates and even if he got the ball he would still have to face the opponent behind him. One nitpick the guys sandwiching Minato are giving him too much space. as you can see in 15:59 Minato has been given enough room to manoeuvre this is unacceptable when sandwiching someone.16:03 blocking with the wrong hand16:30 what is Amihama blocking the way to Mercury? Also no one is on nr 7 hes completely open and can either do a backshot or just a normal throw if he was given the ball. You seriously need to be ON that guy if you want to neutralise his threat.16:44 pushing the ball under water is a foul.17:58 Minato and nr 7 should be cosplaying a submarine, also Baba is blocking with the wrong hand18:37 nice block but Baba should have been on this dude.18:48 if Minato turned around for a sec with a backstroke then he could have recieved the ball and just pushed onwards to the goal. Since as you can see later his opponent isnt able to catch up to him, then again they did not practis this so :/19:05 nice push, if you can do the eggbeater faster then your opponent you will just be able to body him away like you see here.19:17 as you can see Oki is left handed, being left handed is actualy quite an advantage since its decently rare and people usualy focus on defending against the right arm of an opponent, being left handed can throw off a lot of defenders.20:05 Joe\'s dad being the coach for next season (?)At the end of the match its customary to shake your opponents hand and say well played, or atleast thats what we where i played waterpolo.It might seem like im hating on this ep a lot but actualy most of what i said can all be choked up to rookie mistakes since they have been playing waterpolo for only 3 months and this is their first match, and hell all those rookie mistakes are very familiar to me since i know that i made them when i started playing.Ep12--2:39 This might be a Japanese thing, i never did this.3:45 ususaly the coaches of the teams are the ball handler, there will be a couple balls under the benches of the reserve players, ready to be thrown in whenever the ball leaved the bounds of the pool.4:30 usualy you have 1 hand on the line or wall of the pool so show that your ready, its also to prevent you from wandering too far forward and giving yourself a false start.5:00 finaly some solid pushing, but since Minato has the ball in his hand he should actualy be cosplaying a submarine XD. About pushing you can push someone with your body aslong as you arnt using your hand, also the point in pushing for a defender is so that the distance between the attacker and your goal is increased this should give your keeper a couple miliseconds so he can better react to an incomming shot, also an increased distance will mean that it is harder to accuratly land a shot for the attacker. So as an defender it is a priority to push the heavy hitter away from your goal. The inverse is true for the attacker, the closer you get to the goal the better your chances are at landing a goal, thats why you want to push the defender back.5:12 thats some good underwater work, altough that ball is way too deep underwater that will be a foul, also Minato holding the ball should lead to him being pulled down under water by the defender.5:15 nice back shot5:28 the fact that all of the blue team can keep ahead of the white team just means the pros arnt giving it their all lol, someone who is supposed to be the best will be faster basicly 100% of the time.5:32 Baba doing the waterpolo breststroke is nice, but his head isnt above the water so he cant actualy see the game around him. If he wanted to get to his home turf as fast as possible he should be using the regular breststroke, if he wanted an overview of what was going on he should be using the waterpolo breststroke and get his head out of the water. It might also just be the angle at which we are looking so i might be nitpicking too much.5:45 nice that Amihama contested that, but nr9 should not be sitting this out and go straight after him6:03 Minato attemting to get the ball back is such a smal detail i love it.6:12 Amihama is out of position he should be in between those 2 white players, baba should be going to the guy that is fast approaching him. The rest of the team needs to pick up speed but against the pro\'s thats going to be difficult.6:20 everyone just swimming away is weird atleast one white player should be contesting Ushi and Amihama6:24 this is one reason why you dont throw hand to hand but instead you throw it a bit in fron of Eijiri so the ball inst instantly grabbed away.6:32 luring out a foul finaly we get to see it, those arbitters have been way too passive lol.6:59 getting your hand out of the water is nice and all but if you do that you are pretty much stationary, the opponent will just go around you and find an open spot.Also they dont show it but the ususal attack formation in a man more situation is 4 players on the 2 meter line 2 on the 5m line with the defenders in between constantly switching between who they are defending.7:07 nr8 just letting Baba have the ball is quite nice of him.7:34 so close yet so far away :(8:00 this is a good example on what Baba should have done at 5:32, with this Minato can look around him and see where the opponent is and where the ball is, both are crucial.8:06 good sandwich, alltough you are giving him too much space Baba needs to be ON that guy, also 2 hands out of the water is a foul.8:27 Yes goign 0-0 is good but it cost them a ton of stamina, keeping up with pros just eats away at your stamina you might be teir equal in the first period but you sure as hell wont be in the last period.8:52 you have a full bench of reserve players dont even think of sending out the injured guy, also a stern talking will make the gloves come off.9:04 its weid seeing only Eijiri drinking usualy everyone brings a drink, you get thirsty from chlorinated water lol.10:37 Amihama is trying to grab the ball with the wrong hand, what you want to do is use the hand closest to the edge of the pool and shove the ball with that hand towards your second player.10:40 Riku just holding the ball menacingly, in reality Amihama should be goign full speed ahead and crash into him trying to pry away the ball lol10:50 Another instance of Baba not being agressive enough, hes just letting that guy walk all over him.11:25 look this is what should be happening to the heavy hitter, and what follows dont get too invested in pushing as you opponent can just use it against you like what happens in 11:3012:45 Baba get on him!12:56 hes using his hands on Minato which is a foul.13:50 as if the other team isnt using teamwork XD15:25 Yes the arbitter can penalize you when you use abrasive language. But making an entire team forfeit the match is a bit weird.15:42 a reminder to A, pay attention and B, only pass the ball to people who are currently looking or asking for the ball.16:22 Yes you can defend like that, its unconvensional but it stops Minatos team from passing the ball to him, it comes with risk however since Minato is not within your line of sight he can just silently swim away and also if he does manage to get the ball then there is nothing in between him and the keeper.Again no shaking hands. :/ but then again this is Japan======END OF SPOILER ZONE======Anyway i might seem annoyed at this show with all of these mistakes but i can chalk most of them up to rookie mistakes and or differing culture.Honestly during the last 2 episodes of this series i was shouting and creaming and rooting for Minato\'s team, for every play and every mistake brought back memories of when i was in that situation. Honestly at some points i wanted to jump through my screen and hop into the pool to do it myself, this is the first anime that tries to depict the sport i used to play and i fucking love it. I can see a lot of effort went into making this show and i hope there will be an second season ^^Yes i know most of this review isnt a review but i needed to get it off my chest lol, If you managed to get this far i hope you now understand waterpolo a bit better and i do hope you will atleast watch it a bit in real life (for example by watching the olympic livestreams or your local club they can be real fun)Im sorry for my crappy grammar and spelling, to create the spoiler part of this review i rewatched Re-Main and went over it bit by bit this ate up like 8 hours and MAL is starting to lagg because of the size of this review so im not going to do an extensive spelling check i hope you can understand.', 'Story:I really like the combination of melancholy and funny moment in this anime. We learn their backstory, foreshadowing what kind of problem they have. They explain the rules of water polo in easy to understand manner ( for example child draw). In the first episode, we also see how people suffer because of the accident like you can see when Minato eat with his family (His family sad that Minato not interested to do something he loves before) or when her sister cry in the middle of the night because of trauma. It seems this happen from time to time. Well, of course the anime...won\'t show this all the time since their focus is water polo and they also have other character to explore.Character:Since first episode, we already know that Minato suffering because of expectation by people around him and how he is not the same anymore (his body for example). Maybe many people who watch this don\'t realize but you can tell from his facial expression.The other character who is already explored a bit is Eitarou. In episode 5, we know that he is haraguro, selfish and rude. We already see foreshadow of it since first episode. We also see his character development in episode 5.The other character is most likely will be explored too since we already see foreshadow of Joujima with his father.Why I explain all of this? It seems many people think these character is really shallow when it\'s not. Minato is not only easy to adapt but he is also a really positive person. I am similar with Minato in which I easily adapt to situation and I can easily change my emotion and my face, it makes many people think I am okay when I am actually not.  So it really bothered me to see some people say, ""Minato seems okay even if he lose his memory"" when this anime obviously show us in every episode that he is actually troubled by the fact that he lose his memory.I think the characters can be classified to certain stereotype but I don\'t think there is something wrong with that as long as they have depth. Even we, as human being, often being classified by our personality, for example: MBTI, Enneagram. Big Five Personality, etc. And I see potential of this anime explore them more since I already see foreshadow of it.Art:It\'s MAPPA so the animation is really good.Enjoyment:I enjoy this anime and I don\'t have major complain. I hope they explore the character more and also we will learn more about waterpolo in later episode. won\'t show this all the time since their focus is water polo and they also have other character to explore.Character:Since first episode, we already know that Minato suffering because of expectation by people around him and how he is not the same anymore (his body for example).

If you like “Free!” and want more of that, but not a knock-off, despite the fact that these are both for sports that take place in water, try this. It’s tropey in an absolutely wonderful way (honestly it gets really cliche at one point but it’s used quite well, or at least worth sticking through for the painful but good character moments), with beautiful animation, beautiful music, a wonderful cast who are lovely and also mostly ikemen in speedos, and honestly a lot of great messages.I haven’t seen a series that...handles major injuries and deconstructing stereotypes the way this one does, particularly the former. Yes, it’s cliche, but it treats Minato’s injury and recovery in a way you don’t really see that often. At least not since “Yuri on Ice!” or “Fullmetal Alchemist”. It also really focuses on how self-centered most everyone is around Minato’s injury, and how hard it is for junior high and high school athletes to excel, and the many pressures they have. There is a time crunch at that age, and people can break at the smallest losses, because the pressure is that bad. The show doesn’t present a solution for the problem (not that it has to), but it does point out that it’s not just one factor in the whole area of sports that creates the problem overall. It’s everything, whether it’s unsympathetic coaches, toxic masculinity, distant family members, the issues of growing up as a child of separated or divorced parents, particularly with a sibling involved, class status, simply time and effort… It’s just a lot. And the story also focuses on the fact that it is effort, not talent, that gets people ahead. That’s typical of sports shows, of course, but it’s emphasized in really unique ways.The show also deals with little oddities you might write off as bad research or narrative shortcuts via anime cliches, but later brings it up “oh yeah, no, this is something that is a sign of inexperience/lack of knowledge on the characters part” and it’s really brilliant world-building that you just discount until you’re like “ohhhh”, though if you’ve been paying attention, you already took in the details and could have figured it out on your own. For instance, when they eat before a match (I used to be a competitive swimmer, this one bugged me). The pay-off isn’t typically immediate, but when it shows up, it makes perfect sense. Not as I guess a plot hole filler, but in a way you realize why it hasn’t been addressed prior to this. There’s a brief moment in episode 11 that was honestly perfect for this, and that’s littered throughout the story.In a way there’s narrative frustration between “I want a story with a typical anime underdog” and also “I want to see the characters do well at the sport”, and the show favors the injury and character relationship plotlines more than the sport itself, which leads for an odd ending pair of episodes that at once feels a bit overwhelming but also puts you in the mindset of a bunch of players who have been practicing water polo for what sounds like around three months, versus players who have been practicing for literal years. Also, the latter has been practicing matches, not individual skillsets. And it’s kind of frustrating that the message is “friendship and having fun is what matters”, when a lot of the messaging is “we want to do well at this team sport in competitions”. “Free!” worked because they only had one underdog, and the guys mostly all knew each other, and a central message was about how rivalry is toxic. “Re-Main” tries to convince you that bonding with your teammates will make up for years of discipline and varied practice… but also that it literally won’t, and if you expected it to um… What is wrong with you? And then tries to sell you on the idea that it’s a satisfying story.And that CAN work, in a way. If you’re happy with the parts that aren’t necessarily water polo. I personally enjoy most of the rest of the stuff, and even a lot of the water polo specific stuff is still enjoyable, even if it’s honestly painful to watch how predictably bad these newbie and untrained players are. And the fact that honestly, reminding us that your life shouldn’t be about medals but about enjoying what little time you have on this earth, particularly if you have good friends and something fun to do (a la “Sk8 the Infinity”), isn’t a bad message either, which is probably why so very many of these shows have that as a message. It just gets a bit muddled here. This gets closer to managing it better than other shows do, though.If you want a story about a neat group of guys with interesting backstories and characters who don’t abandon their personalities for cliches (well… except in two cases, but it’s fun angst, anyway), and follows through on those things, and has a lot of really sweet heart-to-hearts between characters and supportive friendships, and episodes that just make you smile (and also hot guys), this is for you. It also honestly made me start tearing up around episode 7 on the regular, so there’s that for it. It’s not the easiest watch, but it’s enjoyable. And it honestly has an amazing set-up for season 2 if there is one, unlike a lot of other series that just continue to continue. handles major injuries and deconstructing stereotypes the way this one does, particularly the former. Yes, it’s cliche, but it treats Minato’s injury and recovery in a way you don’t really see that often. At least not since “Yuri on Ice!” or “Fullmetal Alchemist”. It also really focuses on how self-centered most everyone is around Minato’s injury, and how hard it is for junior high and high school athletes to excel, and the many pressures they have. There is a time crunch at that age, and people can break at the smallest losses, because the pressure is that bad. The show doesn’t present a solution for the problem (not that it has to), but it does point out that it’s not just one factor in the whole area of sports that creates the problem overall. It’s everything, whether it’s unsympathetic coaches, toxic masculinity, distant family members, the issues of growing up as a child of separated or divorced parents, particularly with a sibling involved, class status, simply time and effort… It’s just a lot. And the story also focuses on the fact that it is effort, not talent, that gets people ahead. That’s typical of sports shows, of course, but it’s emphasized in really unique ways.The show also deals with little oddities you might write off as bad research or narrative shortcuts via anime cliches, but later brings it up “oh yeah, no, this is something that is a sign of inexperience/lack of knowledge on the characters part” and it’s really brilliant world-building that you just discount until you’re like “ohhhh”, though if you’ve been paying attention, you already took in the details and could have figured it out on your own. For instance, when they eat before a match (I used to be a competitive swimmer, this one bugged me). The pay-off isn’t typically immediate, but when it shows up, it makes perfect sense. Not as I guess a plot hole filler, but in a way you realize why it hasn’t been addressed prior to this. There’s a brief moment in episode 11 that was honestly perfect for this, and that’s littered throughout the story.In a way there’s narrative frustration between “I want a story with a typical anime underdog” and also “I want to see the characters do well at the sport”, and the show favors the injury and character relationship plotlines more than the sport itself, which leads for an odd ending pair of episodes that at once feels a bit overwhelming but also puts you in the mindset of a bunch of players who have been practicing water polo for what sounds like around three months, versus players who have been practicing for literal years. Also, the latter has been practicing matches, not individual skillsets. And it’s kind of frustrating that the message is “friendship and having fun is what matters”, when a lot of the messaging is “we want to do well at this team sport in competitions”. “Free!” worked because they only had one underdog, and the guys mostly all knew each other, and a central message was about how rivalry is toxic. “Re-Main” tries to convince you that bonding with your teammates will make up for years of discipline and varied practice… but also that it literally won’t, and if you expected it to um… What is wrong with you? And then tries to sell you on the idea that it’s a satisfying story.And that CAN work, in a way. If you’re happy with the parts that aren’t necessarily water polo. I personally enjoy most of the rest of the stuff, and even a lot of the water polo specific stuff is still enjoyable, even if it’s honestly painful to watch how predictably bad these newbie and untrained players are. And the fact that honestly, reminding us that your life shouldn’t be about medals but about enjoying what little time you have on this earth, particularly if you have good friends and something fun to do (a la “Sk8 the Infinity”), isn’t a bad message either, which is probably why so very many of these shows have that as a message. It just gets a bit muddled here. This gets closer to managing it better than other shows do, though.If you want a story about a neat group of guys with interesting backstories and characters who don’t abandon their personalities for cliches (well… except in two cases, but it’s fun angst, anyway), and follows through on those things, and has a lot of really sweet heart-to-hearts between characters and supportive friendships, and episodes that just make you smile (and also hot guys), this is for you. It also honestly made me start tearing up around episode 7 on the regular, so there’s that for it. It’s not the easiest watch, but it’s enjoyable. And it honestly has an amazing set-up for season 2 if there is one, unlike a lot of other series that just continue to continue.', 'Why is my rating so high you ask? Well I believe this sports anime is interesting and provides a fresh new take on amnesia and sports in anime. If you have seen Golden Time, you might appreciate how Re:Main handles it in a different way. All the people who dont like to watch sports anime or straight up wholesome shows shouldnt be writing bad reviews for this show. I dont care if its ""generic characters"" or whatever you guys are saying. Its genuienly very enjoyable with the comedy, wholesome moments, and forming a complete new team. For fans of Haikyuu! I have to say that...it gives off similar vibes and I love it. And honestly i read the reviews then binged 6 episodes and had to come back to leave a review bc it quickly became a show that I love and will definitley rewatch.Quick Plot (no spoils): MC gets in car accident and goes in coma for 203 days. Loses 3 years of memories from his time playing water polo before. He wakes up and he has to focus on trying to get into highschool and getting better. Long story short he obviously does it again (duh) and has to retrace his steps to become the prodigy to everyone else he once was.The side characters do get involved pretty well in my opinion. And doesnt feel like they leave any character out. Great sports team anime and defintiely got me to laugh and even gasp at one scene.Anyway just try it yourself and if you dont like sports anime then dont watch and complain about it. Or shut up and watch it anyway. it gives off similar vibes and I love it.

Re-Main is a sports anime that would have benefitted greatly by not being a sports anime. An anime torn between being a character driven type drama and a sports anime, failing to deliver on both and ending up to be average in all areas. I can\'t give it a low score as the anime was not bad. But there was a lot of potential left unfulfilled. It\'s middle of the road 5/10, there is better out there, and I would only recommend if you...are really bored. Continue reading for some light spoilers and more in detail explanation.As a sports anime, Re-Main leaves a lot to be desired. I came away from watching feeling I know very little about Water polo. The anime itself featured very little as most episodes focused more on the characters. Even episodes that did feature water polo still focused on the characters and how they were feeling during the game. It\'s worrying when you\'re watching the final episode and there are still people narrating the rules of the game to themselves to keep the audience up to date with info. Meaning the first 11 episodes have not done enough to educate the audience on exactly on what\'s happening. This detracts from enjoyment in a sense, as when you do not know what is happening, you do not know what to feel.The character front, the main focus on this anime, it\'s also surprisingly weak. The only character given any real depth is the MC, Minato. After having a date with Truck-kun, he loses a span of time and years worth of memory. The anime follows his growth of learning about who he was as a person, people\'s perception of the ""new"" Minato, as well as when his memories return and how he copes with this and his ""new"" life. I actually really like this idea. There\'s a lot that can be done with this, interactions with characters can change quickly given knowledge of characters, previous experiences etc and this did happen to small extent. If the anime focused more on this, and was not tied down to a sports setting, I feel it could be a very interesting watch. Re-main is not that show.  It could have been used a lot more and to greater effect.The supporting characters are weak. Even after just finishing, I barely remember any names. They fall into their stereotype, and that\'s how I remember them by. They have maybe 1 story element (although I\'d go as far as to say, some have almost none), each that gets semi resolved by the final episode but none of them are noteworthy and any investment was not rewarded.Re-Main is a long drink of water. It\'s certainly not bad. It ticks enough boxes. But it falls into mediocre valley. It\'s not good, and not bad enough to be entertaining (though the latter I find is rare in anime). Regarding art and sound, again both are serviceable but forgettable. There was nothing much to standout so this review will feel rather bare bones because of it. I will not remember Re-main or look to rewatch this further down the line. As for Sports anime, there are lot better out there. For a recent example, Bakuten! a sports anime for gymnastics is one I would recommend. It\'s also not perfect but I\'d rather watch that over Re-main.

Re-Main was hyped by Mappa so it was an obvious must-watch for fans of Mappa's previous works, such as Jujutsu Kaisen and Attack on Titan season four. Despite it not changing the sports genre in anime, it still showed us that even something as simple as water polo has the potential to be properly animated. Although the pacing for Re-Main is a bit problematic, combined with its character growth, the anime itself is well done, along with these points that make Re-Main good.The plot...of Re-Main focused more on character development than actual water polo, much to its irony. If given more episodes, there would've been more scenes where the main cast starts playing against more rivals, but the pacing goes too slow. It features the main character getting nerfed at the beginning of the anime, but his motivation to join water polo again was honestly wasn't well-written. To cover up for it, it featured the water polo team from Yamninami high starting to improve their status as a great water polo team. However, there were barely any water polo matches, not to mention the anime kept on disrespecting the main cast, which I felt was going too far, even for the creators of Re-Main. A positive note is the amount of character development each member of the team receives. Not only does it emphasize the concept of teamwork, but it gives them their resolve for the future of the series. That said, the pacing for both of those combinations could've been better, but I'm hoping that the anime receives a second season to fix those flaws.The story itself was somewhat interesting. Because it focused on the main character recovering from a critical accident, it gave him the chance to catch up to what he's missed. Soon, he tries to avoid water polo, but his past as a famous water polo player catches up to him. However, once he meets a girl and learns of a stupid bet he made, it motivates him to continue water polo again, but from there, it drops that reason and focuses on water polo itself.  The water polo matches themselves were too short, and they certain parts of the action, which I was disappointed they did. However, I did enjoy the buildup Yamnanami high school had towards their match with Shogakukan, and the way it was delivered was worth it. The growth between the individual characters was executed well, but I wished their resolve was continued beyond the twelve episodes. Overall, the actual combination of character development and water polo was implemented neatly.The characters and their growth were the central part of this anime that was prioritized over the actual water polo during most of the episodes. A shocking plot twist was the main character, Minato himself. He started weakened from his previous memories. If not, he would've been the most overpowered throughout the entire series. While I liked that choice made to his character, the second half of the anime took a one-eighty when they got rid of his personality we knew and love. While arrogance and rudeness weren't the best parts, they gave him a chance for character development, and I commend that option despite having to endure such a recent change in Minato's personality. The other Yamnanami team had good character growth throughout the twelve episodes. Also, I have massive respect for its racial representation by making one of the characters a Nigerian. I liked everyone's character designs as it matched who they are and how they expressive they were despite the struggle they've been through before the anime began. Though at times, their growth took over playing water polo, which would've been better with the proper pacing, it's hard to do so for an anime original.The animation for Re-Main was somewhat overhyped. Even though Mappa had amazing quality animation for their other productions, it was almost average. In specific frames, it's visually stunning and had fluid movements, which could've been hard to animate since the characters are constantly moving, but it was well done. The CGI in the faraway views of the characters was a little distracting, but I had no problem. I also liked how they showed the CGI for a short amount of time before switching to the 2D models for the characters. The amount of quality for the animation had given its justice, but despite the use of CGI, Mappa still managed to fix that overly hated aspect and worked around it to satisfy the viewers.The music for this anime wasn't anything special, but at the same time, I found both the opening and the ending songs to be good. The beginning song itself gives us the impression combined with the visuals makes it look like the next Haikyuu, but it gave that false impression since it mainly focused on character development instead. I liked the ending as well. For some reason, it gave me the impression that if foreshadowed the future teamwork the Yamnanami team developed, and they'll continue to improve. They both sound beautiful, and I appreciate the artists behind both of those songs. They both weren't too exciting, but it was relaxing to hear them thorough the anime.Overall, this was a decent anime original, not as exciting as the previous season's originals, but at the same time, it wasn't as bad as people make them sound. The character development was incredible, the water polo scenes were visually stunning, and the plot twist with the character's personality change was completely unexpected. Although, I wish Mappa spent more time focusing on playing water polo and letting Yamnanami high have a chance of winning, which they only did once. I'm hoping that this original gets a second season since it sets up for another season, which would be a great idea to accomplish when Mappa completes their upcoming projects for the future of their anime and as they improve on the studio's working quality. of Re-Main focused more on character development than actual water polo, much to its irony.

The fist 7 episodes were great I was ready to put it in my top 3 for sports anime but then episode 8 came along and ruined the whole series for me. Everything was fine until they decided to make the mc a jerk and mean to everyone. This dosent make sense seeing as how everyone was treating him after the accident. They were not scared of him or anything. I have to drop this anime because the only two ways I see this anime going....He keeps his jerk ways and gains his new memories back and changes for the better, or he dosent regain his new memories and just becomes nice which I dont see happening. So i cant keep watching because none of these seem good to me.or a third option where to hits his head and goes back to how he was after the accident He keeps his jerk ways and gains his new memories back and changes for the better, or he dosent regain his new memories and just becomes nice which I dont see happening. So i cant keep watching because none of these seem good to me.or a third option where to hits his head and goes back to how he was after the accident', 'Re-main started as a great show but ended up being the most generic drama in existence. Be warned that this show tricks you to think that it\'s a sports show, but it\'s a drama with water polo wrapped around it.The pilot episode was very good. The amnesia that Minato suffers is cheesy, but the pilot executes the pacing and sets the tone of the story. Minato loses his memories, goes through rehabilitation, gets accepted to a new school, and get introduced to two to three new characters, and everything seems quite natural. You aren\'t overloaded with information, but a lot of events happen. The second...episode is not terrible either. It follows up with the pilot episode by introducing Minato\'s potential love interest as well as introducing Minato\'s motivations, mental fragility, and his eventual caving into playing water polo again.That\'s where the magic ends. There\'s no practice that\'s meaningful. There\'s no rival teams other than Minato\'s former school to hype games up. In fact, there are only two official games that the water polo team participates in anyways. There\'s some stategy, but it goes nothing more than ""PASS TO ME!!"" You know peoples\' struggles through flashbacks and backstories rather than them suffering defeat in official games and trying to improve. There\'s a hint of some rivalries everywhere, but in reality, it\'s all telling and no showing.In fact, I have to believe that this show\'s writers had no one in their staff that was actually knowledgeable about water polo or swimming. I\'m no water polo expert, but I know a bit of swimming and just some damn common sense. Oka gives a calculation about Amihama\'s 100 meter freestyle time. He states that it\'s 52.77 seconds, and so naturally, his 150 meter time would be 52.77 times 1.5, which is 1:19. Think about it for just a moment here. Amihama\'s 100 time is 52.77, so naturally, his 150 meter time is 1:19. Obviously fucking not. Amihama\'s 52.77 time is only achieved by sprinting 4 laps. If he had to add an extra 2 laps, his lap time would be slower since he has to accomodate swimming extra laps. I\'m using a hyperbole as an example, but if Amihama could maintain a 52.77 pace for the 400 meter freestyle event, he would be 10 seconds faster at 3:30 than the current 400 meter world record of 3:40 set by Paul Biedermann.His 52.77 time by the way, would still blow the current world record for high school swimming out of the water, literally. Roman Jone\'s 100 yard freestyle world record time is 49.75 seconds. Converting Amihama\'s 52.77 100 meter freestyle time from SCM (meters) to 100 yard freestyle time would be 47.54. Yeah, Amihama\'s just casually beats the world record holder by a WHOLE 2.21 seconds. Let alone beat his brother, Amihama\'s the undisputed world champion of high school swimming. Yet, he only placed third for the 100 meter freestyle in Japan nationals. Isn\'t that strange? Doesn\'t it feel like the writers didn\'t even bother figuring out what was reasonably realistic for swim times, and how swimming more laps would obviously mean a longer time per lap? These writers probably never swam in their life, which is fine, since they\'re writers, but they also didn\'t do any due dilliegence in researching how swimming or water polo work. It\'s pathetic.The next 4-5 episodes are generic club activities with forced drama. In each episode, I was thinking, ""which insecure club member is it this time?"" I was surprised that the show didn\'t go round-robin and go through everyone\'s dramatic past with the likes of Babayaro. Everything about the club is forced, and you get to know characters only through the cringy drama that they go through in the present with the current club members, and the dramatic past they had in the past. More times than not, the episodes rarely had a focus on water-polo and more on the drama that was playing out.But it gets even worse. Generic club activities and drama turns into even more drama. It\'s funny that the writers are self aware that the show is painfully predictable and cheesy by having Minato create a self-fulfilling prohpecy, joking about how predictable dramas love to have the amnesia-ridden protagonist remember everything at a critical moment. Guess what happens?*spoilers aheadThen the show just becomes a bunch of drama, teenage angst, and edgy bouts of anger by Minato. This is very normal, actually. Minato\'s circumstances are pretty crappy, and his dreams of becoming Japan\'s best is shattered. Even Chinu was just gaslighting him. The problem is, I though this was a damn sports show? Hello? I did not expect to watch a cheesy drama. If I wanted to do that, I would fucking watch a cheesy drama that does a much better job than this show does. Like wow, Chinu actually hates Minato! Wow! Minato was an asshole or something! Wow, Minato coincidentally loses his memories AGAIN. WOW, he\'s standoffish to his current teammates. Wow!! Minato\'s world is falling apart, as if everything in this show was fabricated in order to have some shitty drama.The animation is just dreadful in games. While out of games, everything is pretty normal, but the game CGI is glaringly obvious, and there\'s absolutely no effort put into framing any shots and having any meaningful perspective of games. It was cheap, and it looked cheap. When people swam through watter, it sure as hell didn\'t feel like they were gliding through it. There aren\'t any amazing scenes at all, and half the games are slide-show decks. I expected nothing less from MAPPA.Chinu\'s the most miserable plot device and victim of the show\'s attempt to be as dramatic as possible. She\'s only there because she simultaneously serves as a love interest, serves the dramatic past that she had with Minato, and finally, as a info-dump to explain Minato who he was previously. There\'s absolutely no characterization or depth to her since there was no screen time other than when she\'s relevant to progressing the story forward. This show is a damn farce. episode is not terrible either. It follows up with the pilot episode by introducing Minato\'s potential love interest as well as introducing Minato\'s motivations, mental fragility, and his eventual caving into playing water polo again.That\'s where the magic ends.

It\'s funny that the writers are self aware that the show is painfully predictable and cheesy by having Minato create a self-fulfilling prohpecy, joking about how predictable dramas love to have the amnesia-ridden protagonist remember everything at a critical moment. Guess what happens?*spoilers aheadThen the show just becomes a bunch of drama, teenage angst, and edgy bouts of anger by Minato. This is very normal, actually. Minato\'s circumstances are pretty crappy, and his dreams of becoming Japan\'s best is shattered. Even Chinu was just gaslighting him. The problem is, I though this was a damn sports show? Hello? I did not expect to watch a cheesy drama. If I wanted to do that, I would fucking watch a cheesy drama that does a much better job than this show does. Like wow, Chinu actually hates Minato! Wow! Minato was an asshole or something! Wow, Minato coincidentally loses his memories AGAIN. WOW, he\'s standoffish to his current teammates. Wow!! Minato\'s world is falling apart, as if everything in this show was fabricated in order to have some shitty drama.The animation is just dreadful in games. While out of games, everything is pretty normal, but the game CGI is glaringly obvious, and there\'s absolutely no effort put into framing any shots and having any meaningful perspective of games. It was cheap, and it looked cheap. When people swam through watter, it sure as hell didn\'t feel like they were gliding through it. There aren\'t any amazing scenes at all, and half the games are slide-show decks. I expected nothing less from MAPPA.Chinu\'s the most miserable plot device and victim of the show\'s attempt to be as dramatic as possible. She\'s only there because she simultaneously serves as a love interest, serves the dramatic past that she had with Minato, and finally, as a info-dump to explain Minato who he was previously. There\'s absolutely no characterization or depth to her since there was no screen time other than when she\'s relevant to progressing the story forward. This show is a damn farce.', '(spoiler-free)This show is one of the strangest sports anime I’ve ever seen. Calling it just a bad show feels wrong somehow. And don’t get me wrong- this show is not good, but there’s just something so, so weird about it. It can’t seem to decide what it wants to be. It seems like they want to tell a more serious story but can’t figure out how to. None of the characters are likeable, and the show has a bad habit of retroactively making itself worse. The worst example of this is the final scene, which is so genuinely unsettling in its implications that I have...no idea what to make of it.Let’s start with the plot. In the first episode, we are introduced to our main character, Minato. He used to be a star water polo player, but on the way back from one of his games he was in a traumatic car accident that put him in a coma and caused him to lose several years of his memory. He has no memory of ever playing water polo, nor any particular love for it. In addition to that, his body has been affected by the year-long coma, and he isn’t in any condition to play a high-intensity sport like water polo. When he’s asked by his family if he intends to keep playing, he straight out tells them no. Of course, we as the audience know he’s going to get back into it- it’s right there on the cover! But the way that this happens is… not great.Minato gets back into water polo not because he wanted to, but because some random girl tells him that before his accident, they agreed if he doesn’t become Japan’s best water polo player, he will owe her a lot of money, and she’s going to hold him to it. Putting aside the fact that no sane person would hold Minato to this deal he doesn’t remember making and is physically incapable of fufilling, this is dumb and creates further plot-related problems down the road. It takes away Minato’s agency as a character- he’s not taking up his old hobby because he chose to, he’s doing it because some rando is convinced he owes her money.As for the sports aspect of this sports anime, they do the same thing every other sports anime does (school club with no members gets all the members they need except one, the guy they recruit has some baggage related to the sport, they give him group therapy for an episode and the show moves on), but the issue is that they’re… REALLY bad at water polo. Like, genuinely terrible, and they don’t ever get better. On one hand, I’m glad they didn’t try to make us believe this group of total amateurs has a real shot at winning a national tournament, but it’s also a bit frustrating watching them struggle to tread water eight episodes in. At one point they lose a practice match against a middle school team, and they take it embarrassingly hard.The real issue with this show isn’t the water polo, though. It’s how every single character is an absolutely irredeemably awful person.Multiple characters in this show take advantage of Minato’s condition, lying to him about past events or holding him responsible for things he has no memory of doing. Without getting into spoilers, the girl I mentioned before reveals something later on that completely ruins the show retroactively and also just makes her seem like a terrible person. One of the characters on the water polo team is, genuinely, one of the most unlikable and disgusting characters I’ve seen in a while. Don’t get me wrong- I love shithead morally grey anime boys as much as the next guy, but he is so out of place in this show. His actions feel too real, and he is never framed as anything but a sweet guy who might just be a little misguided in his attempts to make friends. He comes off as such a manipulative little toad that I genuinely had to get up and take a walk to calm down at one point.The team constantly feels like it’s on the verge of falling apart. Nearly everyone has a token “I’m quitting the team” moment, but they never feel properly resolved. These moments don’t feel like road bumps they have to overcome as a group, they feel like wedges driving the characters further apart. It’s not even fun to watch them interact, they barely have any chemistry.The final scene addresses a new aspect to the plot that was always there, but the show was carefully avoiding addressing directly. I don’t think the writers meant to retroactively turn their sports anime into a borderline psychological horror, but they sure did. After the final episode, I had to spend a few minutes just sitting in front of my screen, processing the implications of the protagonist’s final line. I have never been made so uncomfortable by a sports anime before.Overall, I really can’t recommend this show. It can’t decide what it wants to be, and in its confusion it creates a surprisingly heavy plot that it simply cannot handle properly. I know that everyone has different tastes and are entitled to their own opinions, but I genuinely struggle to understand why there are people who like this show. If my description piqued your curiosity in any way, I would honestly just tell you to save your time and read a plot summary.

It just happens to appeal to me. The op and Ed are good, the art is good, the plot is good, the characters are good, and the development is good. I may be biased, but the show got me to like it a lot so that’s a good job for them too. Im writing my first ever review too, as the time of writing this it has a 7.25 score which I think is a bit low. But on a practical stand point, even...if I didn’t fall in love with the show, it’s still a pretty good show. Watch it! if I didn’t fall in love with the show, it’s still a pretty good show. Watch it!', ""this is not your typical sports anime. the main focus is more on the characters and the memory loss. It's been a rollercoaster ride, and I love how they portray the memory loss journey in a pretty convincing and emotional way. Each episode gets better and better, I am so glad I did not drop it in the initial few eps (can get a bit slow at times). If you are expecting a legit water polo anime, then this might not be your cup of tea. but if you are looking for a character-oriented anime, then yes, do give this anime a try! "", ""Came for the cute boys, stayed for the plot twists. When I was watching the first three episodes I didn't expect myself to like this anime that much. In fact I once remarked, after the first episodes, that this anime would be forgotten in no time after airing - well, it is for the majority of the anime watchers, but not for me.The art and music are above average. They certainly are not the best, but good enough to get the job done. I especially love the ending theme; the lyrics and tone fit the plot so well. The structure of the story seems to...be a bit messy at first glance, but after rewatching the whole thing, I notice that all the lines and plot points are being referenced later, so there certainly are some careful plannings.This is not your typical sports anime, so don't expect a lot of actions here. One may even say the first half fits better in the CBDCT (cool bois doing cool things) genre. The plot twists used in the first half gave me the feeling that they are trying to go into the exact opposite of the common sports anime tropes, hence part of the humor. Water polo is cool and the characters did play it seriously, but it really can be any competitive team sport without altering the light-hearted humor and moods. Don't get me wrong - it's still cool to see the less popular sport getting featured, but you may get yourself disappointed if you are expecting to learn the rules and whatnot about water polo through this anime.Then the second half decided to take an abrupt dark turn and I can totally see why some of the viewers hate this twist, but I like it this way. The true intention of the director was revealed and is the meat of this anime - to illustrate how one could stand strong and control his fate again after falling from the peak of his life. (At this point, it's not about the sport anymore.) It is about accepting the status quo, understanding yourself and making compromises with your past self, and I think the message was delivered beautifully.If not for the similar personal experience I had, I probably wouldn't be so strongly sympathetic toward the MC, so I get that this is not the tea for everyone. For me, the solution they provided in such a situation deeply resonates with me, and for this sole reason I give this a 10/10, a score that I reserve for animes that have a special place in my heart. be a bit messy at first glance, but after rewatching the whole thing, I notice that all the lines and plot points are being referenced later, so there certainly are some careful plannings.This is not your typical sports anime, so don't expect a lot of actions here.

Basically, the critique is that Re-Main tries to be two different anime and falls short in both areas. I can definitely see why this comment is made so much, but I don\'t always agree with it. For instance, there aren\'t a lot of matches (or games? I\'m not sure) in this anime. Considering the eventual focus these characters have on winning, the lack of time they actually...play is a bit dissatisfying. That being said, I don\'t really feel like the point of this anime was the same as a typical sports anime. Yes, the characters had the same goals of winning tournaments and beating their rivals, but the plot of the anime itself didn\'t scream ""national championship"" to me.Which is another gripe people have about this anime: too much time was spent on Minto\'s amnesia. Now, the amnesia plotline is a beast in and of itself, and I can\'t talk about it without spoilers, but I\'ll say this: the plot tried to do too much. There was a rather forced twist in the middle that I think would have been better had the anime started after it happened. The stuff that\'s shown in the first few episodes would have still been the history that could have been addressed through flashbacks and stuff, but I really think this anime could have shone if the twist had just been the entire anime. That being said, I do think that the last half of the season was better than the first, despite not liking the twist that brought the plot there. Why is that? Because the entire tone of the anime changed. It went from a rather relaxed anime that didn\'t feel like it was going anywhere to an anime where the building of a solid team felt like a really important factor. Like I said, this anime isn\'t like other sports anime. And I really like that the purpose of it seemed to be creating a team from scratch, not improving an existing one to make it to nationals.If Re-Main were to have a second season, this first season would be the perfect lead up to making Re-Main into an anime closer to Haikyuu!! or Ace of Diamond. In fact, if this season had been 25 episodes instead of 12, there was a lot of potential for it to successfully be a drama and a sports anime. Unfortunately, it did ultimately fall flat because it tried to do both in a short amount of time, but I don\'t think the product was bad at all. Certain characters do weaken it a bit because they\'re very inconsistent, which is also due to a lack of time to build them up. Some of them are very unlikable at certain points because there\'s an attempt being made to give them complex character traits, but those are never fleshed out. Instead, the unlikability goes away in favor of them being an agreeable character once again. So that\'s annoying because I couldn\'t get attached to a handful of the characters.But, genuinely, this anime is enjoyable to watch. It does actually do drama well, at least, in terms of tone. The plot is, as I said, unrealistic and forced. But Re-Main can feel very intense and tragic when it\'s trying to be. The characters that aren\'t inconsistent have great color--even when they aren\'t always nice. Essentially, Re-Main has a decent setup and passable execution that could have really excelled had it been given the proper time. As is, if you\'re looking for something that will keep your interest, I think this will do it. It\'s no Haikyuu!! but it\'s fun, and sometimes, that\'s all that counts. play is a bit dissatisfying.

Voice actors and the character lines are so simple but funny.Even though I am in my late 20s. I still enjoy high school phase. Maybe because I feel that I have wasted it by myself and that I didn\'t create any memories I can look up to when...I get older.I love how these animes fill part of this emptiness I feel about my high school years. How irrational high school students can be, they get angry easily.  But they are wild and they are living the best years of their lives.Of course it is exaggeration if we think about how anime beautify everything. But still, watching sports anime and seeing people fight for their dreams is absolutely marvelous.This anime is for you if you enjoy friendships, chasing wild dreams with a great sense of comedy, great art style and lovely voice actorsAnd Enhypen singing the opening !!! forget me not (I was surprised but happy) I get older.I love how these animes fill part of this emptiness I feel about my high school years.

But i\'m always up for a sports anime, especially if it is a sport i dont know much about.STORY: 6/10It seems that MAPPA is trying to do this ""really emotional sports anime"" thing. Kinda like Hoshiai no Sora did but with better animation. What you risk while doing this is losing the ""sports"" part of your sports anime which you could say happens here. There are 2 and a half games of water polo in this water polo anime. And the games we do get feel...rushed, like we are just speeding trough the minutes of the game. However the show does feel emotional and shows how painful memory loss can be. Its kinda fucked up how belittled it is by the characters in the show. Also i like the change in the main character, its rare that we get both a nice and antagonistic main character.ART: 7/10I mean, its about what you would expect from MAPPA\'s C team. Not good but not bad. You would expect better of a sports anime tbh. There are some scenes that look really good but they are fan and between.SOUND: 6/10Sports anime is the kind of thing where sound design is more important than music. RE-Main does the 1st thing decently and the latter badly. The sound design is good and the sound of the ball hitting the net is satisfying but i expected more, especially from an sport that takes place in water(one of the most beautiful things in anime). The music is forgettable.CHARACTER: 8/10The characters are pretty good. It has some originality here but not a lot. It has the reliable captain, and the guy that is sad he sucks but the main character is grade and i liked the transfer student from Africa. As i said, it doesn\'t really make sense that people belittle the MC\'s amnesia but the characters are fun and not too basic. I also like the side plot-line of the brother rivalry.ENJOYMENT: 7/10I just wanted more games, it honestly is better towards the end when we get to see the water polo. Watching the main character face his amnesia and the results of his own actions is interesting and somehow makes you want to know of his background. But it really isn\'t that interesting to see them train try to figure out a team jersey.ENDING STATEMENT: The biggest problem with RE-Main is its consistency. Its either good or bad, never somewhere in-between, but i do feel that MAPPA is heading into the right direction with these sports anime but i think it will take some time before they create a classic.OVERALL: 7/10 rushed, like we are just speeding trough the minutes of the game.

To take it a step farther, most people don't even know about the sport at all. I swam for years, but I really wanted to spend my college years doing a team sport. Just like with Shuugo, having a background in swimming really helps in the ability to keep up with the play. As we saw with the first quarter of the last episode, there's a lot of times...where you're swimming back and forth. There's also strengths that you need to possess to succeed at each individual position. Re-Main provides us with these characters with unique personalities and strengths that go beyond a lot of sports anime out there.To me, this season of Re-Main invested most of its time to creating the team we care about rather than the sport of water polo. This was probably for the best, as from my experience you really learn the most by playing in matches. There's more strategy that's integral to every match, but again that wasn't the focus of the show. We are practically given the blueprints to how this team that's not very good now has the potential to be great. It's a very standard plot, and when it tried to be different it was eh. I wasn't really interested in the hot potato game of Minato's memory/personality. At the end of the day, we do see relevant and interesting growth of these characters, although it took the entire season for the payoff in the last two episodes.There were obvious plays that only exist in this realm of sports drama like the whole team defending Minato. But there were some very basic technical aspects that are glaringly wrong. Minato, even with all of his experience, tried to block a right-handed players shot with his right hand. You need to rather use your left to be in parallel with the ball for a block to actually happen. And realistically, it's incredibly difficult to play water polo with no subs. Even in the best condition, there's just a strategic advantage to having subs, since you can come back in whenever unlike soccer.Overall, I came into this show already with a background of water polo, so I can already admit that I have extreme bias and different wants from this show. But as a sports show, there's been better as well as much much worse. It'll be interesting to see if another season comes in the future, but I'm glad that it exposed many people to a sport that I love very much! where you're swimming back and forth.

I wasn't really interested in the hot potato game of Minato's memory/personality. At the end of the day, we do see relevant and interesting growth of these characters, although it took the entire season for the payoff in the last two episodes.There were obvious plays that only exist in this realm of sports drama like the whole team defending Minato. But there were some very basic technical aspects that are glaringly wrong. Minato, even with all of his experience, tried to block a right-handed players shot with his right hand. You need to rather use your left to be in parallel with the ball for a block to actually happen. And realistically, it's incredibly difficult to play water polo with no subs. Even in the best condition, there's just a strategic advantage to having subs, since you can come back in whenever unlike soccer.Overall, I came into this show already with a background of water polo, so I can already admit that I have extreme bias and different wants from this show. But as a sports show, there's been better as well as much much worse. It'll be interesting to see if another season comes in the future, but I'm glad that it exposed many people to a sport that I love very much!"", ""I have go to say, my mind was blown when I found out that MAPPA,the same studio that did Jujutsu Kaisen and Yuri!!! on Ice, alsoworked on anime like this and Days. Regardless, I consider thisto be a very interesting show that both embraces and subvertstropes commonly found in sports anime.Visuals: It's MAPPA, so the visuals are, as expected, prettygreat. Although not quite at the same level as some of thisstudio's more popular works, Re-Main still boasts visuals farabove the average seasonal anime. However, I do have one gripe....I feel like the actual sport this show is about, water polo,could've been presented better, especially given who isanimating it.Characters: The main character is easily one of the best partsof the show. I was expecting this anime to take thestereotypical approach with how the MC regained his memoriesafter getting amnesia, but Re-Main's take on the whole thingwas really quite refreshing. The side characters, however...aren't nearly as well done. Most of them are prettyone-dimensional, and while that usually wouldn't be that big ofa deal in other shows like this, the problem is glaringlyapparent in this anime. It almost seems like each sidecharacter was assigned a single trait that was then made thefocal point of their entire personality.Sound: The OST for this anime is surprisingly good, butnothing too crazy. I do have to mention the opening though,which I consider good enough to bother listening to outside ofthe show.Overall Thoughts: I kind of feel like this show is a notch below similar sports anime of the same caliber, which is why while this show would normally get a 6 or 7 from me, it just lacks that one final push that brings it all together, which is the why I am giving it thefollowing rating:Final Score: 5 I feel like the actual sport this show is about, water polo,could've been presented better, especially given who isanimating it.Characters: The main character is easily one of the best partsof the show.

It \'s also created by MAPPA so the animation and art-style is top notch. Though there should have been more content on the 3 year and 1 year long periods, like when they kind of ""co-existed"". Although in sports anime there\'s always a character who is a lot worse than others, nothing bad in it, but it\'s kind of ""used"". The characters were intriguing but I wish there was more content with his old team. I think some people might love it, others, well... enjoy it. It\'s a hard anime to...hate. hate.', 'Not sure why there would be so much dislike for this show.. considering I loved it myself. There’s not many sports anime’s that I see that have potential to go in many directions, although I like the game of water polo. I feel as if this is more centered around teamwork and friendship. Not only that but learning how to deal with life with the many things that may be thrown your way. Seeing as how the main character tries to navigate his feelings with the amnesia he faces and being frustrated with not being able to remember certain things. It really hits your core...to the deep parts of the main character, how he learns to make decisions despite the cards he has been dealt in life. It’s a beautiful learning experience, friendship filled, inspiring piece of anime. The one thing this show doesn’t lack is passion. to the deep parts of the main character, how he learns to make decisions despite the cards he has been dealt in life.

This anime was so nice~I want a second season!The story, the development of characters, it\'s all so touching!Note that there is some drama in this but do not worry, the sport genre is definitely there which has helped with bonding between characters! It\'s comedic and really makes you smile too - at least for me.There were quite a few surprises for me that I truly felt had a freshness to it. MINOR SPOILER: For example, his loss of memory again thus reverting to his old self.His family is lovely! My first initial impression when I saw the family and thought...to myself, ""Ohhh they\'re quite different in a way. Their appearance was unique and to top it off they are super heart-warming, affectionate and understanding of Minato.Individual stories from characters: Just touching. My heart kept feeling for their emotions when they spoke about their current situation (especially Jou!).Anyways, I will definitely rewatch this anime and continue to grin like an idiot!Honestly, give it a go if you do not mind some drama\'s.

Minato started off strong as a player, but had a flawed attitude. After losing his memories, he was brought back into the sport despite having no past memories of it, and in a new...team, and the plot twist in the middle did help him to grow as a person, while also showing the viewers how Minato was as a person before he lost his memories, and Minato finally learning to accept that the past is over and grew as a person to become more accepting, with an ending that is satisfying and heartwarming to watch as the team finally came together.Re-Main is the first ever show I gave a perfect 10/10 to, after a streak of mainstream popular anime that I couldn't fully get myself into, it is everything I wanted. The ending was perfect, watching Minato and the team grow and come together to earn that one goal in the final episode was the perfect ending, it summarises their 12 episode journey as a new team made me teared up happily.

This Water Polo themed sports anime by MAPPA had great animation, a simple but captivating plot, but the execution felt 50-50.With just 12 episodes, Re-Main didn't covered enough aspects of the game to give a thorough enjoyment. A bit of comedy, with some past of the characters, the anime was strictly fine, not because it was short, but because it couldn't capture any aspect perfectly, be it with friendship, personal life or sports whatsoever.It was an okay affair for me and I hope if it gets a sequel announced in the near...future, the story is built better.

Instead, most of the show is spent recruiting members or dealing with the main character\'s amnesia.To the show\'s credit, as someone who played water polo in high school, the new recruits are very true to life.

It's a group of people getting together to form a team in a school where no one believes x sport will succeed and at first they suck but eventually they pull through and all's well that ends well;...they play in a final match of a competition and we get to see their growth throughout their journey. Re-Main has that concept still within its story but it adds to the mix the element of amnesia where our main guy, Minato, had an accident and lost his memories.The amnesia plot point in my opinion it's both Re-Main’s strongest suit in making it more interesting and stand out against other typical sport anime while at the same time being its weakest point in terms of pacing. Overall, that was the biggest problem I had with Re-Main; the absolute lack of a coherent pacing for the viewer to follow along at a consistent speed.From episode 1 I was able to see this was going to be the biggest issue. Look, I don't mind when an anime throws me in a loop with an overly impossible situation without any real explanation, it's fiction and I can overlook those details. But in episode 1 so many things are introduced to us to be later on brushed aside... We see Minato, a guy we know nothing about go through an accident, forget everyone and everything (who we as the viewer still know nothing about) and start school while his old friends and other people don't seem to worry about the fact that, uh, idk, he forgot everything ?? His old teammates appear once and they don't seem to be preoccupied about their old friend losing all recognition but okay we move on from that.We are later on introduced to our main cast as the story goes along. The characters.... are just fine. They are all stereotypes to some extent like the broody one, the sweetheart, the explosive one…. and while I normally don’t mind that, I feel like there were so many overarching plots and struggles that just when you were starting to like a character the next episode we completely switched to the next and I was left like ‘oh okay I guess see you never’. I will say however, that the best episodes of the series surprisingly come towards the end, because while I do feel that the audience is overexposed to a lot of plot points that get confusing and tangled up at parts, the resolution to most of them were alright (specially Jou and his father and Ushimado’s lack of confidence imo). Although old Minato is a pest and annoying, I did enjoy him growing with the team and while, again, the pacing felt very off putting and Minato’s personality switched back and forth more than I would have liked, it had some cool moments here and there.Now onto the rivals and “villains”…. Ngl I didn't care for a single one of them. I thought Shuugo’s and Momosaki’s subplot dragged on forever and they tried to make me care about it but I just… Didn't. Which in turn, made it so that the pushing force on the rivaling team and the whole Minato thing felt disconnected and honestly I wished we would have gotten to see more of the rivals struggles. I feel like one of the coolest things when it comes to sport anime is that they tend to show you both sides of the story, while of course you tend to root for the main team and everything, you end up feeling some sort of way for the rivaling parties and it makes it much more interesting to watch as it keeps you on the edge. With Re-Main I felt nothing for any of the rivals and it made matches kind of predictable to watch as I just cared for like one or two characters as a whole so in the end you just root for them. I will say however a positive aspect when it came down to the whole sports thing (which I won’t dwell too much on because I know nothing about water polo) is that the matches dont drag out with dumb plot contrivances. They play for a good amount while having dynamic shots and passes here and there but they don't try to oversell screen time with the sports playing part and I do appreciate that in terms of enjoyability as a whole.Finally In terms of characters, I would also like to talk about Chinu for a moment. I felt like she was used as a plot device for Minato’s sake and while I thought the whole “reveal” part was predictable and kind of just there to build tension, I did enjoy her as a character and I wished she would have played a more important role. Overall I feel like the best characters came down to her, Jou and Ejiri but most of the time they were cut screen time to feature others like Minato, Shuugo and Oka who in my opinion were objectively…. Kinda boring or annoying.I will also say the visuals are very good. Again, I don't know technicalities of water polo so I can't comment on that aspect but for the most part it all felt natural and flowing, MAPPA never fails to deliver good animation quality imo. I also really liked the character designs of the main cast (specially Inomata) and that one rival team guy with the blonde streak, they were all pretty recognizable and very matching with their individual personalities. The opening and ending are good too as well as the voice acting.I would say, give Re-Main a watch if you enjoy sports anime and you don't take things too at heart because even coming from someone who usually doesn't mind big soap opera-esque moments, it was a lot at times. If you can make it through the first middle episodes you get a decent watch for an alright show. If you are looking for extremely compelling characters with heartwarming stories you might get some of that but in the end you are probably gonna be left wanting more from an interesting set of characters that were sometimes sidelined for the sake of other plot points that were… not as interesting.

So when Mappa came out with Re-Main I was excited to see how this would measure up. It has an interesting story premise, water polo prodigy Kiyomiza Minato fell into a coma after a car accident and has forgotten who he is, his teammates and has to re-learn who he is and how to play. Also Mappa has a great animation team (when they're not being crunched into dust) so I was hoping for blood pumping water polo action.Unfortunately, you won't see any water polo until around...maybe episode 3 or 4. The first half of the season is dedicated to developing the team which is fine. They all have good chemistry with each other and there are some genuinely funny moments but... it's not anything you haven't seen before if you've watched a sports anime.By the time I had gotten to episode 6 I wasn't interested in continuing and thats a shame because it is a beautiful show. The one match I did watch was well directed and animated but it just... didn't make me feel pumped. For it's interesting premise it's sports anime formula is generic.I think I might give this another chance when I have a bit more time. I do know people who enjoy it and I don't want to turn off new viewers from giving it a chance because I do want to support original anime, but for right now it hasn't got enough to keep me watching.So for right now:5/10 mediocre maybe episode 3 or 4.

I do know people who enjoy it and I don't want to turn off new viewers from giving it a chance because I do want to support original anime, but for right now it hasn't got enough to keep me watching.So for right now:5/10 mediocre""]"
Saber Marionette J Again,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1191/Saber_Marionette_J_Again,"['J again is like the episode 26 of the first season that been cut into 6 parts and watching it straight is like watching a movie~ now now Mecha-harem anyone? :DStory:A lot of things has happened in this OVA, but the main story was about a sudden awakening of a Marionette with a serial number NSMX-1, with no memories of who made her and from what country she came from. She met Lime in the forest and thus begun her daily life in the Otaru household together with Faust saber dolls named Tiger, Luchs and Panther. No one knows the impending danger that awaits them...and how valuable the role of Marine will be.Character:Otaru Mamiya matured enough since the 1st season, same for his 3 marionette.Marine former name MSMX-1, is a marionette with a normal attitude except that she hate men. She always follow Lime around thinking that she is her master. Tiger she\'s broken in this ova because of the battle in the first season, she\'s the first marionette of Faust and love Faust more than anyone else. Luchs, who love to cook like Cherry, except that she\'s bad at it. Panther like Bloodberry, is a hot headed one, and have a personality and build like Bloodberry thats why they get along with each other.Art:Ive seen some improvement in the art since the first season, seems like Otaru\'s marionette become more cuter and brighter specially Bloodberry. I\'ve change my opinion on her, didnt know she was that pretty, like in the Op song and ED song of J again. They did a great coloring in the character this time.Enjoyment:i really enjoy this one, specially the fight scenes with the ""Terminator"" like creatures. Its refreshing to see a new marionette and some bad turned good marionettes. and how valuable the role of Marine will be.Character:Otaru Mamiya matured enough since the 1st season, same for his 3 marionette.Marine former name MSMX-1, is a marionette with a normal attitude except that she hate men.

The first episode at least attempts the drama of the original (poorly at that but whatever) the rest of the show is much more focused on ""fan service"" than actually keeping the characters personality.I would recommend just skipping this one as I have heard better things about J to X, nothing from this appears in J to X anyway.If you are able maybe try to read the light novel(s) this is based on.

Sankarea OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13055/Sankarea_OVA,"['So, I watched both OVA\'s and now can write a review on it.In short: the first is about Chihiro and how he had found a book about resurrection; the second is about Aria and her strange dream (I can\'t write what was this dream about because it will be a great spoiler for you; for same reason I\'m not writing who is Chihiro&Aria).Story:First OVA is like a prequel for the TV series. If you didn\'t watched ""Sankarea"" yet, I strongly recommend you to start with this OVA -- you\'ll free from several question and won\'t say ""WTF?!"" after the first TV ep. 10/10.Second is so...strange and weakly connected to the main story. That is why I recommend you watch this after the TV series, but not the right after! 6/10.Overall: 8/10.Art:Both OVA\'s are well-animated and have cute scenes.

Being the prequel, it'll answer some questions you have.Episode 00 is about 17 months earlier. Chihiro is telling a story, about memories, mostly in his perspective but also some is in Rea's. You see some more about Rea's odd relationship with her father and her mother. Chihiro goes on a holiday with his family and Ranko tags along. So you learn more about their history, too.The second OVA, Episode 14, is best to watch after the series, as that's it's proper place. A weird girl appears under the...temple and strange things start happening. Chihiro shows he's smarter than he looks, and it all comes together in the end. temple and strange things start happening.

It's basically a backstory that takes place immediately before the events of the main series happen. It'll show you how the main character got the book he used to resurrect Rea.

It didn't really add anything to...the main series beyond knowing the origin of the book.The second episode is the last episode of the series, making it a sequel to the first thirteen episodes. That episode was an average episode of Sankarea. Which made it kind of useless. For a last episode, it was pretty bland, but it would've been bland regardless. I do love Kimura Ryouhei and the voice acting he does in this anime, but it isn't enough to make this story interesting.

I don't really like the dark and grungy aspect of it, but I suppose that's down to personal taste. Much like the rest of the series I did find it sort of difficult to sit through these two episodes as they seemed to drag due to lack of a solid plot line and uninteresting character development. The one thing I will give to these two episodes is that the creepy factor is pretty spot on. If you really liked the anime, these episodes will probably be really enjoyable for you.

Selector Destructed WIXOSS Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31280/Selector_Destructed_WIXOSS_Movie,"['EDIT 9/25/18:I\'ve gotten some messages regarding people who were slightly confused over this review, so I\'d like to clarify something.At my time of writing this review, the Lostorage WIXOSS series had only just began airing (literally five days after I wrote and posted the review), and as it hadn\'t quite been a thing at that point, I want to mention that any mention of the ""WIXOSS series"" in this review is SOLELY directed towards the Selector WIXOSS series, whether it be Infected, Spread, or the Destructed movie.Even to this day, I have yet to watch the Lostorage WIXOSS series and currently have no plans to,...and the series itself is COMPLETELY unrelated to this review. Sorry if that was confusing to anyone, but this review was written at a time when it didn\'t exist, so I didn\'t have any way to know whether or not my usage of specific terms would be confusing within the context of this review.The rest of the review beyond this line has been untouched; hopefully MAL staff doesn\'t take my review down for editing it two years later.Contains spoilers of the first and second seasons (none of the actual movie, however), so read at your own risk.This will be less of a review of the actual movie and more of a review of the fact that it was a movie. I\'ll explain that in more detail later.I have every right to believe Selector Destructed WIXOSS was just as good as the second season, and even better than the first. What I don\'t quite agree with 100%, however, is the fact that it was made into a movie.Please, do NOT panic when I say this. Don\'t consider this an automatic dealbreaker if you\'ve seen the first and second seasons and are trying to decide whether you should watch this movie or not. But, about 70% of the movie is recap of the first and second seasons.This may come off as a bit of a disappointment to some, especially for people like me who had been waiting nearly 8 months since its original February 13th release date in Japan for this movie to be released on BD and subbed. And hell, I\'m sure there are MANY other diehard WIXOSS fans who had been watching the entire series weekly since it started airing, and it\'s felt like a seemingly endless journey waiting for the series to be concluded. However, just in-case you don\'t understand based purely on my rating, I was the exact opposite of disappointed.Here\'s some facts about the state of recap present within Selector Destructed WIXOSS. It gives you just enough to enjoy the movie if you\'re one of the people who have never seen anything WIXOSS-related and just decided to go out and see the film, but at the same time, doesn\'t overload you with stuff you already know if you\'re a returning fan who\'s already seen the first and second seasons. In its own way, it\'s a perfect way to bring up more WIXOSS fans. They\'ll watch the movie, and sure, they\'ll already know all that happens. But some things that aren\'t explained in the movie (that, as someone who\'s seen both seasons, can confirm ARE explained in the TV series) might draw curiosity out of some of the viewers, and cause them to go and watch the first and second seasons. And, with how underrated WIXOSS is, I\'m MORE than welcoming to any attempt to draw in more fans.Why were things done this way? Simple. The entire sequel aspect of this movie comes from things being explained within the actual storyline present within the first and second seasons.The movie starts out with a bit of a prequel, explaining one of the loose ends I actually audibly spoke about having a problem with within the first season. It continues with more recap, but as the recap continues on, more and more plotlines that perfectly (and I mean PERFECTLY) tie up some other loose ends present within the series are sprinkled within the film, making it feel like a much more fulfilling experience. It, then, ends with a very well-written ending that I couldn\'t have asked to be any different.The reason that I don\'t agree 100% with the fact that this all was turned into a movie is simply because I do think that this all could have just been added into the first and second seasons. The prequel aspect could\'ve been added in a way similar to the psychokinesis scene in Shinsekai Yori, where it seemed random and out of place but as time continued on, you begin to understand it more and more. The rest could\'ve just been placed within the series chronologically, with no problems. And the ending, at the very least, could\'ve been an OVA of the 2nd season.Let\'s face it. 70% of a 90 minute movie being recap doesn\'t sound very appealing, it means that only about an episode\'s worth of content was actually fresh. To think that that couldn\'t have been squeezed into a 26-episode multi-cour series is absurd. It\'s quite obvious that the purpose of the movie was just to milk the series, and bring up more fans of it by forcing them to sit through it in a movie theater in order to watch it.But, while I did say I don\'t agree 100% with their choices to do this, does that mean I truly disagree? No, not at all. If their goal of this movie was to milk it by bring up more fans of the series, then I am completely okay with that. It just gives me more WIXOSS to watch, and more people to talk about it with. No problem with that.So, as for the new content, how good was it? It was nearly flawless when you look at it a certain way.My biggest problem with the first season was that it only deconstructed aspects of what a majority of the card game sub-genre has been up to now. When I started watching the series, by around episode 3 I was really craving a full deconstruction, but that wasn\'t what I got. What I got was a story written similarly to Madoka Magica, in how only certain aspects are deconstructed and the rest are left out in the cold. It was definitely still a great series simply because of how well characterized every character was, in addition to how well the story went with what it had to work with, many of the situations being handled really well, and overall great directing. But I was still left a bit underwhelmed.Then we continue onto the 2nd season, which pretty much fixed every problem I had with the first season. Every single aspect of what makes the card game sub-genre what it is was completely deconstructed in pretty much every possible way. The psychological aspects behind how well developed every character was, the loopholes in the system, the way everything was created. Just everything. I really was amazed, and I didn\'t really expect such an amazing season out of it. But, here\'s a fact: there was a reason why I didn\'t really expect things to go the way they did. You see, while I DID want things to go in a way that completely deconstructs the card game sub-genre, I didn\'t expect they would because I knew the process of creating a story that did just that wouldn\'t be easy by any means. It was going to be a heavy load to carry, and I thought it was kind of a miracle that they pulled it off. However, given how heavy of a load it was, things weren\'t pulled off flawlessly, and there were still quite a few unanswered questions by the end of the 2nd season. So, I thought it was amazing but wasn\'t quite at the level of being a masterpiece.Then, we continue on with this movie. Every, and I mean EVERY, single unanswered question, loose end, and confusing plot point was answered flawlessly. What we were given was a completed work, one that showed that everything was planned from the beginning, and how well-written the story was as a whole. The things that were missing from the 2nd season that made me not consider it a masterpiece were present within this movie. Even though I wouldn\'t consider either a masterpiece, I have every single right to say that the WIXOSS series as a whole is deserving of being called one.I do want to say that the way things were presented was kind of fun, in its own way. It reminded me a lot of the presentation of the Monogatari series, where everything was aired in non-chronological order and felt a bit like a puzzle, which made it kind of fun. The WIXOSS series, up until the movie, was definitely chronological, and even the movie itself was chronological. But, the fresh content introduced within the movie that wasn\'t within the first and second seasons wasn\'t chronological to the first/second seasons. So, it was a bit fun in that regard.And, in the end, the movie really was just about as good as I expected it to be. All my questions were answered, and I end with a fulfilling experience that I think is worthy of being considered one of the best I\'ve ever had with anime before. I don\'t completely agree with the fact that it was made into a movie, but with everything all said and done, I think it\'s fine that it was just because I still got to experience everything in a way that was quite close to perfection. and the series itself is COMPLETELY unrelated to this review.

Sankarea: Wagahai mo... Zombie de Aru...,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16694/Sankarea__Wagahai_mo_Zombie_de_Aru,"['A quick and simple Review for this OVA. The usual daily doses happen between Chihiro and Rea. Rea starts school and tries to live a normal humble life. Not too much happens and it could be seen as a filler ep, however it does slightly continue after the main series. The ending reveals a new character and gives subtle nudges of things to come. All it did is hype me up for season 2, where are you!Rated it based on how I rated the main series because it felt like an obvious part of it. ', ""A nice, cute and simple finish to the first season. Told mostly in the perspective of Baabu, the zombie kitty.It seems to just be a feel-good episode, about Rea going back to school, playing with her zombie power a little and her and Chihiro getting closer.Learning some more about each other, plus little bits of possible romance between the two of them.Baabu makes a friend and you learn more about the deterioration of zombies.The very ending makes you excited for the next season. If there will be one, which lots of us are hoping there will be.It's worth watching. "", ""This episode was alright. It was narrated by Babu, which is fun. Although, it does seem to have left room for a whole other season, but one hasn't been made. I assume that the following OVA episode will probably end in a cliffhanger.As far as the love story portion of this anime goes, I can't shake the feeling that it just shouldn't be a thing. I get that it's supposed to be quirky and original, but I don't sense any chemistry between the two main characters, even in this single episode where it seems like their relationship is supposed to be progressing.It seems like the...ending of this episode, as I said, is supposed to lead to something more, but I don't really like that idea either. In this episode Furuya is trying to think of more ways to keep Rea's body from decaying, so I understand that there could be more done, but it just seems like it's becoming too complicated.As always, the voice actor for Furuya is fun to listen to, and Babu is probably my favorite character in the anime, so this episode wasn't a total waste to watch. Not much happened, but it is a sequel to the main series, so if you liked that, I suggest you watch this. ending of this episode, as I said, is supposed to lead to something more, but I don't really like that idea either.

The second half almost made me cry, easily my favorite part of the anime. It didn't really introduce new themes to the main story, but it does show a slightly new perspective to it that makes the whole thing much more impactful to me. I thought the main story is great but slightly undercooked in some areas, this episode made up for it with a very touching ending. I don't think I'll ever see zombies in the same way after this, it does make me feel slightly depressed just thinking about them. ""]"

If not, you\'ll get spoiled a fair bit and not get the full potential out of this fantastic parody.In short, Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou is a fantastic parody. It absolutely nails the scenes from the original series. The impact, intensity and music are close to perfect in each and every scene that the show is ""making fun"" of.Story: 6/10The story (VERY loosely) follows the original Attack on Titan story line. The same music and phrases are used for each scene in the parody, as it was used in the...original series. It has TONS of references, like when *you know who* is eaten and *you know him* screams/cries teary eyed with his arm extended.Art: 8/10The art uses a light color palette to bring the chibi characters to life (I couldn\'t word that better, sorry...)There\'s a bit of recycled animation from the first season, like when titans are running, or when the big ol\' colossal titan is peeking over the wall.But here\'s a twist!Sometimes, (when something scary/shocking happens) the art turns into some of the manga drawings from the original manga. I was pleasantly surprised when it first happened, but it doesn\'t happen a lot during the anime, sadly.Sound: 9/10If you\'re a big fan of the Attack on Titan soundtrack, then rejoice! They use nearly all of the songs from AoT in this parody. It\'s incredible how well they manage to weave the soundtrack into every scene, without it feeling out of place or stitched on.My only gripe about the sound, is that they didn\'t introduce any new songs in the show.Characters: 7/10Take the strongest traits of each character (Eren -> Kill all titans! Mikasa -> Protect Eren! Levi -> Cleaning.) and exaggerate the living shit out of it.I don\'t mean this in a bad way. It goes really well with the tone of the show, but if you\'re a newcomer to the Attack on Titan universe and start with this series... Oh boy.Enjoyment: 10/10I absolutely fucking loved it!Holy shit I\'ve never been this pumped when watching a ""comedy"" show.The music, the fucking references man! Everything goes so fucking well together!When i heard about Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou i thought, ""Great... Just HOW much are they going to milk the franchise?"" Then i watched the first episode and found out that i hadn\'t laughed that much in ages. It\'s a really good time.Overall 8/10Shingeki!

No? Then you wouldn't relate to this crap. Attack on Chibi is a spin-off parody anime to one of the most popular shows ever made. It's done by a different studio, focusing more on comedy and having this chibi artform instead of the dark and greedy look that the original show has.The show fails at everything. You would expect that a parody of Attack on Titan would succeeed at poking fun at it, while having some clever stuff thrown in. Instead, we have this show pandering towards fans for the sakes...of getting another dollar. A lot of the characters felt like they were pulled out from fanfictions and Tumblr. One of the most popular characters in AoT is Levi, who is now known in the fandom as that guy that has a thing for cleaning, though this was barely present in the original show. In Attack on Chibi, they decide that it would be a good idea if they drag that cleaning joke for Tumblr users to fangasm.Does it work?I don't see too many people really talking about this.The only reason this cashgrab exists is to remind you that AoT is still a thing and that the second season will be out in 2016, but there was no point in making this.Every character is an exaggerated version of their fanfictions, the comedy is slaptstick nonsense and everything else is not note worthy. But I will give them credit for one thing. At times, they play serious music in the background while parodying a scene from the show, and I'm not sure how, but it works pretty well. Unfortunetely, this is barely present in the show, and is only used in episode 1 and episode 12, which are the best episodes.The rest? It's hard to watch. It really is. Not only that, but the episodes are only 17 minutes for some reason, and it doesn't help that each episode feels longer than the average 22 minutes, too.This show is like anime, a mistake. 3/10 of getting another dollar.

If you have not seen or did not enjoy the world of Attack on Titan, don't watch this. Straight up don't do it. You will be on the outside of an inside joke. Knowledge of the original series is absolutely critical to getting anything out of this spin-off. It is a parody that relies heavily on the parallels it draws between the original characters and events and the irony of twisting the setting in which those events take place. If you haven't seen the original version, this is going to come off...like an episode of Dora the Explorer or some shit, and it's also going to spoil the events of the original series, so just don't do it. Don't.Okay, so everyone left reading has seen the original at this point, right? Excellent. Here we go.I expected to think that this series was stupid. I literally only watched it out of morbid curiosity, the ease of time commitment (episodes are roughly 15 minutes long), and the fact that I really missed the original cast of characters while waiting on Shingeki no Kyojin's third season. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a well-crafted parody that is at once naively childish AND smart.If you've never seen the original, this series is going to consist of a bunch of hammy characters trying to naively solve silly, inconsequential problems in the wholesomest of ways. It's very hard-work-and-friendship-conquer-all. It's cutesy. It's corny. It feels like an episode of My Little Pony. However, that's kind of where its brilliance lies. What the series is actually doing is wryly mocking the very R-rated, tragic, and horrifying events of the original story. With that in mind, Chuugakkou is quite sick, twisted, and wryly hilarious.The characters are overblown, exaggerated versions of themselves, each one successfully lampshading their defining traits. It helps the comedy that the same cast of actors returned to voice them and treated them with the same emotional depth and gravitas as the original series, expounding the dramatic irony. What references are made to the events of Shingeki no Kyojin are both unexpected and hilariously underplayed, leading to genuine laugh-out-loud moments in each episode. The plot of each episode is more or less irrelevant nonsense--it's merely a vehicle for character-driven and context-based mockery. Frankly, the inclusion of a real plot with actual emotional stakes would likely undermine the humour of the series. It's necessary only as a backdrop for a bunch of darkly funny silliness.Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou is a splendid supplement for Attack on Titan fans twiddling their thumbs between seasons. It gives you a light-hearted dose of your favourite cast of characters and successfully lampoons the horrors-of-war storyline in a way that would frankly be insulting if it weren't written, produced, and performed by all of the people involved in the original project.

Often times, these spin-offs come in the form of OVA\'s, extra episodes that usually don\'t pertain to the original plot and go off on their own little sidestories.  Other times, we have completely different stories that are usually for comedic reasons and pander to fans of this series.  This...is the latter.Story: Attack! Titan Junior High, as it\'s known in English travels into a different world of the SNK world where all of our \'lovable\' characters go to...junior high school (or middle school) at Titan Junior high where they experience the best school life possible, filled with fun, excitement, and the signature rampaging monsters known as titans.  What fun!The main thing here to realize is that the SNK that a lot of people know and love has been turned into a school comedy.  All of the events that have happened in the series both in the anime and the manga have not transpired, and everyone is alive.  Note, EVERYONE is alive.  So, what does this say about this show?  Well, not much really.To be honest, there\'s nothing really interesting about the story of Attack Junior High.  Every episode, our merry band of lovable titan killers go about their daily school lives, doing what apparently every middle/high school in Japan does according to anime such as: school festivals, club activities, getting love letters, and sacrificing your lunch to the oppressive titan species that for some reason has a school right next to you.  And honestly, that\'s all the show has to offer.  In every episode, we follow Eren, or some other member of the main SNK cast on a mini adventure that usually has some kind of throwback to the original series be it a reference to an iconic scene, or hidden little references that every SNK that sees it will go, ""Oh!  It\'s that!  Nice!"" or something of that sort.In the end, Attack! Titan Junior High is a bland piece of cheap entertainment that only really services hardcore fans of the SNK series.  Its entire potential was wasted at the start since it tried to take a series and turn it into something it both wasn\'t and could never be.Overview:-  Bland, marketed spin-off-  Seriously though, there is nothing worth about this series.Characters: Similar to their original counterparts, the cast of this show is essentially a devolved version of the entire SNK cast, with each character retaining only one of their \'vast\' amount of traits.  Eren is the same genocidal maniac who wants to kill all titans, Mikasa is her same ""only sustained by Eren"", Jean wants to be popular with the ladies, Sasha wants food, Conny could give less of a crap about anything, etc.The most noticeable difference I can see in terms of cast is the fact that Armin for some reason is a temperature freak who for the life of him cannot take cold, even if it\'s 70 degrees Fahrenheit outside, and requires a futon on or around him at all times, which really makes him look and seem more ridiculous than he already was.  (And that\'s saying something.)And as I mentioned before, every character, and I mean every character of the SNK series appears in this spin-off, including Levi\'s dead patrol, Sawny and Bean, and the other nobodies who died during the first arc of the series.In the end though, there still really isn\'t much to say.  These characters already weren\'t really that good as proper characters in the original series and seeing them again, especially in a format that really doesn\'t try and make them seem likable, doesn\'t really help this show in a positive light.Overview:+ Everyone comes back-  Everyone is one-note and/or boring.  (We get it, Eren.  You want to kill all the titans.  Shout something else for once, will ya?!)Art: Now, the art.  The art is one of the more peculiar things about this spin-off.  Wit Studio made the original SNK with a very definied artstyle with everything looking somewhat melancholy with these thick black lines to define character outline, folds in the face, etc.  But for this spin-off, we have Production I.G. taking the reins in development and you know...there\'s just something...off, about this.Attack! Titan Junior High uses a chibi or moe style of animation that isn\'t really all that unique in any way.  Nothing about the show really stands out except for the way the characters were made.  To put it in simple terms, the characters look both great, and terrifying in Chibi form.  Now, why do I say they look great and terrifying?  Well, it\'s because the chibi format really doesn\'t work for everyone.There are certain characters in the SNK universe that have an inherently defined look to them like Erwin, Jean, and Keith.  And as such, when being transferred, look really, REALLY weird in this format to the point that they look laughable or out of place.  (Seriously, who thought that was a good idea?)  They look so off with the chibi proportions that are displayed that it\'s just jarring to look at.  Other characters like our three main characters, Christa, Sasha, and even Conny look fine, but it\'s just hard not to remember how creepy it looks to see Jean\'s unmodified face stuck onto a Chibi body.  (Now THAT\'S true nightmare fuel)Overview+/- Average and generally normal quality-  Some of the characters look off; VERY off.Sound:  The soundtrack for Attack! Titan Junior High is basically what you heard in the original SNK with only a few minor differences.  Every so often in the show, they will play one or two sound bites that will sound familiar if you\'ve seen the original series, but that\'s about it for relation to the original.What makes this series different than its predecessor is its opening.  Essentially, it\'s a rehash of the first opening of SNK with a more \'school-related\' sound to it with ringing bells and sounding more upbeat than its original melancholy self.  The ending is rather generic, so it really doesn\'t deserve much special mention either.Overview:+  Throwbacks to the original-   Any music made specifically for this is meh at best.Personal Enjoyment: First of all, I didn\'t really like the original SNK.  And it\'s not because I\'m inherently someone who just doesn\'t like THE popular thing, but rather because it was a show that had promising potential, but just had a lot of flaws that hampered the quality of the show.  (Plus fandom.  I hate fandom.)  So, after finishing this what are my thoughts?Did I like this show?Ok, for the first episode, sure.  It\'s the kind of one-off experience thing where you\'re like, ""Wow, this is a thing.  That\'s a little funny.""  because it\'s a parody of a series that\'s just so bad, it\'s funny.  But, with every new episode, the show got tired fast and there really wasn\'t anything to enjoy watching.  At least it\'s only like 15 minutes an episode, so you don\'t have to suffer a full-length episode worth of soulless material.What didn\'t I like about this show?Most of all, it\'s just how bland and tasteless this felt.  It\'s a spin-off that only really served to market SNK even more as a series, pandering to the fandom and following it has, thus creating a series that even as a comedy, failed to fulfill.  There just didn\'t seem like there was much effort put into it, like I.G. thought, ""We can make this as crap as we want; people\'ll still watch it.""  Which...kinda came true in the end.Would I recommend this show?If you love SNK.  And I mean LOVE SNK, then this is a show you should probably watch, since its got all of the SNK wrapped up in a different setting package.  But if you\'re not one of those die-hard fans, just don\'t even consider this; you\'re only wasting your time with this series if you decide to watch it. junior high school (or middle school) at Titan Junior high where they experience the best school life possible, filled with fun, excitement, and the signature rampaging monsters known as titans.

But then why would I still rate it 7?You see... As far as it\'s right that the plot is very alike it\'s still a...fact as well that this anime has a far more humorous aspect to the story. This creates a whole new dimension which is way too looked upon as this is actually a very clever and creative idea.Art - 8The art concept is not bad but rather somewhat medicore. I\'ve seen better, I\'ve seen worse. But for this plot and the whole chibi act this art is absolutely fitting and wouldn\'t be half as good with lovely realistic rivers and perfect looking building.In the end it\'s a great art for this type of anime, yet it\'s not as good as it could\'ve been if the genre had been otherwise. Therefore I decided to give it a somewhat reasonable high grade.Sound - 9The original opening was amazing, this new opening is very alike but again somehow manages to succed in replacing the old opening in a humourous way. In the end it\'s creative, funny and more importantly extremely enjoyable. I see absolutely no reason to call of this to a low grade as all the other sounds such as the ost and ending are all of the same caliber.Character - 10They were awesome and rad before right? I mean if you disliked the original, then why would you watch this?Just as amazingly cool the characters were before, just as chill, funny and ironic are they now. They\'re literally the same chracters, but once again they\'re just turned into the comedy genre rather than the original action one. They\'re literally perfect and I see no way to improve them... Therefore It had to be a 10!Enjoyment - 9As I stated earlier, this might very well be milking the cow a bit much, but I mean hey! It\'s funny, it\'s entertaining and the 18 minutes that each episodes take is 18 minutes that passes by in what feels like 3-5. It\'s incredibly enjoyable as the story unfolds perfectly in sync with the comedy genre and they even use the main story as a leading thread. By any means this is undoubtfully the best parody of an anime we\'ve had in a VERY long time and it deserves a top spot.OverallI\'m just going to leave a simple math calculation for my explanation on the 99 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 9 = 45 (simply the scores plused together)45 / 5 = 9 (finding the average)And there you have it.The reason this anime should have a higher rating than 1-3. Just because it\'s somewhat ""just another bottle of milk"", doesn\'t mean it can\'t be a great show with some amazing aspects to it.Thanks for reading (Y) fact as well that this anime has a far more humorous aspect to the story. This creates a whole new dimension which is way too looked upon as this is actually a very clever and creative idea.Art - 8The art concept is not bad but rather somewhat medicore. I\'ve seen better, I\'ve seen worse. But for this plot and the whole chibi act this art is absolutely fitting and wouldn\'t be half as good with lovely realistic rivers and perfect looking building.In the end it\'s a great art for this type of anime, yet it\'s not as good as it could\'ve been if the genre had been otherwise. Therefore I decided to give it a somewhat reasonable high grade.Sound - 9The original opening was amazing, this new opening is very alike but again somehow manages to succed in replacing the old opening in a humourous way. In the end it\'s creative, funny and more importantly extremely enjoyable. I see absolutely no reason to call of this to a low grade as all the other sounds such as the ost and ending are all of the same caliber.Character - 10They were awesome and rad before right?

Very funny but honestly one of the worst cases of character reductionism and Flanderization I've ever seen. If you can handle viewing the characters of Attack on Titan as one-dimensional and with none of the depth they enjoy in the original series, you'll like this. Its practically required to have seen the first season of Attack on Titan to understand many of the references in...this series. this series."", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I want to save my nostalgic anecdote related to Attack on Titan for when the second season eventually rolls around. (It recently got pushed back to 2017, so we have a bit of time before I share the tale.)In the meantime, I will say that, based on the contents of Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou, I would not consider myself a clean-freak. I like doing the dishes, taking out the garbage, and making sure my abode is relatively clean, but I have no qualms with keeping my room messy.If I had the three-dimensional maneuver gear that Mikasa,...Eren, and the rest of the gang use to clean the massive walls at their junior high, however, I am positive that I would do a lot more cleaning than I already do. Until I get that gear, I can bide my time with Chuugakkou, a more-than-solid anime based on its more-than-popular relative.STORYChuugakkou stems from the famous Attack on Titan series. But this anime is no sequel, and it is technically no spin-off. Instead, Chuugakkou is a parody of Titan proportions.The premise loosely relates to the main series: Humans live among the Titans. But rather than practicing fighting mechanics and protecting their loved ones, they practice mathematics and protect their lunchboxes. The Titans disrupt their daily lives on occasion, but they are never a pressing issue – at least, to the extent that they are in the main series.For example, one episode has a female Titan falling in love with Jean. Another episode has a bunch of the Titans stealing the students’ cheeseburger stand. In reality, these two instances (and discounting Hange’s strange obsession with tickling Titans) showcase the Titans the most. Arguably, foregoing the Titans in favor of focusing on the classroom activities, the test of courage, and the student council presidential election may be a mistake. After all, the anime is poised as a parody of the main series. Meaning, no Titans equals no parody.Thankfully, Chuugakkou realizes the lack of Titans and pursues parodying the other parts of the main series. And it does so expertly. Many of the scenes mirror those in the main series – right down to the dialogue used. A nice example is in episode seven. Their year’s class is getting crushed in the sport’s day games. Mikasa, wanting to rally everyone, gives a goading speech, declaring how strong she is and how weak they are. Her speech matches the one she gives following a devastating event in the main series. Even Jean’s response – that Mikasa’s oratory skills need work – is the same.The anime does this scene-for-scene parody a lot.Episode twelve contains some advice from Levi to Eren about making decisions and relying either on oneself or one’s comrades (with accompanying desperation look from Petra).Episode ten has Marco giving an encouraging speech for Jean, a (similar) speech that he also gives in the main series following Armin’s risky plan.Episode eight has Erwin Smith standing behind Eren, Erwin’s hands on Eren’s shoulders and asking Eren what he sees. Same as he did in the main series.These are just a handful of examples. In reality, the amount of parody that goes on is substantial, indicating the anime’s tight focus throughout the entire season.This direct parodying is not always comedic, but it is nostalgic. At least, for those that have seen the main series. And, to be fair to Chuugakkou, that is the audience for this anime – fans of the Attack on Titan series.Armin dresses up as a poster girl (highlighting his effeminate appearance). Eren carries a key on his shoulder with glowing-green eyes (simultaneously referring to the boulder-carrying sequence and the all-important key to the basement). The anime states how almost inconceivable it would be to have broken three-dimensional maneuver gear (which, of course at this point, happens in the anime). Jokes, events, and tropes lost on non-main-series watchers, but, for those familiar with the series, become welcomed allusions.Chuugakkou also adds subtle parodic elements that boost the show’s comedy chops that much further. In the classroom, Mikasa’s drawing of Eren is, for a junior-high student, a literal work of art, joking about Mikasa’s perfection in everything she does. The masks and puppets that sometimes pop up match some of the iconic Titans. And Levi calling Hange “Abnormal” is a reference to the above and other, irregular Titans while also acting as an insult.Beyond the parody, the anime also includes other comedic bits. Background dialogue between Ymir and Krista about Eren incorrectly putting his name on a makeshift stamp. The characters nicely timing a repeat joke about Annie going to a Titan-and-human-mixed cram school. Mikasa unfazed by nearly every ridiculous event that happens around her.And that is the extent of the anime. Chuugakkou does not go for worthwhile themes, and it does not have to. In its seventeen-minute episodes, the anime focuses purely on being a parodic, comedic experience. An experience that does almost everything right.ANIMATIONChuugakkou continues its strengths through its art and animation.Actual animation remains surprisingly high throughout most of the season. The exaggerated nature of the anime allows for a lot of character movement in the form of three-dimensional maneuver gear, cooking food, and running Titans. Even when characters are not doing much, their eyes, limbs, and other attachments move with fluidity.Artistically, however, the anime is a toss-up.On the one hand, the backgrounds and the places visited are bland. The school grounds do not invite many opportunities for gritty details or impressive-looking locations.On the other hand, the comedy and the parody does not stop. Characters wear silly expressions to elicit laughter, and specific scenes will literally be identical to those in the main series – frame-for-frame, perspective, and orientation.As for the character designs, they stay mostly true to their originals. “Mostly” because there are some changes. Mikasa’s eyes are more passive. Armin wears a futon wrapped around his head. Hannes dons a janitor’s outfit.The thick, black lines, the attire of the corps, and the realness is exchanged for a small (pun intended) difference: The designs are all in miniature form. The characters have heads pretty much as big as their bodies, giving them all a silly look that boosts the comedy once again.CHARACTERSAlmost every character from the main series appears here in Chuugakkou.Naturally, the big three – Mikasa, Eren, and Armin – are front and center. Mikasa still has her unwavering devotion to Eren and her impossibly impeccable skills. Eren’s hatred for the Titans is as fervent as ever. And Armin’s baby behavior burns brightly. They are the same characters that the majority of the anime community have come to know and love.Many of the other characters are the same way, sticking to well-known tropes. Sasha loves food more than anything. Connie is somewhat dimwitted. Jean vies for popularity with the ladies. Oluo bites his tongue whenever he talks. Levi is scarily intimidating yet helpful. Ymir fawns and protects Krista who in turn continues being the nicest person imaginable (and a cutie to boot). Annie acts standoffish, Hange is slightly insane, and Hannah and Franz are madly in love.What gets lost in translation between the main series and Chuugakkou is the drama the cast experience. Without the looming threat of Titans, the potential loss of loved ones, and the intense interactions of the cast, the characters become only their aforementioned superficial traits. I.e., they lack depth.The result is a lot of repetition on the characters’ part. Mikasa does nothing more than say “Eren!” the whole time. Connie exists to say something slightly stupid sometimes. Oluo always bites his tongue whenever he appears.Now, the argument is that this repetitive behavior is yet another parodic element of Chuugakkou because the main series takes this route with its characters as well. The argument does not work, however, for two reasons.One, only two characters are as repetitive here as they are in the main series: Mikasa and Eren. The majority of Mikasa’s dialogue in the main series includes Eren’s name, and, for Eren, his dialogue is some variation of “I will kill all the Titans!” Even then (and has been brought up), more happens to and is shown of their characters in the main series, so the repetition (however slightly) is cut down.Two, the frequency of the characters here compared to the main series is wildly different. In the main series, some of these characters only appear just in the first half or just in the second half, and some of these and other characters are killed off, eliminating them from the anime entirely. In Chuugakkou, nothing horrible ever happens to the characters and they are always around (since they are in the same class and clubs), so their traits are simply present more than usual.So while the lack of depth for the characters can be explained away by the extreme focus on parody and comedy, the repetition cannot. The repetition causes Chuugakkou to lean on the same jokes with its cast time and again, reducing the efficacy of the parody and comedy it strives for.SOUNDParody continues with the music employed by Chuugakkou.In particular, the original soundtrack uses many of the same iconic pieces that the main series is known for. Perhaps obviously, the intense and melancholic tracks are nowhere near as impactful when compared to the main series, but they are just as awesome to hear. Plus, they contrast with the everyday happenings and the exaggerated reactions. This contrast adds yet another layer to the comedy, making the show that much more focused.The voice-acting performances are nice in the sense that the actors and actresses who portray these characters in the main series return to portray these characters in this series. Yui Ishikawa, Yuki Kaji, and Marina Inoue reprise their roles as Mikasa, Eren, and Armin respectively to make the main-series fans feel as if they are at the Walls once more.The voice-acting performances are not-so-nice in the sense that the characters do not have many chances to demonstrate their chops. Not as much yelling, screaming, and emotion goes on. They (obviously) sound the same as when they speak in the main series, but the performances simply do not stand out as anything special.The opening theme (as one should guess) parodies the OP of the main series (right down to the subtle glance Mikasa gives Eren). Per usual, this iteration of the OP is not as intense, choosing a much happier and optimistic tone. The end of Chuugakkou’s OP makes this tone quite apparent with its less-than-serious lyrics and upbeat nature. As a parody song, it works. As a standalone song, it does not have the power and emotion to carry itself.The ending theme is reminiscent of Attack on Titan’s second ED, but it does not feel like a parody of the track as the OP does. Following the mood of the show, the piece is quite lighthearted, filled with guitars and drums that seem to erupt from a makeshift garage band. The track does not have any catchy or memorable sections, unfortunately. Combined with its non-parody status, this ED ends up being subpar at best.ENJOYMENTI am not sure how many of my readers know this, but I am a big fan of the main series. A few reasons make this so. One of the biggest – perhaps the biggest – is Mikasa.Mikasa is one of my favorite female characters in anime, and, in this one, Mikasa was amazing throughout the season. I loved everything she did. Her nonchalant attitude, her incessant need to do everything with or about Eren, and her general adorableness and awesomeness all made me smile and laugh and be happy.Thus, episode three was my favorite. Seeing Mikasa utterly depressed without Eren around, and then seeing her push Jean out of the way when Eren arrived made me laugh out loud. While her main-series counterpart is even better, Mikasa made this anime for me.While I do not like the rest of the cast nearly as much as I do Mikasa, a lot of them were fun, too. Krista being way too cute. Annie’s shyness. Sasha and Connie wanting food and acting dumb. Eren, however, not so much. A ginormous difference compared to the main series makes him a lot less cool, and the difference severely hurts the likability of his character.And, in order to make valid comparisons, this one gave me an easy excuse to watch a large chunk of the main series. Getting to rewatch the main series made me more than happy, but it also made it apparent how much weaker the school setting is. The magnitude and the intensity is a large part of what makes the main series so thrilling, and this one just cannot reach that same level with a bunch of junior-high kids. Mikasa or otherwise.Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou parodies its way to victory. The comedy is focused. The characters, while repetitive in behavior, are reminiscent of their main-series counterparts. And the art, music, and entertainment are strong in their own respective ways. The anime makes it hard to doubt just how clean it is.SUMMARYStory: Great, the parodic and comedic focus never waversAnimation: Good, above average actual animation, mixed artistic direction, and reminiscent yet silly character designsCharacters: Fine, while repetitive, Mikasa, Eren, and the rest of the gang accentuate their main-series counterpartsSound: Fine, okay OP, bad ED, good OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, Mikasa is amazing but she and everything else cause yearning for more of the originalFinal Score: 7/10 Eren, and the rest of the gang use to clean the massive walls at their junior high, however, I am positive that I would do a lot more cleaning than I already do.

The titans don\'t play a huge role in every episode and the ones they do, they\'re never threatening to the point of fatality. Characters are frequently stepped on and thrown resembling comic relief you\'d find in a rom-com, and when the mood gets serious, it\'s hardly ten seconds before somebody gets interrupted by some ridiculous incident.It\'s hard to focus on the story because for much of the series, it\'s apparently absent right up until the very end when something relating to Eren\'s first incident occurs again on a bigger scale and reminds you what he was fighting for.Eren\'s noble quest to protect everyone\'s lunch from the titans seems silly in the grand scheme of other issues titan\'s cause, but in the context of this fun parody, it\'s motivation enough to stir some powerful and unsettling reactions in Eren.His character is exaggerated and he\'s usually the loudest in any scene whether the situation warrants it or not, but he\'s still someone who inspires those around him. When it\'s time for someone to step up to the plate and fight, Eren\'s the first one to do it.It\'s interesting to watch the dynamic between Eren and the rest of the first years because even though he\'s virtually the same in every episode, the interactions each character has with him is always unique and something to look forward to. The relationship between Eren, Armin, and Mikasa notably becomes the strongest towards the end and their companionship in this parody hints at something stronger and unbreakable in the original.Even for someone who has not sat through Season One, and now, Season Two of Attack on Titan, by paying enough attention and connecting a few dots, it\'s not hard to guess what might happen to these characters in the original.Overall, even though it\'s a parody, the characters still retain the soul of who they\'re supposed to be and make each episode humorous by playing off their flaws and warping them to extreme degrees.In regards to the art, the original style returns, only shrunken, to create chibi variations of otherwise intimidating cast members such as the titans, Levi, the teachers, and some of the second year students. The style works fine to communicate the nature of the series and you know what you\'re getting into just looking at the cover. No complaints on that front, but the backgrounds are forgettable if you start to remember they exist.The sound quality is great. The opening theme is a reinterpretation of Attack on Titan\'s original and unforgettable first theme song, ""Guren no Yamiya"", and the ending theme, ""Hangeki no Daichi"", is a lively J-Rock song sung by the Japanese voices of Eren (Yuki Kaji), Mikasa (Yui Ishikawa), and Jean (Kishō Taniyama). The background OST adjusts for each mood like it should and when the situation is romantic or tinged with danger, the soundtrack does not disappoint and provides some stirring tracks.I could go on and on about everything well this series does, but for a person who sat through the original Attack on Titan and cried and struggled with those characters, I can understand their irritation. I imagine their feeling is the same as a person who grew up watching Teen Titans and waited years for its return only to get Teen Titans Go on Cartoon Network. But set all that aside and take this show for what it is: a joke. It\'s taking everything that scared you, Eren, and the rest of the first years in the original and putting a baby face on it so it\'s not anywhere near as intimidating as before. And maybe that\'s not for you. Maybe that\'s not what you look for when you watch anime. That\'s fine. But this anime, even if it\'s a parody, has a lot to offer. It still bears a lot of the same emotion I imagine was present in the original and reconstructs it to fit inside a fun and cute story about a man and his burger.If you like Attack on Titan and you\'ve already seen everything else; while you\'re waiting for that third season, you may as well sit down and at least tolerate this 12 episode series. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. And if you don\'t like it, there\'s still casuals like me who have money at the ready to pay for more cash grabs like this and the toys that come with it.So you may as well come along for the ride. of middle school.

Attack on Titan: Junior High is a show that nobody asked for, but one that everyone needed. This show is just AoT wish fulfillment and I can shamelessly say I don\'t care.Story: 8/10I often get bored of stories without an overarching plot, but this show managed to stay fresh and entertaining through all of its episodes. It plays off of typical high school anime scenarios with a unique spice only this cast can bring. Something about these tropes feels innovative,...considering the fact that the AoT world is nothing like this setting. It\'s a bittersweet irony, especially considering how many references they make to the original story.Art: 7/10Definitely nothing too stellar, since all their characters are presented in a chibi art style. I kind of appreciate the change in art style though because the show would feel awkward if it was in the same art style as the original. I think it was a good stylistic choice.Sound: 7/10Again, nothing really to write home about. The sound used in the comedic gags are pretty cliche, but they get the job done and they convey the message clearly.Characters: 9/10I think the most impressive feat of this show was how it managed to still have the essence of the cast in an entirely different setting. It\'s a break from the serious tone and a celebration of the fantastic chemistry between characters and the life their personalities bring to any story.Enjoyment: 9/10Any comedy that has me laughing out loud on multiple occasions definitely earns a 9 in enjoyment. I think the gag about Oluo Bozado biting his tongue is a little overdone, but for the most part, this show has impeccable comedic timing and plays off of the organic character interactions well.Overall: 8/10This is a very character-driven anime, so if you aren\'t a big fan of the AoT cast then this anime is not for you. I see this experience as a breath of air for fans who are sinking deeper and deeper into the dark, twisted world of AoT. Also, if you miss characters who have been killed off as the show\'s aired, then you\'ll be able to enjoy their presence again with this show. That perk is actually the reason I initially wanted to watch this show in the first place. Not only was this able to fill the hole I had in my ""stomach"", but it was also a very pleasant watch and a fun ride. considering the fact that the AoT world is nothing like this setting.

With all your favorite characters from Attack on Titan living in a completely different world, it is perfect to get your mind off of the original series if you need it!While it is a cute show, it also has a ton of callbacks (and also some spoilers if you squint hard enough) to the main show! Making it entertaining for people who both just...started to watch Attack on Titan, along for people who have finished the series!

It\'s full of character development that the anime or even the manga haven\'t particularly touched yet. Also the foreshadowing for events to come are actually rather brutal once you realise them. This is not an anime to watch if you\'re not up-to-date with Season 2 and perhaps even the manga, though the spoilers for the manga are a lot subtler.[POSSIBLE SPOILERS]Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou is actually pretty far ahead of even the Season 2 timeline of Shingeki no Kyojin and...it quite excellently shows the characters of the original show as (decently) normal kids with everyday problems. In this show you can see much more clearly how there was and still are things between characters:Eren <--> Annie, Mikasa <--> Eren, Berthold --> Annie, Christa <--> Ymir and Reiner --> ChristaIt\'s fun to see these normally stone-faced heroes just be kids that have feelings towards one another and try to survive in school against bullies (Titans) and due to the way that Shingeki No Kyojin is made (it\'s not exactly a romance) this is probably the only way to give the viewers confirmation on how the characters truly feel.[EVEN MORE SERIOUS SPOILERS FOR SEASON 2 AND 3-4]And on about the foreshadowing aspects of this anime, well let\'s say that when I realised that Armin can\'t stand the cold and his room is burning hot OR when I noticed how Annie wore the ""Femal titan""-halloween mask and Berthold wore the ""Colossal titan""-halloween mask I had a wide grin in my face. This show is a must-watch for Shingeki no Kyojin -fans, but ONLY if you\'re up-to-date with the manga. It heavily spoils even Season 2 events for Shingeki no Kyojin and manga-readers will undestand how extremely hot conditions are linked with Armin. And that moment when you realise that the ghost girl that helped Christa/Historia is actually Frieda Reiss, I have no idea how they came up with these parts, but they are incredible and bring a joy of realisation for the manga-readers.Shingeki! Kyojin Chuugakkou is in my opinion a Great 9/10, because it\'s far more than just a parody. It handles the characters well and even without a full lenght story to tell it manages to entertain with each separate episode with its fantastic humour, fun animation, cute moments and top-notch foreshadowing and character development. it quite excellently shows the characters of the original show as (decently) normal kids with everyday problems.

The titans themselves looked somewhat stupidly cute as well since their not trying to eat people just their lunches so they would go around causing mischief for the students.I thought the comedy was pretty funny and they would constantly use stuff from the original series and turn them into jokes like Oluo biting his tongue while he monologues or Hange being a completely crazy person because of her interests in titans and I think this version of her is probably more crazy than the original.Overall I thought this was actually a pretty good parody, but I wouldn't recommend watching it until after you've seen the second season because it does easter egg some spoilers in here if you notice them, other than that I think AoT fans would definitely enjoy this. make AoT a show about people fighting and dying from giant monsters known as Titans and somehow change it into something cute which was a definite surprise and it mostly works, most of the time it was entertaining, but there were some cringey moments and it definitely spoils some things for season 2 like Bertholdt wearing a colossal titan mask which surely isn't a dead give away.It definitely turns out like your usual school anime with the sports festival, running for council president, test of courage and even a cook off and along the way it manages to incorporate moments from the main series into this which actually played out pretty well.The characters are basically comedy versions of themselves as the show really uses the aspects we thought were funny about them in the main series and make it their entire character in this like Sasha eating a lot of food, Mikasa's obsession with Eren really makes her out to be a really tense Yandere, Levi's cleanliness powers are certainly off the scale and then there's Reiner's and Ymir's obsession with Krista as they fight over for her.The show used these aspects to great effect and they worked really well although sometimes Eren's titan slaughtering behaviour did get on my nerves and I never really understood why Armin was always in the state of having a constant cold which just didn't make any sense and the fact they dressed him up in a bunny outfit just made him look like a trap which is something I didn't really want to see.I thought the artstyle was actually pretty good and it suited the characters well especially for some like Mikasa, Annie, Sasha, Connie, Armin, Eren and even Levi as it made them look really cute.

This is a loosely based Shingeki No Kyojin spin-off series, therefore in the (however unlikely) event that you watched this show without having watched the main anime, this review might not be for you, however I will be regarding the aspects of this show both in regards to the original show, and without.Story 6/10The story is basically an alternate more comedic version of the original SnK anime. Humanity exists in a confined space, due to the presence of Titans. In SnK Titans threaten humanity itself, in this show the humans school lunch.A...lot more comedic and with a much more upbeat and softer tone, the story is entertaining, but not much else can be said about it, gets the job done. If you have not watched SnK then this story might be a bit silly and not really able to hold up on it\'s own.Characters 6/10The cast is the SnK characters, but made in a chibi like design and shifted to a high-school setting. Character traits and personality are the same but are a bit more exaggerated and greatly applied in the various school situations to enhance comedic effect. Interactions with characters that never happened (or cannot happen) in the original SnK are present in this one. The show takes full advantage of the characters and creates some pretty funny sequences with them. I\'d say that the characters are the meat and potatoes of the show since they are the key ingredient to making this show work. Finishing the show you might feel that you learned a bit more about the characters, and it\'s overall a pleasant change to see them in that setting.However, If you haven\'t watched SnK then much like with the story, you are out of context and most of the comedic effect of the characters will be greatly diminished.Art 6/10The aesthetic of the show is very fitting and appropriately transformed. Much like the opening credits everything is given more color a happier, campier look and an overall ""shrinkage"" if you think how Titanic (ba dum tss) SnK seems to feel. Characters much like the rest of the show are all drawn in chibi-like versions of themselves. Overall I\'d say the show did a perfect job of transitioning the setting and characters of Snk to SnC without compromising any of the aesthetics and personality we come to expect from these characters. Motion looks fluid and various scenes and tension are executed pretty well. My rating here is more influenced on the technical aspect of the Art, at the end of the day it\'s nothing groundbreaking or unprecedented.Sound 6/10Again much like everything else on this show, the soundtrack seems like a transformed version of the SnK soundtrack. There is epic orchestral music, a happier campier version of the 1st SnK opening, and pretty much what you would expect from SnK itself in terms of atmosphere. (Again just a bit different)Enjoyment 7/10If you are a fan of SnK, patiently waiting for season 2, this will definitely get you your SnK fix without diminishing your appetite. There is definitely enjoyment to be had with watching the SnK cast in this alternate setting pulling of zany shenanigans and a pleasant change of tone from the original SnK. If you haven\'t watched SnK , then I really can\'t say if the show will be nearly as enjoyable as it was to me and other fans.In conclusion, SnC is a great spin-off both in concept and execution, it\'s a good way to refresh the characters but giving them a different spin, while filling some time until season 2 is here. However that being said the show by itself is nothing groundbreaking but it gets the job doneOverall 6/10 lot more comedic and with a much more upbeat and softer tone, the story is entertaining, but not much else can be said about it, gets the job done.

This scenario of what if the Attack on Titan cast were in a junior high was a true breath of fresh air for me.This spin-off may not convey deep and dark themes like the official story. However, I find the brighter themes to be a break from all of the darkness that is Attack on Titan. The art style represents the childish nature of the anime. The simplistic...animation and art style suggest that this would be for a children's show. In other words, the art style effectively portrays the genre of the show. No sound design stood out to me. However, the original Attack on Titan soundtrack being used reminds us that this is still a show based on Attack on Titan and not its own thing. The art style and soundtrack work together to both link the show to Attack on Titan and make the show its own thing. Viewing the characters of the original series in a modern junior high scenario is definitely something unique that I am very glad they created as an anime.Seeing the cast happy again made this experience much more enjoyable then you would think. Overall I rank this 7/10. animation and art style suggest that this would be for a children's show. In other words, the art style effectively portrays the genre of the show.

I don’t think it would be super enjoyable if you watch it on its own, cause it’s just slice of life. Still, when I was binge watching attack on titan from season 1 to final, I switched to this as a form of intermission when the series got too much and it was nice. It’s great to see them alive and well, while getting a gilmpse of what they could probably be like if...everything is normal, you know, like, adding to their personality (levi is an emo teenager no one could change my mind). 9/10 should not be watch as a stand-alone, but still a nice addition to the title. everything is normal, you know, like, adding to their personality (levi is an emo teenager no one could change my mind). 9/10 should not be watch as a stand-alone, but still a nice addition to the title.', ""Spoiler Free ReviewSo, it's kind of obvious that Attack on Titan Junior High is just a cute little show that uses the characters from Attack on Titan. I will say that I had more fun in this show than I did with Koro-Sensei Quest. The characters were fun and it was nice to see them in a peaceful environment for a change. This show doesn't even try to be something that it isn't. This could be a good thing, but it stops this show from being a great show.

I found enjoyable and funny. So its changed where instead of Titans eating people, Titans are bullies who take food from the main cast. And instead of killing titans they knock them out. It was kinda fun to see but it had flaws. The chibi form was kind of disappointing but I guess it was supposed to be cute. I expected more from Production I.G. Instead of being a parody it felt like it steered away from the actual show and was just its own thing, I would’ve liked it to...stay close to the show with a twist. stay close to the show with a twist.', ""Production I.G. is truly made up of some talented people. Somehow, they managed to make a show about people witnessing their loved ones being eaten alive by giants, adorable and funny. So this anime's main setting is a middle school divided in two: one section's for Titans, the other humans. The weirdness doesn't end there. In this alternate reality, Titans are interested in the kids' LUNCHES. And that's what Eren's so mad at the Titans for. The rest of the cartoon's a cute recreation of season one of the show they're parodying (Attack on Titan). This is a cute, slice-of-live style review of the major...events in the first season.

I've never watched real Attack on Titan because I am 12, and it looks like it would give me nightmares. So when I found out they made a spin-off about the characters but they too have just started middle school and were my age, I was like: YES. So I watched it and had a lot of fun! I think that if you like slap-stick too much and you also like one-liners, then you'll probably enjoy this show. If you are like me and can't watch the real deal but are in middle school, I highly recommend watching this show! I watched this with...my little sister who is 6 and we had a lot of fun with it!

And man its so funnyStory: I\'m not gonna spoiler. But there is less blood in it. More story based on food. And those titans are jerks. Well there is not a linear story in it. More like a parasoy of there lives. Wich makes it really easy...to watch and understand.Art: Art is maby a little bit childish. But its also kinda funny. My favorite artstyle is the Conny face. Wich makes me laugh all the time. Art is good for a ""Little bit"" childish serie.Sound: Opening and ending are fine. But the effect are good. Dont know why i say this. Its just good.Character: Ok we ""Almost"" all know Eren Jaeger. This guy is still to fanatic in killing those titans. Well in this serie its nothing less. Because Eren got some issues with the Titans being jerks. He cant help him to kill (kinda?!) the titans. And well its a failure.Conny in the other hand is my favorite, why? Well my best friend told me he is like me at school. He doesnt care about school. And he is a little bit, we call it in Dutch nonchalant. Wich means well, if I dobt have a problem. I dont car attitude. He is a good person.Mikasa is my favorite female MC. She is just focussed to much at Eren wich is funny.

There's 12 episodes of 14 minutes if you exclude the opening/ending. Since it's a parody and it's based on the original anime you need to watch the first season of attack on titan before watching this. This parody also references the first episode of the attack on titan OVA quite a lot so it's probably worth watching that too.There's at least one reference to an event in the second season but this reference isn't important and you don't have to watch the second season before watching this.The story is...a parody of attack on titan where all important characters are students or teachers and the titans are bullies who steal the student's food. It is in this setting that the parody recreates many of the scenes from the original anime, though not always in the correct order. A nice detail is that there's also a parody of the original opening which is pretty neat. The parody is pure comedy so if you don't like comedy this isn't worth watching.The characters are the same as in the original anime but more one-dimensional and with some characteristics changed/taken to the extreme.The animation is quite alright for a parody and there's nothing wrong with the voice acting. The music seems to be mostly taken from the original anime and simply re-used. This could be bad considering the atmosphere in the parody and the original anime is quite different but it seems to work out alright.Overall this is a pretty okay parody and worth watching if you were a fan of the original and like the comedy genre. a parody of attack on titan where all important characters are students or teachers and the titans are bullies who steal the student's food.

It loosely follows the same plotlines of the AOT\'s first season, so you might wanna watch that first before watching it. Ironically, there is an accidental season 4 spoiler in the last episode, but you wouldn\'t really get it unless you watched the main show up to that point, so you should be fine. I would consider Junior High to be supplementary bonus content for AOT, but its definitely worth checking out! Especially if you\'re in need of a laugh!Production Wise, the show transforms all...the characters into chibi form to reflect that the show is taking place in a middle school setting rather than them being teenagers in a post-apocalyptic future. They do revert to their original appearance during some dramatic moments for comedic effect. The intro is very reminiscent of Season 1\'s intro, with similar songs and it following the same general pattern. The outros are perfectly different. In Junior, the outro song is called Counter Attack, and follows the chibi cast just goofing around life size objects. The song is pretty enjoyable and I occasionally still listen to it. They also have an adorable animation of Eren and Mikasa running on the chalkboard as the day progresses which was one of my favorite things about the show. The episodes aren\'t as long as the original episodes but for bonus content/parody series, they\'re pretty good length. The characters each have aspects of their personalities dialed up which makes for some pretty funny and enjoyable content. What\'s even better is that the original voice actors also voice the characters in this show (in both sub and dub).Going into the story now. Similarly to the original AOT, the story begins with the Colossal Titan attacks Eren\'s home. Instead of his mom getting eaten, its his lunch that gets the short end of the stick. From that day onward, Eren vows revenge on the titans. Parallel to the start of the show, Eren wakes up crying from that recollection by Mikasa who informs them they\'re late for school and they rush to head out. Eren and Mikasa then meet the rest of our cast: Jean, Connie, Sasha, Ymir, Krista and Annie either from accidentally running into them (literally. They do the classic running with toast in your mouth trope with Krista), or meeting up with them in the titan school. They then find their way to their right school with the help of Hannes where they\'re later attacked by the Colossal Titan again at their entrance ceremony and have their lunches taken. They\'re also introduced to their teacher who is Keith Shadis, and it makes for some hilarious recreation of the training scenes.Eren and Mikasa are then tasked to bring in Armin, who has been suspiciously absent. They make Armin out to be this sickly character who has to have his futon with him at all times or he gets sick, which makes for a pretty funny running gag. They\'re then saved by Levi, who is in charge of a ""secret"" club, The Scouts. Eren and the crew go on to join them as well as the Wall Clean Up Club headed by Rico (granted, Shadis forces them).The rest of the show goes on with some funny skits in a linear progression. Going from a whole love letter scenario, sports day festival, class elections, scout initiation, summer festival and school day festival. The episodes parody the events of the show while also doing their own thing with their own storylines. It\'s done pretty well and make for some pretty funny and hilarious moments. The characters in Junior High are pretty loyal to their versions in the original story and it makes for some wholesome and hilarious content.  The story ends with Eren getting his revenge on the titans by reclaiming his cheese burger and Erwin remarking that they\'ve taken one step closer to being free of the titans.As I mentioned above, there is an accidental Season 4 spoiler. After the school day festival and Eren tries to get his Cheeseburger Stand back from the Titans, Levi and his squad show up as a distraction and put on a musical performance for the titans. The schtick of this fake band is that they’re all wrapped in bandages, including Levi. If you’ve watched Season 4, you should get what I’m saying here.If you liked AOT, you’ll like the Junior High version. It’s a sweet, wholesome and funny parody of the show, and it make for some “feel good” content considering how dark and gritty AOT can be sometimes. I wouldn\'t say its as great as the original, but its worth checking out! Though you should at least watch the first season. I also wouldn\'t be opposed to them continuing the story in some fashion, especially since the original story is coming to an end here soon, but given that its been 8 years now, I doubt they\'ll do anything further with this. the characters into chibi form to reflect that the show is taking place in a middle school setting rather than them being teenagers in a post-apocalyptic future.

Don\'t get me wrong, transposing the characters of a serious action-horror series into a high school for a chibi comedy series might have worked if it was well written... but it wasn\'t. All we got were scenes and lines from the main series thrown into a high school context without much context. That\'s not funny, it\'s not even a joke. And it gets worse when the same ""jokes"" are repeated over and over, like the scene of Hange nearly getting her head chopped off. Did you laugh seeing it once? Well, you won\'t after the fifth freaking time!Throwaway lines from the...series, like Eren telling Mikasa that ""I\'m not your little brother and not some snot-nosed toddler"" are also repeated several times throughout the series, and I just don\'t get why. They add nothing and feel really out-of place when added. Characters frequently have inconsistent personalities between scenes (especially Jean and Mikasa) as a result of the writers trying to combine the personalities of the original versions of the characters with the exaggerated weird personalities that the show is trying to give them.With that said, the Dodgeball episode was hilarious, and I love how adorable they made chibi-Armin. The best episode by far though was the Halloween special, which combines so many insane ideas and ends with such a stupid nonsensical resolution that I couldn\'t help but laugh... But as I said, the laughs were rare and most of the jokes kept being repeated.It also sucks that in this series, titans go to school just like humans (they eat people\'s lunch boxes instead of eating people), because it means that the school allowed Zoe Hange (one of their students) to kidnap and experiment on other students for science club. How would the parents feel about that?In short, it\'s a mostly unfunny, endlessly repetitive series with only two (really) good episodes. Oh, and one where Jean falls in love with two vegetables. 3/10 not recommended. series, like Eren telling Mikasa that ""I\'m not your little brother and not some snot-nosed toddler"" are also repeated several times throughout the series, and I just don\'t get why. They add nothing and feel really out-of place when added. Characters frequently have inconsistent personalities between scenes (especially Jean and Mikasa) as a result of the writers trying to combine the personalities of the original versions of the characters with the exaggerated weird personalities that the show is trying to give them.With that said, the Dodgeball episode was hilarious, and I love how adorable they made chibi-Armin. The best episode by far though was the Halloween special, which combines so many insane ideas and ends with such a stupid nonsensical resolution that I couldn\'t help but laugh... But as I said, the laughs were rare and most of the jokes kept being repeated.It also sucks that in this series, titans go to school just like humans (they eat people\'s lunch boxes instead of eating people), because it means that the school allowed Zoe Hange (one of their students) to kidnap and experiment on other students for science club.

Soukou Kihei Votoms: Red Shoulder Document - Yabou no Roots,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2585/Soukou_Kihei_Votoms__Red_Shoulder_Document_-_Yabou_no_Roots,"[""A pretty welcome bonus prequel chapter in the Votoms saga. Seeing the same style designs as the series with much higher quality animation was a big treat. However, I felt that this didn't give me as much new information as I wanted.At first I thought that since this came out years later that this would be even darker and more violent than the original, but if it was, it was a negligible amount. The gritty realism has always been the highlight of Votoms, and I hoped it would be realized and taken even more seriously here. I'm satisfied that they've kept this value, at the...very least.I'm also disappointed that I didn't get any more insight into Chirico's character. He seems the same as he was at the start of the series. I assumed the harsh Red Shoulder training (of which we didn't get much of because of the length) would be what turned him into a stoic soldier, but I didn't get to see any kind of transition. Instead the whole thing mainly felt like a tribute to the Chirico we already know and a highlight of his special traits that make him up in a different context. I'm a little upset, because the potential for this part of Chirico's history was very high. Still, I was entertained. very least.I'm also disappointed that I didn't get any more insight into Chirico's character. He seems the same as he was at the start of the series.

It was incredible and there was so much tension the whole time. It's actually kind of funny how when everyone learns Chirico is an abnormal survivor they all try to kill him (it's comedic how extreme the military goes to test if he really is an abnormal survivor).This was strong from beginning to end. I can't really say I had a favorite part it was all good and the tension never ends from beginning to end.This story takes place before The Last Red Shoulder (and is the earliest story so far...in the VOTOMS franchise). This would be a good standalone OVA for someone who never saw VOTOMS before but wants to experience it without starting with the show.I don't really have much to say about the story because there's nothing I have to critique about it. It was presented well from start to finish.I don't like though they changed Chirico to being from planet Sunsa even though they established he is from Melkia in the original series. They also changed it to him having participated in the massacre of Sunsa with the Red Shoulders despite in the series he claims his squad didn't partake in the conquest of Sunsa.The retcons kind of mess things up.Imo I want to give it a 9 but I can't with the retcons.I'll give it 8/10 (also the music fit perfectly the emotion in some of the scenes, I tried looking for one track I really liked but it wasn't on YouTube or I would've linked it). in the VOTOMS franchise).

Tenchi Muyou! in Love 2: Harukanaru Omoi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1144/Tenchi_Muyou_in_Love_2__Harukanaru_Omoi,"[""It's refreshing to watch a theatrical anime done by cel, now that every other anime is done by CG. Usually cel anime are pretty poor in graphics, but theatrical ones tend to be very good in quality, like the one we have here, Tenchi Muyo in Love 2. This movie is done in 1999, which is more than 10 years old by now, but it's a gem. I found the DVD lying around in a sale for $1 and honestly I didn't have high hopes for it, but the content far exceeds its price. Tenchi Muyo in Love 2 brought back the excitement I once...had for animation movies.Story: 7/10This movie is an original, meaning it's not a sequel/prequel to the TV/OVA whatsoever, borrowing just the concept/cast/background of Tenchi Muyo, which I like. The story's rather simple but intriguing, with an interesting twist. The pace of the whole show is set steadily and it gives a lot of room for thinking. The setting felt somewhat nostalgic and familiar. The tone is not as comical as the TV/OVA but a tad more serious.Art: 9/10The art of Tenchi Muyo in Love 2 is beautiful. I grew up with cel-art, but my generation belongs to CG, so I can appreciate both kinds of artwork, and the artwork is really really gorgeous. Environments are rendered realistically but it fits the mood and setting. The characters are also drawn in higher quality than in the series, with more care of the details and richer colour. There are a few new character designs that I think are better than the old.Sound: 7/10I don't usually pay attention to the music/sound unless it stands out, but definitely the sound/music helped to create the magical mood/setting of the show. The ending song is very appropriate and soothing as well.Character: 8/10There are some new characters in the movie and I like the characters as they are and how they fit into the movie. The older characters didn't get so much air time but I think each character is given enough screen time to make a significant impact on the main character. The main character gets a lot of development and gets shown in a different light than usual. I felt like I got to know the main character a lot more from this short 1-2hours than the whole TV/OVA series.Enjoyment: 8/10I enjoyed it a lot. It's my cup of tea. The ending was done rather well, and the length of the movie is just nice.Overall: 8/10Anyone who enjoys a good cup of a romance movie should try Tenchi Muyo in Love 2. It doesn't really matter if you watched the original series or not. Definitely a must watch for people who likes older anime and cel graphics. had for animation movies.Story: 7/10This movie is an original, meaning it's not a sequel/prequel to the TV/OVA whatsoever, borrowing just the concept/cast/background of Tenchi Muyo, which I like.

I\'m sharing it so you don\'t have to watch the whole thing. Okay, older Tenchi  with long hair is nice, too.For whatever reason this film has the worst art style of all three films, while simultaneously getting what looks like a technical upgrade. Faces are squashed. Ears are rectangular. Bodies are smushed. Most of the time the art team cannot seemingly draw boobs in clothing.I have a thought that maybe the anime team/production company thought ""okay, we had a movie where...the team stalks a teenager the whole film, then the Christmas alien kidnap film, now what? Oh, I know, we\'ll have Tenchi get kidnapped, brainwashed, and sexually assaulted the whole film with a sort of thriller-esque tone as brainwashed Tenchi sort of gets that he\'s in an abusive relationship but can\'t do much about it because Haruna is too powerful I guess.""I\'m also not sure what Haruna gets out of it. Sure, she\'s still in love with Yosho and maybe sexually attracted to Tenchi, but the first time we see them have sex she doesn\'t seem that thrilled. I\'m not sure if it\'s a physical thing or because it\'s a psychologically empty relationship or something (I mean it\'s pretty clear she basically temporarily lobotomized him by screwing with his memories so anything she gets out of it would have to be purely physical). The movie apparently wants you to feel bad for her (see the umbrella scene; like oh no, she had to wait in the rain for a bit and move away from the entrance to a store, such tragic... 9_9) but like... she\'s doing a lot of really awful stuff so... um... no?But we finally get an improvement over the dub :D dub!Yosho crying out for Haruna is awful. in the sub the voice actor did a far better job. Yippee!Skip this. the team stalks a teenager the whole film, then the Christmas alien kidnap film, now what?

The story really attempts to give substance/depth of 2-dimensional characters but barley manages to scratch the minuscule surface of these emotions.  It is a very shallow SLICE-OF-LIFE tale.  This film is very forgettable.The art style and shifts in art throughout the story are very interesting and different.To get ANY ENJOYMENT from this film I would suggest watching  Tenchi Muyo the TV series to understand the character relationships and motivations.There are...not actions scenes or fighting so if that is your thing you might be disappointed. not actions scenes or fighting so if that is your thing you might be disappointed.', ""A suprisingly mature and meditative conclusion to a series who's selling point is asking the audience which alien broad they'd like to date. In fact it could be said the film rather uniquely explores the tropes of the harem genre from which it was birthed. Its heavy focus on the female characters is unique even for the relatively more female focused Tenchi Muyou franchise allows for an exploration of the emotional labour that would of course be associated with the harem or love triangle formula for all particpants. Even in the movie itself there's this strange tonal disonance between the ruminative almost mumble-core discussions on...loss and nostalgia and the more high-concept sci fi set pieces though that gives it a unique charm. loss and nostalgia and the more high-concept sci fi set pieces though that gives it a unique charm.""]"
