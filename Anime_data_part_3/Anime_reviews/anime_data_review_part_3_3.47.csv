Strike the Blood IV,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40485/Strike_the_Blood_IV,"['The underwhelming subtitle work continues with quality that is enough to turn off all those even devout viewers in this fourth installment of the series.Season 4 is a new beast of confusion, with Kojou ending up places with no explanation as well as no explanation with the ending of the first arc. It is then followed by a jump cut to after everything is already said and done. I hope to God that episode 4 will be explained clearly in the next two episodes in September or will leave much confusion with viewers.Don\'t get me wrong I enjoy the Strike the Blood series and all...the quirks it has, but the recurring ""No, this is our fight"" line had long run it\'s course back in season 1 but has been repeated to the point of disgust in every episode of the series.The ecchi portions of the show are enjoyable but they can get a little old, with the animation being pretty attractive. But I still look forward to the harem ending which is one of the reasons I push on. the quirks it has, but the recurring ""No, this is our fight"" line had long run it\'s course back in season 1 but has been repeated to the point of disgust in every episode of the series.The ecchi portions of the show are enjoyable but they can get a little old, with the animation being pretty attractive.

Kojou is finally reaching the final arcs of the story. ""No senpai, this is our fight."" This iconic line is ubiquitous as usual. My only gripe with this season is that the release schedule is too erratic. Similar to last season, the vision at the end of the first season is coming full circle and is likely going to happen in the next and final installment of Strike The Blood. This season honestly, if you could understand without the terrible subtitling has...moved considerably into understanding Kojou and the past of the Progenitors. This has been a pretty good run. The animation quality has been rather stable and good. The characters have developed rather well into their own unique traits. In all, this is a really well-made guilty pleasure anime and has evolved into its own fascinating story that has no comparison. moved considerably into understanding Kojou and the past of the Progenitors.

Anyways the story comes by as really difficult to understand in the beginning and still confuses me to this day, the art is still good, the sound is pretty decent but it's been overused for so many occasions, characters have been the exact same since season 2 besides some new additions. I didn't really enjoy this and just skipped through portions of the episodes. I still have no clue how they are releasing a season...5 to this but I guess it's popular I don't know, not a lot of people like it because there's like an episode every 3 months to complete this so I wonder how long season 5 will be. Anyways overall it wasn't really enjoyable, only thing I enjoyed was the action scenes but even those are overused, everything has been basically recycled over and over again to create a promising show, which this doesn't whatsoever. If your a big fan of this series, go ahead and watch it, but if you are just joining in on the show might as well go read the LN and come back to see if you understand it, which you probably still won't. 5 to this but I guess it's popular I don't know, not a lot of people like it because there's like an episode every 3 months to complete this so I wonder how long season 5 will be.

Yuusha Tokkyuu Might Gaine,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3486/Yuusha_Tokkyuu_Might_Gaine,"[""Brave Express Might Gaine is the first of the 7 brave/yuusha shows i ever saw back in early 2018 and one of my main gateways into the world of Super robot anime. Going into this based on clips i saw way back, i was expecting a very fun and exicting thrillride of an anime, and i can safely say that it mostly delivered on that, while also becoming one of my all time favourite mecha anime.(WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)Story: 6The story follows Senpuuji Maito, a rich young man who is the CEO of his deceased father's company and on mission to rid his home City...(and the world i guess) from evil, as part of a final request from his father before he and Maito's Mother were killed in a supossed accident. To do this, he'll need the super robot Might Gaine and the rest of the Brave Express team to thwart the ambitions of evil with help from his best friend Hamada kun.Might Gaine follows the monster (or rather villian) of the week formula, with a new foe every ep from each of the 4 reccuring antagonists, always defeated in the same way. Things do get a little more interseting once the rival character 'Ace no Joe' arrives after 10+ eps, posing a greater challenge to the main protagonist and raising the stakes of each battle. There's also a reccuring plot to do with Ace no Joe trying to discover his Father's MurdererThe main Villian of the show the 'lord of Darkness' to me was pretty disapointing. Only fully revealed around the last few eps, we find out it's actually an evil God, and is responsible for the death of Maito's parents and Ace no Joe's Father. It's motives for such were pretty vague, to do with being part of a Game and outright stating that he created humans just to be apart of it. Whilst i found the Villian quite lackluster, the final encounter with it and it's minions resulted in a very intense and exicting climatic battle, all wrapped up by a very Happy and somewhat questionable ending. Overall the weakest element of the show for me.Art and Animation/Sound: 7I really like the art design for the main characters of Maito and Sally, although i think it's a little inconsistent. I presume the main Art/character designer for the show was also responsible for the designs of 'Magical Knight Rayearth, with very sharply drawn faces and very detailed eyes, i'd say this is the prefered look for me. However, some episode will have the characters look like they came out one of the previous yuusha shows like Fighbird or Exaizer, with more rounded faces and less detailed smaller eyes. This wasn't really a big problem for me tho, as it's something i only really noticed later on. The actual animation (outside the Final attacks and combination scenes) is okay at best and nothing to write home about.I really love the music for Might Gaine, whilst I think the OP is ok, Might Gaine's Gattai/Combination theme sounds awesome, very upbeat and gets me exicted to watch the mecha fight begin. The Great Might Gaine theme was is also pretty epic. The 2 EDs are pretty good too, with ED 2 being my favourite. Most of the background music reminds me of old Noir flims, which i really think sets the mood for the show. Can't really say to much in terms of sound design, so i'll say it's Ok.Characters: 7Whilst not the most complex, i enjoyed majority of the characters whenever they were on screen, even the villians. I thought Shogun Mifune was pretty funny, with him being one of the 4 reccuring Bad Guys, his goal was to revive the fedual era of japan, resulting in some pretty wacky moments and funny dialouge. Another Villian 'Catherine Vuitton', i thought more of the opposite of, finding her voice and character very annoying i didn't enjoy alot of episodes with her in it (except maybe the Natto episode)My favourite Character however, had to be Maito. One of my favourite mecha anime pilots, whilst a pretty basic character with a pretty basic motivation, his views about nature and taking care of the world was a suprising trait. Along with cool design and a Hot blooded, powerful voice from legendary Seiyuu 'Hiyama Nobuyuki', he was a joy to watch. Other characters like his butler and best friend Hamada kun were good and fit into their roles fine, i will say tho that Sally chan is pretty cute and Maito's grandfather had a pretty funny episode about 'Natto'.Mecha: 8Might Gaine has in my opinion, some of the best the designs in the Yuusha series, Might Gaine and Might Kaiser were my favourites and the auxiliary ones like Battle Bomber and Guard Diver looking pretty cool aswell. With outstanding designs from Shoji Kawamori and smooth animation from Masami Obari (parricularly in the OP) might gaine's mecha did not disappoint. The combination scenes also looked very crisp, fluid and full of that sweet mechanical detail, truly a treat for the eyes.Overall: 8I think Might Gaine was a pretty fun experience, not doing anything new or suprising in the genre but still managing to be engaging with it's great music and lovable goofy characters, it mostly kept me entertained. Fairely underrated in my opinion, this is definetly worth checking out for super robot lovers, anyone curious about 90s mecha and earlier yuusha shows before Gaogaigar.

Starmyu 3rd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36536/Starmyu_3rd_Season,"['*Contains small existence of spoilers.Woohoo!! Yay! Yay!!What a splendid anime I ever watched. Especially the character I love the most are Hoshitani Yuuta. Maybe he is the most influential character for the story. I like how he so confidential and passionate. That what I love from the story, he teaches me that we should never give up on something we hold dearly. I like how he said that he doesn\'t know how to give up something. Bravo! And why he is the most influential character for the story? Mainly these other characters were being influenced by him so they become passionate for it.For this...3 seasons. They had left the same impression for each time I watched for the new season, and it\'s ""NEVER GIVE UP!""Yep, now this word had placed at my life dictionary. Yay!Hope they make the fourth season for a new generation, maybe? 3 seasons. They had left the same impression for each time I watched for the new season, and it\'s ""NEVER GIVE UP!""Yep, now this word had placed at my life dictionary. Yay!Hope they make the fourth season for a new generation, maybe?', ""Still have to wrap my head around what the purpose of this season was. I enjoyed the past two seasons (no, they're no masterpiece, but they are quite simple and filled with rather interesting characters).That said, this was a rather disappointing season, which managed to introduce yet new characters whose only whole purpose was to force the plot to make the main characters struggle.Story (5): the story is simple and straightforward, but comes off as forced and convoluted because of the characters actions and motives. The finale is just a mess with a pinch of fanservice for long time viewers.Art (7): nothing to complain,...clean animations and nice art.Sound (7): just like the art section, nothing to complain. Every episode features at least one new song.Character (4): they introduced a bunch of new characters that we really don't get to know (besides traits that are relevant to the plot), that overshadowed old and much more interesting characters. Maybe a longer season could have improved the characterization and deepened the plotOverall (5): I grew to love this franchise, I admit idol-anime are a guilty pleasure of mine, and Starmyu is not an exception. This season feels like an empty shell of what the previous two were. I don't mind the cheesyness or the clichès (that's what I'm here for! Just guys being dudes) but God how tiring and pointless was this season... clean animations and nice art.Sound (7): just like the art section, nothing to complain.

The first season was a pile of the most generic clichés and stereotypes, without even mortar to hold them together, about a few boys who had to learn to work together. The second season introduced more characters that had to learn to work together, so everyone had less screentime to help you even remember their names. And here\'s the third season, which... seems to add even more characters who have to learn to work together? Some of those are apparent upperclassmen, even,...yet we\'ve never heard of them despite all the time the original cast has already spent in the school?? And in all this time, neither the designs, nor the image or animation quality has gotten any better??? I simply fail to see any sort of justification for this, especially when there are countless others, at the worst as ""good"" as this, that get the axe after only one season, or two if they\'re lucky.The cast is just way too big, and holy smokes, there\'s maybe two or three of them that don\'t share the basic bland copy-paste look of everyone else - there are very good shots of them in episode 7, iirc, to showcase this, with the perfect bored look on all their faces to boot. Nevermind characterisation, just remembering their names is as close to mission impossible as it can get (there are character cards around the middle of each episode, sure, but even those are bad because the text is in the background that the characters just cover). They do a lot of running around (many times literally) to be able to perform together at the - wait, what even is that Ayanagi Festival, exactly? Frankly, if we ever got an explanation, I forgot, because it\'s that uninteresting to try to keep up with. And all this running around in 11 episodes, only for the thing to finally happen in episode 12... and then skydive into the post-credits scene, way beyond that, where they\'re not even just third years but even one step higher? Talk about pacing. Then the catchphrases add a layer of extra annoyance too: even with a big cast, one would be more than enough, especially if heard in every damn episode. Here we have three, and even a fourth has a cameo, because something has to trigger a completely out-of-place transformation.I\'m not sure how this happened. I watched it because of a sort of principle: I\'ve suffered through the first two, I might as well pick the third up as well.

Even after the last episode, I still didn't feel the satisfaction I usually felt after watching episodes of season 1 and 2. I felt like, even in those 12 seasons there was very little going on and the plot seems recycled from the first season. I honestly couldn't understand why the antagonists were doing what they're doing, especially since the same argument have been solved in the previous seasons.

The story is VERY slow-paced, and a little messy. The introduction of new characters is fine, but with the increased of characters, it seemed that the story has lost its focus. I can understand wanting to give the new characters some action to blend them into the plot. But unfortunately, it seemed like that\'s all the creators was able to do, just giving some...screen time to the new characters as well as the original MCs and Support Characters. The storylines of the new characters and the existing characters did not come together at all. We know through the hopelessly optimistic narration from the main MC that the characters\' stories are somewhat connected. But that\'s all, just a narration POV from the MC that their storylines are indeed coming together to make a full complete story. But in reality, the story failed to display that to the audience. Never mind if the new characters lack their origin story for the audience to know how they have come to be, the story never really make full use of these characters to even develop the main MCs and main Support characters. It just seemed like the creators wanted to create and showcase more pretty boys. (I am not reviewing the musical storylines as part of the story aspect, I consider them under Sound).As with the previous seasons, the Art and Sound are a cut above the Story. The animation (reviewing this under Art) for this season seem to be lacking more than the previous 2, not like the animation production was really stellar for the previous seasons, but in this season, it is a lot more obvious that the animation is lacking. There are a lot of still frames instead of animated movements, and is most obvious when the moments build up to some sort of surprise/ revelation, and the scene is just a motionless character with some sound effects to create the ""oooh"" element. Or even more lame is that instead of showing how awesome the character is through animated movements, they just added a few frames of feathers and/or droplets of sparkling sweat. Though after all is said about the animation, the design of the characters, the stage, the costumes, and the lame sweat (hahah~) are really pleasing to the eyes, It would be great if the animation quality can match up to the Art style of this anime~ It would be more dynamic.The musical aspect did improved significantly as compared to season 1. Hahaha~ Now the musical scenes are more naturally build-up and followed-up by the regular scenes. Though there\'s one thing that doesn\'t sit well with me since season 1. That is, there are several instances with sound effects of a gaming scene. Quite the irony since most of the songs in this series are pretty fabulous, yet the sound effects of certain motions and ""revelations"" sounded really cheap. But overall, is not something I will discount the Sound score for.For the Characters in this season.... I do think that the new characters introduced are pretty interesting and refreshing. But as  I mentioned above, the story really did not showcase them enough. The new characters are underdeveloped, while the existing characters are developed, marginally, through rough and awkward storylines. All the character designs in this series are pretty much above average, even among my top scoring animes, it is just a pity that the story cannot bring out more of the characters\' persona beyond their introduction. screen time to the new characters as well as the original MCs and Support Characters.

Utsukushiku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7014/Tezuka_Osamu_no_Buddha__Akai_Sabaku_yo_Utsukushiku,"[""To me, this movie completely misses its (presumed) point.SYNOPSIS: The creators try to get the viewer feeling nearly as bad about all the suffering in the world as Siddharta/Buddha does, they failed for 2 reasons:- rushed simplification- the use of a lot of violence to ENTERTAIN the viewers, which (out of complete paradox) contradicts the primary purposeBeing about the life and struggles of Buddha I just expected something completely different.Before watching it I didn't know that the producers planned it to be the start of a series of films, I also do not know the manga. My expectations were nurtured by two books:'Siddhartha' by...Hermann Hesse+'Old Path - White Clouds' by Thích Nhất HạnhEven with keeping these good books and my perception of Buddha out of mind this first movie is rather weak, misconceived and filled with... yeah, fillers that add nothing to the story of Buddha.It doesn't go into philosophical depths, which it could at least try (while being about Buddha), but maybe I can free the makers of some of their debts here because most of the philosophising sure is supossed to happen in later phases of Siddharta's life.By the end of the movie he makes a really strong and hard decision. But the way he asks himself questions about the world and its cruelty doesn't get me convinced about his decision at all (unlike the non-movie Siddharta - which is, by the way, annoyingly called SHIddharta throughout the movie)His unsettlement seems rushed and WAAAAY too simplified to me.Also, I feel like the movie character Siddhartha directs his questions/views just too much on the material world (war/sickness/dying) and too less on the suffering of mind+soul.With all the violence in this movie the producers couldn't have aimed for an 'all-family' audience and therefore its depth, its philosophising could and SHOULD be more profound.As I said above the side-stories don't add depth or entertainment to the story. One can clearly see why the creators included them into the movie: to give us a clue about the sorrows Siddharta is feeling, but because of their simplification and stereotypy that just didn't work out at all.The art and music is pretty solid. What you'd expect from a Tezuka adaption: strong, sometimes even a little too loud colours, not even ONE more pencil or brush stroke than necessary to depict a character and solid animation (only with lots of animals and warriors in the picture the animation was somewhat jerking).All in all...... a HUGE bummer!

The movie, based on the critically acclaimed manga series by Osamu Tezuka, follows Siddhartha's journey from his privileged life as a prince to his eventual enlightenment, becoming a revered spiritual leader.— THEMES AND STORYLINE —The movie does an excellent job of portraying Siddhartha's struggle with questions about existence, suffering, and finding inner peace. It also provides an insight into the social, political, and cultural context in which Siddhartha lived. Set in ancient India, the movie revolves around two boys named...Chapra and Siddhartha with contrasting backgrounds and their journey in a world of war and social classes.'Man does not attain all his heart’s desires for the winds do not blow as the vessels wish' — Al-MutanabbiThe movie's plot establishes a four-social class system, with laborers and slaves being the worst of the four. However, the movie primarily focuses on the tragic journey of Chapra and Siddhartha. Chapra, a tenacious slave, becomes friends with Tatta and seeks to become a Kshatriya warrior to improve his life. Through a mutually beneficial relationship with a Kosalan general, Chapra achieves his goal. In contrast, Siddhartha, a prince's son, is forced by his father to learn military tactics and swordsmanship despite his hatred of violence and war. Siddhartha embarks on a quest to discover the meaning of life and find a way to end the wars. The characters in Buddha are well-developed and compelling. Siddhartha, the movie's protagonist, is portrayed as a multifaceted character, with his own strengths and flaws. The supporting characters are also well-developed and add depth to the story.— ANIMATION AND SOUNDTRACK —Unfortunately, the animation quality in this movie was not up to par, which may not come as a surprise to those familiar with Toei Animation's work. While the visuals were certainly detailed and intricate, the overall animation was choppy and lacked fluidity. This can be seen in the awkward movements of some of the characters during action scenes, which took away from the impact and excitement of these moments. In addition, the character designs were somewhat simplistic, lacking the depth and nuance that could have added to the emotional weight of the story. While the animation may not have been a total disaster, it was certainly not at the level that could have been expected from a movie of this caliber.The soundtrack of the movie is fitting to its tone and setting, as it boasts a beautiful and emotionally charged score that effectively complements the themes and mood of the movie. The music blends well with the stunning visuals, which heighten the overall viewing experience. However, while the voice acting is generally commendable, the voice of young Siddhartha comes across as lacking in emotion, and his dialogue sounds somewhat stilted and rehearsed, as if he were just reading from a script.— FINAL THOUGHTS —Despite the minor flaws, it is a must-watch anime movie for anyone interested in exploring spirituality, philosophy, and the human condition. The movie's portrayal of the four-social class system is excellent, and the movie's story and character development are compelling. The movie explores themes of war, social issues, and the search for meaning in life, and its well-developed characters bring these themes to life.Regardless of your familiarity with the manga, this movie is guaranteed to leave a profound impact on you. It is a finely crafted movie that guides the audience through the life of Siddhartha Gautama, who ultimately became Buddha, a spiritual figure revered by millions worldwide.

It was only later that he became the Buddha, also know as the enlighted one ""Movie missed point.  Well this movie was something on a different level, it was breath taking and unique.Story: Well at first glance i expected it to be movie only about Buddha and not only his past, which was quite dissapointing. They basically...only showed his past and event in that era when there was a lot of slaves trafficking, people living in poverty that had to steal to survive. Also story was very confusing from the beggining to the end and it was more focused on other characters than Buddha itself, or should we call him "" prince "" cause that fits more in this movie, cause they only showed a small glance at the ending about him becoming Buddha and going to search for the answer.Also it was very sad story, and characters struggling through poverty and prince enjoying his life, and he never saw life behind the wealthy life  until somewhere aroung middle of the movie, where he meet Migaila ( minor character ), girl that grow up in poverty.She had a lot of inpact on his view on the world and other poor peoples.Anyway it was very confusing but interesting story that was also depressive and sad for me, but kinda dissapointing ( and when i said kinda i mean just a little bit )Animation: Now this was very good, it was way much better than i expected it to be. You could see how they put effort in every single detail but some scenes were a little bit rushed.Sound: Well it was good. And also outro song is really nice.Characters: This is where i felt kinda dissapointed.Siddharta Gauitama aka "" Budhha "" is good guy from royal family that doesn\'t really fighting and seeing other people suffer. Pretty much you can describe him as good guy from rich family that isn\'t looking down on other poor people or people with weak social status.He doesn\'t care about other peoples opinion that he shouldn\'t talk to poor and weak people. Also his voice acting was kinda bad if you ask me, i mean you could get guy from the street and he would do it better.Chapra aka "" Best swordman in kingdom "", "" General "" is the character that was getting attention most of the time.You can describe him as goodbay guy ( really don\'t know how to describe it, it\'s unique ) which grow up in a poverty and saw a lot of people dead. There wasn\'t really much of his feels in this movie except him showing his  love for his mother and reversed.Tatta  aka "" Guy with mystical power "" he is the character that i didn\'t really get much, he was basically once time with Chapra, and then Chapra went to become general and that\'s when all his trails are losing. But he isn\'t fully without feelings, he showed anger , chillness and i don\'t really know what much to say about him.. sorry :POverall: As i statead in beggining, this movie was capable of so much and confusing story and voice acting kinda bringed it down a little bit.

Uchi Tama?! Uchi no Tama Shirimasen ka?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39942/Uchi_Tama_Uchi_no_Tama_Shirimasen_ka,"[""Move over Nekopara, not only does this have the better, less degenerate catgirls, but there's also catboys and dogboys(?) for twice the fun.Uchi Tama?! Uchi no Tama Shirimasen ka? is the criminally underwatched spinoff of the children's show Tama and Friends where for whatever reason the writers decided to spice it up and give all the animal characters anthropomorphic human designs and renowned voice actors in the industry (HanaKana plays as a catgirl dressed like a maid if that's not enough to convince some of you).On a surface level, the anime looks like nothing much. For starters, the central plot of the series is...extremely straightforward. Each episode has multiple storylines that simply focus on Tama, the titular catboy, and/or his friends and their peaceful, daily lives as they find ways to entertain themselves when their owners aren’t with them. The characters have unique designs for what they are, but they are mostly just archetypes and can easily be classified as the cowardly one, the airheaded one, the genki girl, the loner, etc. The series banks more on character interactions rather than character development.Despite all of this, this is where Uchi Tama's main appeal comes from. The series doesn’t let us forget that these characters are actually just your friendly neighborhood cats and dogs. The artstyle sometimes switches around their human forms and their animal forms depending on the situation, mostly because it would probably be weird seeing a human groom himself like a cat. Pets aren’t like their human owners; they’re all just vibing, and that’s exactly what everyone in Uchi Tama is doing. Everything is told from the POVs of the animals, creating a comfy atmosphere that is almost equivalent of watching cat and dog videos on Youtube but in the form of anime characters. The storylines mostly feel like typical, cute slice-of-life shenanigans; for example there is one short skit just about two of the cats trying to stay awake so their owners can share some of their food with them, but there are occasional episodes with completely different tones ranging anywhere from a love story in which one of the cats falls in love to the gut-wrenching backstory of the local stray to a parody anime-style rap battle. The writers were not afraid to limit what they could do with these characters, and it shows.Uchi Tama isn’t the most groundbreaking anime, but if you want to watch something relaxing yet entertaining (especially if you’re a pet lover), this series is worth a watch. extremely straightforward.

"", ""I'll keep this review short and simple.Uchi No Tama is a very cute anime. It is so calming and entertaining and it makes you feel so relaxed watching it. It has no main plot-line to follow but it is an episodic anime that has lots of stories in each episode and each one of them is unique and different.The characters are cute. The overall sound and voice acting are great. The art is wonderful and consistent and the anime as a whole is extremely entertaining.So, If you want to watch a very cute anime with cute characters having enjoyable time then you...are in for a treat *pun intended*Overall I would give Uchi No Tama an 8/10.Would recommend it for anyone wanting to have a relaxing time. are in for a treat *pun intended*Overall I would give Uchi No Tama an 8/10.Would recommend it for anyone wanting to have a relaxing time."", ""Uchi Tama has to be one of the weirdest reboots of a franchise I've ever seen. They took a little kid's show with cats and dogs, and turned it into adorable cat and dog boys (and 2 cat girls) telling slice of life stories. However, this in no way is a bad thing. In fact, being unafraid to try new things with a familiar property is one of the positives about Uchi Tama, and we still get to see the classic, animal designs of the characters used a decent amount.There isn't really so much of an ongoing story with this one, it's moreso a...collection of short stories about the characters and their lives on Third Street. You have a variety of quirky cats and dogs to follow, like the adorable Tama, mysterious Nora, and tough but sweet Bull! Nora was probably my favourite, his backstory being surprisingly emotional and proving that while it's mainly a wholesome anime, Uchi Tama also knows how to tell an emotional story.The art for this show is very beautiful. Very soft colour palettes are used for the characters, and the animal designs look simple and sketched out much like the original Tama anime. One gimmick it has is switching from the kemonomimi designs for the characters to the animal designs when human characters are present, to show the audience that even if we see them in their more humanoid forms, they're still cats and dogs if given the ability to communicate their thoughts more directly to each other and the viewer. The music was also a nice treat, and several characters got their own unique ending themes.One thing to note about this anime is that it's not a great idea to watch it all at once. Some of the episodes suffer from a lack of variation in episodes, which can make it feel a bit boring to watch in one go. However, if you pace yourself and watch a little at a time, Uchi Tama is a great show to relax to and enjoy. This would be a good watch if you're looking for something short and sweet to view as a break between bigger releases. collection of short stories about the characters and their lives on Third Street.

The character designs are not only cute but truly ambitious, considering what the original designs look like.The story is nothing special; it is a slice-of-life comedy after all. But watching the characters play off of each other and get into wacky hijinks is highly entertaining. The writers clearly know how to handle a joke, and they had me grabbing my sides at times, beside myself with laughter and enjoyment.Some storylines are straight-forward or even cliche, but many are absurd and surprising. These ones stand out in my mind. From one character breaking into song in the...style of an 80s music video for being in love with another character that won't love him back, to a rap battle between warring factions of dogs, to the ditzy idol cat brutally punching the cop dog to win a tournament. Uchi Tama revels in absurdity, and I eat it up.Don't let the anthropomorphic designs fool you; this show has heart and genuine passion put into its production. style of an 80s music video for being in love with another character that won't love him back, to a rap battle between warring factions of dogs, to the ditzy idol cat brutally punching the cop dog to win a tournament.

To Be Hero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34009/To_Be_Hero,"[""To Be Hero is a very interesting anime. A lot of people will be turned off from this show because of the flavor of the humor, the extremely weird/out there plot/premise, and the unattractiveness of many of the character designs. I truly believe there's something special here though.Even though this show is a comedy, and I would agree comedy is the best genre to put it in, the comedy is not the reason I think so highly of this show and the comedy is not the reason I would recommend this show. You will know pretty quickly if the humor in this show is for...you or not, however it's hard to nail down what's good about the humor because the reasons I'm sure some people dislike the humor are the same reasons some people like the humor.The art, sound, and animation in this show are all great, not incredible or otherwise mindblowing or outsanding, but defintely great. Every character's design is unique, the animation is never low quality (in fact there's some very high quality animation at the end of the show), and the music fits everything perfectly although no one track besides maybe the ending theme really stands out or is overly memorable.The story and characters are the highlight of this show, and are the reason I enjoyed it so much I'm sitting here still thinking about the show and writing a review for it days after finishing it. While the plot can be hard to follow at times, it is never so out there that you can't follow it. The story is a lot more about Ossan's relationship with and protection of his daughter than the synopsis would have you believe. Underneath the humor is a great story about a father and his daughter and the interesting people around them every day. The main cast in this show all do a great job of making you care about them. I never thought I'd care so much about a creepy pervert neighbor or a computer alien that has access to all the knowledge in the universe. I was always on Ossan's side and wanted to see him succeed in everything he attempted, I wanted Min-chan to be happy, i wanted the alien prince to be happy, I liked everyone a ton and even in all the absurdity the show made sure everyone in the main cast developed and were believable in their actions.As I end off this review, I should say that the number 1 thing this show did right and that it does better than almost any other anime is endings. The end of almost every episode was a very well done cliffhanger that both made you really want to see what was going to happen next and was immediately resolved/addressed next episode. The ending of the entire show was fantastic as well, everything wrapped up in a way that was satisfying and really concluded the story. The final episodes of this show reminded me a lot of why I like anime, and the ending tied everything up perfectly in my eyes.If you've read everything up to now you might have forgotten this show was a comedy for a split second during my gushing, but that's the beauty of it. I was laughing the whole way through, but by the end I was truly invested in this story and it could not have ended more perfectly. Episodes are only roughly 10 minutes long each, which means at 12 episodes the full run time of this show is only about 2 hours. If you watch this show I highly recommend you treat it like a movie and watch it all in 1 sitting, and if you can manage I also recommend watching it with friends who can get caught up in this masterpiece with you. you or not, however it's hard to nail down what's good about the humor because the reasons I'm sure some people dislike the humor are the same reasons some people like the humor.The art, sound, and animation in this show are all great, not incredible or otherwise mindblowing or outsanding, but defintely great.

I would recommend spending the 1 minute of life on youtubing it. Even if you have no intention of watching the show it would be a pity to pass up that...catchy tune.*** Story ***I found that the story was, in many places, metaphorical after you strip away the ridiculousness. For example, everyone has read in the synopsis that the main character is a toilet seat designer. This would otherwise be completely ridiculous, however, if you say, ""He is a businessman and in the eyes of his family whom he neglects due to overwork, he might as well be selling toilet seats,"" things can make more sense. Another example is his drinking and chasing after women is a coping strategy for his stress and not his aloof nature portrayed humorously.This story is all about the depressed main character fighting to protect his daughter and his love for her.*** Animation ***This feels like a budget project. Things seem hastily drawn and there will be no scenes that truly scream, ""Beautiful."" Rather, this show really focuses on it\'s core, which is humour. The animation is a mere medium used to only convey the story.So if you watch shows mainly for good graphics like ""Attack on Titan"" this will leave you disappointed. On the other hand, if you like shows like ""Kaiba"" then this show seems to embody the concept of ... story > animation ... it will leave you satisfied.There are many places throughout the entire show where I couldn\'t help, but think, ""Ah, the animators are breaking the fourth wall and trying to pass off their animator insider jokes to their colleagues.""*** Characters ***The main character is a very loving and protective father placed in a desperate and depressing situation.The only character that isn\'t stupid, gross, perverted, depressing, or otherwise bizarre is Min-chan, the daughter of our main character.All the antagonists are gag characters, but they serve their purposes. Chicken, shrimp, monkey, ""the wife"", prince, demon king.*** Sound ***Once again, that ending them is just too wonderful. Besides that everything else is  mediocrity.*** Enjoyment ***I cringed and laughed throughout this show. Sometimes the humor was hard to swallow and the characters too depressing, but overall it was a surprisingly okay story better than 6/10, but less than 8/10. catchy tune.*** Story ***I found that the story was, in many places, metaphorical after you strip away the ridiculousness.

I also think they should have added a little more episodes like 3 or 2 more but it did end with a fantastic but confusing...ending and i loved it. ending and i loved it.', ""Hey folks, this will be a review for To Be Hero. This show was a ton of fun to watch. From what I watched and from what I read, this show is one of those easily misunderstood shows. People quick to judge or brush off certain types of comedy or art will drop it quickly and deploy a cunning, yet inaccurate written assault to hopefully dissuade you from watching it. I on the other hand bid you to give it a chance.The story is a bit two fold. The first and more obvious story is Ossan becoming the superhero. A once handsome man who...uses toilet knowledge to hit on countless women happens to fall into the toilet. This takes him to a mario esque person who bestows upon him the title of hero and sends him back to our world as a fat man. From here he must protect our world and his daughter from aliens. This side of the story is rather spoofy and though fun to watch not very interesting.The second fold of the story is the reasons behind Ossan's actions, and his connection to his daughter. They do make this side of the story lighthearted and even treat it as a joke when the show comes to and end, however it was still pretty interesting.The art was actually really well done. The soundtrack was alright, the ending song was super catchy.The characters are all pretty crazy and interesting.I enjoyed this show a lot. I was worried it was going to be one of those bad spoof shows, but instead it was a great one. Potty humor, and whether or not your too mature to enjoy the comedy aside the shows story and moral backbone is pretty decent. The art and sound both were pretty darn good and its only 11 minutes per episode which means you wouldn't even be wasting time.The comedy seems to be the biggest issue in this show. I happen to enjoy the fast paced over the top comedy the show presents. There are poop jokes, but that's not all the show has to offer. Though honestly, I'm not really sure why people are so adverse to that type of humor. The comedy sort of comes in waves, starting small and obvious and builds into more and more higher bar. Its all pretty filthy and sometimes twisted, but overall I feel like it enhances the experience.TLDR: Give it a shot, its short and funny. There is a hidden story, but also it can be viewed for straight comedy too. uses toilet knowledge to hit on countless women happens to fall into the toilet.

This series need more attention and of all the super-hero themed anime I watched in my life To Be Hero is among One Punch Man and Boku No Hero Academia. Can't wait for the 2nd season.An absolutely funny anime that can be compared to Gintama(dirty jokes and funny inappropriate moments and other media reference like Super Mario) in fact Gintoki's voice is here too with his iconic funny quotes.This anime has literally anything from a stomach-aching commedy skits, surprising plot twist and sad moments. "", 'Another underrated anime here! This season (Summer 2017) is full-packed with great and most awaited anime of the year and because of that, To Be Hero is not really become the attention of otakus this year. All I want to tell is, this anime is full of potential, to be honest, it reminds me of Gintama, their style of gags... quality gags are very similar from each other plus of one character of this anime is voiced by Gintoki\'s(Gintama). Back to ""To Be Hero"", as i said earlier that this anime contains good gags - the ""kimoi"" ones, maybe some people doesn\'t like this animu...because of it\'s vulgar and dirty gags, but i still recommend this to those people who aren\'t too sensitivity about those thingsThis anime shows a great sense of realism in some ways, MC life is one big example of it, they show how a normal - not so i think, encounter daily problem about family, profession and bathroom rituals. I can say that the story is pretty normal, but I give it 9/10 for some reason that you need to see for yourself.Let me tell you a glimpse about the story. (Don\'t worry it\'s Spoiler-free ^-^)The story is about a middle-aged guy with an unusual occupation, this guy is a real problem child, he only lives with her daughter named Min-chan in an old looking apartment. Min-chan is the one who prevent his dad from doing shameful things by scolding and punching him(barbaric but 10/10 for Ms). One day MC did a very-super-ultra rare dump and gained ability which came with a very ugly consequence, this guy is forced to be a hero, meet weirdos and fight enemies with the ability he obtained. well something like that.All in all, To be hero is an interesting anime.

But I'm one of the few it clicked with and greatly enjoyed. It's the story of a father and his daughter with a lot of funny crazy moments. The ending even made me tear up a bit, and it's really hard for me to do that for any anime. Another great thing about the show is its animation and art style. I had just finished watching Mob Psycho 100 wondering if there were any...other shows out atm with such great animation like Mob. I just scrolled through Crunchyroll and found this show. other shows out atm with such great animation like Mob. I just scrolled through Crunchyroll and found this show."", 'Well, this anime is kind of special. However, I just can\'t possibly rate it higher than 6 overall and 7 for enjoyment.It\'s just a gag anime, a lot of toilet humour and weird jokes. That was what I was watching this for. However, at the end they felt the need to ruin it all and suddenly make the last few episodes somewhat serious and extremely boring. What are they even trying to pull? No, we don\'t need a weird background story or anything else that\'d make us ""sympathize"" with the characters or whatever. A gag anime/manga/novel needs to STAY like that to the end....Only someone retarded would say ""hey, let\'s suddenly make things pseudo-serious and completely change the setting/mood for the last few episodes! What do you mean they liked it for the gags? Naaaah, surely they want what they didn\'t start watching this for so that they can watch it and be happy it\'s over because it left a bad taste in their mouths!"". I mean, think a little! When the ""last boss"" appears around episode 10 or something like that, just stop watching and spare yourself the time and frustration.Other than that, I actually enjoyed it a lot with quite a few laughs. Without the utterly disappointing ending, it might\'ve been worth even an 8 in terms of enjoyment!Well, honestly only the gags made this thing fairly good and the only thing this should be watched for. The story itself is horrible to say the least(gag anime, so that\'s expected, the attempt at making it deeper at the end only pisses one off). The art is subpar as well, it doesn\'t flow well and screams of ""budget"". The sound is similarly crappy, at most mediocre, although I found the ending song to be fairly catchy. As for characters, I didn\'t feel any of them had anything that made them particularly good, they were there just for gags and that\'s the limit to their depth and uniqueness.I also feel like the short duration of the episodes was good, this isn\'t the type of show that should be watched for days, it\'s more like something you should watch in one and a half to two hours to blow off some steam and laugh a bit. It would get old quickly if you actually watched it for much longer than that, even after just several episodes, I already felt like this show had shown whatever it had to offer and was starting to be less funny.

Yuki no Joou (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/754/Yuki_no_Joou_TV,"['Let me just tell you how perfect this adaption of the Snow Queen is. I remember seeing this on a list of adaptions for the fairy tale ""The Snow Queen"" by Hans Christian Anderson, and I was really happy that they had an anime adaption for it. I am a big fairy tale reader and The Snow Queen just happened to be one of my favorite fairy tales. Also, since I enjoy watching anime, putting these two together was perfect. So of course I was going to see how they portray the fairy tale. And at the end of I was really pleased. So I\'ll...explain why I gave this anime these ratings:Story (10)- I thought it deserved this ten. The anime helped the viewers understand the story and the concept perfectly (so if you are ever confused when reading this fairy tale, this is the right thing for you). What I loved most about the anime was not only did they stay truthful to the fairy tale, but they were able to incorporate many other fairy tales into the story, such as The Little Mermaid and The Little Match girl and many more.Art (5)- I honestly think the art is what killed the show. The art isn\'t the greatest compared to many other animes I have seen. The story is amazing, but people wouldn\'t be interested in knowing what\'s going on because the art and animation is too distracting. I also think that is why this anime is underrated.Sound (10)- The soundtrack is amazing. The classical, smoothing vibe this show gives with its soundtrack is the best.Character (9)- They were able to portray every character successfully without mischaracterizing anyone. But I would be lying if I said that I didn\'t get annoyed at some characters.Enjoyment (10)- Don\'t even get me started. I actually was able to get attached to most of the characters in the show (even if their appearance only lasted one episode). Yuki no Joou teaches their viewers many valuable lessons along the way and this show made me feel like I was a part of Gerda\'s journey. Which made this show very enjoyable to watch.Overall (9)- The show did have its flaws. The art isn\'t the greatest and the show does start out slow. But as you watch each episode you start to get use to the art style and animation. Once you do, you  then can concentrate on the story of the show and learn how amazing it is. The beautiful sound track, characters, plot, lessons, this show just has it all.

A girl around the age of 12 or...so, to find and Bring back her childhood friend Kai who has been taken away by the Snow Queen, with the main focus of the show being the journey itself.The overall story can be broken down into the well known three-act structure.With the first act is around for 3-5 episode where the relevant characters are introduced and The main character Gerda\'s Journey begins.The second act is primarily an episodic natured, ""Monster of the week"" kind of deal. just replace monster with people and places, with their own fairy tails that Gerda basically have to navigate. with both upbeat positive stories that will feel with joy and faith in humanity and sad stories that will make you sad. Especially episode 19, that episode is the jewel of this show no contest.Then the third act that ends with some sort of final climax epic battle kind of ending that pushed the Gerda into the background while focussing more on the Snow Queen herself.  and is, in my opinion, the part I really didn\'t like and the reason I considered to give it a 6. The ending isn\'t bad in of itself, and it had a good build-up. but moved too far away from the original story to my liking.Art:  7The anime was made back in 2005 and looks pretty decent. but can be a turn off if you don\'t like the style, as the style is very much a very rough version of the Vinland Saga, just replace all with all the dynamic character movement, in scenes that requires a lot of actions and drama wi filled with still pictures, and sounds. so yeah it\'s Ok. but no masterpiece in my opinion. but I did enjoy the style.  But I do like the characters designs that had a standoff out place designs. like a certain group of bandits.Sound with the focus on music.I did like both the opening and ending, with the op being the best of the two. the background music was alright, as in, the music did the job without sounding bad with few of the tracks, that stood out, but not enough for it to be worth listening to by itself.Characters:  between 7 and 8This is an important one. due to animes length and its episodic nature.With Gerda being the best character in the show by far. and I loved pretty much every scene she was in, regardless of the scenes feeling forced or natural. she is a good well-meaning girl who tries to help people in need and will insist on repaying the help she receives with during chores like, washing clothes or helping with cleaning and stuff.Kai is more of a plot device than a character, but the personality he does have when together with the snow queen is alright and nothing special.Ragi a grown man that helps out Gerda on her travel is there. he plays odd music. and is a mysterious type with a past connected to the snow queen, aside from this he a nice guy who knows how to fight, the action is important. I guess. Nothing against him, but nothing special comes to mind with thinking about him.The Snow Queen.  the title character is, unfortunately, my least liked character, due to the creative changes, that to me made her feel less like The ice-cold snow queen, to a character lost in the past for a reason I really didn\'t care for. which in my opinion was a shame. but that part is clearly hinted at, through her interaction towards Kai.The Episodic supporting characters. were great and many of them well explored and I loved pretty much 98% of them except those I were meant to hate. and those ones I hated. please kill those few with fires, and offer that one jerk to Enma Ai from Girl, or something.  That aside it\'s because of many side characters I graded the character section 8, because with them. it would have been a solid 6.I loved the beginning and midsection and the retelling of other fairy tales. written by Hans Christian Andersen ( the original author of the Snow Queen) but the ending could have been better, and some the episodes contained the feeling of tragedy should have had a some follow up and carried on to the next episode. its a shame many of those heavy feel moments last only to the end each episode.All in all I enjoyed this show.  While I didn\'t care for the third act even if the out of place ""Villain"" was decent. I still loved the journey, and I will still return to this anime, to rewatch a certain few episodes.And I will HEAVILY recommend anyone to watch the episode, even if you have to skip the whole show, it\'s an amazing retelling crossover with the Little match girl, I can\'t recommend that episode enough and episode 20 to is enjoyable.overall I will give this anime a  7 out of 10There are things I liked. and really didn\'t like.  and pieces I really loved.The ending isn\'t Soul Eater bad, by any means. but that epic thing were really unneeded.Hope you found this review helpful.Have a nice day :D so, to find and Bring back her childhood friend Kai who has been taken away by the Snow Queen, with the main focus of the show being the journey itself.The overall story can be broken down into the well known three-act structure.With the first act is around for 3-5 episode where the relevant characters are introduced and The main character Gerda\'s Journey begins.The second act is primarily an episodic natured, ""Monster of the week"" kind of deal. just replace monster with people and places, with their own fairy tails that Gerda basically have to navigate. with both upbeat positive stories that will feel with joy and faith in humanity and sad stories that will make you sad.

I have always adored the spiritual devoted love story at the heart of ""The Snow Queen"" and this anime captures and represents it beautifully. Even with the inclusion of notable fairytale characters from other recognizable childhood stories, the series still exudes the exquisite and encouraging aura of this Coming of Age adventure-and the unbreakable power of true love.The screen and character writing are richly done and the traditional animation style truly makes this a hidden gem viewers of all ages can appreciate and be touched by. Certainly one of the best adaptations of the tale ever...produced in my opinion. Passionate, resonant, and powerful-this is a must-see for any fans of Andersen\'s stories. produced in my opinion.

Not worth the time really.', ""There isn't really much I can say about these cute little extras, but I did enjoy that they all seemed to be taken from the strips in the manga that weren't in the normal episodes, like Nagi talking to a story display when she took her glasses off or when Tooru and Run made character bentos for Yuuko and Nagi, these little shorts are a cute little add-on to the normal A Channel series and I'd recommend watching them if you want more A Channel or if you wanted to see more of the manga strips made into anime ^^ "", 'A - ChannelArt - The art style of this is a mix of moe and chibi, which really isn’t a problem and is actually very cute to watch. The characters kind of remind me slightly of “Is the Order a Rabbit?” which is another show that I really enjoyed. With the short episode run time I was surprised to see how much detail the artist put into all of the background characters. Normally shows like this will stick to silhouettes of characters that don’t speak or even have anything to do with the story, so I thought that this was a really nice touch.Music -...Because of the short run time this show had very little musical direction. I did however like that the simple music fit the simplicity of the show itself. This music was catchy and fun to listen to, but I found myself anticipating it and expecting it to get annoying. However, when this happened, the same song didn’t repeat itself. I am sure there was re-used music in the 12 episodes, but they were spread out far enough to not let you notice that they were being reused, which made it much better - and I am someone who can hear a song once and want to listen to it over and over again.Story - There really isn’t a story in this show. With a run time of only about 3-5 minutes, how could there be? Really this show takes a peak into the life styles of four friends in their first year of high school. They go to the movies, they make each other bentos, and they even fight off bugs together. While what the show lacks in story, it makes up for in characters. I say this because while it was super short and overall kind of boring, the show had me coming back because I enjoyed watching the characters have fun.Personal Reflection - This is one of those shows were I knew next to nothing going into it, and after the first episode was over in 3 minutes I felt a little confused. But then I was able to watch one episode after another and really enjoy the show overall. It was like binge watching Youtube episodes, and I really enjoy doing that. When the show finally came to a close it was so sudden and I actually was a little disappointed because I wanted the fun antics to continue. Overall I felt like the show had no story but fun characters. It was so easy to get invested in them that when the show was over as quick as it started, it left me wanting more. If you need to burn a half hour, go and watch A-Channel! I’m sure you’ll enjoy it.Overall Rating - 6.9/10 Because of the short run time this show had very little musical direction.

Being familiar with the characters obviously helps, but I think these would (mostly) be enjoyable for anyone looking for a quick fix of cute and humorous slice-of-life situations. The exception would be the first special which relies on familiarity with one of the characters in order to really appreciate it completely. The others have elements...of humor that I think work even without familiarity to the main series.To summarize: I recommend this for anyone who likes cute and humorous slice-of-life situations and doesn't want to sit through full episodes to get their fix, but special #1 should be saved until you have a bit of familiarity with the series. of humor that I think work even without familiarity to the main series.To summarize: I recommend this for anyone who likes cute and humorous slice-of-life situations and doesn't want to sit through full episodes to get their fix, but special #1 should be saved until you have a bit of familiarity with the series."", ""It's pretty much the same as A-channel except it starts at them moving up a grade instead of one getting into high school.

Overall: 6 "", 'Once again, the content remains consistent with the established themes of the A-Channel series. Viewers familiar with the show will recognize the comedic elements and vibrant atmosphere that characterize it.The inclusion of additional episodes is a thoughtful gesture, evidently tailored to cater to the fanbase.While I found the experience enjoyable, my expectations were measured, acknowledging that these supplementary episodes primarily serve as a special offering for enthusiasts rather than introducing substantial developments to the narrative.If you enjoy a quick serie with a comedic/light theme, this one is perfect for it...

And those folks, by their reasoning, would be correct:- the story is non-existent- the art is all over the place- the animation sucks- the character design, well, the lead (except in flashback) is a hulking sort of Amazon; there\'s a ""psycho supporter"" lesbian who wears a bra with a cup size so large only Dr. Seuss could come up with a letter designation for it; a dwarfish creature that appears to have escaped from ""Spirited Away"" or, more likely, was exiled; and there\'s also ""those...two characters who are always hanging around the lead character""; and then there are the other characters who show up, disappear for no apparent reason and then resurface several episodes later for the same no apparent reason.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT? WE DON\'T NEED NO STINKIN\' CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!So it\'s understandable that the folks who watched ""Air Master"" assuming it was about an outsider girl ""finding her way to acceptance by being the bad ass-est fighter on the street"" would be upset and think it deserves a ""1"".

""Air Master"" is a fairly sophisticated satire presented as a silly action anime.', ""The story of Air Master is a typical flimsy series of excuses to fit in as many fights as possible.  This is not necessarily a bad thing since the real reason to sit through all 27 episodes of Air Master is for the enjoyment of the fight scenes.The characters never get much depth, but they click in a way that makes the silly comedy work.  Maki (main character) does get some flashbacks: I like her unusual fighting background.  Mina might offend some people, but her proportions are so ridiculous that it's hard to take her for anything but the parody she is....Even annoying little girl Renge gets a few comedy moments that make her not quite as annoying.Voice acting is pretty decent.  Paku Romi was a great choice for Maki, and Mika Doi does a good job as the psychotic Kaori.  Also featured are Yukana Nogami as Mina (Tessa in Full Metal Panic), Tomoko Kaneda as Renge (Chiyo in Azumanga Daioh) and Masumi Asano as Michiru (Hakufu in Ikki Tousen).  The music isn't outstanding, but fits the show well, particularly the fast-paced OP and ED.The art seems to be one of the biggest reasons people avoid this anime.  However, after seeing the billionth show designed to have the cutest characters possible, it's downright amazing to have character designs that are willing to slap you in the face and kick both &quot;cute&quot; and &quot;the norm&quot; to the curb.  It's also refreshing to see a female anime character that can kick butt AND looks the part.  The character art isn't always consistent, but the animation does a great job of making the fights flow well and making the blows look real and painful, while using a variety of crazy fighting styles.I recommend this show to anyone who wants to see some interesting fights that don't have much in the way of the typical copouts (like hurled energy beams or blurred strikes that are supposedly too quick to see).  For those viewers, the key rating is 7 for enjoyment.  People who don't care much about fights and want some real character development and substance to the story should look elsewhere.

Grappler Baki might be my favorite series ever, Garouden is my favorite manga, I thought Yu Yu Hakusho was great, and consider Bleach good solely on the strength of its action scenes.Air Master, however, is the single worst anime series I\'ve ever seen.  It is putrid, like moldy rice tossed into spoiled milk, that reeks for weeks on end.  At first, I thought that three of the other four reviews for this series giving it a 1 were just exaggerating how bad it was.They weren\'t.The story introduces us to Maki,...a seven foot tall, 14 year old girl, who fights with the power of....wait for it.....gymnastics.  Her goal is to challenge other strange-looking people to street fights.  Violence and poor animation ensue.How a seven foot tall girl with broad shoulders, weighing at least 250 pounds was at one point a world class gymnast and can fly through the air never even receives an attempt at an explanation.  It does, of course, lend itself to numerous shots of tight white panties underneath Maki\'s mini-skirt.Apparently, the goal is to turn me on sexually with an animation while I\'m watching a fight featuring copious amounts of blood.Now listen, I have no problem with absurd, unrealistic premises and backgrounds in an action anime.  Hell, I like it.But even if none of the moves used are the least bit practical, there has to be something in the fictional main combatant that resembles a REAL fighter, or at least the audience\'s perception of what a true fighter should be.Baki was a teenager also, but he was muscular, disciplined, and had a great personality.  Ippo was a boxer of tremendous dedication and heart, and acted like a real human being.  Hell, even some of the characters in Dragonball Z had moderately interesting aspects of their personality that were genuine.Here, Maki is like a giant robot, with no emotion, no motivation for anything she does, and numerous holes in the consistency and logic of everything from her interactions with her normal friends, to her feelings about other fighters.She\'s not cool, deep, or unique.  She\'s an overgrown, violent retard.Of course, you can\'t really blame her.  Every other character is the same.Now, let\'s talk about the animation.  Normally, I don\'t believe it deserves its own section, but this is an exception.  ""Air Master"" has the worst animation I have ever seen in an anime.  There are literally about 3 or 4 frames per second, at best, which often makes me think I\'m seeing a Powerpoint slide.It feels disjointed, the characters are animated with little detail, change noticeably from scene to scene, and their movements always feel unnatural, not just in terms of the fighting, but even something as simple as crossing the street.  Frankly, it feels like the series was made between 1988 and 1992, not 2004.The only possible thing that could salvage the series would be the fight scenes.  Unfortunately, they\'re stale and repetitive; once you\'ve seen one fight, you\'ve essentially seen them all.  The afore-mentioned horrible, cheap animation doesn\'t help either.Additional lowlights in the series include a high-pitched, midget 14 year old who cries and throws temper tantrums when she doesn\'t get what she wants, and is present in virtually every episode.  Why throw one of the most annoying anime characters I\'ve ever seen into the show?  Apparently, she\'s supposed to be funny.The dialogue is unbelievable, too.From the first episode alone, we get the following priceless quote from a Mexican Lucha Libre guy, to demonstrate how much of a scary motherfucker he is;""Or perhaps there\'s a poor puppy struggling for breath in a muddy stream, even if there\'s a heavy rain warning, I\'ll jump in!""Intimidating.

It was just one anime among the many but I got interested in it just because one artist I've been stalking has made nice ( yaoi ) fanart out of it.So I sought Air Master out and watched it, without having any idea on what I was going to see.I was surprised to find that the main characters were females and not only that, the yuri/lesbian implications were quite evident ( to the point where they weren't even implications anymore ). I didn't mind at...all. And BIG big bonus: the females were NOT annoying, generic, overly cheerful, bug-eyed, cutsey wutesy woo twerps with glittery hair and two out-of-proportion sticks for legs. The characters were exaggerated, but realistic somehow. It was nice and refreshing.The story itself does leave alot to hope for.

I immediately got the feeling that once again the makers of the anime trust that the person who sees the anime has read the manga.In Air Master, it was plain and a bit stupid... plus it the series ended like in the middle of everything. I didn't feel like anything was concluded. So story-wise, it was a bit of a disappointment.What saves it was the quality of each individual episode. It wasn't a funny anime per se but it was amusing, and impressive. Don't get me wrong: I do NOT like fighting animes generally. I find them utterly boring. But Air Master was beautiful, plus I do find some charm in the Street Fighting romantique ( can you say that? ). Besides Maki herself is really likable character, as Air Master and as Maki, her fighting style is cool.I understand if someone would diss this anime because of the lacking story, but I'd say one should still give it a chance ( and maybe if one likes it, she could see about the manga? ).However, if you're the type that likes cute girls doing cute things or high-school boys who sprout wings every now and then, I don't think this anime is for you.If you're a bit perverted ( to every way ) and find amusement from dirty jokes, yet enjoy a bit of coolness every now and then, Air Master should be well worth a view. all.

However with Airmaster...the delivery is more like a ""slice of life drama"" and it just so happens the main protagonist is involved in a lot of fighting.

Being a street fighter makes her feel alive, which gives her amazing\xa0power and grace. She fights A LOT of enemies, and after continuing to demonstrate her incredible power, she earns the new nickname, ""Air Master"".First off,  Air Master was good because there were hilarious moments that were topped with a myriad of epic street battles and a hint of romance, surprisingly. The anime\'s plot was good at telling the story but...I believed that this anime could\'ve done a lot better. The first thing that I didnt like at all about  the anime is that Aikawa was made WAY too tall. I mean she towers over everyone around her age, given the fact that she\'s a woman. I understand that women come in all shapes and sizes, but really? Does she have to be that tall? Also, I didn\'t like Aikawa\'s friends Mina and Renge. Let\'s start with Mina. I didn\'t like Mina because she was extremely annoying and clingy towards Aikawa. She wouldn\'t even last one second without Aikawa. Seriously? Do you need her that badly?! Also, Mina\'s boobs are way too big for her own good. She always gets noticed for her big boobs by guys everywhere she goes. I\'m not hating on her, but it really gets annoying. Secondly, I didn\'t like Renge because her voice sounded like a dying raccoon. Also, doesn\'t she look like she should be in kindergarten, not junior high? Over all I give this anime a 6/10. It wasn\'t good or bad either, I just wish that the characters were developed properly and that the plot was better thought out and planned out properly. I would only recommend this anime to people who are interested in top-notch action and comedy. I believed that this anime could\'ve done a lot better. The first thing that I didnt like at all about  the anime is that Aikawa was made WAY too tall. I mean she towers over everyone around her age, given the fact that she\'s a woman. I understand that women come in all shapes and sizes, but really? Does she have to be that tall? Also, I didn\'t like Aikawa\'s friends Mina and Renge. Let\'s start with Mina. I didn\'t like Mina because she was extremely annoying and clingy towards Aikawa. She wouldn\'t even last one second without Aikawa. Seriously? Do you need her that badly?!

There isn't any complex storyline or thinking involve in this anime, but it does have fighting scenes and funny moments in every episode.I think most of the characters are likable, there is only two or three that most would find annnoying, Mina and Renge.Kaori Sakiyama is like Vegta from Drangonball Z because she strives to be better than the main character Maki Aikawa. She has the most development in this story and the most fun to watch. There are many other interesting characters and their interactions with each other is funny to watch, Maki and Julietta is one I...find funny though it is boardline creepy/obsess.The storyline  isn't really about Maki training and fighting others to reach the top.Maki starts of strong already and she does get progressively stronger, but that's not really the reason of the show, to me anyways.The storyline could be split into two parts.The first would be Maki and her friends going through series of situations, which some would deem random, but it is also the time when Maki tries to find strong opponents to fight to achieve the thrill and adrenaline rush that she used to feel when she was apart of gymnastics. During this time you are become used to all the characters. I like this half more since even though it was more random, you understand a bit more of why Maki wants to fight and her capabilities as the Air Master.The second part would  be Fukamichi Ranking.This parts has all the fighters that Maki fight in the previous part show up again. Most of them take part in the ranking and there are new fighters introduced. The fights are good and Maki is stronger, but to me during this half she doesn't really have the same fighting drive she did in the first half. Also, this half shows Maki isn't always invincible.The ending episode is a bit confusing. I would like more information about the whole Eternals and the ghost lady first, and if they had an episode explaining it fist and then have the last episode it would atleast made a bit more sense. But the fighting was good and everything did feel complete beside the Eternal thing.So, you should watch it if you want to watch something funny and has action and no really serious plot.Though there is mention of yuri (Maki, the main character, and Mina the big chested girl[its somewhat onesided] ), and yaoi (Kinjiro Kitaeda, one of the fighters, and Nagato, Kinjiro's bodyguard [also onesided, but they do kiss-extremely gross, but funny]).There is a few obsessive characters, but its funny. So, if you take the show to seriously or don't like the above mention then it wont be funny or enjoyable. find funny though it is boardline creepy/obsess.The storyline  isn't really about Maki training and fighting others to reach the top.Maki starts of strong already and she does get progressively stronger, but that's not really the reason of the show, to me anyways.The storyline could be split into two parts.The first would be Maki and her friends going through series of situations, which some would deem random, but it is also the time when Maki tries to find strong opponents to fight to achieve the thrill and adrenaline rush that she used to feel when she was apart of gymnastics.

It definitely isn't a style I have seen very often and came with a lot of interesting character designs and a fighting style that I enjoyed.I found the variety of characters to be surprising. There wasn't too much repetitiveness and each fighting style...kept me intrigued and interested in how fights would go and what would happen with the characters. While many of the fights and characters lacked the amount of depth or story some would hope for, this was a fighting show and the fights were all over the place enough to keep me watching.All in all Air Master is a good series if you are not looking for to much depth and just want a good ole fighting anime that doesn't have any ninjas (aside from one). kept me intrigued and interested in how fights would go and what would happen with the characters.

If you see many fan service in this anime then it is not for you or if you hate it after 2 or 3 episode then you don\'t need to go further. It won\'t really get better in term of story wise or animation wised. Also don\'t watch this if you\'re expecting it to be like other anime because it won\'t. At least from most anime I have seen Air Master still stand as pretty unique from others. Of course not because it\'s good but it just doesn\'t follow rules that makes a story good. I\'ll try to...explain it short.Story; 3Art; 7 (If kanon(2006) and clannads(2007) faces are good then air master(2003) is good)Sound; 7Character; 4 (Decent enough to not bore but not good enough to remember)Enjoyment; 9 (Good flow/directing so it\'s good to mindlessly binge)Overall; 6For example, it\'s hard to spoil this show because the anime is almost episodic, thus, don\'t really have any plot to follow or to spoil. Then for an almost episodic story, it would need a good cast don\'t you think? Not necessarily, this series don\'t have cute cast like Lucky Star or funny cast like How I met your Mother. At least not in the typical term of cute or funny. Think of this show as Naruto but without Naruto wanting to become Hokage, and his friends got no ambitions other than to follow him. Though Maki might resemble Sasake more than Naruto. Hopefully, you see that setting won\'t work... at least not for some. Not everyone has a taste for seeing and hearing a motive less character even with fights. This is what I can understand why some people don\'t like it.It\'s not like I\'m a special snowflake who likes quirky character or thing, it\'s almost weird to actually enjoy Renge\'s character yet I do. If you can\'t find charm in weirdly and annoying character with too much ego then that\'s fine for not liking this anime. However, something like art style or animation argument is mostly BS to me. After this sentence it\'ll mostly rant so you can stop reading here.---People who argument about the art. Stop right fucking there. For me if anything is done right in this anime it\'s the art. Sure the animation is bad comparing to FMA from 2003. Yet the art is unique and honestly good. Maki being a hunk is pretty expected if she\'s going to withstand a blow that can break a fucking wall. Though sure to break a wall you might need to look like a character from Baki but the point is. Their proportions are good to used in a fight. Also if this anime had the Clannad anime style or Kyoto Animation\'s style (no offense) it wouldn\'t be about the fight but how pretty the fight is instead.Okay so here\'s about the fighting. Sure the anime lack good animation but that\'s where a good directing comes in. It\'s Daisuke Nishio whom directed this anime. He has directed Dragon Ball series, One Piece and more. Those I\'ve seen are One Piece and Futari wa Pretty Cure. Both shows has a lot of actions with less frames, however, has a lot of ""force"" in every hit. That\'s what he is good at and that\'s what make the fighting good without the Naruto/Baki like actions. Also the fighting seems more down to earth and powerful when you can see and follow how each hits connects.Lastly, I want to mention the ""fanservice""... If those white panties turns you on then leave this anime. It\'s not even trying to bring attention to those panties and Mina\'s big boobs are so cartoonishly over fucking exaggerated that only retards can get turn on from it. It\'s so obvious that is supposed to be made fun of and if they want to sexualize the panties then why would they not shade the genitals to make it look more provocative and eye catching? I never even once batted an eyes on them. Sure I may be a girl but I don\'t look at guys crotch either. Either way there\'s no boob movement in the fight like High School of the Dead and there no showing of them in any fights either.

No last-minute copouts because she\'s a girl. And I have to say that while I don\'t usually go for this type, I\'ll admit that she made me enjoy the ""handsome girl"" archetype. As she certainly has presence.Lastly, the opening and ending songs are just hype. I enjoy listening to them even when I\'m not watching the show. The bg of the actual show goes up and down in quality, but never reaches bad levels. The only negative thing I have to say in regards to sound is the little girl, Renge\'s, voice. It\'s just grating.

Watashi ga Motete Dousunda,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32899/Watashi_ga_Motete_Dousunda,"[""Looking at the score, I wonder how this anime made it so high. This was one of those anime my group of weaboo friends made fun of and made each other watch on many accounts of i dare yous. Though to be fair, the art is pretty decent.The story starts out with a fat and ugly kae, eyes like brock from pokemon, and glasses like any stereotypical otaku in akihabara. After a tragic death of an animated drawing of a male yaoi character and about a week of starving herself (wow! promoting that anorexic lifestyle!) she not only loses her glasses and develops some tohru...honda eyes, but becomes the next victoria secret angel, loosing over half her initial body weight! Suddenly, all the guys who ignored her before as she was shipping them have turned their heads and looked at her newly evolved form!Even after they establish that they're all after her, she still treats them like toys. She never thinks about them, rather about how they could be together with each other. She clumps them together and don't think of them as their own respective person, yet they're still smitten.Think of every trope you've ever seen, like the kabe-don, the beach scene, the double kabe-don scene, the date scene with all suitors, and smash them all in one, and you've found a shojo hellhole that makes up this anime.The music is mediocre and very upbeat, but nothing sticks out. Art is the only redeeming feature. I was really sad because I was expecting something like her BL or yaoi mangas, which I actually really like.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. If you like BL or yaoi, skip this manga/anime and just read her other manga honda eyes, but becomes the next victoria secret angel, loosing over half her initial body weight!

If you like BL or yaoi, skip this manga/anime and just read her other manga"", 'Watching Watashi ga Motete Dousunda (Kiss Him, not Me!) reminds me of feeling like a kid again. Kind of like a kid walking right into a candy store, the show felt pretty silly at first and even hysterical. I mean, it’s a reverse harem shoujo. Shows like this tends to appeal to mostly a certain demographic and to me, it isn’t something that I favor a lot. However, there’s this something about this show that feels more appealing than some of the other reverse harem shows I’ve watched before. Whether it’s because the series is a parody of making fun of BL or the comedy,...this turned out to be a pretty sweet ride.Adapted from the manga of the same name, the series is about a fujoshi named Serinuma Kae. For those who are not familiar with the term, it basically designates individuals who has fascination about boys’ love (BL, yaoi, etc). Kae is a bit of an extreme example as her character is not only into BL but also fascinates about fictional characters like an otaku. The first few episodes establishes her as an avid fangirl of a TV show that she watches. Furthermore, she ships about her classmates in awkward fantasies. So on surface, you can pretty much say that she’s a girl that may have a hard time making real friends. Oh and she is chubby too. That is, she does certainly lose a lot of weight after the death of one of her favorite anime characters. Life changes and now, Kae is a bombshell who attracts attention at school like never before.Okay, okay. I know what you’re probably thinking. How can this show really make a character like Kae likable? The fact that is, she is an otaku-fujoshi hybrid although the show seems to emphasize more on her BL fandom. The storytelling focuses on her the most but makes it more into a shoujo dramedy. This is accomplished by the numerous suitors that seeks to capture her heart. The fun catch is that Kae is more interested in seeing the suitors paired with each other. Throughout the show, you can expect a lot of daydreams and fantasies from Kae’s point of view. Most of is delusional while others are crafted by misunderstandings. In the meantime, the main male protagonists really do care about Kae whether she knows it or not.From the main cast, we have Mutsumi, Igarashi, Nanashima, and Shinomiya. Each of these guys has a different personality although all has the same goal: to win Kae’s heart. Oh and later on, even another fujoshi girl enters the story further amplifying the competition. Now I have to admit, these guys are pretty stereotypical in terms of characteristics. For instance, Igarashi instantly gives me the classic suitor type that never seems to give up until he gets what he wants. Nanashima is more of a tsundere with a bad boy type attitude. On the other hand, there’s Shinomiya with feminine features and a more gentle personality. Mutsumi is probably the most care-free of the guys and treats the competition more casually compared to the others. So you get the idea here? They are pretty much the type of guys you can find in any shoujo or reverse harem show. Comically enough, Kae isn’t too interested in dating any of these guys but rather have the guys date between themselves. She is a fujoshi after all.Regardless of the characters, the show focuses a lot more on its comedy by selling humor. This is done through character relationships that progresses between Kae and the others. While the pacing isn’t too impressive, she does get closer to each of the other guys. In fact, it’s clearly shown that some of them are truly falling for her while Kae herself begins to wonder about her own feelings. The comedy comes in with Kae’s usual fantasies that begins to also blend between fiction and reality. The introduction of a female character (Nishina), also makes the show more refreshing because she and Kae has quite a bit of similarities. It hypes up the competition and also brings out the other guys’ personalities more into the open. The point is, the show isn’t really much more about serious drama or realism. It’s there instead to make the viewers laugh and experience from first view point of a fujoshi character. It isn’t trying to get you to like Kae or the others. Instead, it seizes opportunities to bring the storytelling and characters to a level that is beyond just popcorn entertainment.From a technical perspective, the show is just fine with how Brain’s Base adapted this manga. Honestly, I’m more borderline between fine and so-so because the overall quality isn’t impressive. The character designs obviously gives the reverse-harem and shoujo feel with its bishounen looks. On the other hand, Kae is decorated with femininity and her gentleness. However, character expressions is another story. The directing of Kae and others characters’ facial reactions has a very entertaining way of expressing themselves. Most times, it’s Kae’s yaoi fangirling but the other characters draw attention as well. In retrospect, character expressions adds an extra dose to entertainment in this show.The soundtrack is more or less pretty standard although the theme songs stands out with performances by the actual voice actors/actresses. Speaking of voice acting, I have to emphasize that each of the characters does make impressions just by their voice tone alone. It defines their personalities especially Kae. I mean, you’d see Kae fantasying about the guys and her voice changes dramatically to overemphasize her passion.Watashi ga Motete Dousunda is the type of show that is definitely not suitable for everyone. It’s hard to recommend to everyone because what it looks on paper. Yes, the premise is pretty much what it is and the storytelling never distances itself from that. Still, I would recommend giving this show a chance if you’re seeking for some comedy. As a manga reader, the series is also faithful on most parts so it doesn’t degenerate into a mess. But all else aside, this show is like a buffet where you choose what’s satisfying for you. this turned out to be a pretty sweet ride.Adapted from the manga of the same name, the series is about a fujoshi named Serinuma Kae. For those who are not familiar with the term, it basically designates individuals who has fascination about boys’ love (BL, yaoi, etc). Kae is a bit of an extreme example as her character is not only into BL but also fascinates about fictional characters like an otaku. The first few episodes establishes her as an avid fangirl of a TV show that she watches. Furthermore, she ships about her classmates in awkward fantasies. So on surface, you can pretty much say that she’s a girl that may have a hard time making real friends. Oh and she is chubby too. That is, she does certainly lose a lot of weight after the death of one of her favorite anime characters. Life changes and now, Kae is a bombshell who attracts attention at school like never before.Okay, okay. I know what you’re probably thinking. How can this show really make a character like Kae likable? The fact that is, she is an otaku-fujoshi hybrid although the show seems to emphasize more on her BL fandom. The storytelling focuses on her the most but makes it more into a shoujo dramedy. This is accomplished by the numerous suitors that seeks to capture her heart. The fun catch is that Kae is more interested in seeing the suitors paired with each other. Throughout the show, you can expect a lot of daydreams and fantasies from Kae’s point of view. Most of is delusional while others are crafted by misunderstandings. In the meantime, the main male protagonists really do care about Kae whether she knows it or not.From the main cast, we have Mutsumi, Igarashi, Nanashima, and Shinomiya. Each of these guys has a different personality although all has the same goal: to win Kae’s heart. Oh and later on, even another fujoshi girl enters the story further amplifying the competition. Now I have to admit, these guys are pretty stereotypical in terms of characteristics. For instance, Igarashi instantly gives me the classic suitor type that never seems to give up until he gets what he wants. Nanashima is more of a tsundere with a bad boy type attitude. On the other hand, there’s Shinomiya with feminine features and a more gentle personality. Mutsumi is probably the most care-free of the guys and treats the competition more casually compared to the others. So you get the idea here? They are pretty much the type of guys you can find in any shoujo or reverse harem show. Comically enough, Kae isn’t too interested in dating any of these guys but rather have the guys date between themselves. She is a fujoshi after all.Regardless of the characters, the show focuses a lot more on its comedy by selling humor. This is done through character relationships that progresses between Kae and the others. While the pacing isn’t too impressive, she does get closer to each of the other guys.

It was hilarious, light hearted and very cute with great art.The first 5 episodes I was laughing so hard... however after a while you notice the story isn\'t really going anywhere and unfortunately that was definitely reinforced with the season ending, it felt like the main character hadn\'t really grown throughout the anime, which is also good if you think about it in the way that she ""stayed true to herself"" .The characters have good development and all have moments in the spotlight but really its...just another harem anime (I\'m not particularly fond of harem) I still found it very enjoyable and light hearted to watch, quite a few times I found myself laughing or giggling out loud. There are also plenty of moe, BL and even Yuri moments for the fangirl at heart.Due to the lack of story beyond romance .. I\'ll have to rate it 7/10 just another harem anime (I\'m not particularly fond of harem) I still found it very enjoyable and light hearted to watch, quite a few times I found myself laughing or giggling out loud. There are also plenty of moe, BL and even Yuri moments for the fangirl at heart.Due to the lack of story beyond romance .. I\'ll have to rate it 7/10', 'There are anime where there is a girl who ships two guys together, and there are anime where there is a girl who has her own reverse harem. Well, why not combine them into one? Behold! A girl who ships the guys in her own reverse harem! I first heard about the manga for this anime before the anime was even announced; it seemed interesting, so when it was announced that it was getting an anime adaptation, I was immediately on board. Thus, I watched it as it aired, and honestly, I\'m really glad I did.Ladies and gentlemen, here is my review of ""Kiss Him,...Not Me"", a.k.a. ""Watashi ga Motete Dousunda"".Kiss Him, Not Me follows Kae Serinuma, an overweight fujoshi who ships her classmates, Yusuke Igarashi and Nozomu Nanashima, and is in love with a character from the anime ""Mirage Saga"", Shion. However, in one episode, Shion ends up dying; as anyone who has had their favorite anime character die can relate to, Kae does NOT take his death well. She locks herself in her room for a week, refusing to eat.... and when she comes back to school, she comes back very attractive as a result of all of her weight loss. Needless to say, she catches the attention of not just Igarashi and Nanashima, but she also ends up attracting an underclassman named Hayato Shinomiya and an upperclassman named Asuma Mutsumi. Unfortunately, she\'s not romantically interested in any of them, but still, the competition begins....I\'m just going to be honest; the story wasn\'t as good as I was hoping it would be. There were episodes where I wasn\'t really as engaged in what was happening as others, and the ending was slightly unsatisfactory. However, that does not mean the story is bad; on the contrary, it\'s actually a good one. There were a lot of funny moments that at least made me smile, and it was interesting to see the characters\' development. Plus, with Kae being an otaku and all, there are a few Easter eggs from other anime scattered here and there, especially from Attack on Titan, so that was interesting to see!Now, let\'s talk about the characters. Kae is someone who any otaku girl can relate to, whether they\'re a fujoshi like her or not; that, along with the funny moments involving her, make her an interesting protagonist. Each of the boys in her reverse harem have their own quirks, too, and without exception, each of them gets their time to shine. Mutsumi is my favorite out of all of them; he\'s very kind, it\'s obvious he cares about Kae whether in a platonic or romantic way, and the episodes focused on him were my favorites. There\'s also Shima Nishina, a girl who joins the reverse harem a bit later than the rest. As a yuri fan, I\'d like to rejoice, but honestly, I never saw the relationship between her and Kae as anything more than platonic; however, she was still an amusing character nonetheless. The supporting cast was amusing whenever they appeared, too, especially Kae\'s friend, A-chan.The art was really pretty, and the character designs were solid. Brain\'s Base did a really good job with the animation, too. Both the opening and ending themes, ""Prince x Prince"" by From4to7 and ""Dokidoki no Kaze"" by Rie Murakawa, were both extremely catchy songs that I\'ve already listened to a million times! As for the voice acting, I was originally a bit sad about the cast from the drama CD being changed (especially Yu Kobayashi replacing Kana Hanazawa as Kae), but all of the voice actors really nailed their respective roles. I\'ll admit that it\'s a bit strange how different Kae sounds between her fat and skinny forms, but it really goes to show you how her voice actress can do different kinds of voices.Overall, Kiss Him, Not Me was an enjoyable anime. If you\'re tired of the same old reverse harem anime and want one where the protagonist is a fujoshi, I\'d definitely recommend this one. Who knows?

I cant believe i sat through 12 episodes in a discord call over the period of about 2 weeks watching is absolute flaming pile of D O G S H I T.The story starts off with a fat chick who OH GUESS WHAT DEVELOPS A SEVERE CLINCAL DEPRESSION OVER THE DEATH OF AN ANIME CHARACTER. Nevertheless she loses about 300 pounds and her soul by not eating for a week.She goes to school the week after starving herself and magically is liked by all the boys, i. kid. you. not. they all started...treating her like a princess in a fucking fairy tale. Over the course of the anime the story gets more shallow, and the oc develops SEVERE PTSD over tripping on rocks, getting kissed and being told somebody likes her.overall this anime sucks and please do yourself a favor and watch boku no pico instead.1/10 treating her like a princess in a fucking fairy tale.

Here, is where the term ""REVERSE HAREM"" was given a totally different definition, this was probably the only reverse harem where the main character is pretty much as obnoxious as a guy in a regular harem, and this was also the only anime where the harem member were competing for the girl\'s affection, what makes the harem member different from a usual reverse harem was an addition of a lesbian who adds to the competition of the guys for the girl.5 over 10Artwise, I just don\'t have anything to say about the illustrations o the character.4 over 10I really don\'t give a damn about them seiyuus who did the character\'s voices, so let\'s just leave it at that.8 over 10Characters, well since this anime really gives the term ""REVERSE HAREM"" a new definition, it won\'t come as a surprise that the guys here were a total quintessential of a usual guy to girls harem like:Asuma Mutsumi, a quintessential sempai who is the bright one, here, he\'s is the male version of a Yamato Nadeshiku.Nozomu ""Nana"" Nanashima, a quintessential tsundere, a male version of a tsundere that is.Yuusuke Igarashi, a quintessential athletic type who is a male version of the typical sporty type.Hayato Shinomiya, a quintessential half breed, in fact he is a make version of a half Jap and half white that would be usually be found in any harem.Shima Nishina, well she the usual bokuko, and since there can\'t be a male bokuko , she has to really be a bokuko. Why do they have to add her anyways.Now let\'s go to the main character, Kae Serinuma, pretty much a character I\'d like to give a karate chop on her head, as a main character of this anime/ manga she, basically is quite annoying on one hand cu\'z of her immaturity, but then again I really like that she was portrayed as this total obnoxious main character. In which in my book is a very good thing, now I\'ve rate is an 8 not because I like the characters, but because I really admire the way the characters were portrayed.6 over 10Enjoyment, I really wasn\'t that eager to enjoy this anime , in fact, I\'ve skipped some episodes along the way, since I really hate the way as to how the main character see her harem, for her, they were just her basis for her imagination as an otaku.7 over 10Overall, it was decent enough to be watched, but my annoyance for the main character was a bit overwhelming, but then again, seeing how unique the ending went, kinda changes my perspective for this anime. Besides, it wasn\'t always that we get to see a harem getting rejected by  the main character, and that is the only good part.Whoahoho OUT! interest.

This story is just gross and fetishize-y, I feel gross just thinking about the main character behaves. Her entire personality is fetishizing MLM relationships, shipping her classmates, and being the definition of a fujoshi.Even if I look past that, the characters are just boring, and the only decent character is that one dude who isn't a total asshole and liked the MC before she was 'prettier'. The story is just your typical harem anime with gross behaviour from all characters.The one scene that really pisses me off is...when the MC gains her weight back, and her motivation for exercising is seeing two guys hold hands and interact. It doesn't feel right, it's so off-putting watching a girl be so obsessed over the idea of an MLM relationship, and the whole weight loss story is just stupid.If you like this series, stay away from me, don't come near me, I don't want to even know you exist. when the MC gains her weight back, and her motivation for exercising is seeing two guys hold hands and interact.

This love for gay anime leaks to real life and she often fantasizes about romance between guys. Every episode they all follow her (the main character) around doing stuff for her, helping her and guarding her in hopes to get (sexual) attention from her. However she doesn't like any of them romantically and ultimately let's them down (really predictable and anti-climatic ending), because she likes her gay anime more than real life.Thoughts:There's very...little character deveploment and the characters itself aren't that good either. There's some humor and anime references, but nothing that would make me laugh. Probably the only good thing about this anime is the animation and art style, it's easy to look at. But that doesn't help when you got a really bad story that doesn't produce other feelings than anger.4/10, would not watch again. little character deveploment and the characters itself aren't that good either.

The only people who are gonna enjoy it are female otakus, especially if they're into BL. We're the core audience here so if you're a straight male, you should best stay away from it.For those of you interested in the reverse harem genre, know that somethings have to be accepted at face value, including:1. Lots of boys will like one girl, for no apparent reason other than that she's pretty (and sometimes, has a sweet personality)2. The girl is always completely oblivious of how the boys feel for her.3. There is no plot - all the...boys compete in their own way with each other to catch the girl's eye, who in turn sees them as nothing more than friends.5. The big reveal is always within the last 5-10 minutes of the last episode of the series.So now that you've accepted that this WILL happen, let's move on to my review. As you have already understood by my score, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. I loved how it poked fun at the moe culture and otakus, without really being offensive to either. In many scenes, I saw myself in the shoes of the female MC ; I guess that's what made it all the more enjoyable for me. Many, many scenes had me in splits. I loved how the shipping of male characters was given an entire episode; this is something I haven't seen before in any anime.What I also like about the reverse harem genre is how deeply respectful all the male characters are towards the feelings, decision and consent of the female character. Always. The choice is always left to *her* to decide who she likes and the boys always agree to *respect* her decision. The 4 boys in the series (apart from being very good looking) had 4 different personalities, which shone wonderfully throughout the series. I especially loved the discomfort they felt every time they were made to do something yaoi-ish. Hahaha! Those were some of the best scenes.All in all, it's a pretty decent watch and unlike most female MCs from the reverse harem genre, this one actually has a brain. It's definitely worth a binge watch!PS. I LOVED the anime references in this anime. They had me fangirling like crazy!PPS. I really wanted the MC to daydream a lot more about the BL between her admirers, but unfortunately, in that way the title of the anime is misleading, because there was very little of that.*you can stop reading this point afterwards if you haven't watched the anime*Just a small overview of the characters and who I ship with whom:1. Mutsumi (history club dude) was the most obvious choice for Kae, because he saw beyond her looks and loved/respected her for who she really was. He was the only one who noticed her when she was fat.2. Igarashi (the sports guy) was the only one who understood *why* he liked Kae. That was character development! He and Nishina (the girl) had some moments together and I was hoping the two would end up together. He was my 2nd choice for Kae.3. Nanashima (the blonde) showed the maximum character development. The ep with his sister was adorable and showed us his kinder/gentler side. Made him 10x more attractive to me and I'm sure, to many other fangirls as well. He's also ready to defend/fight for Kae's honour, which is HOT. He was my 3rd choice for Kae.4. Shinomiya (the youngest boy) is cute, adorable and easily lovable. He was the least suited as Kae's partner, but we all fell in love with him nonetheless :)5. Nishina (the girl) was a pleasant surprise, and it was nice to see how none of the boys poked fun at her for being a girl (and competing for the affections of a girl). They all accepted her as another competitor, which I think was wonderful for the LGBTQ+ cause. I didn't ship her with Kae, though. I got more of a crazy-otaku-bff vibe from them.6. Kazuma was a surprise entry, and I TOTALLY shipped him and Nanashima. Hahahahahahahaha!! The Junjou Romantica references made their scenes so much more hilarious!!If you have any thoughts, please drop by my profile!

Its a harmless show with a fujoshi protagonist who doesn\'t take advantage of the amount of dick she\'s surrounded by. At the start of the anime Kae is portrayed as an ugly obese girl who gets off to boys being lads. However when she goes home and finds out her favorite character in some anime dies. She instantly loses weight over the hard loss. She manages to go from ugly girl to pretty girlie within about a week.Although now shes a pretty protaganist shes got theese four boys that are after her even though shes...an otaku and a fujoshi (but she dosent tell them that) I dont think the anime spread a good message from Kaes transformation and everyone suddenly going head over heals for her. It kind of puts in my mind ""no one will love you if your unattactive"" which isnt healthy. I wish they had potrayed this is a different attempt to make a comedic, reverse harem,However the show dosent dwell on it much and the cast is generic but fairly alright. The show has alot of funny elements and several anime references relating to real life such as going to comicon, and cosplaying from attack on titan, and Black Butler.

They only wanted Serinuma because of her weight loss. Not a single one of them truly cared about her feelings, her hobbies, or her overall personality as long as she stayed thin in all the right places. There are so many moments in the show where each of the love interests do things to court Serinuma at her own expense. None of them were all that likable. (aside from Asuma Mutsumi) Serinuma herself was a...flawed characters. I get this is to poke fun at the fujoshi community but she was still disturbing. Definitely not saying women have 0 right to enjoy mlm media as I do not have a say in that but the fetishization over mlm media (and LGBTQ relationships in general) is weird and disgusting.PLOT/CONCEPTS: 1/10The overall message alone is distasteful. The main people consuming this are young women and as someone who struggles with body image,  this is a terrible message. (I am ONLY talking about the anime not the manga just fyi) This essentially shows young girls that personality doesn\'t matter as long as you are thin in all the ""right"" places and beautiful.

None of the love interest really show any growth in truly liking Serinuma because she\'s her. They only like her because she\'s hot. Sure, they play along with her hobbies at time despite finding them strange, but you can tell they don\'t do it for her sake but for their sake in winning her affection. Mutsumi Is really the only one seen liking Serinuma and respecting her as a human being before and after her weight transformation, while the others were shown to have little compassion for her as a human being. This is a terrible message and the plot is so generic, it\'s literally your average reverse harem anime.ENJOYMENT: 3/10Admittedly, this anime has its fun, cute, and funny moments. What ruined this was its message to young girls and the annoyingly pushy love interests who did whatever they could to date the new ""attractive"" Serinuma at the cost of her own feelings. She is shown to feel uncomfortable and upset over the love interests\' selfishness and that\'s just a huge turn off for me.

If she was to permanently revert to her old self I doubt any of them (aside from Asuma Mutsumi) would still pursue her.

After reading the synopsis and watching the first episode i was pretty exited about the premise of this show.  A reverse Harem where the main character isn't an oblivious moron, but rather a pervert who is going to try to redirect her harem's affection towards each other instead of her.Then... it turns into a typical harem anime.  You get a little fan service here and there with the guys looking cute.. but it is few and far between.  The main character becomes an oblivious moron who has Zero character and just blushes or yells about...her favorite anime  character.

I found myself cringing throughout the entire thing- not even exaggerating.  Reverse harems are a huge guilty pleasure of mine, so I found the show and decided to watch. I wasn\'t expecting too much out of it as it seemed like your generic shoujo anime with a bunch of cute guys, an average main character, and all that jazz. I thought the concept of it would be interesting, you know, the whole fangirl ""wants the guys that want to be with her to be with each other.""But...God, I wasn\'t expecting it to be that bad.So the main character, she\'s the worst. The whole fangirl trope in the series was something I could relate to, but the way that the show portrays Serinuma, making her ""fangirling"" so exaggerated to the point that she couldn\'t even control herself while two men were speaking made the show so unbearable to watch.Now, I understand that the show is a reverse harem so the base concept for the show is unrealistic in itself, but the fact that five characters followed around this girl just waiting so blatantly in competition to be with her was so impractical it made me feel bad for them. Not to mention that most of the characters that wanted to be with Serinuma were extremely superficial. It rubbed me the wrong way that the idea of the anime for a while was that if you\'re fat then you are undesirable, but if you\'re skinny then people will like you.Let\'s not forget the fact that throughout the entire series there was little to no character development for any of the characters except (in the slightest way) Asuma.I get that the show was basically a slice of life, but every single episode was just a recycled plot trope from every single anime you\'ve probably ever seen. Same with the characters. I can name at least three shows that each character was so obviously taken from.The humor was OK, the art was good in certain parts,  but I feel like often in order to avoid elaborately animating certain scenes the animators would just put in excessive chibi clips which got old after the second episode.In conclusion, this show was worse than your average slice of life reverse harem anime, and if you\'re expecting a lot out of it, think again.

That thrown aside, this anime was quite entertaining for me regardless of it being a reversed harem, and I totally would recommend girls AND guys to watch this if you\'re looking for a silly, short and easy-to-watch anime to pass time.***I say the first 5 episodes of Watashi...ga Motete Dousunda were the most interesting. The first 5 really lure you in.

Starts off pretty original, right?After episode 5, well, things became *sort of* unoriginal. Not entirely. But there were a couple of scenes that you have most likely seen before in a school/harem anime. Did that make it 1% less entertaining? Well, I guess, but it was still entertaining anyhow.***Onto the characters:Some of the characters were somewhat unoriginal, so the character descriptions will be simple. Although they are kind of generic, they each had small traits that separated them from other similar characters. Each one of them has an \'eye candy\' appearance and are all very lovable, and watching the characters interact with one another was very enjoyable and fun, sometimes funny.Kae Serinuma - The female protagonist, Serinuma, is defintely not your standard heroine. She is a diehard otaku with a huge BL (Boys Love) fetish that she shows all throughout this anime. Although she has that typical nice-girl personality - the mix of her weird, drooling fujoshi nature is enough to differentiate her from other heroines.Yuusuke Igarashi - The mature ""nice guy"" typeAsuma Mutsumi - The happy-go-lucky \'stoner\' typeNozomu Nanashima - The tsundere/aggressive type (personal fav)Shima Nishina - I\'ll start off by saying she is voiced by one of my favorite female voice actors--Miyuki Sawashiro. She\'s the female, lesbian \'prince charming\', very similar to Kashima from Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun.Hayato Shinomiya - The weak, \'scaredy-cat\' type (voiced by my overall favorite male voice actor, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka!)***The setting and music were nothing out of this world. The OP and ED were both cute and give off the familiar happy vibe that gets you enjoying what you\'re watching even more, that being said I would rate the music a 7.5. The setting is your average school-life environment, but it varies as the main characters do new activities so the sights never get boring.***My biggest problem--and I won\'t spoil--is as the anime is further executed you begin to wonder; do ALL of them actually like Kae Serinuma for more than her looks? That\'s one thing that put me off a bit with the story, as it didn\'t show much proof of them liking her for who she is and not solely what she looks like, and in a way this can send a bad message to women - so if you are easily offended or perhaps have a light sense of humor, I would recommend you to not watch this.If it were not for that issue and the already-been-done events in this anime, I may have rated higher for the cute concept - I would say this anime is more of a 7/10, but I rated it an 8 because I\'m generous with my ratings :) ga Motete Dousunda were the most interesting.

She begins the story being overweight, but once she watches her favorite anime character get killed off she grieves for him and in doing so she refuses to leave her room, eat any food, and shuts herself off from everything for awhile so she can continue mourning her precious Shion.Since she refused to eat, she has miraculously lost a significant amount of weight and now is thin and now considered to be a beauty.Her peers are shocked...and some of them even fall for her. In particular, four boys and even a girl.  These five pursue her throughout the anime and try to win her over by competing with the other four.Now for individual scoring:Story - Nothing too original, its a reverse harem with many clichés and typical things you\'d see and expect in a harem with a touch of comedy.  One thing in particular that I liked about this anime is that all candidates in this harem got a fair chance at winning Kae Serinuma over, including the other female.  Other than that nothing too notable.  The story was interesting to continue to watch and I got through it fairly easily and quickly without growing tired of watching it.  Although the ending was predictable (and to be honest, slightly disappointing) the story was fairly well done.Art - Artwork is pretty well done, but somewhat generic of its type.  That being said, its fine and is by no means ""ugly"" to look at.  However, I must point out that it took me quite awhile to get used to the coloring of many characters eyes.  They seem to have tried to make the characters eyes pop more with a gradient of color, but in many cases for me began to be a bit of an eyesore at first.Sound - Music was well fitting and fine, nothing bad to say about it.Characters - Character designs were good and unique.  Each character had an interesting personality and I found myself liking all of them quite well.Overall, Watashi ga Motete Dousunda (Kiss Him, Not Me) was a fairly well done anime.

Needless to say, within the first episode, I found myself pissed off by most of the people in the show, especially because they were all so shallow and rude. However, as the show went on, it really grew on me, and while I don't agree with some of the statements made, it...made for a really fun time.To begin with, the story; the story was decent (I would have preferred a few modifications; after all, fluctuating weight is a problem, especially when starving yourself is how you get there) and I had a lot of problems with the fat-shaming. However, the show got better in that aspect. It showed change in the people who previously fat-shamed Serinuma, who learned to fall in love with a personality instead of an appearance. I thought the message was sweet. I liked it even better considering I'm a massive fangirl and otaku myself-- however, I'm not as big on BL as Serinuma is. I just ship EVERYTHING-- no restrictions. :) As a fellow obsessive fan, I really enjoyed all the little references in the show and nods to fan culture. (AND YES IT DOES MATTER WHOSE NAME COMES FIRST IN A SHIP FIGHT ME) (I'm worse than I thought I was...) XPThe art was beautiful. The backgrounds were colorful and ever-changing, not to mention that all the girls and guys were drawn beautifully and were very appealing to look at.The sound was alright. Both the opening and ending were catchy, but I'm not sure if I would listen to it again unless it just came up. The background music was fitting and wasn't distracting.The characters were pretty amazing. As a fangirl, I appreciated having the community represented by such an amazing example :D Jokes aside, it's been a while since I've seen a heroine with so much nerve and passion, and considering that I hate most female characters (they're usually written as passive, submissive, and weak) I was pleasantly surprised to find myself liking one-- ESPECIALLY in a reverse harem anime! Some of the boys were insufferable at first due to their rude behavior when Serinuma wasn't attractive, but a few of them I liked (namely Mutsumi and a little Igarashi as well) because they respected Serinuma even when she was 'fat'. While Nishima definitely isn't my type, I really loved her respect and honest love towards Serinuma, no matter what she looked like. Despite being an avid shipper of anything and everything, by the end of the show, I just loved everyone together as a friend group opposed to anyone dating Serinuma (though I think Mutsumi deserves her most out of everyone there... I can find room in my heard for Nishima and Igarashi if need be).I enjoyed this way too much and finished it in less than 24 hours (which I rarely do... I usually don't get this excited over many shows). There were enough references and fangirl jokes to have me on the ground laughing (which is rare for me, I rarely laugh while watching anime) there were also enough cute moments for me to be screaming into the void as my shriveled fangirl heart started beating again. All in all, this was a wild ride, and I was glad I tried it!I would recommend this if you: like otome games, like reverse harems, like smexy boyish lesbian girls, like hot dudes, like cliche anime episodes like the 'beach' episode and the 'ghosts' episode, are a fangirl, are a BL fangirl, like shipping things, like humor and satireI would NOT recommend this if you: don't like harems of any sort, don't like fangirl or fangirling, you don't like shipping, you like serious plotlines, you wanted serious romanceHave a great day everyone! made for a really fun time.To begin with, the story; the story was decent (I would have preferred a few modifications; after all, fluctuating weight is a problem, especially when starving yourself is how you get there) and I had a lot of problems with the fat-shaming.

Well Its a bad show but if anything was good it's the voice acting which is fantastic and is the best thing added to the anime. The hilariously goofy voices add alot to the characters like when serinuma and nishina go full fujoshi mode. The ed is also good but set's me off at the same time.

For example, the regular shoujo heroine is actually a...fujoshi which ships people in her class ~which is relatable lol which means shounen-ai and shoujo-ai themes across the anime, which I think is the cool thing about the storyThe art was beautiful, the design was just like Junko's designs in the manga which I love the designs so the art was nice.The sound was okay.

It\'s more similar to Watamote than anything else. Kae Serinuma is plunged into several situations she\'s never been in such as having an romantic relationship. Everything that she\'s learned about relationships, is from her insane BL/fujoshi lifestyle. To say that our main character is oblivious and unrealistic is wrong, and it puts a complete twist on the harem stereotypes. She isn\'t looking to screw one of these guys, but instead...wants to see the guys screw each other. She\'s a static character in a dynamic environment.That\'s what makes this anime great.Serinuma is set in a situation with 5 guys + 1 girl in which she doesn\'t know how to handle, so she puts them in ludicrous scenarios (or the guys put themselves in ludicrous scenarios) where she can keep her BL lifestyle alive. It\'s the perfect protagonist for the intended audience.The show makes it that every character is likable in someways. Our MC\'s disinterest in the others makes it so that this can spark conversation, shipping, etc for the fanbase. One episode even makes fun of that exact premise. Overall, the character interactions and humor is great. It\'s kinda like ""One Punch Man"", you either understand it or not. Not for everyone, but still a great show and I highly recommend it to anyone that understands fujoshi or BL culture. wants to see the guys screw each other.

Everyone just likes the MC once she loses weight, alright. I found that really shallow, there was no real depth to it. I was not expecting a deep show, however, but I would have appreciated at least something.I would say that it was fun at...times and that I did laugh at quite a few scenes, but that was it.

It actually started fresh, promising the viewer to show something slightly different from what already exists but alas, it turned into the typical harem/ slice of life. It included almost all stereotypes one can think of. The Cultural festival, the beach episode, the scary episode, of course all the romance and drama, fair share of misunderstandings and fights in the group of protagonists etc etc...etc etc (does it sound familiar? Can bet few bells rang). In sense of story development, flow and setting it was disappointing, could not live up to my expectations especially with this high (MAL) score.That said, however, I didn't give it a 7 for nothing of course. What was quite well done here was the humor (tsukkomi) of the characters. It really had me laughing out loud on few occasions and giggling quite a lot (though not all jokes can be properly translated into English so they wouldn't strike as funny). The references to and parodies of other animes were adequate as well. The art was very pleasing and so was the voice actor selection (except for Kobayasi Yuu - I admit she fits the fujoshi role quite well, but after the unexplained transformation of the heroine, that image gradually started to fade and it just became unpleasant hearing her high pitched voice, just a personal preference of VAs but I think Sawano should have voiced the heroine).If I have to recommend anime to someone this will not be on my list of recs but if I'm asked if it's any good to watch, I would probably say if you want to waste time go for it, it's not bad, it's just I have already seen this pattern so many times and probably everyone else has too, so why bother watch something you already have watched.... etc etc (does it sound familiar?

I felt that a lot of the story may have been rushed as sometimes this happens with adaptions to ""keep up"" with the manga.

Usually, I\'m not a huge fan of harems, Kiss Him not Me captivated me due to its appealing colors and the characters. It\'s also very relatable for fujoshi! (I\'m not a fujoshi but I still found it relatable as an anime fan)STORY: 7The story is pretty typical for a reverse harem. Serinuma Kae is a fujoshi who starts out being overweight but then loses it all once she becomes depressed and locks herself up in her room after her favorite...character dies. After she loses weight, all of the cute guys that she ships together ends up falling in love with her and competing for her love. I\'m not a huge fan of a character\'s weight being the butt of the joke (which unfortunately happens in almost all anime) but the way each character interacts with Kae drives the story forward, which I really enjoyed.ART: 7The art was also typical for a shoujo anime. The characters and backgrounds are very colorful and pretty pleasing to look at. It\'s not the most gorgeous thing ever, but I was able to deal with it.SOUND: 6The opening was the most reverse harem thing (that\'s the only way I can describe it) I\'ve ever heard come from an anime. It\'s unfortunately also pretty catchy (it\'s stuck in my head as I speak). The ending song isn\'t super memorable and the BGM doesn\'t really stand out at all. The ending and opening songs are both fitting for the anime, so I\'ll give it that.CHARACTERS: 8All of the characters are extremely tropey, but I love Nishina and 6-senpai a lot so I\'m being extremely forgiving here. I\'m gonna rank them from best to worst (in my personal opinion)I personally consider Nanashima to be worst boy since there\'s literally nothing going for him other than the fact that he looks like Serinuma\'s favorite anime character. He\'s a pretty big jerk and one of the main people that forced Serinuma to lose weight when she gained it back (which is just... really? come on, man).Shinomiya is probably the most tropey one since he\'s supposed to be the obligatory shota. I love cute characters, so I couldn\'t let him be worst boy. He\'s not a jerk, unlike Nanashima. But at the same time, the shota characters usually aren\'t jerks so I wouldn\'t imagine him being one.Igarashi is a better version of Nanashima. He was one of the first ones to be straight forward about his crush on Serinuma. He also treated her somewhat ideally. I wasn\'t a huge fan of his character design, though.Mutsumi-senpai is infinitely better than the other three boys. I honestly question why there\'s competition between them to begin with. He\'s really nice to Serinuma, doesn\'t force her to lose weight, and is extremely accepting of her and her interests. Near the end (for reasons I won\'t say) he especially proves himself to be best boy of the series.And finally, there\'s Nishina, the only reason why I fully enjoyed this anime. I personally consider her to be best girl of the year because of how cool she is.One thing I really liked about this anime was how Nishina was treated like a proper member of this harem. None of the characters belittled her for being a girl pursuing Serinuma and saw her as an equally formidable competitor. A lot of people praised Yuri!!! on Ice this season for being progressive for same sex relationships, but at least (spoilers here oops) Nishina actually claimed that she loved (she said ""daisuki"" for goodness sake, unlike the other three inferior boys) Serinuma. There was no gay subtext or inferences or ""they don\'t have to say \'I love you\' for it to be love"" bs she was straight to the point and confessed her love. Definitely less queerbaiting than Yuri!!! on Ice IMO.ENJOYMENT: 9I genuinely enjoyed this anime for what it was. It was very fun to watch and it kinda made me feel like a middle schooler again (that wasn\'t a bad thing, by the way).This was a lot longer than I wanted it to be and I didn\'t mean to bring Yuri!!! on Ice into this, but I just needed to go into why I liked this anime.

I don't expect much excellent or quirky animation coming from a harem anime, but this one is so static and unmoving I felt bored watching it.The characters themselves are weak because no one seems to grow. There's no development, nothing urging me to stay and watch...more episodes. How the characters play off each other is pretty lame as well with repetitive dialogue and animation.

Will these guys be able to handle her personality, be able to accept that you have to love a person inside-in-out AND will Kae every fall in love with a real man? Art; The art was absolutely beautiful and hilarious at the same time! Brain\'s Base does some fantastic work. Sound; Typical upbeat music that can be found in any romance anime. Characters; Honestly, all the ""love interests"" that were given... were such SHIT HEADS, expect for the Asuma Mutsumi. I didn\'t really take Shima seriously the whole time, but even she was better then the other three options.Overall, the anime was cheesy, hurt in the right places and always made me howl when Kae went full Fujioshi on the guys (which was basically... every episode, haha)I wouldn\'t suggest this anime to anyone UNLESS they want a quick, typical ""Ahhh she\'s hot, and now we all want to date her"" anime.I will be picking up the manga in the future. I\'m crossing my fingers she actually ends up with one of the guys... and by one, I mean THE ONLY GUY who treated her like human being since the beginning... the sweet Asuma Mutsumi <3 everyone would still treat her the same once she goes back to school was A FAT CHANCE.

Go!Ok, so the art is great and each of the main cast has different aspects to each of their personalities that just makes them likeable and you see pretty equal amounts of each of them so viewers certainly have enough to see with whoever they ship the main heroine with (or with any other character!)Though I do wish that Kae\'s best friend A-chan had more screen time considering that she is, well, the MC\'s best friend and all. Bit odd that we only see...her in small intervals and that Kae only spends time with the ""harem"".Though I usually dislike the whole weight loss cliche I do like some aspects of how this one was handled (just in case any future viewers are avoiding watching for that reason) -1 - The weight loss was completely unintentional and it doesn\'t affect whatsoever the way in which the MC lives her life.2 - Before her change Kae wasn\'t bullied about her weight which is a trope often seen that I\'m very glad was not in this.3 - Someone is called out on the fact that they only started liking the MC after she lost the weight and is made to reflect on that.All in all this is a good comedy anime that is light-hearted and doesn\'t take itself too seriously, so if you\'re looking for a strong plot I\'m afraid you\'re not going to find it here. I\'d recommend this anime for people who like fanservice (there are pretty boys AND girls, though definitely more boys) and people who just want something easy to watch and have a bit of a laugh. Also I have a feeling that if you like visual novels (as I do) you will also probably find yourself liking this!Hope this little review helps!(Also Mutsumi-Senpai is the best - Fight Me.)(NOT A SPOILER BUT COULD BE THOUGHT OF AS ONE SO READ BELOW AT OWN RISK)HOWEVER one reason why people might not like this anime as it\'s why I unfortunately had to knock down the rating from and 8 to a 7 is that if you are a romance lover as I am this anime has what can be thought of as an open ending and no actual conclusion pairing. her in small intervals and that Kae only spends time with the ""harem"".Though I usually dislike the whole weight loss cliche I do like some aspects of how this one was handled (just in case any future viewers are avoiding watching for that reason) -1 - The weight loss was completely unintentional and it doesn\'t affect whatsoever the way in which the MC lives her life.2 - Before her change Kae wasn\'t bullied about her weight which is a trope often seen that I\'m very glad was not in this.3 - Someone is called out on the fact that they only started liking the MC after she lost the weight and is made to reflect on that.All in all this is a good comedy anime that is light-hearted and doesn\'t take itself too seriously, so if you\'re looking for a strong plot I\'m afraid you\'re not going to find it here.

The romance aspect of the series is average, partly because of Kae's addiction to merchandise, making her character uninteresting to fans of the genre. There's many tropes in this show when it comes to episode locations and events, but it's worth watching for shoujo fans, as the competition between the guys is intense, but professional and peaceful at the same time.Art 6/10 -- I'm not a real fan of Brain's Base, and the art seems like it would come from an anime 10 years ago...rather then late 2016. The character design isn't that unique, but props to the guys that make the comedic faces in the series. Not a lot of visible mistakes to my eyes, however the series backgrounds lacked detail from my perspective.Sound 7/10 -- Acting was average, music also average.Character 8/10 -- Even though the character design was average, I actually enjoyed the growth of some characters in this series. Yuusuke learns quickly that not everything is based off looks. Nozomu and Hayato are both naive but earn maturity points while they spend time with Kae. Shima and Asuma are probably my favorite characters, as I like Asuma's quiet but cool mannerism, and Shima's loyalty to who her friend was from the beginning. Kae seems awkward as a reverse harem protagonist, but her obsession with BL makes her character unique, and it shys away from the harem genre and makes it more amusing as a comedy.Enjoyment 7/10 -- I think what's most enjoyable is the boys passion for trying to win Kae over, mixed with Kae's and Shimas hot topic of seeing the boys together. The two different agendas blend well together to make an interesting series to watch. The facial expressions are golden, but certain characters definitely leave more impression then others. I think the first half is better then the second half as well, as you realize that the story seems to slow down after midway.Overall 7/10 -- Reverse Harem and Shoujo are two genres I don't watch a lot. However being new to both, I found this anime to be amusing. It's not as great as Ouran Host Club, but I believe this anime can't be compared to that one fairly. This anime is mid tier for people that are stocking up on plan two watch lists. Even though i'm giving this series a 7 overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this series to romance fans, as it's more of a comedy aimed at girls rather then a romantic show.~Castawayz rather then late 2016.

Also the anime had a lot of funny moments.BUT the whole concept is wrong!A girl is fat, so boys either ignore her or are mean towards her. Then she suddenly loses weight, and the same boys start to be very interested in her. The whole anime is about them being interested in her, spending time together and so on....But honestly, I wouldn't want to spend time with someone who is nice to me only because I'm attractive.In my opinion she should have enough self-esteem to say no to jerks who are only after her looks, and doesn't care about her personality.Moving forward, given that she didn't say no, and they indeed spend so much time together you'd think there is a room for change. The boys should realize looks aren't everything and like her for who she is.Not a chance.Although one boy says he realized just that, his actions speak oppositely. They go with her to anime conventions and historical adventures, and hate it all the way. They hate things she is interested in, so you tell me if they like her for her personality.For most episodes we get to watch funny moments of a group of friends, only we are constantly remained they aren't really friends. The boys don't like each other. They hang out together only because they don't want to leave one of them  alone with this girl, which I think  is really sad.To be fair there are two characters that don't mach this description, as they liked the girl even when she was fat, and they share her interests. But unfortunately that doesn't change anything.<beginning slight spoiler>I thought in this anime the girl will come to realize which characters like her for who she is, choose them or one of them, and leave other jerks alone, but that's not what happened.<spoiler end>To sum up, the plot is terrible, but I can't deny I laughed a lot, so if you don't mind the story, you can watch it just for laughs.

So because of that fact I can\'t compare this to others in the genera but regardless, I wish to give my two cents on the show in question.The show ""Kiss Him, Not Me"" is a reverse harem comedy with a very intriguing gimmick. I trust that before reading this you read the show\'s synopsis. And so as she becomes ungodly beautiful, she in turn attracts lots of guys (and a girl) and despite being surrounded by all these people who are in love with her beauty, only wants them to...be in love with each other, Hence the title. And so her boylove passions collide with a set a pretty boys attempting to woo her and as such, highjinks insue.So lets take a paragraph and talk about our fujoshi hero. She is so damb good looking. Somthing about her more appealing to relatable girl audience apperance is really attractive. The lovely purple hair, the earings, the make-up and the outfits are really beautiful. Not only does she look unique but from what I\'ve heard. Her personality is also very different from most reverse harems. From what I\'ve heard most reverse harem protagonist are boring slates to which the veiwer (your generic girl I guess) is to project herself onto. In KHNM our heroin has a waterfall of personality with more to bottle and ship to stores. She has things she likes and enjoys, things she dislikes and people she cares about. Generally we see her show her caring towards the rest of the main cast.The rest of our main cast consists of the four pretty boys and the pretty girl. Because I\'m terrible with names I\'ll be calling each by their archetype. The first one is your strong boy. He\'s strong and cares much for the main girl. But that\'s as far as he goes. He looks normal, black short hair and a plain face. Easily the most forgettable. Next is blonde badboy. He\'s got more going on. He\'s protective of the one\'s he cares about. Ignores everyone he doesn\'t. He has an imouto (little sister) he cares about and does whatever possible to make her happy. And is very straightforward with what he wants. Next is the wimpy yet smart kid. He\'s well, kinda the wimp character that only wants to be like the strong protective type like the previous two. But in the end is the second most boring character as well as the most annoying character. Next is the weird nice guy that at the start doesn\'t even want to date the main girl but eventually progresses to like her. He has a longer face and brown hair. He\'s interesting and fun, is mysterious is some ways and is all round the least shallow and most good natured guy in the cast. And finally, the girl who vies for our protaganist affection as well. She is a rich girl who fills the rolls of a fujoshi friend and a potential love interest to our main girl. She is fun to watch as she gushes about boylove both as an admirer and as someone who creates it through drawing. Personally I think she was best love interest but that\'s me.These are our characters now what kind of story do they inhabit? Well the story is really a collection of goofy cenarios revolving around our heroin\'s hobbies such as comiket or traveling to a historic place where an anime took place. Each episode is usually a different situation, with the goal of each love interest scoring points in the form of building affection with the heroin. Some are quite funny while others kinda suck. Without spoilers the anime doesn\'t give a full resalution to the story. At least not in a satisfying way.Now as for the music I can\'t tell you anything. Music probably wasn\'t that good cuz I can\'t remember any of it. Meanwhile the op has some funny gags and is very good at showing how good looking the characters are. The ed had a cool slideshow esc thing where the main girl would be in different cute outfits. As the op and ed music. Not memorable.The animation was your basic on the budget animation. Nothing astounding or unique. The character designs were very much ""pretty"". Very much exaggerating how beautiful these men and women are. Artyle on the other and was also not very impresive otherwise. But the show is not about the visual spectical. Its about the gags and character interactions.My closing thoughts are that this show was surprisingly entertaining despite it\'s genera and my general taste. Meaning that this might be one of if not the best of it\'s kind. If your into the reverse harem genera than I highly recomend this. Personally : 6/10 be in love with each other, Hence the title.

I have no interest in BL.But I did enjoy this anime especially the comedy part of it. Serinuma, Kae a girl with two sides, a kind and timid side and her fujoshi side are portrayed really well by Yuu Kobayashi(Voice of Sasha Blouse from Attack on Titan). With 4 generic prince type characters we get a mix of crazy, funny and romantic scenes. Seeing how Serinuma interacts with each of the characters is really interesting and fun, especially when we see the boys ""interact"" with each other as seen in the eyes of Serinuma.They...also added a handsome girl into the fray which just made things all the more funnier and awesome. The flow of the anime is also really good giving each guy in the harem an arc of 1-3 episode. Each guy in its own way fell in love with Serinuma even though most of them at first they only liked her looks and body.The downside to this anime is the story and some of its characters. Like most anime who have a harem genre some characters don\'t give a good reason for falling in love with the main character most of the guys in the group fell in love with Serinuma because of her looks although some may have redeemed themselves later on but they don\'t expand on why and how.I would have given this anime a higher score if it gave a good reason as to why each character liked or even loved Serinuma and an overall goal to the story. But I cannot deny as to how much I laughed at their gags and other stuff and when the Shoujo parts come in I can\'t help but giggle like a girl because of how cute Serinuma\'s reactions are.Overall if you like Comedy, A bit of BL, or even harem you will like this anime. And you might also fall in love with the main character. also added a handsome girl into the fray which just made things all the more funnier and awesome.

I just wanted watch this series because there\'s a scene fat mc turns into cute bon kyuin bon girl :)). I expected lot but In fact i couldn\'t get why she turned into that as logical way... that was disappointing. Author could\'ve made it better if he had more experience expect BL manga settings. Nah whatever, it\'d be good dessert for fans of BL. But it was not bad for me.Story is good. But author destroyed main key point at...first place. Why she turned into cute girl... if it explained with logical way it could turned this series to great one. But it just buried in the ground.Art was normal. Characters movements were normal. Background was lonely.At early episodes character\'s voices it didn\'t stick to my ears. But it stick later. Op, ed were normal but osts were better.I didn\'t liked mc girl.In fact this anime\'s main genre was romance Mutsumi could be main heroine. I liked him.(for his role)Others were fine.It wasn\'t bad.

A reverse-harem anime, a first for me. And I must admit that it was slightly better than I was expecting it to be. For starters we have Kae, a chubby, 'fujoshi' lover who drool's over two guys dating, and a crazy otaku. But one day, one of her most precious anime guys dies and she shuts herself out from the world for a few days. Then magic happens as she realizes that she's no longer a chubby mess, yet a cute, stereotypical girl with some redeeming factors. Thus follows...a band of your standard, typical guys who all find her to be wildly attractive and go out of their ways to try and win her over. As you can see, this show is littered with cliches, but that's not too bad in this case.I like a show that can entertain me enough to the point where the cliches kinda go away. And wildly enough there were quite a few moments that made me laugh.As for the sound and art, it's all very fair. Nothing too good, nothing too bad. Just what you would expect out of a show of this stature. I must admit that the voice acting was quite good though (subbed).So overall I'd say that it's worth a watch if all you are looking for is some good, wholesome entertainment with nothing more around the bones. I will only recommend this anime to someone who is a die-hard fan of harem anime, or someone who just wants to be amused. a band of your standard, typical guys who all find her to be wildly attractive and go out of their ways to try and win her over.

It's about a closet otaku girl that loves BL mangas. So all you peeps out there freaking out because you don't want to see boy on boy action rest assured.The beggining of the series is about how shallow we all were back in school days. Lets be honest we all tried our best to get along with the popular guys, or the good looking people. If you managed to find mutual interests and or had good chemistry you'll tag along for the rest of your Junior High or high school period....If there's no compatibility or you just get treated like dirt you move on to a different circle. Having stated it, yes, a couple of the guys didn't treat Kae with proper respect due to her appearance, and that completely changes when she becomes slim and noticeable. The good thing is that once Kae gains weight, all of the guys try to help her get back for her own sake, but also find out that they love kae no matter her appearance. No, the series isn't going to win the best humanitarian message award, it's not so bad is it? afterall it's a very light romance/friendship kind of series.The characters are simple and likeable, non of them are complex or entireable relatable, in fact some of them are archtypes of other romance/comedy series. Again, that's not bad at all, since it's a light romance/comedy series.We got Kae, the Fujoshi otaku closet girl, who is very shy when it comes to speaking to guys even after she gets her change appareance. Igarashi the though decisive athletic guy. Nanashima or Nana, the hothead. Mutsumi the mild kind hearted guy and Shino the younger nicer guy. And there's also Shima the boyish looking girl who can do pretty much anything. Yep all 5 of them will try to win Kae's hearth by trampling each other. I said earlier that all of the characters were pretty likeable, but I'll have to be honest and say that Misha is just ludicrous as it is, being a rich girl, fashion oriented, straight forward, profesional self published mangaka.The art is very faithful to the manga, and that's a good thing. It goes almost by the book to the old shojo manga designs, girls with big bright eyes, long eyelashes, lovely pinkish lips, and slender figure. Although it's kinda odd that Kae managed to get a bigger bust size compared to the rest of the girls in the series, mostly for comic relief on the cliched stumble jokes. The guys are pretty much what girls like, slender and a tad muscular on most of them.The backgrounds are pretty plain and single colored, not so bad since most of the plot happens in school grounds.The weakest point could be music is almost non existant or at least nothing remarkable.The fun factor is probably it's best asset, you'll always want to see Misha and Kae taunting the boys and pulling pictures of them in awkward BL situations wich they don't enjoy at all.If you enjoy like light romance/comedy series, no brainer required, this is one you should watch.

Although it's kinda odd that Kae managed to get a bigger bust size compared to the rest of the girls in the series, mostly for comic relief on the cliched stumble jokes. The guys are pretty much what girls like, slender and a tad muscular on most of them.The backgrounds are pretty plain and single colored, not so bad since most of the plot happens in school grounds.The weakest point could be music is almost non existant or at least nothing remarkable.The fun factor is probably it's best asset, you'll always want to see Misha and Kae taunting the boys and pulling pictures of them in awkward BL situations wich they don't enjoy at all.If you enjoy like light romance/comedy series, no brainer required, this is one you should watch."", 'Many of us can relate to this otaku friend. The main character Kae is an ordinary girl who\'s an otaku. Actually, she\'s a pure fujoshi, which means she\'s very obcessed with anything BL in anime world.""Watashi ga Motete Dousunda"" aka. ""Kiss Him, Not Me""... For a first impression, the story didn\'t disappoint me at all. The comedy is infinite, which means is fun to watch from the very first episode to the last one. I personaly think that whoever tries watching this anime ""Watashi ga Motete Dousunda"" will NOT be disapointed at all, I can guarantee that, however... be aware that this may show a...little yaoi in some parts, but I think you shouldn\'t be bothered by it cuz the whole anime will be focussed more in comedy and the fight to win Kae\'s heart.The jokes about anime will make you laugh like, ""Hey, that\'s-"" or ""Where have I seen this reference from?"". You will get the idea once you try and see what I was talking about. It\'s super fun to watch!About the boys... no offence, but I think they are an eye sore, except for Mutsumi which did like Kae before she got thin. Mutsumi, for me, is the only one for Kae, a pure heart angel, the most genuine boy I saw in this entire anime. little yaoi in some parts, but I think you shouldn\'t be bothered by it cuz the whole anime will be focussed more in comedy and the fight to win Kae\'s heart.The jokes about anime will make you laugh like, ""Hey, that\'s-"" or ""Where have I seen this reference from?"".

They are more likely ""strangely enough"" attract peoples attention ""mostly females"" because of how hot their bodies look or their stereotypical personalities are. Strangely, this show is straight and it\'s weird, but it works.I had to tip my hat for the creators of this show (most importantly the manga where they got they resources from), I think people in both genders can watch this show, sure,...it\'s meant for women as they say, but that sounds like an excuse for not actively making creative work, instead, being lazy and provide jokes that women can only understand. If you would have a show only meant for boys or girls, then I don\'t think it would deserve so much credit if it really excuses why the opposite gender couldn\'t enjoy as much as the actual gender do.This review will be over the Plot, The Animation, Sound, Characters, and its Flaws that it had.Plot: This plot wasn\'t so much interesting if you were to discuss it on paper, which I am. You have a chubby woman named Kae, and she is an Otaku who is strongly into Yaoi and fantasizing her classmates being couples. Then a tragedy happens, one of her favorite characters, Shion (yes you will have to remember this stupid character), gets killed off of the show, and she gets over dramatic and shuts herself out for about a week, with no food or water. Finally, her family gets her out of her senses, but suddenly, Kae lost a lot of weight, and pretty much looks a model (the anime side, not my side, I only see a drawing on paper).Now, excusing my plot explanation for a disclaimer, this logic of not eating or drinking anything for a week is obviously for comedic purposes, and it is what got peoples attention, and you can see why it did. This logic obviously doesn\'t work, but it\'s more like, ""Eh, it\'s a cartoon, let it do what it wants."" Anyway, back to the plot.Because she looks hotter than ever, she attracts many sorts of attention, she attracts a male that makes fun of her weight, she attracts a male that tries to forgive himself for his friends sake of making fun of weight, and finally, she attracts a male that seemed awfully rude to her, even when she was injured. Not to mention she has a male friend that talked to her, even before she lost her weight. Now everywhere she goes, she always has 4 male friends with her, including a female that later joins the roster.Obviously, all these characters has feelings for her, except one, because he is an air head that only hung out. I\'ll describe about these characters later. There isn\'t much of the plot anymore, other than short sub plots in each episode, they want to date Kae, that\'s all.The Animation: I liked it how they manage to pull peoples attention by turning a fat person into a super model by shutting yourself, but they don\'t express the animation so much. Sometimes you get bored of a scene, and looked at what the other people are doing because you got bored looking at the main characters, but they don\'t do anything but freeze where they are and don\'t do anything. Sometimes they have decent animation I can give credit for, even the ones that are doing the animation for humor, other times it\'s just lazy. Every time, when Kae has a ""special"" moment to say, it\'s all glitterly, sparkly, and pink, and it gets old after the 6 time they used it in the first episode, I get that it\'s suppose to visualize how men see it, but it doesn\'t excuse why they use it in every 3 minutes whenever she smiles.The Sound: This music track does have some good musical background for the atmosphere that catches your ear, but most of it is bland and isn\'t noticeable.The Characters: I think the characters carried on the show quite well, it\'s the only real reason why I did. Overall, most of these characters did deliver some good humor and dialogue to follow, but only for half of the show.Kae: Kae is a otaku, yaoi fan who loves to fantasizes men as couples. She is very kind to people, is quite shy at times, and doesn\'t express much of love, but appreciation. This is a good character you could understand and like, especially the humor she delivers, you don\'t have to be a yaoi to understand, you could just hear what she says and think it\'s ridiculous, but then realize that some people actually think like that. I liked this character, and I don\'t think we can have a yaoi fan that can be annoying again for awhile, at least I think that is the case.Yuusuke: This character is bland and boring, you can understand his relationship easily, but he isn\'t interesting. He is just kind and athletic, he does display a little bit of character trying to steal a chance to be alone with Kae, but that\'s all you get out of him. He does deliver good dialogue that makes him funny, but it doesn\'t really display his personality.Nozomu: He is just temperamental and wants to date Kae for looks. Also he is good with kids.Hayato: He is a bit of a coward, childish, clumsy, and he doesn\'t do anything for the show except one episode. Now those qualities doesn\'t make him a bad character, however, this show fails to display this character, rather, he is just put in just for his personality and stereotype, I didn\'t get a laugh out of him which is disappointing, and he doesn\'t do anything remarkable. Therefore, he is the lamest character out of this roster.Asmua: He is just an air head, who is also kind, gentle, caring, and a bit weird. He is, however, protective, and gets serious when someone picks on Kae.Shima: A female who is also wants to date Kae, she stands out more than Hayato does. She is rich, well-known from a lot of people (which is hardly mentioned) talented with drawing and creating mangas (about yaoi). Finally, she is a hardcore fan of yaoi.Other characters: They just play their part.The Flaws: While I do credit for its humor and characters, it does a few things wrong, for example, one episode (for japanese) plays the music loud enough that you can barley make what the the characters are saying, sure, in subtitles you can easily know what they are saying by reading it, but think about people that went through that don\'t read the subtitles and understand the language, that would be a problem. The beginning wasn\'t the most exciting part because it only focuses on having a crush on Kae, but when you get to episode 3, you will see the charm it gives away, but by episode 8, it loses that charm and goes back being bland.Conclusion: I was just surprised that it was good, it completely changes my opinion about how a show about yaoi could be boring and goes no where, but yet, this show proves that it could be entertaining in the right elements. I think it deserves the credit that is given to us, and hopefully you, the audience, agrees.I give it a 6/10, if the ending didn\'t end with a joke that had a serious topic on top of it, then I would give this a 7, oh well, I got some laughs out of the show, and that\'s what matters. it\'s meant for women as they say, but that sounds like an excuse for not actively making creative work, instead, being lazy and provide jokes that women can only understand.

Listen, you need to know going into this that it\'s meant to be cliche. Like, the whole point of the anime is to throw every yaoi and reverse harem cliche it can at you.

It\'s just the type of art style I like. Pretty colors, refined character designs, and good environments. Also, this anime is funny as hell. Especially if you can relate to the type of anime viewer/fan the main character is. I...think the premise of the series comes across really well; it pulled off what it wanted to.The characters, as well, were all very fun to watch together.

Running off during a storm, getting into some trouble, hot springs scene, beach episode, etc. The male characters are also somewhat cliche, though the tropes were fun and served a purpose....If you\'re coming into this show hoping for some BL/Yaoi, there are only moments, and are much to the displeasure of the male harem hahaha! All in all, a fun little show that\'s worth the watch if you have time. Its cute and funny, gives me some Ouran Highschool Host Club vibes, though Ouran is definitely a more plot driven show. I\'m hoping for a season two! Rooting for Mutsumi senpai! If you\'re coming into this show hoping for some BL/Yaoi, there are only moments, and are much to the displeasure of the male harem hahaha!

As a fudanshi, i found it easy to relate to the main character which added to my enjoyment, so I highly recommend this anime to any fudanshi or fujoshi friends out there (Despite this being a harem anime). That said, those who aren\'t into yaoi might get turned off by the fact that the mc is a MASSIVE fujoshi, but don\'t disregard it that easily. Most anime fans, whether they be yaoi fans or not, should still fairly get a good laugh out of it. The humor is fairly clever and isn\'t dragged out and...works with the story.Comedy aside, the anime does take some time out of the ""haha he fell onto her boob"" moments to  flesh out the characters, which is always good. One thing I don\'t like is how the MC doesn\'t really change and can get kinda annoying, and spoiler alert, kinda ruins the ending. However that can be ignored as her over the top fujoshi personality creates most of the comedy.One thing i love about this anime is how it breaks out of the standard harem anime mold. The MC actually has a personality, and the story isn\'t dragged out by infuriating moments like accidentally peeping on the girls or falling on a girl\'s chest. The characters are genuinely good and can relate to a lot of them.Overall I\'d recommend to this to anyone who wants a quick laugh or fluffy romance.(dont expect too much romance as this is a harem anime haha) works with the story.Comedy aside, the anime does take some time out of the ""haha he fell onto her boob"" moments to  flesh out the characters, which is always good.

The characters aren't bad, but don't change much and are very stereotypical. However, I personally loved the show and was laughing the whole time. It may not be a masterpiece, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not a show to watch for character development or complex plot and philosophy. It's just a show to laugh at and enjoy, and that's perfectly fine.The site wants me to write a longer review so I'll just spam a bit, don't mind me, the rest is irrelevant.El Tratado de Versalles fue un tratado de paz que se firmó...en dicha ciudad al final de la Primera Guerra Mundial por más de cincuenta países.1\u200b Este tratado terminó oficialmente con el estado de guerra entre la Alemania del segundo Reich y los Aliados de la Primera Guerra Mundial. Fue firmado el 28 de junio de 1919 en la Galería de los Espejos del palacio de Versalles, exactamente cinco años después del atentado de Sarajevo en el que fue asesinado el archiduque Francisco Fernando, (en alemán: Franz Ferdinand) la causa directa de la Primera Guerra Mundial. A pesar de que el armisticio fue firmado meses antes (11 de noviembre de 1918) para poner fin a las hostilidades en el campo de batalla, se necesitaron seis meses de negociaciones en la Conferencia de Paz de París para concluir el tratado de paz. El Tratado de Versalles entró en vigor el 10 de enero de 1920.De las muchas disposiciones del tratado, una de las más importantes y controvertidas estipulaba que las Potencias Centrales (Alemania y sus aliados) aceptasen toda la responsabilidad moral y material de haber causado la guerra y, bajo los términos de los artículos 231-248,2\u200b deberían desarmarse, realizar importantes concesiones territoriales a los vencedores y pagar exorbitantes indemnizaciones económicas a los Estados victoriosos. El Tratado de Versalles fue socavado tempranamente por acontecimientos posteriores a partir de 1922 y fue ampliamente violado en Alemania en los años treinta con la llegada al poder de Adolf Hitler.Alemania liquidó el pago de las reparaciones de guerra en 1983, pero todavía quedaba pendiente el abono de los intereses generados desde la aprobación del tratado, que ascendían a 125 millones de euros (cambio de 2010). Dichos intereses no podían ser abonados hasta que Alemania no estuviese reunificada, dándosele para ello 20 años a partir de ese momento. Por aquellos días se creía que nunca iban a ser abonados, pero, tras procederse a la reunificación del país, se fijó el 3 de octubre de 1990 como fecha de inicio de esos 20 años.

It had a great art style, nice animation, good voice acting, and a nice story. Really, it's just a fun nice story.The story? No spoilers here, but it's not disappointing and well, I guess it's a bit too honest for some? Yes, a girl will be more liked by everyone when she is not a whale. And yes, girls do like guys who look decent. It's basic biology/nature, nothing to be surprised or be ashamed about. Heck, this show might as well just give you...the motivation to lose a few pounds if it offended you, haha. Seriously, it can never hurt to be fit.

It's not supposed to be realistic. Yes, her voice totally changed after she lost weight and she became the definition of y/n (you'll know what I mean if you go on wattpad/ao3).However, even though I haven't finished it yet, I'm really enjoying this anime. The theme song is fun, the boys' personalities vary, and there are lots of laughs. Each boy has a different personality and characteristics: one is rowdy and thinks highly of himself, one is quiet and respectful, one is a bishonen tsundere, and one is... basically prince aladdin? I think...you're supposed to relate to the main girl (Kae), as she's an otaku and likes hot guys, but:Even after all the comedy and cuteness, I find that the anime is promoting unhealthy beauty standards. Lots of girls are uncomfortable with their body shape, no matter what it looks like. I bet lots of girls wish they could wake up after a week and look completely different and have boys/girls gushing all over them. Younger girls might think that if they do this, they will have this too. Now, that's a very small possibility that girls would think that but this anime IS putting that idea out there.Lastly, the idea of fujoshis is taken very far. In a way, it's kind of taken to a level where it becomes pervertish. Different fujoshis act differently, and don't all act the same way. Before I started this anime, I thought that Kae was the type of girl who'd just read yaoi manga and shipped characters and such, but that was not the case. She ships the boys in her school, which I feel isn't a bad thing unless they know about the ship, if that makes sense? It's just that she gets all gross about it when any sort of homoerotic thing happens, and instead of acting normal and just fangirling in her head, she gets all drooly and NOBODY SEEMS TO NOTICE.That's what irks me about this anime, but its' pros outweigh the cons.

If I could rate it 0, I would. I don\'t understand how there are people that enjoy this anime.Right off the bat, the whole story is that the main girl is fat (therefore, unattractive), then starves herself because her favourite character died and suddenly becomes skinny (therefore, attractive), and all the boys in school are into her. So if only the young girls watching this just Starve themselves, they\'ll Finally completely change their appearance and be Attractive (which, of course, you can\'t be if you\'re fat).And as if this isn\'t ridiculous...enough, this isn\'t the main plot. It\'s only the begginning. As the title ""Kiss him, not me"" suggests, the main girl is a fujoshi that fetishizes gay people in real-life, and ships her real, actual, human boy classmates with eachother, and desperately wants them to get together.Not a single redeeming quality.

It has a great story arc, it challenges fat bias, it explores sexual objectification and obsession vs real love and it demonstrates being confident in who you are in a world that is antagonistic to you and your passions.It also teaches about sexual assault and how it is depicted in romantic novels is not reflective of how people feel in real life. Serinuma is assaulted by Nozomu. She compares her assault to a similar event that occurred in a romantic novel and comments how she liked it as the reader, but didn\'t like experiencing it. The assault hampers her...relationship with Nozomu but also makes her afraid of touch by ANYONE.For those who are commenting that the girl treats every guy like crap in this anime really don\'t understand this anime at all.Yes it is a reverse harem but she has different relationships with each of the men.Mutsumi is clearly the friend who has a special bond with her. He was the only person to recognize her and accept her for who she was BEFORE she lost weight. He takes interest in the things she likes and she takes interest in the things he likes.Serinuma treats his wounds when he is injured in the first episode. She continues to show kindness and caring for each of the guys in her life in differing ways, despite many of them treating her like she wasn\'t human before she got thin. Like when she got injured she was accused of faking it and made to leave for another student who was thin. Yet she is always kind and respectful.People who have an issue with this anime are those that expect her to ""put out"". They think that because she isn\'t reciprocating the feelings of the guys she is with, that she is being rude. THAT IS ABSURD. She doesn\'t need to be sexually involved with ANY of the romantic interests to be classified as kind to them.She has NO experience with love. She might even be ace. She doesn\'t owe the men she is with romantic relationships just because they flock over her. She is kind to them and does nice things for them even though they didn\'t even register her as a human being before she gets skinny.Ironically regardless of her weight, she gets dehumanized into an object by most of the romantic leads. They want to possess her, not love her. They split up time with her without asking what SHE wants. Of the group, every man on the date at the school fair with her ""takes"" something from her. Only Matsumi ""gives"" something to her by feeding her.This is a show that exposes not only the inhumanity of the characters towards fat people but also the audience. When she becomes fat again, you feel yourself wanting her to get skinny because we too have the bias against overweight people. When she is just as valid being chubby and just as loveable. It stretches you to see her through Matsumi\'s eyes, the eyes of man who truly loves her.Also spoiler alert:She ends up marrying Matsumi in the manga. When she gets pregnant with their baby, she gains weight. Their son later points to a picture of his mom when she is chubby and asks who it is. Mastumi replies it is his mom. The boy says, no that can\'t be her! Mastumi smiles and says, she changed a little to protect you inside of her. But she is still the same person. He truly is the only one who loves her as a person and NOT a sexual object. That is why he wins out. That is why he is never jealous of her. He only wants what is best for her and what makes HER happy, even if it isn\'t him. And she comes to love him with the same selfless love.

Well it does follow a lot of the similar tropes your standard shoujo ai anime series does, but there is still a little bit of a twist.Kei Serinuma is a fujoshi who is obsessed with anime and manga, especially BL and yaoi. She\'s so obsessed with this that she actually starts shipping real people like her classmates together. Now of course the majority of otaku are not actually like this, but I thought this was an interesting concept to explore. It definitely beats the standard nice girl has a group of guys who all like her, and...that\'s the plot.Despite the series only being 12 episodes long, each character does get their moment in the spotlight. They also seem to be more developed than most characters you see in this genre. Although they could still be given a lot more depth, they are not just completely blank slates and are pretty memorable. The problem is there isn\'t really any chemistry between Kei and the people trying to pursue her.The four boys are completely uninterested in Kei at the start (due to the fact she is fat and not aesthetically appealing) but as soon as she loses weight they notice her because of how pretty she is. Since the four boys do have their own personalities and interests, I was expecting them all to find an actual reason by the end of the series to like Kei other than ""wow, she\'s so pretty!"" but that doesn\'t really happen. None of them seem to have much common ground with her, and they all seem to find her otaku obsession annoying and just a thing they have to put up with. I think out of all the boys Mutsumi probably has the most reason to like her, because there is a little bit of overlap in their shared love of history, but still there doesn\'t seem to be that much chemistry between them.The one girl who wants to pursue her, Nishina Shima, definitely seems to have the most reason to actually like her. They have a shared love of anime and manga and seem to have a lot in common. It\'s even revealed in a flashback that Shima actually took an interest in Kei before she lost weight. Shima seems to be the only character who likes her for her personality.Despite the lack of chemistry between characters, I still found this series enjoyable. The art style is beautiful, and a lot of the humour and comedy is incredibly funny. It\'s one of those series that you shouldn\'t take too seriously and just enjoy the wacky adventures. I think this is probably a series otaku will enjoy more because a lot of the humour comes from poking fun at fan culture like anime conventions, fanfiction writing, shipping characters etc.As for the ending, predicatably Kei ends up not making a decision and doesn\'t choose any of them. This is pretty standard for this kind of series so I never really expected her to choose someone. But apart from that, there isn\'t any massive glaring plotholes that are never answered.I would recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a lighthearted funny series to pass the time. Just don\'t focus on the romance aspect too much. that\'s the plot.Despite the series only being 12 episodes long, each character does get their moment in the spotlight.

I think out of all the boys Mutsumi probably has the most reason to like her, because there is a little bit of overlap in their shared love of history, but still there doesn\'t seem to be that much chemistry between them.The one girl who wants to pursue her, Nishina Shima, definitely seems to have the most reason to actually like her. They have a shared love of anime and manga and seem to have a lot in common. It\'s even revealed in a flashback that Shima actually took an interest in Kei before she lost weight. Shima seems to be the only character who likes her for her personality.Despite the lack of chemistry between characters, I still found this series enjoyable. The art style is beautiful, and a lot of the humour and comedy is incredibly funny. It\'s one of those series that you shouldn\'t take too seriously and just enjoy the wacky adventures. I think this is probably a series otaku will enjoy more because a lot of the humour comes from poking fun at fan culture like anime conventions, fanfiction writing, shipping characters etc.As for the ending, predicatably Kei ends up not making a decision and doesn\'t choose any of them. This is pretty standard for this kind of series so I never really expected her to choose someone. But apart from that, there isn\'t any massive glaring plotholes that are never answered.I would recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a lighthearted funny series to pass the time. Just don\'t focus on the romance aspect too much.', 'A HILARIOUS ANIME WITH INTERESTING PERSPECTIVEThis anime is ideal for those up to date with the current anime/manga culture, trends, and overall fandom. The main character Kae is a high school girl obsessed with anime. She in particular, is obsessed with the Boy Love genre and shipping male characters together. The entire anime is not only incredibly funny, but represents what the now ""USUAL"" girl watching anime is like.The characters developed pretty well for a 12-Episode anime and are more interesting than the main lead Kae, that is me being honest. They grew to be likable.The ending stayed true to overall theme of the...series. Although it does not have that nice cliche ending to make you happy, it does have you consider these are the mentality of your anime girls today series.

Any hardcore Otaku or Weeb will strongly relate to the main girl (Kae). I loved her from the first episode.Kae is a girl consumed with a love of manga, anime, and visual novels where hot guys fall in love with each other. As a result, she likes to fantasize about the hot boys at school getting into lovey dovey situations. Also she is fat, so the hot boys don't pay attention to her, which she is perfectly fine with. But one day (slight spoiler, I...guess??? not giving away anything major) she is at home watching her favorite anime when suddenly something tragic happens to her favorite anime boy! Now this anime boy was totally her waifu btw. She has all the collectible stuff and cardboard cut outs for this character. So naturally, she is devastated when calamity befalls upon him. She locks herself in her room and refuses to eat, sleep, or go to school for a whole week. Finally her mother forces her to get out of bed and to everyone's surprise, she has lost all the excess weight and looks soups Kawaii! Now all the hot boys at school notice her and try to woo her, but she much rather watch them fall in love with each other! Thus comedy ensues!I highly recommend it!

I have NEVER laughed OUT LOUD so hard watching an anime before, consistently at almost every episode. I am not at all a fan of boy love, but this show makes it *extreamly* bearable.I’m only up to ep. 7, so I cant speak for the storyline just yet, BUT I can tell they're trying to go somewhere- and it looks promising. Honestly even if they weren't, and it was just a bunch of random episodes that have...nothing in common other than the main plot- I wouldn't care- it's just that good.**Edit**After completing this show, I may be a fan of BL now! 😄😄😄I need a season 2 and I’m highly upset it’s taking so long (if it ever comes). nothing in common other than the main plot- I wouldn't care- it's just that good.**Edit**After completing this show, I may be a fan of BL now! 😄😄😄I need a season 2 and I’m highly upset it’s taking so long (if it ever comes)."", ""There were a lot of things I really liked about Kiss Him, Not Me. Some expected, and others that pleasantly surprised me.I think Kae herself is a good example. On one hand, she's pretty much what we were promised. A crazed fujoshi fangirl who can't quite separate her love for fictional characters from her everyday real life. But at the same time, there was more to her than that. I found her to be quite likable. She was generally a very kind and caring person, passionate about various issues when she saw them. (Spurred on by the Saturday-morning cartoon sort of justice that's been...instilled in her throughout the years.) And she was capable of interacting with her classmates as real people. I guess it just felt a little... refreshing. I'm used to seeing otaku characterized as being so socially awkward that they can't even function on a day-to-day basis. The only time Kae really fits that bill is when she's face-to-face with her new friends' romantic intentions. As the series goes on, it was nice to see Kae stay true to herself. I feel like she learns and grows a little with each experience, but never really changes, and I liked that. Simultaneously, I liked seeing her suitors grow to accept her for who she is-- even the craziest parts of her-- more and more as they had more adventures together. And I found all of the main cast to have their likable points. I do wish most of them had been developed a little more, but I there was no one I truly disliked, no one who brought down every scene they were in.On top of that, it was interesting to see the series occasionally tackle serious issues. The main plot itself comes into question-- addressing the boys only liking Kae for her appearance when she gains the weight back in one episode. This, thankfully, ends on the note that she's the same person on the inside no matter what she looks like. (And the manga actually addresses this issue multiple times and is more outright about the message the author was trying to send.) There's also an episode that takes a serious look into sexual assault, and Mutsumi's relationship with his older brother looks into sibling abuse and toxic family relationships... Honestly, the story with Mutsumi isn't addressed as completely as I hoped it would be, but I felt the sexual assault storyline was handled tastefully, and I really liked that the writers weren't afraid to discuss something so serious with no real barriers between the audience and the message they were trying to impart there. (Basically, it's a very quick moment with Kae and one of the love interests who's delirious with a fever at the time, but no one tries to brush it off like it wasn't a big deal, and Kae was reasonably affected by it, which I really appreciated. Too often in anime, those sorts of scenarios are brushed off like they're not a big deal-- or worse, played off like it's romantic in some way-- and it was just... very refreshing. Kae even goes back through her manga to reevaluate her opinions on those types of stories.)On a lighter note, I can't remember the last time a show had me laughing this hard from start to finish, almost every single episode. There's definitely a lot to love here for long-time anime fans, a lot of references and just... otakuisms that they managed to simultaneously poke fun at and indulge in. I do think that you'll probably know from the summary alone whether you'll enjoy this show, though. I don't really feel like it's the type of show that can deviate from its intended audience, and it's not something I'd recommend to new anime fans. But I personally enjoyed it just as much as I thought I would, and if it sounds interesting to you, I'd definitely encourage you to check it out! instilled in her throughout the years.)

And why didn\'t you bastards tell me about this shit?! Inconsiderate assholes.\'Kiss Him, Not Me\' (KHNM) was an incredible surprise to me. Despite what I found to be a rather interesting premise, I approached this series with hesitation, fearing that it might end up being just another cookie-cutter romance between oblivious fools constantly overreacting to stupid misunderstandings, as is often the case with seemingly-odd romances nowadays... or perhaps something even worse, considering the touchy subject matter. Thankfully, though, what I got was not only...an atypical romance, but one of the funniest shows I have seen in quite some time, one that had me in stitches from beginning to end. The strangest part: I\'m not even a fan of yaoi!Before we get to the fun shit, here is how I scored this hidden gem:Story: 7Art: 9Sound: 8Characters: 9Enjoyment: 10OVERALL: *9/10*Instead of giving a traditional review, I decided it would be more fun to rate Kae\'s potential love interests and delve into their personalities a bit, beginning with the worst and going from there:*DISCLAIMER: LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD*5. Shinomiya Hayato - Shinomiya is the beta-male of the group: He is short, weak, cowardly & spineless, and suffers from a slight case of ""small man syndrome"" as a result. Aside from constantly kissing Kae\'s ass and following what everyone else is doing, he constantly attempts to show off by acting macho, which, considering his utter lack of anything resembling manliness, usually fails in a hilarious fashion. Shinomiya is one of two suitors who is clearly only interested in Kae because of her looks, making him especially unlikable in my eyes. I rated Shinomiya as the worst among them because, not only does he have the least in common with Kae, but he was the only character to openly look down on her with contempt before losing the weight. Fuck this punk-ass bitch.4. Nanashima Nozomu - Arrogant, stupid, ill-tempered and not at all shy about being shallow, Nanashima is more your stereotypical high school douchebag. He excels in sports and knows how to fight, but there isn\'t much else about him that is particularly redeeming on paper, at least compared to the rest of the suitors. Nanashima is the other suitor who is only interested in Kae because of her appearance, and he is easily Kae\'s most aggressive pursuer: making the most overt sexual advances towards her; becoming try-hard whenever he feels outdone in some way; and even being the only love interest who literally tried forcing himself on her (albeit in a state of ""delirium""). He is barely saved from being the worst of the suitors, though, by his resemblance to Kae\'s favorite anime character, his positive relationship with his sister, and his eagerness to defend Kae when she is in danger... and yes, the so-called ""nice guy"" ought3. Igarashi Yusuke - And now, we have reached the ""cool guy"" of the group. Igarashi is pretty much your standard male protagonist in romance anime: He is popular, athletic, bright, confident, assertive and even kind - the type of guy who almost every girl (or guy) in the school would want, and already the ideal romantic protagonist. Igarashi also goes through the most character development in the series, especially with regards to his feelings for Kae, and, despite being an ideal romantic interest from the get-go, he is perhaps the most-relatable character in the entire series. While he is leaps & bounds ahead of the two aforementioned douche-nozzles in terms of desirability, there are still two people who exceed him as romantic interests, at least in my eyes.2. Shima Nishina - There are some things that a man simply cannot do, and that is where Shima comes into the picture. A prodigy in many ways, Shima is our resident lesbian and has more in common with Kae than the other four combined; in fact, not only are they both otakus with similar tastes, but Shima is a doujinshi author who has written some of Kae\'s favorite titles! Shima also fell in love with Kae before she lost weight, so there is no doubt that her feelings are genuine. It was a tough decision, but I had to rate her a very close second because she can be a bit smothering, possessive and enabling, which negatively-affects Kae more than once.1. Mutsumi Asuma - There are ""nice guys,"" and then there are genuinely nice guys... and Mutsumi is most definitely the latter. Also popular with the ladies, Mutsumi is that quiet, easygoing and a little absent-minded type who draws you in with his pleasant nature and infectious aura without any effort whatsoever. From the very first time he is introduced, it is obvious that he liked Kae for who she was from the beginning; in fact, he was the most indifferent to her new-found beauty, and the only one who recognized her immediately post-transformation. He gets the top spot, though, because he is the most honest, forthright, empathetic and supportive of all the potential suitors; best of all, while he doesn\'t exactly share her interests, he has no issues with participating in any of Kae\'s hobbies, and even volunteers to serve as a muse on more than one occasion. Mee-yaoi!-----------------------Does this list match up with yours, or do you find someone else more deserving of Kae\'s affections? Perhaps you want the guys to fuck each other senselessly as well, or maybe you wanted the ladies to do some hardcore macking+muff-diving. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for certain: as long as there is some homo-ness in the air, Kae will be there to faithfully observe from behind the pillars... with drool running down her chin all the while. an atypical romance, but one of the funniest shows I have seen in quite some time, one that had me in stitches from beginning to end.

I’m still pretty damn new to the world of anime, so watching shows like this and those that are similar are such a new experience for me.

It’s pretty different, and maybe I don’t totally get the way that others view this kind of anime, but to me I saw a bunch of people brought together by one girl. At first, she wasn’t...the prettiest and had her flaws. But it was so amazing to watch her grow because of everyone and to watch everyone accept her and love her for who she is as a person.

I like the way you get to know a bit of all the characters, you really also start knowing what kind of people you like or you're drawn for. The main character is really weird in a really cool way, she's sweet, and considerate in a genuine way. You do realize watching this that she still has a lot of growing up to do, but why should she do it now? She's just a high school student who really likes anime.So if you have the time, and don't know what to watch next and think this is interesting, give it a try!

To be honest, the show started very interestingly. but then the plot went nowhere. I\'ve noticed this a lot in animes, and I personally refer to it as the Lost Plot Syndrome. The Lost Plot Syndrome is when an anime goes nowhere by either not knowing where to go after a certain arc ends, to betray its main purpose in an unprofessional way, or to suddenly turn into a filler show halfway through. The story starts as a standard reverse harem romance. I think that after you introduce the characters, you take your chances to turn your show from a standard anime into a unique one. I have to say that the idea itself was very creative, but it was not executed properly.Characters: 8/10Kae: 6/10I like the idea of having a fujoshi as the main character.  She was too much of an airhead though.Mutsumi: 9/10My favorite. He was kind to her from the start and didn\'t judge her because of her weight.Igarashi:8/10Although he fell in love with her for her looks, he learned over time to like her for her true self.Nanashima: 8/10He turned from a rough aggressive bad boy into a nice, understanding person. I like how he is shown to be a good older brother. But what on earth was the fever that he got that made him do that to Kae?Nishina: 8/10I didn\'t know why I shipped her and Kae so much. But I do like her character.Shinomaya: 9/10Very adorable. I like how Kae brings him confidence.Art: 9/10Very good. The best thing about this Anime. Is it just me or does it get better throughout the show? Only minus a point because the ""lipstick"" was very dark and out of place.Ending:3/10Very bad. Because the creators didn\'t want to choose a favorite, they ended it in a dumb way.Soundtrack: 5/10Very average. Nothing special that stands out.Extra: Enjoyment (7/10)Pretty funny for the most part. Although its sense of humour is quite average for this genre.Should YOU watch it?Maybe. It is a very standard reverse harem anime with good art and a not so good plot.Overall score: 6/10 (AKA fine) .Story: 6/10This story is about a second-year girl named Kae, who is a fujoshi that is absolutely obsessed with BL (Boys\' Love). She ships her classmates Nana and Igarashi. After her favorite character from Mirage Saga (Shion) dies, she starves herself and loses weight.

I really enjoyed this short series despite the extremely frustrating ending to it, I found myself genuinely laughing out loud throughout the series. It combines yaoi and a reverse harem genres very well and makes for a very enjoyable watch (for the most part).I find that the series quite lacks a storyline, just multiple characters that are all pursuing one girl, who is somehow clueless the entire time of it. I really enjoyed watching the character development of Nanashima, Igarashi...and Asuma Mutsumi but am disappointed to say that the main character, Serinuma, whom everyone pursues has no individual development whatsoever.Overall I still rate this series a good 7/10 since it was entertaining the entire way through up until the last 5 minutes of the series finale. As you might be able to tell, I got a bit too attached to this and the ending was just plain disappointing and unsatisfactory so please take my advice and just watch it as a quick, casual binge.Now for all the viewers that have already finished the series, I just have a quick rant (including spoilers): In the last episode when everyone finally reveals their feelings to the clueless Serinuma and requests her to make a decision, she acknowledges the seriousness of their words and yet gives the MOST IRRESPONSIBLE AND SHALLOW CONCLUSION WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY UGHHHHHHHHHH and Asuma Mutsumi but am disappointed to say that the main character, Serinuma, whom everyone pursues has no individual development whatsoever.Overall I still rate this series a good 7/10 since it was entertaining the entire way through up until the last 5 minutes of the series finale.

From the first episode to the very last you create a connection with them and that's very cool.The story is fine, probably too many cliches, but I really laughed hard sometimes. It's very positive and the boys are charming.The only BIG problem si the ending, which is very unsatisfaying and predictable, I wish they took the romance situation more seriously, but they didn't.In the end, is not an amazing anime, but it gives you some joy.

It\'s been recommended to me over and over again. I was pretty excited coming into the show, I thought the concept was unique and hilarious.I will say I\'ve gotten some genuine laughs while watching this. From her mourning the death of her favorite anime character to freaking out over new anime merch I had fun seeing something I could relate to so much. But these funny moments were not able to outweigh the moments I found genuinely repulsive.In the first episode, the blatant fatphobia was pretty off-putting, to say the least. The way her character is...drawn while heavier vs when she\'s skinny and ""beautiful"" speaks volumes on its own. In the heavier depiction of her, her eyes are imperceivable, her mouth is tiny to draw attention to the width of her face, her voice is blatantly less attractive and there is little to no characterization on her face. I understand that this choice was probably made for comedic effect, but I honestly just find it objectionable. It gets worse when you see the skinny ""beautiful"" depiction of her after she lost weight from NOT EATING. The show\'s choice to have her transformation be after she didn\'t eat for a week is harmful on another level. After her transformation, her voice goes up about three octaves to the typical female romance protagonist voice. Then we see all the characters except for two, her best friend and Mutsumi, starting to treat her with respect after they see her new look.A major part of her characterization is the fact that she\'s an otaku, specifically, she\'s OBSESSED with BL. She\'s shown shipping male classmates and discussing with her friend who would top or bottom. She literally drools and moans when she sees any remotely intimate interactions between them. She gets excited during her first date with the boys because it\'s her perfect chance to see attractive boys interact so she can ship them more. I don\'t understand how so many people ignore the blatant way she fetishizes gay men.*Spoilers*Episode 5 was the real nail in the coffin for me. Halfway through episode 5, Serinuma comes back to school after Valentine\'s day as heavy as she was at the beginning of the show. All the male love interests and other characters, except for Mutsumi and Shima, show immediate disgust at her weight gain. The characters go out of their way to persuade her into exercising to loos weight again and go back to being ""pretty"". They make her do fast intensive exercise so she can lose the weight fast. Not only is it problematic to depict intensive exercise as the best form of weight lose but they make it seem as though anything but being skinny is disgusting and must be fixed. Yusuke admits to Nana that he still likes Serinuma even when she\'s fat and the show treats this as some amazing and crazy revelation. Nana says ""Get it together, stupid! You\'re saying you\'re okay with this?!"" (pointing to a picture of heavier Serinuma). That moment in itself filled me with literal disgust. After a bit of trying to get her to lose weight through intensive exercise and not seeing results, they come up with a new plan. They decide to make a goal chart and at each weight loose milestone, the boys will do some form of gay romance trope. These include ""holding hands"", ""press against wall"", and ""lick ear"". They use her obsession with gay men to motivate her to lose weight and be ""beautiful"" again.  This entire moment was my biggest motivation for this review.The examples I listed above are only a couple of many. I can understand the appeal of this show but I can not understand how that appeal could outweigh these moments.

Overall a 5.5/10 for me, this review contains no spoilers :)The main character Serinuma, was a chubbier girl, and a HUGE otaku, and an obesssive fan of BL. When her favorite character Shion died from her favorite anime she was in a depressed state for a week, and woke up and lost a lot of weight. Then suddenly, she has a harem around her. These guys had no interest in her before she lost weight, and now that she\'s lost weight she\'s attractive??Asuma, a guy in her history club, a sweetie pie....He liked her with her weight, and without it. I haven\'t read the manga, but I hope the Asuma and Serinuma get together!!Nana, a popular douche, who fell over her in gym class, and didn\'t feel the need to apologize, and called her a ""Human Cushion"" but now that she\'s lost weight, he\'s all over her. and I quote ""She\'s a total hottie now that she\'s lost weight!"" He\'s clearly interested in her face, and face alone.Shinomiya, was on the health committee with her, and he was quite cold to her. He just wasn\'t kind to her, but when he saw Serinuma, he was so kind to her, and he just completely changed his attitude towards her.Igarashi, is Nana\'s best friend, and I didn\'t mind him. He forced Nana to apologize after Nana fell over her, and Igarashi apologized to her too. He wasn\'t interested in her before she lost weight, but he was always nice to her.And lastly, Nishina. She was also a weird kinda obessive BL fan, but I kinda saw her more as Serinuma\'s best friend? Like I know that Nishina was interested in Serinuma, but like they had so many of the same interests. But, she fell for Serinuma at first sight, before she lost weight.Overall, the anime wasn\'t bad, it was pretty funny at sometimes, but I can\'t with the toxic love for BL. Serinuma & Nishina would have weird fantasies of the guys (Asuma, Shin, Nana, Igarashi.) And I did not like Shin & Nana, I feel like they like Serinuma BECAUSE she lost weight. He liked her with her weight, and without it.

I watched both the dub and the sub and I’d say the dub is quite watchable and doesn’t really take away from the show much. the characters are interesting and out of all of serinumas potential lovers I only find myself cringing at 1 of them (the rich artist girl). This show took me extremely long to finish for some reason but I did enjoy watching it and I would recommend it for people interested in BL and yaoi but also really like romance anime’s.All episodes dubbed and subbed are...also available on youtube also available on youtube', 'The anime is about a fujoshi. I could stop right there and THAT could justify my reason for hating this anime so much. Other than that, the plot is horrible, the characters are horrible, and everything else is horrible. I hate every single character in this show except for one. So the show is about a girl named Serinuma. She is “fat” and she wears glasses so she is bullied. This is literally so stupid and it’s such a basic plot line. Like haha shes fat and she can’t see?? So funny IKR! In the first episode we already know she is a fujoshi cause...she talks about how she would rather see men kiss then be kissed. Her character is just so gross. A woman that likes seeing men kiss… fetishizing mlm relationships… wow… such a good character… I literally hate her so much. So basically she gets hit by this guy named Nanashima (who is one of the main love interests) and she has to go to the infirmary for that. He literally doesn’t care that he hit her by the way and just makes fun of her. When Serinuma gets home, she has to watch the new episode of this show she likes. In the episode her favorite character dies. SO, when she sees this, she decides to starve herself. Promoting this in a show is so disgusting? Especially because everyone thinks she’s pretty when she becomes skinny. So when she wakes up, her brother just calls her fat so thats really nice… again I hate 99% of characters in this stupid show. So she goes to school and no one recognizes her until her only friend says her name?? Then automatically everyone wants to talk to her. Then this asshole Nanashima comes in and his friend Igarashi (who is decent sometimes) wants him to apologize to Serinuma because of what happened when he hit her but he just laughs at her and tells her she’ll always be fat. She runs away crying not because he was mean to her… but because she looked like the anime character that died… :| So she runs and crashes into another one of the main love interests who is named Shinomiya. I don’t have that big of a problem with him except for hes boring. Most of the characters in this show are boring but his only character trait is that he cant defend Serinuma from big strong men… its so stupid. But he wants to get her bandaged up. Some stuff happens honestly I havent seen this show in a while because I wouldnt rewatch. She eventually ends up talking to the only decent character in the show. Mutsumi is my man he is the only one who recognized her he was nice to her when she was “fat” and he just doesnt treat her different from everyone else. Serinuma doesn’t deserve him but I assume they will get together because he is the best love interest.So then a lot of shit happens. They all ask her on a date on the same day? And then they all have the date together??? Why not just schedule for different days for each of them if you cant turn them down… Then she goes to buy an anime pillow and oh they accept her for being an anime fan wow nice. Eventually they meet a girl and I also hate her she’s also a fujoshi… weird. Serinuma and the girl kiss… like the only kiss that happens in the show. They make the guys uncomfortable by making them take weird pictures…All in all this show is garbage I hope it never continues :) she talks about how she would rather see men kiss then be kissed.

The anime feels even worse than the typical anime harem. The anime is full of fan service that fetishes bl and mlm, with the main character being obsessed with it. I also hated how the main character went from being overweight at one period and the next week being loved by all the boys. The characters' development never went anywhere, which left out key parts that would've made the show easier to understand. Though there are 12 episodes, every one of them feels the same. The show has no redeemable quality, which I personally...would not recommend. would not recommend."", 'This is a queer baiting anime. NOT ONLY that but the main girl fetishizes gay men the entire time, its about a girl who is unattractive and then becomes attractive and all of a sudden all the guys like her but she cant stop fantasizing about the guys together. I think this is just wrong, Plus its basically saying if you\'re a ""fat"" women you wont have any men that like you or even notice you, as in the anime.  I think this anime is SHIT and deserves 1 rating, 10 out of 10 would not recommended. and i will not listen to people...who says its supposed to be funny or humorous because IT IS NOT. its just the same plot every episode and boring. who says its supposed to be funny or humorous because IT IS NOT. its just the same plot every episode and boring.', ""I personally don't have a problem with the weight loss but I really hate the love interests (apart from Mutsumi and Nishida) for only liking her when she was skinny. I really hate the fact that Kae had a whole thing about BL and made everything in her life about it like it was just fetishization which was weird asf. The characters' dialogue was alright and mostly comedic and all the characters did have their own sense of personality, non that was really remarkable. The plot is like every other slice of life but with a mc who actually has a personality. "", ""Okay, I want to start out by saying I really enjoyed this anime! It had me laughing the whole time, despite what other comments said because I laughed up until the very last episode. The reason I didn't give this anime a better score, because the whole time it was a 10 for me, was due to the final episode. I'll try not to spoil anything but that last episode was so disappointing that I could not give this anime a 10, otherwise I would have. The story is very cute and funny, again I was laughing pretty much from start to finish. However, there...were a few episodes that seemed a little out there, meaning they felt out of placed. Nevertheless, even though the plot (how things happen) was a little jumpy at times, it still made a cohesive story (as to what happens). The art was beautiful and I liked how adorable and quirky it was. Even the character designs were top notch, and I truly appreciated the little things throughout the anime and its design. Sound wasn't anything to memorable but it was good. The characters were great, I liked a few more than others, but they were all enjoyable in their own way. The main character was hilarious, though a little over the top at some moments where she kind of annoyed me, especially in the last episode!! -_- Again, I won't spoil it but I really just wanted to chuck my laptop across the room after that fiasco. Still, she was pleasant throughout the series. I found all the characters enjoyable, funny and likable.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime and it would have been one of my favorites if not for the brutal ending.

However, I do like to point out that the narrative does increase in flavour when there are decent characters in the series. I understand the appeal for character development but for a series like this let's be real here you're not expecting a 180 so if you're banking on that it is already a terrible decision....Though I have to say the characters are drawn rather nicely, this is perhaps the highlight of the series if the characters were unattractive I seriously doubt this would gain any traction. The music was passable with some really good moments incorporated altogether with the overall aesthetic. Although not all characters were written well, the ones that are, were absolutely great.The pacing was alright but it could've been better, perhaps the anime was meant as a tease to entice its audience to read the manga because there were many angles that they could've shot for. The voice acting is surprisingly stacked with some powerhouse cast and the most notable one would be Sawashiro Miyuki you'll instantly know it's her when her character appears she just possesses that star quality that is hard to miss, unsurprisingly her character is amazing too.The overall aesthetic of this title banks a lot of its comedy and cutesy romance. Although the narrative was slightly within the average zone, it succeeded in its comedic scenes and over-deliberate cute moments. Although I personally would've preferred a more heart-felt romance in this case it just wouldn't fit the overall feel of the title. Props to the writer, there were certainly many different directions this could've gone but the overall was really well done.A pretty decent 7 I suppose.

The voice acting is surprisingly stacked with some powerhouse cast and the most notable one would be Sawashiro Miyuki you'll instantly know it's her when her character appears she just possesses that star quality that is hard to miss, unsurprisingly her character is amazing too.The overall aesthetic of this title banks a lot of its comedy and cutesy romance. Although the narrative was slightly within the average zone, it succeeded in its comedic scenes and over-deliberate cute moments. Although I personally would've preferred a more heart-felt romance in this case it just wouldn't fit the overall feel of the title. Props to the writer, there were certainly many different directions this could've gone but the overall was really well done.A pretty decent 7 I suppose."", ""I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's triggered by fatphobia and by teacher-student relationships.This anime should have been about two weeb girlfriends who get into fights about ships. It has shown time and time again that it cannot handle any other topics. When the MC was not skinny she was considered ugly and made to exercise by two of the love interests with the goal of making her thin again. The hot teacher who hits on students and wants to date a student is just there, and then he isn't but that's only because he decided to. Even the romance between the MC and...the guys is shallow, and of course it is since they only care about her looks (except her senpai).It had some funny and cute moments, but they were the ones that were focused on how she's a weeb, and how she and the female love interest bond and clash because of their interest in shipping.Literally this story could have been 90% better if it was only about a love triangle between the MC, her senpai and the girl that's into her because their interactions were the only ones that were actually cute. the guys is shallow, and of course it is since they only care about her looks (except her senpai).It had some funny and cute moments, but they were the ones that were focused on how she's a weeb, and how she and the female love interest bond and clash because of their interest in shipping.Literally this story could have been 90% better if it was only about a love triangle between the MC, her senpai and the girl that's into her because their interactions were the only ones that were actually cute."", 'This anime was actually pretty good but I do have a few qualms about some of the major plot points early on. Literally only two of the characters treat the main girl with any respect when she isn\'t skinny. Once you get past the fact that the rest of them were only in it for her looks in the beginning this is a really enjoyable anime. However it really made the flaws in a lot of the ""interests"" very clear from the very start. Their attitudes towards her when she puts the weight back on was absolutely disgusting and I\'m glad that they all had...some development in why they acted like this.

One love interest loves her overweight figure, another is ultimately indifferent (he is arguably demisexual), one prefers her at a skinnier figure but doesn\'t care too much either way, and the two prefer her skinny entirely. A lot of commenters on Crunchyroll were angry at the shallowness of this but it\'s frankly realistic that people will have physical preferences and, ultimately, physical attraction is important in relationships. What matters is showing the audience that the general mainstream media POV that no one fancies overweight people is entirely incorrect and that the MC isn\'t  hurt by any of the negative connotations about her weight.--> the comedy is pretty great in this show I found myself cracking up most episodes. Some jokes involve anime references (even a reference to an obscure hentai) and others are ones beginners would enjoy.The story itself is pretty simple and exactly what the synopses says- it really is just a simple, albeit VERY bashful, romcom. Now for the negatives:--> the aforementioned LGBT+ stories are mostly undermined and not taken seriously unfortunately. Only the straight relationships are regarded as realistic. There are undoubtedly set ups for all of these LGBT+ moments but it\'s up to the audience to flesh them out or carry them on with their own imagination.--> this show is fatphobic. Yes it\'s exaggerated for the sake of humour but the fatphobia is undeniable and it\'s up to you whether that will trigger you. This includes: the first episode the MC is treated pretty badly because of her weight and the voice change during scenes when she is overweight that one Crunchyroll commenter accurately described as sounding ""like she\'s gargling lard"". Luckily there aren\'t too many scenes like this.--> in terms of romantic development there really isn\'t much this is a classic bashful Japanese romcom and the characters aren\'t even tsunderes to give us character development. Basically, the MC is a voyeur who isn\'t all that interested in sex and romance so she gets upset by most handholding or attempted kisses.

Essentially, this overweight/obese otaku gets so sad when her favorite character dies that she ends up not eating for a week, causing her to magically lose weight and become pretty. Once she becomes super pretty, hot boys + girl go after her, but she only gets happy when the boys pursuing her have some kind of fanservice moment (or when the other girl joins in on their little fantasy or whatever).

I get that this is a male harem where you're supposed to relate to the female MC, but I just couldn't like the characters except senpai. Luckily, the manga ended much better. So if you want to watch this, please read the manga first. It's much better and less superficial. "", ""The best way you I can put it, is like Ouan High School Host Club. While it's certainly more problematic in the year of 2020+, it's still a very much guilty pleasure watch. It's fun and gives you the ability to root for someone in hopes of them getting together with Kai.Though, like most, I do not like how the main character loses weight from severe depression in the very beginning. I feel like they very much glosses over that part and how everyone seemed to like her so quickly. We also don't get to have a lot of time with more side characters,...like Amane, who is meant to be her best friend, and yet beside fan girl moments and at the very end - barely see her. It also feels like the anime barely even focuses on the other's at all at times, and we know nothing about their personal lives - while other suitors have complete episodes regarding their homelives and relationships outside of the harem.Three out of 5 of the main suitors are incredibly shallow, only liking her for her works at the beginning. Though, it is really nice to see that despite the competitive nature, they all truly learn to care about her and like her for her personalities - so much so the young versions of themselves would barely recognize them. Near the end, while still having that nature - are completely still open to the idea of simply being friends with her and everyone else in the group.Every suitor character besides Shima seems to have their time to improve, even in the little things like focusing boundaries, and being able to be honest about themselves and how they feel. Shima feels much more like just another rich girl and more of a platonic soulmate than a romantic one.While it can come off as fetishy for some, that's mostly just a stereotype of how how Kai is a otaku, someone incredibly into men loving men content. Anime feels more like her one true paring than any of the actual suitors, and the anime makes it incredibly clear.Again, I highly recommend this if you're looking for something light hearted and fun to turn your brain off to. like Amane, who is meant to be her best friend, and yet beside fan girl moments and at the very end - barely see her.

The art style is average alongside the mutual relationships and ‘realism’ within the show but there...are a few funny moments.If you’re seeking to pass time with a short anime then this could suffice, but I wouldn’t ‘hype’ this up to be one of the best animes of all time. are a few funny moments.If you’re seeking to pass time with a short anime then this could suffice, but I wouldn’t ‘hype’ this up to be one of the best animes of all time.', 'Kiss him not me is a revolting anime to say the least. I want you all to know how fatphobic this anime is and how it promotes the fetishisation of gay men and eating disorders.Kiss him not me starts of with a fat (and therefore ugly because according to this anime you can’t be fat and pretty 🙄)high school with basically no facial features in tears because her favourite character in an anime dies. She become so emotional that she become unable to take after herself and basically starved herself for a week. Getting up after this week she finds herself to be skinny...and with actual facial features!!!She goes to school and nobody recognises her because she lost weight and is now somehow completely unrecognisable. She finds out that many people have fallen for her now that’s she’s skinny (really feels like that’s promoting an eating disorder tbh).The anime then goes on to do many typical anime tropes, such as a beach episode, going on dates with all of the character…etc, etc. but somehow all the stereotypical episodes are able to not be completely terrible.All the characters in the show are horrible and I likeable for their own unique reasons. Infact they were so bad I don’t remember any of their names, so to describe the characters to you I’m gonna go based of their most noticeable feature.The blonde one is so I un-likeable idk why she even considered him, he’s a bully,and he only likes her because she’s skinny and has no actual interest in her when she’s not skinny.The short one feels as though hes not ‘manly’ enough because hes built like a girl and actually has emotions, despite him sounding actually alight hes also only inlove with her bc she’s skinny and treated her like shit when was was considered ugly.The boy with short black hair is similar to the blond one but actualy has some decency. He starts of only liking her because she’s pretty but after A WHILE he realises he will love her no matter her size, which is sweet igThe girl is not great, she would be better if she didn’t kiss her without consent and didn’t fetishise gay men but that seems to be a running theme in this anime so by the time they introduced her I wasn’t as botherd. She’s rich and she saves the main girl from a creep who was trying to take up-skirt pictures of her.And FINALY the ONLY person in this anime who is a good person is Mustumi (the tall one with brown hair) from the beginning he knew it was her when she lost weight, stateing that she was still the same person and that she had just lost a bit of weight. He was the only person in this show that wasn’t a creep and was genuinely just a nice person. I love him for thatThe music in the show as alright but nothing special, I did however really like the opening music.

This is also the period that had a large influence on Japanese Culture and religious developments.Its a mix of slice of life, detective, mystery, comedy, action and history.The art is what stands out the most as Chen's character can only be described as simple, however the design for each character is unique and all standout in their own way. The movements are well choreographed and at most time smooth. (Especially the final episode my god that fight is next level.) There are also the small details like the mouth movements are more precise than your day to day anime, no flapping mouths but with the mouths shaping the sounds the actor is making.The sound, my god the Opening and ending are both really good, both the opening song and animation. The ending song is also great, and the ending animation showcases the work and art process for the animation.The characters all had their own quirks making them all unique, But the ones that stood out obviously was Li. However each character has their moment to shine.The show sometimes plays off like a detective story, which makes senses considering that is what the Affairs Bureau handles. Which gives it added flavour.I enjoyed this alot more than I thought I would. Would definitely recommend. The voice acting is top notch, and its the attention to details.

The scene carries us the sounds and smells of rust, dust, must. Empty cells with spooky roars coming only from the last cubicle scares away our last patrol on duty. There\'s no one left to guard this monster. Is it a prisoner? a caged lion? some type of demon? It\'s actually a cat. Well not really. It\'s a human-cat, or is it a...cat-human.Story/CharacterWe\'ll need to add bit of setting to this story. We\'re actually at a period of the Tang Dynasty right after the Li clan rebellion was eliminated, leading to mass execution and imprisonment. Chen Shi, our friendly country bumpkin protagonist, decides to move to the capital in search for his long-lost brother. But he\'s stupid, poor, and in desperate need of a job. Without knowing much he ends up working on guard for our human-cat. With certain power shifts happening in the Tang empire, this cat-human who is also a part of the Li family becomes officially pardoned and no longer needs to be imprisoned. He becomes tasked to work as the senior official head of the Dali Court (a government bureau similar to the Supreme Court). Chen Shi who was able to persist as the prison guard to our cute cat humanoid is suddenly promoted as secretary to the senior official.

We\'re actually at a period of the Tang Dynasty right after the Li clan rebellion was eliminated, leading to mass execution and imprisonment. Chen Shi, our friendly country bumpkin protagonist, decides to move to the capital in search for his long-lost brother. But he\'s stupid, poor, and in desperate need of a job. Without knowing much he ends up working on guard for our human-cat. With certain power shifts happening in the Tang empire, this cat-human who is also a part of the Li family becomes officially pardoned and no longer needs to be imprisoned. He becomes tasked to work as the senior official head of the Dali Court (a government bureau similar to the Supreme Court). Chen Shi who was able to persist as the prison guard to our cute cat humanoid is suddenly promoted as secretary to the senior official.

.hack//Sign,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48/hack__Sign,"["".Hack//Sign is a single part in the Project .Hack franchise, one that combines novels, manga, TV anime and OVA's to form one grand narrative with characters and events happening not only chronologically, but simultaneously as well. The review below is written from the franchise point of view, and as an standalone anime.The general consensus of Hack//Sign is that the story's boring, there is almost no action and it doesn't make fast progress. While some of these points are quite true, the story is one of character development and interaction. The viewer learn more about every side character through their interaction with the rest of the...cast, their surroundings and gradually helps move the plot. The plot is one of clashing and matching personalities, driven by mysteries..Hack//Sign, The story:+ It's detailed- It does feel slow at timesThen, we have the art, fun scenery's and great character designs do give you the feel of an online game world that was actually thought out (see the games .hack//IMOQ and .hack//Frägment). The animation however, is quite sloppy and the characters themselves aren't drawn very detailed.+ The art does create the illusion of an actual MMORPG+ Great and original character designsThen we have the Sound, if there was an option to give it more then a ten out of ten, then I would choose it. The compositions by Yuki Kajiura, are in my opinion, what lifts the anime up from a meagre 7 to a 10. With an enormous array of songs and tunes, Yuki adds depth to the art and the story, giving it time when the characters need time and hypes the viewer when it's going down.+ Yuki Kajiura's music is truly a work of artThe characters of .Hack//Sign are gamers, and thus some try to act online like someone they aren't. Some take their offline situations into the game and some try to forget them instead.Complex emotions and double personalities are just some of the things you can find here.+ Character actually have character progress without it being important to the main storyline cast, their surroundings and gradually helps move the plot.

What could be more stress relieving than diving into a fantasy world where you assume the role of the character in the game? It sounds very tempting but if one should stay too long in the virtual world you could lose yourself in it with no way to return to the real world. In the worst case scenario you may forget which world is real and which is fake.That is the premise of .Hack//Sign. .Hack//Sign is a part of the .Hack series which surrounds the...MMORPG called “The World” and the different characters who find the mysteries surrounding this virtual land..Hack//Sign follows the story of Tsukasa, a Wavemaster (Spell caster) in “The World”, who suddenly wakes up in a dark dungeon with no recollection of how he got there and what he was doing prior to his collapse. While trying to gather his bearings a female Heavy Blade (sword wielder) by the name of Mimiru passes by and strikes a conversation with him. To her surprise Tsukasa instantly warps back to the town leaving her behind. It’s while he is in town that Tsukasa realizes that he can’t log out of “The World”. He is trapped in the virtual world with no way to get back to reality.If your thinking this will be an action packed show with monster fighting and adventuring you would be mostly wrong. While there is small tidbits of fighting and adventuring this show is very slow paced and mostly revolves around Tsukasa and the people he interacts with. .Hack//Sign also has noticeable dark elements to it especially when the real world is involved. The idea of escapism is really brought out when you see the character’s real life counterparts and the struggles they go through. But that is just a small part as Sign is mostly set in “The World”.Due to the slow pacing every character in this show has a chance to develop and feel more realistic. “The World” allows characters to express themselves in a way that the real world doesn’t allow. The result of this is that characters are intriguing to watch and thus provide a deep story. However this slow pace does cause most people to drop the show, as the pacing may be a little too slow and sometimes it feels that some scenes drag on. Another problem is the ending which is very abrupt and quick. I won’t spoil anything but let’s just say there is a reason why this is a part of a series of Anime shows and games. Overall the story is solid and enticing.The animation in .Hack//Sign is a very well done and fits the fantasy setting of “The World”. Every location has its own emotional feel that lends itself well to the slow pace of the show. The uniqueness of each area helps set the tone for the current situation in the Anime, as each area has its own theme and setting that really makes “The World” feel as big as the real world. Tropical forests, barren deserts and frozen wastelands litter the land with vibrancy. While this is true for the virtual world, the real world on the other hand resembles old black and white silent films.The real world is depicted as bleak and hopeless as text show up to replace verbal sound. This contrast between the vibrant virtual world and bleak real world becomes very important in portraying how “The World” seems to be a perfect escape from real life issues. The character designs are also very well done, since each character has their own design which fit the grander design that “The World” sets up. There are some parts that were a little bit grainy as I would call yet overall the design of this virtual world is truly something to appreciate.The music and overall sound in .Hack//Sign is where it really sets itself apart from other anime. The opening song Obsession gives off a feeling of trance and emptiness that really fits the mood of .Hack//Sign while the background music has a sense of tranquility and sadness that backs up the visual aspect of the show. The music also has a folklore aspect in a sense that it makes you feel like it’s telling a story or possibly narrating the situation your currently watching. One big plus is the background music with vocals in them. Key of the Twilight is one of the best songs in the soundtrack and really exemplifies how music is able to set the tone of a scene and possibly the show. However there are some points where the music overpowers a certain scene in the show which can ruin the mood but it rarely happens. So my advice is to pay attention the music as it can really pull you into the story and set the mood.Overall .Hack//Sign is something that shouldn’t be overlooked. The story of escapism gone wrong will leave you wondering if this could happen to you. The animation is compelling and imaginative while the music really sets the emotional tone of the show. I must warn you again that if you hate slow paced shows or want some action then steer clear of this show but for those who want a good mystery with a fantasy setting then.Hack// Sign is for you.

Anyway, it's basically about what would happen if Shinji Ikari played video games. Tsukasa, the main character, wakes up in The World, the first Virtual Reality MMORPG since some supervirus stomped all over the internet. He can't remember how he got there or who he is, and soon discovers that he can't even log out of the damn game. After running into some douchebags who want to jump his ass for supposedly hacking, he acquires some...wacky ass jello bullshit that flies around and kicks peoples asses for him. From there, Tsukasa and his friends attempt to figure out the reason as to why he can't log out, and end up unraveling the dark secrets about what The World really is.Sound cool? I thought so too. As it turns out, Bee Train pulled a fast one and replaced all the cool aspects of playing an MMORPG (like bitchin' ass spells, gunblades, implying other player's parents are really the same gender, etc.) with half-assed attempts at exploring the concepts of escapism, and how interpersonal relationships affect us as humans. Now, I consider myself a sophisticated member of society. I have no problem with slow paced, character driven shows, but if I'm going to be watching a show that's 85 percent dialogue, I'm expecting a lot more in terms of plot and character development than what I was given. They even managed to fuck up the lesbian undertones by making one of them a cripple. Come on, Bee Train, cripple porn? I never thought you'd sink that low.The art is fantastic. Beautifully painted backgrounds, imaginative character designs (although that's to be expected, considering they were done by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto) and for the most part top notch animation come together to make the anime really stand out. Plot aside, if you really dig artsy shit, you'll be able to appreciate the detail that went into the show.The sound is great too. The soundtrack has a way of both perfectly fitting and amplifying the tone of the scene, and the voice acting is pretty awesome as well.As for the characters, they start off as your typical bunch of anime cliches but then the metric fuckton of dialogue hits and character development starts to make its way through. Tsukasa starts off as a stoic jerkass who develops into Shinji Ikari: Part Deux, Mimiru is the happy-go-lucky only-sane-one (especially considering the dysfunction junction that is the rest of the cast) who plays the game for fun, Bear is the cool old guy/big damn hero/Shepard, BT is the condescending information broker (who hates lettuce, remember that), the Silver Knight is the cliche shounen hero that FIGHTS FOR JUSTICE who, through character development, stops being so bombastic and douchey and starts being a more approachable big damn hero, Subaru is the shrinking violet/woman in charge with a twist, Crim is the ridiculously over-the-top large ham with unrealistic hair and an unnervingly large sense of honor, Helba is the hacker, Sora is the lovable jerkass who assaults women in-game, etc. Most of them seem to take more pleasure in standing around talking to each other about their real lives than in actually playing the game, though. I guess that's the point, seeing as the anime is all about interpersonal relationships, but it certainly does bog down the dialogue with a lot of useless information. And implications about lesbian cripples. Ugh.Overall, if you like boring shit, you'll love .hack//SIGN. wacky ass jello bullshit that flies around and kicks peoples asses for him.

This was the anime that started the ""trapped in an MMORPG"" craze in anime. Although it is far superior in quality to SAO and Log Horizon, it somehow has an average rating almost 2 full points lower. Allow me to explain why this is a great injustice!Story and characters: 7/10The story will no doubt seem familiar at this point, because so many series have ripped off .hack. After a computer virus devastates the internet, a new web system is created and shortly after a massive MMORPG using virtual reality is born as the brain child of a...German computer genius with mysterious motives. A player called Tsukasa finds himself trapped in this fantasy MMORPG and is unable to logout, but is not aware why or even who he is in the real world. This is only a problem for Tsukasa and no other players are effected by this. What makes .Hack unique is that Tsukasa dying in the game world doesn\'t mean he will die in the real world. Instead, he just respawns and is still trapped, like an eternal purgatory. Tsukasa must discover the mystery of why he is trapped and find out more about this MMORPG and why it was created. The pacing in this series is slow, so it will take a while to get good. However, I appreciate that this series unlike SAO or Log Horizon focuses mostly on character development and psychological drama rather than pointless action and fanservice. Afterall, duel wielding eventually gets a little stale. ""Jesus Christ SAO! Duel Wielding isn\'t THAT cool, tone it down guys!"" - John Wooart: 6/10The character designs are good, but the animation is sometimes lacking. Most of the time, people are standing around talking and this isn\'t exactly going to blow you away with its visuals. Hack was made by a small animation studio called Beeline best known for ""hits"" like Noir and Spider Riders for Kids WB. Yes, there is an anime called Spider Riders, and it is just as bad as it sounds!Soundtrack: 10/10Hack is probably most well known for its outstanding sound track that features a new song in every episode. At one point the OST fetched outlandishly high prices on E-bay, but I am not sure what it is worth today. It is still an excellent sound track and comes highly recommended.Entertainment: 7/10Yes, I will admit that it can be a bit slow at times. That doesn\'t mean it is a bad series. The drama and character development make this one worth watching.Overall: 7/10This anime does have some issues with animation, pacing, and a few minor flaws. However, it is a LOT better than SAO or Log Horizon! Don\'t be a n00b! If you watch 1 trapped in an MMORPG anime, make bloody well sure it is this one! German computer genius with mysterious motives.

It has hardly any action, contrary to what it may seem like, and the main focus of this story is on the characters. But it is done in such an appealing way that I personally found myself not wanting to sleep until I found out how it ended. I\'ll warn you: .hack//SIGN isn\'t flashy and exciting; but it does have some fantastic qualities to make up for that fact. So let\'s break this down.STORY:.hack//SIGN is about a virtual reality MMORPG ( Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Game...) called ""The World."" In The World, players determine what class they would like to become, and then set out to play the game however they see fit. Some play in parties, while others choose to play solo. In this game, we meet several interesting and amusing characters - all who are playing the game differently, but whose paths fatefully cross at one point or another. But most notably of these characters, we meet Tsukasa: the ever troubled protagonist of this story. Tsukasa is met with a problem never before seen in The World: he can not log out. Stuck in the game, he is forced to face the fact that he might not even want to return to reality; but the many people whom he encounters during his stay in the game seem to be determined to figure out the mystery surrounding him, and return him safely to the real world.Now...the story moves slow. Like I\'ve said, there are not any flashy battles nor explosions, and what little action there is is very mundane...So, do not watch //SIGN expecting to be wowed by action scenes. That being said, there are some things that are left unexplained...but all those unexplained things CAN be explained if you read the manga. So, if you like the series and you find yourself wanting to know more about just what in the heck happened, then check out the manga or the novel of the same title.Alright. The true heart of this story is in the characters. So let\'s move on.CHARACTERS:.hack//SIGN consists of enticing characters; each with their own stand out qualities, motives, pasts, and subsequently, problems. In fact, I must say that every character in //SIGN is extremely interesting - I found myself relating to many of them in different aspects of their personalities, and in how they handled situations...which is a very welcome feeling, as many times, characters in anime seem to be a bit far fetched as to how they deal with certain occurrences.The character development is suburb; mainly because the characters are the main focal point of the entire story. So much time is spent delving into their hearts, feelings, and minds that one can not help but get attached.ART:Its got its quirks and problems, but all around, the animators did a good job. The animators made The World a beautiful place, while also a tad bit frightening in some areas. But I\'m not too good at reviewing art, so I\'ll end this portion here and you can decide for yourself.MUSIC:Excuse me while I squee with joy. *ahem* This is one of my favorite soundtracks. Yuki Kajiura at her finest. Every track fits The World to a T; and one can\'t help but feel like they\'re inside the game in some parts. Aside from the perfect fit of the songs, they are also emotional, exciting, and just plain fun.If you decide in the end that you do not want to watch .hack//SIGN, at least go listen to the soundtrack; it is pure enjoyment.OVERALL:I loved this series. I\'d watch it again in a heartbeat. To me, its only downfalls were that there could have been a little more action, but it wasn\'t necessary to the story, and that they should have explained more in the anime. But aside from these things, my enjoyment of this series was very high. I recommend you at least give it a shot. You never know until you try! I did, and I am not in the least bit disappointed.

And even if you do not find yourself a fan of the story...engage yourself in its soundtrack!', ""As a former hard core gamer, I had high expectations of this series which has been languishing in my list of stuff to someday get to watching. So I started viewing this intending to finish all the .hack series.Story/CharacterThe premise is exciting - one player in &quot;The World&quot; is suddenly unable to log out - why? The mystery gets deeper and deeper as we are pulled into his life and the life of the other characters (in game and in the real world) who either want to help him, want to solve the mystery or have some other hidden agendas of their own.The set up...(first 8 episodes) was very well done. Just as I started to get fascinated the series went on a philosophical bent and the plot stagnated. By the time it tried to recover I was frankly pretty bored and was just going through the motions of finishing the series.The characters are a mish mash. Some you remember and some could actually have been left out of the anime without making any impact at all. It was hard to even like any of them except 1-2 (you'll know what I mean).Art/Animation and soundThe animation was great for that time. Very cute and I can see where &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; may have copied some of the stuff. Songs were pretty decent but not as good as the art. It's a very pretty anime and as a gamer I was satisfied with both.EnjoymentThe series starts well, gets slow in the middle and tries to end with a bang but somewhat fails to pull it together. The end is ambiguous which detracts from overall enjoyment, hence the low score.OverallThis is one of those polarizing anime. You either love it or you hate it. There are a lot of similarities to &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; (which I hated) but I scored this a lot higher due to the effort it took to make the gaming world realistic, which I really appreciated. Overall I gave this a 5 -- there was much more that this series could have done that they didn't do, and the slow pace really made this less enjoyable than I would have liked.

All members who have worked on this review are mentioned at the bottom. In addition, this review will also contain a “Value in the Anime” section detailing life lessons and values that make this anime worth watching.-------------------.hack//sign isn\'t exactly new. Known for it\'s slow pace, it has a reputation as a poorly paced, often boring show. While this is true, to an extent, there is still value in this anime--life lessons that make it worth the time you\'re willing to invest in it.Story: .hack//sign is a slow...anime with an episodic format and plot to match. Often, you may feel that you might have to go back and re-watch an episode or two because might have missed something in the last scene.The pacing was bad and would have been much, much better as a one cour (12-13 episodes) series. The impact of the plot was lessened by the postponement of the primary conflict, which was not introduced until about halfway through. The ending ultimately lost impact because of the story telling, which was more or less average.Understandably, there are also some parts, especially prevalent in the OVAs, where you had to have prior knowledge for full understanding. The OVAs themselves added little to the story, mostly giving a sense of ""all\'s-well-that-ends-well."" It does try to be realistic in it\'s approach, though it doesn\'t always succeed.Art: The animation style is decent, but outdated, and doesn\'t quite manage to hold up to today\'s standards--though this is to be expected. The character designs were varied and distinct while the backgrounds, though predominately dark, were aesthetically pleasing. For the most part, the animation was smooth and the jerking and stills were kept to an acceptable minimum--problems consistent with many other older anime.Sound:. hack//sign\'s music and sound fit well. The OST complimented the mood while the OP and ED were catchy, though otherwise unmemorable. At times, the background music was a tad overbearing-- a fault that often resulted in a ruined atmosphere. Standing alone, the music can be drab at times, but proves to be sufficient overall.Characters: This is .hack//sign\'s focal point. Character development is initially slow, but speeds up later on in the anime. The characters are interesting, and almost all of them contribute to the plot at some point--one of them receiving extra development during the first OVA. No characters appears similar to another, and they are easy to relate to, though they can be dull at times. The villain is good, but suffers from a lack of impact as the episodes draw on.Enjoyment: In essence, this is a slow anime with poor pacing that often left us wanting more. It\'s worth a try if this appeals to you, but it will not keep everyone who watches awake. Because of how slow it is, it would probably be best if you watched this anime over a long period of time. Try watching as a substitute for pills or lullabies.The soundtrack is nice to listen to, but gets a little tiring after a while and the art is worth a look, even if it isn’t the best. The characters deserve more than a passing glance, being the primary draw of the show.Values in the Anime: There is value in this anime that makes it worth watching--certain life lessons that we can all learn through anime.Accepting Reality: This anime shows us how dangerous it is to get absorbed in entertainment. This is an issue especially present in today\'s society, where everyone is on their phone or computer at almost all times. It’s good to have fun and get absorbed, but also important to stay grounded in reality as well. Recognizing that line between entertainment and reality is paramount.Games are a way to express yourself; they are a way to act as someone you’re not. No matter what though, remember that these things should stay in the game; they are exclusive to the laws of the game for a reason. Accept reality for what it is, and know the difference while maintaining a balance.Respecting Others: Respecting others is important in real life, but can be equally so in a game or online. The main character is initially rude and unlikeable, but finds the value in those basic concepts throughout the development of the story and improves themselves as a person.

I was pretty skeptical because a couple of my really good friends said it was very boring. Then again I had friends that said it was amazing. With that being said, i just had to see for myself.Right off the bat I need to address one HUGE CON of this anime. The use of flashbacks and how many episodes they used. The large majority of .hack//sign was used having flashbacks. But not even stuff that we haven\'t seen yet. There was one scene  (that was several...minutes long) that was played AT LEAST 10 times in the series. Not to mention for a WHOLE episode they did a review of everything that had happened thus far. When you are dealing with an anime that is only 26 episodes long there is no need to do a 20 minute recap of everything that happened in the first 14 episodes! I can understand if you are on episode 150 and want to recap what has happened, because a lot of information can be forgot... but not in 14 episodes.It is my personal opinion that this anime could have been finished in 12 episodes. There were moments when the anime was boring as all Hell. Where I wanted to just say ""screw it"" and go to the next anime or skip that episode. There is tons of pointless information that could have been left out or scenes that were just not necessary. But in the end, within a couple episodes it had my attention again.Now for some Pros. There was many times in the series where I was very into the series. For example the Grunty scene where Su Casa was searching for the purple berries. It was very emotional and kept me on the edge of my seat. I did find myself yelling at the characters from time to time, At how stupid they were or in anticipation of what would happen next.There were many characters that I connected with. For example Sora. Sora was by far one of the greatest characters on the anime. His use of humor and whatnot was unparalleled.In the end the anime was good. It had its cons and pros. But evened out the anime was good. even Though it was good, the chances of me watching it again are not too high.I recommend watching it at least once and come with your own conclusion.OVERALL: 8 / 10Rewatch value: Low minutes long) that was played AT LEAST 10 times in the series.

And did you have the feeling that you will live your life in this game, find your love, ignoring the conventions of the game? If yes, then .hack//Sign will seem very close and familiar to you.This is the story of people who want to believe that the game is more than just a game. And literally, story lives on this faith. The characters here are not just invented images. First of all, these are people who control their avatars. At any moment they can leave the game, and for them it will cease...to matter. And their actions should be regarded from the position that they are trying to abstract from reality, but not get out of it. They don\'t feel the pain, or the warmth of their close player - but they want to believe it.However, the composition of this anime is more complex than I described above. After all, there is the main character of this anime - Tsukasa.Tsukasa doesn\'t know how he got into this world of the game. The mystery of its origin will hold until the very end. Unlike the players, he feels pain and warmth. However, this feature makes him the loneliest person in this world of illusions. The closest thing that can be cited as an example is LIMBO. And throughout history, he will face a choice - to close himself off from everyone remaining in the twilight world, or to try to return to reality?Perhaps the period of indeterminacy in the characters is the most boring, but at the same time the most interesting moment of the narrative. After all, as they move forward, their worldview will change.It is because of the process of character development in such an unusual composition that I think this anime is a damn masterpiece. Perhaps not one anime of this genre has not revealed this so plausibly, at the same time presenting itself as a techno-fantasy fairy tale. And if the director was faced with the task of revealing the social element of online games, then he coped with his task COMPLETELY.This is one of the most underrated anime I\'ve ever watched. But there is a reason for this - it is very boring. Seriously, in some episodes nothing happens except the characters\' dialogues (sometimes with themselves), but at the same time it is... Quite naturally. After all, this story is not meant to entertain you. This story happens naturally.

I didn't particularly enjoy the game that much, and it became lost behind the newer games that came and were added to my ever-growing video game collection.Fast forward to November 2007, and I stumble across .hack//SIGN while flicking through the channels one night. I decided to watch it, and I became immediately hooked.One of the strong points of the .hack video game was the story, and the story to SIGN was also brilliantly written. I also loved the art and the characters were a lovable motley crew,...of sorts.The music fitted in well with the atmosphere of the series. The celtic influence was notable in both scenery and music.A lot of people say this dragged on, &quot;They've all got weapons, but there's no fighting.&quot; Ah, well. So what? I didn't care. I'm never one to care about the pace of a telly programme, film or video game etc.I really enjoyed the series, and it pulled me in further into the world of anime.And, because of the series, Infection was pulled out from behind the newer games, and played once again.

(And was completed this time around.)"", 'First impressions of ""Hack Sign""... stunningly good animation and excellent music.Unfortunately there\'s not much more to it. This is an anime with a weak story line that contain more holes than Swiss cheese, and tries to make up for it by pretending to be deep. What they don\'t seem to realise is that there\'s more to being deep than having the characters do little more than stand around looking thoughtful and utter the occasional grunt whilst elegant music drifts past in the background. You need GOOD dialogue and storyline to be deep, and as hard as this anime tries, it doesn\'t have either. ""Hack Sign""...is a prime example of how to make a dialogue heavy anime that is dull (for an example of a good dialogue heavy anime, look no further than ""Crest of the Stars"").One of the main problems is that nothing ever happens in ""Hack Sign"". They would have had difficulty making this into a decent 13 episode anime, let alone a 26 episode one. What kept me watching was mainly the aesthetic pleasure that\'s derived from the gorgeous animation and music. Also, at the end of several episodes along the way, it does show flashes of brilliance with some chilling scenes that promised much... but ultimately delivered very little, if at all.Characters aren\'t much to be remembered by. I found myself spending a lot of time wondering why they were all so serious... they\'re playing a game ffs. People like to joke and play about in games. These guys on the other hand, prefer to stand around talking about their real life issues... in total, they must have spent a whole five minutes or so on playing the actual game! No wonder most of them seem really low level! And what\'s the big deal about about player killing? Having played these kind of games myself, I know it\'s an integral part of the gameplay, but this anime makes it out to be some sort of bad practice, and kicks up a huge fuss over it, even though people can just respawn afterwards. The accumulative result of all of this is that it didn\'t feel at any point that they were playing an MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online RPG).Throughout the anime, especially in the beginning, I often found it hard to understand the motivation behind a lot of the character\'s actions, which made the story and characters of ""Hack Sign"" feel very artificially driven. For example, if something serious happened like a player could not log out and is stuck in the game, wouldn\'t that make the game potentially very dangerous? You would think that it would get shut down at this point, but apparently no one cares about such a trivial matter, and players carry on playing the game as usual, as though it\'s no big deal. At least not all the characters are devoid of charm though, and after a while (a long while, admittedly), I did start to warm up to a couple of them like Crim (who is quite cool, and actually seem to be interested in playing the game).The ending... what the hell was all that about? They dragged the anime through 20+ episode just to reach THAT kind of conclusion? It was almost getting exciting towards the end, but the extremely anti-climatic ""climax"" just brought my ratings for this anime crashing back down again. I think that must have been the worst conclusion ever. After spending the majority of the series hyping up the ""mystery"", it barely explained anything. Throughout the anime I kept waiting for things to become clearer, and they never did. And also, ""Evidence"" must be the sh*ttest recap episode I\'ve ever seen. All it did was sum up all the the parts you don\'t understand and make you realise that there were even more of them than you remembered.

Not to mention the occasional chill sent down my spine. While it may be confusing it beats most clich&eacute;d RPG-Based Animes and Fantasy base Anime out there. The cliff hangers leave you waiting and wanting more. Even though it doesn't have so much action in it I think it is great. Beats the crap out of Pokemon, and Final Fantasy. What I love about this is it's so mysterious, and dark, and unpredictable. Unlike with Final Fantasy, Zelda, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh and so on. The music...is great to. The acting was great, the best I have ever seen. This is one of the bests in my opinion. In Fact .hack//SIGN is the first Anime I have seen, that was actually dark. With the many surprises in there, I have never been the same. There are many great characters in this series, some goofy, others serious, and just plain lovable. Tsukasa is a highly emotional enigma. Subaru is a personal fav. of mine. She's sweet, and cute. And they didn't try to hard to make them funny, or make their jokes funny. &quot;Tsukasa, let's play red light green light!&quot; -Sora. That was the best gag I have ever heard. David Whittenburg did wonders for Sora. And the Chrimson Knights. And A-20 is an adorable characterVery wonderful animation by Bee-Train along Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Minako Shiba, Satoshi Oshawa and others. They have tone, to their bodies, and the EFX are wonderful. There is some cell shading, but it's light, and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.Wonderful songs by Yuki Kajiura (FLCL, Fiction, Boogie Pop, NOIR, MADLAX) wonderful blend of Ambiance, and Orchestral sound. And mix of pop, and classical, makes it just right. I have two sound tracks to the show, and one to the game. And it's just wonderful. The songs are memorable, and greatly composed. Music is very important to me, and Yuki pulled it off nicely.Great voicing. Brianne Siddal, Amanda Win Lee, Kim Guest, and many others, including the man Dave Whitenburg (WHR, Speed Racer, Digimon 03) as the malevolent, yet goofy &quot;Sora&quot; My favorite Quote from Sora &quot;Tsukasa! Let's play red light green light!&quot; And Valiery Arem as &quot;The Voice&quot; Morgannah. &quot;I need you, as much as you need me. As long as we walk together, I shall protect you.&quot; Kim Guest, plays the sweet Subaru, and she brings her out very nicely.Who would have thought up such a novel of a story? It is brilliant. It's so mysterious, and not predictable. Full of dialog yes, but still. Fighting isn't everything. There comes a point when fighting gets ridiculous, and takes away from the story. And it's told across this show, the games, and Manga books. Truly the largest story I have seen in an Anime. (Not counting Pokemon)Like I said, seeing .hack For the first time was chilling. When you are watching light comical Pokemon all the time, plus G&reg; Rated Cartoons and you see something with that strong of thematic elements, you get chills. During one episode, when Aura, stabs Tsukasa, and who can forget, wasn't expecting that. And who can forget, &quot;Data Drain.&quot; This was a rare treat for me, because I hadn't (and still don't) seen that strong of Thematic Elements in Cartoons before. .hack is truly my Gate-Way Anime, to much better Anime.This is one of my favorite shows because it didn't go overboard with Violence, but it remained dark, and just unknown. It really bugs me when people give this show poor reviews. If it were just another type of it's Genre, fine. But I see this as a rather unique show. Not by it's Genre, by everything else. Stuff I had never seen before, prior to this. Imagine my reaction to Mimiru ;) Plus when they give it a low score just because it's full of dialog. Not everything has to be violent to be good! I hate it when Violence is so extreme, that I can't bare to watch it. (Inuyasha, Read or Die Wolf's Rain Cowboy Bebop) Because it's just distracting. Violence doesn't make for good story telling. But you don't see me giving those 0's or lower than 7, because of that. I gave Read or Die, a 8/10 over all. I can understand if you have ADHD, and you can't sit through it. Fine that's fact, doesn't mean you have to give it a low score. .hack//SIGN is more on thematic elements than combat, and more on mystery, than action. You want action, play the .hack GAMES, or watch something else You'll get your action. One of the best Anime I have ever seen. is great to. The acting was great, the best I have ever seen. This is one of the bests in my opinion. In Fact .hack//SIGN is the first Anime I have seen, that was actually dark. With the many surprises in there, I have never been the same. There are many great characters in this series, some goofy, others serious, and just plain lovable. Tsukasa is a highly emotional enigma. Subaru is a personal fav. of mine. She's sweet, and cute. And they didn't try to hard to make them funny, or make their jokes funny. &quot;Tsukasa, let's play red light green light!&quot; -Sora. That was the best gag I have ever heard. David Whittenburg did wonders for Sora. And the Chrimson Knights. And A-20 is an adorable characterVery wonderful animation by Bee-Train along Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Minako Shiba, Satoshi Oshawa and others. They have tone, to their bodies, and the EFX are wonderful. There is some cell shading, but it's light, and doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.Wonderful songs by Yuki Kajiura (FLCL, Fiction, Boogie Pop, NOIR, MADLAX) wonderful blend of Ambiance, and Orchestral sound. And mix of pop, and classical, makes it just right. I have two sound tracks to the show, and one to the game. And it's just wonderful. The songs are memorable, and greatly composed. Music is very important to me, and Yuki pulled it off nicely.Great voicing. Brianne Siddal, Amanda Win Lee, Kim Guest, and many others, including the man Dave Whitenburg (WHR, Speed Racer, Digimon 03) as the malevolent, yet goofy &quot;Sora&quot; My favorite Quote from Sora &quot;Tsukasa! Let's play red light green light!&quot; And Valiery Arem as &quot;The Voice&quot; Morgannah. &quot;I need you, as much as you need me. As long as we walk together, I shall protect you.&quot; Kim Guest, plays the sweet Subaru, and she brings her out very nicely.Who would have thought up such a novel of a story? It is brilliant. It's so mysterious, and not predictable. Full of dialog yes, but still. Fighting isn't everything. There comes a point when fighting gets ridiculous, and takes away from the story. And it's told across this show, the games, and Manga books. Truly the largest story I have seen in an Anime. (Not counting Pokemon)Like I said, seeing .hack For the first time was chilling. When you are watching light comical Pokemon all the time, plus G&reg; Rated Cartoons and you see something with that strong of thematic elements, you get chills. During one episode, when Aura, stabs Tsukasa, and who can forget, wasn't expecting that. And who can forget, &quot;Data Drain.&quot; This was a rare treat for me, because I hadn't (and still don't) seen that strong of Thematic Elements in Cartoons before. .hack is truly my Gate-Way Anime, to much better Anime.This is one of my favorite shows because it didn't go overboard with Violence, but it remained dark, and just unknown. It really bugs me when people give this show poor reviews. If it were just another type of it's Genre, fine. But I see this as a rather unique show. Not by it's Genre, by everything else. Stuff I had never seen before, prior to this. Imagine my reaction to Mimiru ;) Plus when they give it a low score just because it's full of dialog. Not everything has to be violent to be good! I hate it when Violence is so extreme, that I can't bare to watch it. (Inuyasha, Read or Die Wolf's Rain Cowboy Bebop) Because it's just distracting. Violence doesn't make for good story telling.

(Noir is another early work by YK, and also very good).  You should absolutely buy the soundtrack.  Don't bother watching the anime.The music is especially noticeable, because there is almost nothing else that will grab your attention on screen.  The background art is decent, but most of the animation simply reuses the same sets over, and over, and over again.  The first few episodes make you think that the anime is going to...turn into something really cool, but it never pans out.  The plot is entirely uninteresting, and the characters are either really annoying, or really boring, and often both.The anime is supposedly set in an online MMORPG (kind of like Sword Art Online), but it has got to be the most boring game ever made, because we almost never see any of them actually play the game.  Instead, they mostly sit around waiting for things to happen.  Of course, nothing ever does.All that would be okay if we had great characters and dialog, but the characters are entirely meh.  The authors attempted to make the dialogue deep and mysterious, but nothing of importance is ever said or revealed, because nothing of importance ever happens in the plot, and the characters don't develop in any meaningful way.  There's a little bit of action at the end, but after 20-something episodes of just waiting, I had long since ceased to care. turn into something really cool, but it never pans out.

Personally, it qualifies as one of my most favorite animes.  When i first ventured into it, I wasn't expecting much.  After all, the games for ps2 sucked.  Soon, I found the character development and color of Tsubasa and her peers to be interesting.  True, at times, the droning music and dull colors may make people fall asleep, but this tone is what characterizes .hack.  It is meant to be in a dark environment, making it...unique. unique."", ""Kudos for being one of the first few animes with the topic of MMORPG. That is the only positive i can say of this title. Having recently finish season one of Log Horizon and still being in the mood for more anime with this genre,i decided to watch this series.

Sadly,the story line was worst than it's artwork,it was just 26 episodes of characters talking to each other. There were little to no action sequences at all throughout the either series. Even the conversations between the characters were boring as they use a lot of scientific sounding jargon that i think were probably made up for the series. Now,i pride myself as only watching animes with its original Japanese dubbing,but after three to four episodes,it became too tedious and i had to switch to the English dub. That did not help as the series continued to be dull,wanting to finish the whole series,i labored through the remaining episodes.

Forget about the generic shounen anime tropes of annoying kids and unrealistic teenagers taking games way too seriously. This anime has bigger ambitions.Now, don't get too excited, while the premise features players being stuck in a video game, this is not like Sword Art Online or other average VRMMORPG anime, so don't be fooled by the setting. If you're seeking fast-paced action and epic battles, you've come to...the wrong place.Some may find .hack//SIGN slow and boring, but that's merely a testament to its dedication to story progression and character development through dialogue, emotions, and background information. Instead of mindless battles and defeating antagonists, .hack//SIGN sets its sights on solving mysteries and delving into the psyche of its characters. It's a role-playing game where growth occurs both inside and outside the virtual world. Who needs action and excitement when you can have long, yet meaningful, philosophical conversations and emotional introspection?'Don't take it too seriously; it's just a game'..hack//SIGN is generally gloomy, but not completely devoid of lighthearted moments. We have Mimiru, the young and slightly childish character who provides some much-needed balance to the show's serious and depressing atmosphere.

I've rewatched it recently and found that a lot of the themes, namely about growing up and coming out of one's shell, are spot on. Sign remains my favorite in the series, primarily because other entries are more adventure plots whereas this one is much more about character interactions and an overarching mystery about how to help Tsukasa.Most criticisms of Sign that you'll hear are valid; It's slow, the characters can be pretty insufferable from time to time, and its success has caused spiritual successors or follow-ups that one might like better. The score...is really quite good, though I could see where over 26 episodes, one might get tired of hearing the same music cues. Further, in spite of the brilliant watercolor backgrounds and hand-drawn nature of the show, I'd not defend Sign as being visually dynamic or particularly exciting artistically.Where Sign stands out is in drawing you in to its world (helpfully enough called 'The World') and its conflict. The music work and backgrounds are a start, being in and of themselves works of art that can stand alone. The characters interactions and bonds are vital and develop organically in ways that make sense given the individuals' psyches and goals. Leads towards fixing what's wrong in The World normally take an episode or longer to mature, so when the party does strap on their adventuring boots for a plot-relevant dungeon romp, the payoff seems greater.There's a lot of good character work here, with Tsukasa being so divisive and annoying because he is the up-his-own-ass woe-is-me Shinji Ikari that perhaps we all had a phase of being. Everyone in the show is vulnerable, though those vulnerabilities are what drive them towards their noble (or sometimes ignoble) ends. Dropping hints on each character's trauma takes place at a pace that might be seen as too slow, but at least avoids the trap of seeming like a rushed exposition dump.There are some flaws here that can't simply be handwaved as a matter of taste, hence why I don't think it's a masterpiece and or that anyone who objects to it is a philistine. There's some filler and fluff to pad out the methodical pace the show wants to go at, characters will swap loyalties readily to the point it can be hard to track what characters are working towards, dialog can sometimes be more accurately described as a whirlpool than a back and forth towards a point, and elements of the plot that are played up as really important may not get a commensurate amount of screentime.All that said, Sign is a work that speaks to me a lot. It is without doubt a bit of bias on my part that its flaws are ones I more readily accept and its virtues and potential are things I normally thirst for in anime, making for a perfect storm where such an obviously imperfect show can be so dear to me. Give it a watch yourself; even if you're not sucked in by it, its shadow stretches long across the MMO anime genre, making it as much a cultural piece as a show in and of itself. is really quite good, though I could see where over 26 episodes, one might get tired of hearing the same music cues.

I might not be finished with it yet, but I am enjoying this series sooo much. It is my top priority right now, along with Sukisho and Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro, to watch this, I just love it that much.Story (9): This is basically about a video game called The World and the characters that play this game. It's focused around Tsukasa, a male character that can't log out of the game. There are some things that have happened in the beginning that I still don't understand, but it's things that I can overlook. I find the story to be quite original, because...I haven't seen anything like this yet. The first four episodes, I thought, 'Yeah, this is alright, I guess.' Thankfully I ordered the next four episodes of it, because that was when it caught me. The whole thing just makes me wonder what's going to happen next.Art (8): Hmmm... I've seen some points in the anime where the art just gets kind of ugly. Don't get me wrong, it's got good art, but it's not the greatest that I've seen.Sound (9): I refuse to watch dubbed when subbed is an option, so I can't tell you much about the dubbed, but the subbed voices are, in my opinion, phenomenal. The voices fit perfectly with the characters. But there's one voice that I can't stand sometimes: Bear. I like the voice, but sometimes it gets annoying.Character (9): Oh, how I love some of these characters... I'm a pretty big Tsukasa fan, because he just, in one word, pwns. XD Sora is one of my favorite characters, too, because he's just so funny at times! He's a jerk in a happy-go-lucky kind of way. (He makes me think of Sakamochi from Battle Royale at points.) All of these characters, with the acception of one: Subaru. I really don't like her. I don't really know why... There actually is some character development! It's amazing! You never see character development anymore...Enjoyment (9): This keeps my attention pretty well. There are some boring parts mixed in there with a bunch of talking with Subaru. But that usually stops pretty soon and goes back to the interesting stuff. I really do enjoy this anime.Overall (9): I could quite possibly give this a ten, but I don't feel like I would be being honest. I will very rarely give a ten. So a nine is a big compliment, along with the fact I'm actually reviewing. .hack//SIGN is a great anime, but I feel like you will either love it or hate it. I happen to love it. It's interesting and actually surprises me at some points.So go watch it. Right now. ^-^ I haven't seen anything like this yet. The first four episodes, I thought, 'Yeah, this is alright, I guess.'

Right now. ^-^"", 'Well I almost don\'t know what to say about .hack//Sign, there was so much I loved about this show and then so much that made me want to claw out my eyes. Lets just dive into this.STORY:.hack//Sign takes place in a virtual reality MMORPG called ""The World"". Players in the world have different classes and play styles that they choose from and play. They all can play the game differently. We focus in on a player named Tsukasa who is trapped in The World, unable to log out. Tsukasa doesn\'t know why this is happening and neither does anyone else. The story progresses as Tsukasa...meets other players who all become interested and worried about why Tsukasa can\'t login. They embark on and EPIC journey to find out the mystery behind this... they don\'t seem to be in any rush what so ever because they seem to like sitting around talking....This has to be one of the WORST paced stories I have ever seen in anything ever. I get that the writers wanted to make the story and places feel real but this anime could have easily been around 14 episodes long, but it is dragged out way to much. It had such a great and interesting premise, but it just lacked any since of urgency. There were times were I could have easily just dropped the show but....CHARACTERS:The characters in .hack//Sign are very very well done and flushed out. Despite the horrible pacing of the shows story I didn\'t drop the show because the characters are just so good. They are all very real, I\'ve played MMORPGs before and I would have to say I have encountered basically someone who is like each and every character in .hack//Sign in a MMORPG. I found myself very attached to the characters because the way they interacted with each other felt very real. They all have their own reasons for wanting to help Tsukasa, and most of them felt very believable.SOUND:Yuki Kajiura... that is all. What an absolutely beautiful soundtrack! It made the moods of the show feel more passionate. It gave The World a feel of mystery, fantasy and scale. If I go on anymore I\'ll be rambling. I watched the English dub of the show (shut up you Elitest and Weeaboos) and I have to say I was fairly impressed. Brianne Siddall did an suburb job in portraying Tsukasa and Paul Mercier smooth fatherly voice was a perfect fit for Bear. Every time Mimiru talked I thought that Rei Ayanami was on crack LAWL (share same VA) A solid performance from all the English voice actors. Oh and I\'m sure all the Japanese VA\'s made reading the subtitles just ""grand"" For as much talking as this show has you owe it to your eyes to watch .hack//Sign in English plus it was a good dub.ART:The art in .hack//Sign was kinda meh. They made the world look nice, but nothing really stood out to me as WOW THAT LOOKS AWESOME. Same thing on the animation side, since they don\'t move much it was hard to really judge the animation quality, but for the few times there were ""action scenes"" it looked almost out of place. Not much else to say, it works but nothing really to brag or complain about.ENDING:I just had to put this in don\'t worry there are no spoilers. The ending of .hack//Sign ranks as the all time worst ending to any anime that I have ever watched. It just sucked and offered no closure at all. The story was just building up and up and up and the it ended in kind of a ""LAWL NOPE CTRL ALT DEL"" fashion.... I don\'t care if it\'s a lead into the games THE ENDING IS PARAMOUNT!! So yea that pissed me off. Don\'t get me started on the filler OVAs, an anime should be able to stand on its own without having to have OVAs or movies fill in the holes.OVERALL:Despite my hatred for the ending and the pacing of the show .hack//Sign was actually rather enjoyable. The story does pick up in the last 6 episodes and there is enough interesting aspects of the show to consider watching it. The music is great, the voice actor spot on and it is easy to relate to the characters. I enjoyed .hack//Sign but honestly to someone who wants something fast paced and action heavy (I.e SAO people who want to see more of SAO like stuff) I would pass on .hack//Sign.

It\'s a great watch for someone who is wanting really a character drama and for those people, you will enjoy .hack//Sign.', ""Okay, I generally cannot watch anything Studio Beetrain produces, Most of the stuff they put out generally is uninteresting or boring, I watched both Noir and Madlax completely through, Noir was boring, but Madlax was fantastic. The .hack series is a major major letdown, I personally feel that a series like this has way too many complicated terms and sometimes stops people from trying to follow the story, Maybe the story was just ahead of it's time but I feel that it needed to be stronger and unfortunately it is very easy to get lost, but I wish the story was put into a language...everyone can understand. everyone can understand."", 'Before I start off with this review I\'d like to point out that I haven\'t played any of the .hack video games, so this view is directly from a person that has no background information from the video games.This .hack is definitely different but similar in it\'s own accord compared to the other .hack series. The story is very plain and boring when read on paper, but really think about it, if you try to imagine the events happening in the real world it would be pretty messed up and interesting, the one thing I really liked about this...series is the fact that they put more emphasis on the players themselves rather than the characters inside the video game, the main character Tsukasa is ""stuck"" in the game, he can\'t seem to log out (although in the real world tsukasa is actually a female playing a male character in the video game).The story gets more complicated as the number of episodes escalates but it mostly still revolves around the main character tsukasa, weird events start happening and the item called ""Key of the twilight"" is mentioned, which is I\'m guessing the same item that they were looking for in .hack//roots, with that being said these events happened before roots, since in this one he obtained the key of the twilight while in roots it\'s considered to be a myth. Now the amount of episodes that Sign has is quite understandable, 26 isn\'t too much and too little either. Overall the story could use some more excitement considering there\'s almost no action in the whole series, the most you\'ll ever see is them wielding out their weapons and threatening each other to fight, but other than that it\'s usually just pure talking.The art of the anime is pretty straightforward, nothing too fancy or too unique about it, this was made in 2002 so don\'t expect much about they way they look, for those that are really picky with the art and animation, all I can say is that for you guys, it\'s bearable to watch and I\'m sure that\'s convincing enough for you guys to check the anime out.Now the final thing I want to talk about are the characters, tsukasa\'s design is very very plain, and I\'m completely comparing him/her to Haseo on this one because the way Tsukasa looks makes you want to go to sleep, I understand that his character in the video game isn\'t really for close combat or anything flashy like that but come on now... he\'s the main character can\'t you make him a bit cooler looking? The character that really intrigued me the most is Mimiru, the heavy blade character that befriends Tsukasa and Bear and is helping him/her trying to figure as to why Tsukasa can\'t log out of the game. What makes her so interesting is that she\'s the lead female character of the anime and yet she takes on the role as to what the male is supposed to be, which is the buffed up warrior role, and I think she plays her character quite well to a point where you know she has the ability to protect tsukasa and at the same time have that soft female side from her, (and plus I think I can relate to her because I\'ve always liked warrior classes from mmorpgs)Overall .hack//SIGN isn\'t such a bad anime, I\'ve seen way worse ones out there and it\'s clearly safe to say that you really need to play the video games if you want to experience the true feeling of getting into this anime because clearly from my perspective as a person who hasn\'t played the video games you can really see from the scores I\'ve given this.cheers. series is the fact that they put more emphasis on the players themselves rather than the characters inside the video game, the main character Tsukasa is ""stuck"" in the game, he can\'t seem to log out (although in the real world tsukasa is actually a female playing a male character in the video game).The story gets more complicated as the number of episodes escalates but it mostly still revolves around the main character tsukasa, weird events start happening and the item called ""Key of the twilight"" is mentioned, which is I\'m guessing the same item that they were looking for in .hack//roots, with that being said these events happened before roots, since in this one he obtained the key of the twilight while in roots it\'s considered to be a myth.

Not to sound immature but with the fantasy RPG setting, the massive franchise it spawned, and the flashy upbeat opening, I thought this was gonna be some grand, action-packed epic adventure. It was not. It's 26 episodes of everyone just moping and talking. Not that talking's bad, but where did any of these conversations go? Absolutely nowhere. I don't care about any of these characters. They're so dull and flat. The main character whose name I never remember even while...watching is just Shinji Ikari except instead of not wanting to be in the robot he doesn't seem to really want to play the game. But who's forcing him? This was just an absolute chore to watch. I'm normally pretty good with 26 episode series because even if I only have time to watch 1 a day I can still knock it out quick. This took me months because the whole time I couldn't decide to drop or just finish it off. If you want a sci-fi series that moves at a slower pace but is actually good go watch Ergo Proxy. watching is just Shinji Ikari except instead of not wanting to be in the robot he doesn't seem to really want to play the game.

I already knew the problems of this anime and really thought I could ignore it, it used that proposal of the MC stuck in the online game, which makes me already excited, even because I like the style. Yes, let\'s go to the review!1 - Story [6/10] - As I said earlier, I like Sign\'s proposal, but I don\'t think it was done well. The worst point of this anime is the fact that the development is extremely slow, the dense dialogue...does not hold you at any time, while watching the anime I felt that the dialogues did not change much and were not interesting, the plot and much dragged and undeveloped. Believe me, I am not the type who likes to put action on everything like SAO, but this anime had an embarrassment in action fights to make it more fun to watch. Despite all this, the anime has a good ending and as I said, a good story proposal, the problem was actually the execution of the idea.2 - Art [6/10] - I could be content with the very lively art scenes of Sign (There are very few) and give a 7 or 8 note for the art, however, the thousands of scenes without animation, scenes of painting static made me take a step back and give a grade 6, which could simplify as: Something interesting to watch.3 - [8/10] - Yes! Sign deserves an 8 at BGM, honestly, the soundtrack is somehow very good! I can\'t say it was very well used, but it is still good. The opening was not a big deal when it comes to art, but the opening song is really fun.4 - Character [6/10] - In this category I can say that I am very rigorous, the protagonist is the center of all animes, no matter which one, the characters that integrate are what will give life to the work. The feeling that frustrated me with Sign was the fact that the protagonist is a pain in the ass! All the first 10 episodes of Sign boil down to how to be friendly with the protagonist, that really bothered me. He is too slow to make decisions and has dragged himself through the work like a poor guy who can\'t solve anything. Unfortunately, I didn\'t get to like him ... Besides, all the other characters are in fact ""acceptable"", by the standard of characters, nothing too flashy.5 - Enjoyment [1/10] - Simply boring! As I said earlier, I don\'t mind not putting action in this type of anime, however, not the salvation for this anime. He was not amused at all. It failed to generate impact, failed to make it exciting, failed to make it interesting. Nothing! Only dialogue and dragged development. What a disappointment!Overall - The anime had a lot of problems, which made it boring. And I already say that it is impossible to ignore, unless you just want to put it on the list. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WORK! does not hold you at any time, while watching the anime I felt that the dialogues did not change much and were not interesting, the plot and much dragged and undeveloped.

Sora, what 7 year old is really this good at games so complex and parents let him stay up so late? xD BUT the Love between the main chars awwww &lt;3 hehe I like that =P but over all a 8 this is the average of the scores as of the way it should be not a random number. ', ""If you like a slow paced story, focussing on the characters with thoroughly immersive music, you will greatly enjoy this anime. If you like fast paced stories with action scenes led forward by the storyline, this anime is not for you. For those whom the rest of this review is not yet redundant, feel free to read on.The story is well crafted; while it appears the story is light-hearted, underneath it all it is quite dark. The theme of escapism runs throughout the series, and this is synced well with the aesthetics. The World is colourful and diverse, with canal based cities, green cliff-tops above...the clouds, deserts and snowy mountains to name a few, as well as the powerful music. You never forget it's just a game though, with the chaos gates and memories sounding like they were being retold through a headset being 2 very MMO effects used. The real world on the other hand, is black and white, crackly and silent, with lines told in text. It emphasises how enticing The World is compared to real life.The characters' stories are told fairly uniquely, in that there are two stories, for the in-game character and their real-life counterpart. These personalities are often different, and it underlines the theme of escapism. Interpersonal relationships do well from this as well, as characters can interact with not only other in-game characters, but also their real-life character. This complexity makes the character's feel realistic, and having characters from various walks of life reinforces another virtue of MMos: that people, no matter their age or gender or social status, can interact as equals.The music is by Yuki Kajiura. Her music is always outstanding, but it is either forced upon you, interfering with the story and making the music and the story very disjointed, or is used to immerse the viewer in the story, enhancing the experience. I can happily say this is definitely the latter, which is impressive considering how many of the soundtracks are sung in English; in fact, the songs are both the best of the soundtrack, and the most immersive.I came looking to burn through the anime and add the soundtrack to my music player; instead .Hack//Sign sat me down and showed me a masterpiece; this is definitely a must-watch for any who can watch a slowly unfolding story. It plays out like a spiral; you think it is unchanging, moving forward, but without realising the story is getting deeper and darker with each episode you go through. It does have some flaws; the ending was so fast I thought I missed an episode, and the camera does sometimes stay on characters for a long time, with little animation going on, but these are nit-pickings that don't have any real effect on my enjoyment of the anime. the clouds, deserts and snowy mountains to name a few, as well as the powerful music.

SIGN is a character study, and deeply introspective. It\'s not about videogames; it\'s about people who play videogames, and why.What makes it interesting is that the characters are roleplaying. What you see is not what is actually happening in the game (a common critique), but what they are collectively imagining is happening. The catalyst for the story is an encounter with a problem that supersedes the game, yet exists almost entirely within it. Slowly, over the course of the series, you...get a glimpse at the people behind the avatars. They shed the skin of stereotypical anime characters, existing within a bright color palette and strict archetypes, and become ordinary humans.Despite the cast spanning the gamut - from school kids to struggling single parents to CEO\'s, they are deeply relatable to the average viewer. Everyone has a reason to escape, to want to become someone else; and it\'s only when confronted with someone significantly more disturbed than themselves that they can look inward and face their own demons. This show is about a group of disparate people coming together to save someone, and in the processes, saving themselves.The pacing is, at times, unbearably slow - the bulk of the show is the characters having conversations with each other. The conversations are highly revealing if you\'re paying attention, but otherwise do not push the overarching ""plot"" forward. The soundtrack and world design is gorgeous and otherworldly, but it\'s only a stage. ""The World"", the videogame, is not what this piece is about. It\'s about the characters. If you can\'t accept that, you\'ll absolutely hate this show. If can, you might be pleasantly surprised. get a glimpse at the people behind the avatars.

The premise is there, but it's all very slow-paced which can really try your patience if you do not enjoy works solely for character interaction and want a steady plot.  That being said, the characters are varied and there is development of personality and relationships over the series.  The major downside though, and what made...me score this series poorly, is that so much is left unresolved.  I persisted until the end because of how well the mystery was developed and I wanted to know the answers, and was left unsatisfied.The opening theme is very nice, and the artwork itself is nothing special compared with recent anime, but environments within the World are nicely done.  Brief glimpses into the 'real world' in silent black and white do add something to the messages about escapism.Overall, it's something that shows certain themes through character interaction.

Guy is stuck in game, meets a array of different characters whom each have their personality flaws.That\'s all pretty good and right. Is one character really that bad in my opinion, hmm now i think about it my least favorite character was A20 because she never...really stood up for herself and she somewhat pissed me off as a result, sure she wasn\'t really a main character or anyone of great importance to the series in the end but as i was watching her constantly getting beaten up by monsters to the point she ended up told off on several by Mimiru.Another Character that also bugged me was Grim, with other character\'s talking about him i thought he would have been at least have a better personality towards others. I found myself on several occassions yelling at the screen ""maybe just listen"".  Everything like that aside there was none of the things most people look for such as fan service (pantie shot e.t.c)  or action, basically not enough to get a person hooked.

He finds himself in a dungeon without any memories of who he is, or what he\'s done.

One of the most noteworthy in the series was one of the characters suffering from a handicap using The World as a way to overcome their inability to walk. Later in the series, characters try to build relationships with each other outside of the game.My biggest beef with the story is that much of it is unexplained in the show, but delivered in the series of games. Lots of plot holes can be found within them and it leaves me a bit unsatisfied now that I \'need\' to order the games just to know everything ""The World"" has to offer me.The art was ""alright."" Some sequences where the show dealt with computer special effects were really slick, but the character animation was a bit chunky.

I don\'t know what more to say.To me the characters are the shows main draw they all receive their fair share of development and through the course of the show it steadily paints a picture of who the players are behind their characters. Intricate details help give them depth and make them as human as possible. Personal favorites are Crim and Sora, the former which deserved much more screentime and the latter whom, despite his annoying manner, the reason for which is explained, you can\'t help but love whenever he appears. Despite all the enjoyable characters there are some who I despise and shall remain nameless...Subaru.I thoroughly enjoyed this show, yes it has it\'s lowpoints where everything seems to creep to a halt, but then there are the highpoints which are amazing. Scenes that evoke powerful emotions, scenes that would make this series a masterpiece (if it weren\'t for the series shortcomings.)Overall 7/10 you won\'t be disappointed if you know what you\'re getting yourself into. of the World MMO, gets caught up in a huge scandal that comes to involve nearly every character in the World.The art wasn\'t the best, in my opinion of course, the design just rubbed me the wrong way at times the characters seem flat and have an odd ""fish-eyed"" look about them, Tsukasa in particular seems to look in different directions at times.The music is beautiful, simple as that.

While I will say it lacks a lot of action for being about someone trapped in an MMO, it really doesn't need that much action. All it really does it set the stage and give background information to the first game...of the .hack series, .hack//infection.The story was pretty good, a little rushed around the end but coherent and at times kind of tense.Art is dated by a bit but some of the background environments looked well made and its by no mean ugly.Sound was kinda eh, no music from the show stuck to memory, but i remember i didn't hate it.Characters aren't as fleshed out as they should be. If the show lacks action and features mostly talking, then it needs compelling characters to truly sell the show. What we got were Blackrose and Orca rip-offs and a few calls to the original game series and Tsukasa was ok i guess. It kind of felt like these characters were just shells of better characters.Gets a 7. Not bad, but by no means great. of the .hack series, .hack//infection.The story was pretty good, a little rushed around the end but coherent and at times kind of tense.Art is dated by a bit but some of the background environments looked well made and its by no mean ugly.Sound was kinda eh, no music from the show stuck to memory, but i remember i didn't hate it.Characters aren't as fleshed out as they should be.

Most of the characters have enough depth to them to carry the story.The story towards the end gets some what sloppy, and that did take away from the over all enjoyment of the series.  However, up until the last few episodes I couldn't wait to see what was going to come next.All in all, an excellent watch. .  and A must watch if you play kind of morpg regularly. "", ""Each category will contain detailed pros and cons and then I will write if I would watch this anime again and if I recommend it.-----Story - 6/10+ The mystery involving the main protagonist and the plot was entertaining. I liked the involvement of additional mysteries throughout.+ Having played the first .hack game series a long time ago, the game world of the anime brought back some nostalgia for me.- The story is pretty slow-paced and I found myself bored quite a bit since the anime is mostly dialogue. I could only watch a few episodes at a time to prevent myself from standing up, going...outside to scream, then coming back inside very calmly to turn the TV off.-----Characters - 8/10+ The main protagonist is cynical and unsociable at first, but he progresses into a positive person later on. Great character development there.+ Most of the characters have personalities that can be identified in a typical JRPG. Hey, that's not a bad thing!+ The dialogue offers little to obscure information about the players behind their characters. Although not important since the anime focuses on the game world, it gives it a sense of realism to know just how different the players are from their characters.- A few characters were either dumb, annoying, or both.-----Art - 10/10+ The colors of each character and the different areas of the game world are beautiful and attractive. I love, love, love the art! Look at me, I'm like an 8-year-old girl again.+ The animation is very smooth and rich, like the greatest strawberry smoothie you've ever seen. Not the best one you've tasted though, sadly.+ The buildings of the main town and the numerous canals that run through it are reminiscent of a lovely European city. I want to live there.-----Sound - 8/10+ The music score is very well done and it offers plenty of different sounds. I might consider buying the soundtrack at some point.+ The opening theme is impressive and can be addicting, which alone gives this category high points. I found myself humming the theme on the toilet after a few episodes.+ Most of the characters have terrific dialogue and the English dub helps bring those characters to life, most of the time.- A few characters have annoying or bland voices. One particular minor character made me want to punch her in the throat.- The music can be overwhelming at times, especially during some of the dialogue.-----Enjoyment: 5/10+ Even though I felt like I was struggling with this anime at times because of the slow-paced story, I'm glad I watched it to the end. In retrospect, the mystery of the character tied to the game world encouraged me to go on. The personalities of the characters, the excellent animation, and the great music helped drive that encouragement even further.- For an anime set in an MMORPG game world, I was pretty disappointed and surprised by the lack of action scenes. I don't know if it was intentional, but plenty of action scenes would have made this anime a lot more enjoyable to watch.-----Final Score - 37/50-----Would I watch this anime again? Probably not. It's good enough for me to complete it once.Do I recommend this anime? I would say yes. Don't let some of the criticism I have stop you, if the positive points in my review piqued your interest, give it a shot! outside to scream, then coming back inside very calmly to turn the TV off.-----Characters - 8/10+ The main protagonist is cynical and unsociable at first, but he progresses into a positive person later on.

Dot Hack Sign is the first(that I know of) to do trapped in a MMORPG.   The characters consist of Tsukasa who is unable to log out, and is the only character to experience this problem. Mimiru, a heavy blade who is someone who tries to help Tsukasa but becomes frustrated easily.  Bear, a sword user who is the logical/calm one of the cast. Finally there is Subaru, a heavy axe wielder, and also a guild leader...and another who tries to help Tsukasa.  For the most part this anime consists of drama as the characters bicker in a way that is reminiscent to high school.  As they continue to get angry at each other, you're left wondering why they don't go their separate ways and be done.  Even at the end of the anime when you think they have bonded, you are thrown a curve ball gain.  The characters while fleshed out a bit, aren't given the development they fully deserve, instead leaving it up to you to piece it together.  The soundtrack is written by kajiura yuki, who is known for her work on the SAO soundtrack and her contributions to works by Ufotable. If you are looking to experience the full entirety of Dot Hack I recommend saving this for last.  This serves as a prequel and only expands more on the games. and another who tries to help Tsukasa.

The World as the RPG is called is one with a setting of monsters, player characters and dungeons. Tsukasa is a detached and introverted character that has a number of mysteries about his player character. Many weird happenings seem to surround Tsukasa and his involvement in a rare item called 'The Key Of The Twilight' sparks Tsukasa's meeting with different online characters and the befriending of their real life counterparts; All without ever meeting face to face in reality. What is strange about Tsukasa is that he can't seem to log out of The World. Subaru and Silver Knight of The Crimson Knights continue to look for proof of why Tsukasa cannot log out or the existence of The Key of the Twilight. Meanwhile Bear, Mimiru, and BT as Tsukasa's friends try to help him understand who he really is and how he can return to the real world.Here’s the one thing in this show that might tune out a lot of people out: At the first beginning of the series, it felt very slow-paced and the plot is mostly hard to follow at a few times or even sometimes if you went to take a bathroom break, you won’t miss any important detail considering it’s very scatter-brained. Also, the plotline where the character Tsukasa can’t log out in the game and the whole “you die in the game, you die for real” aspect, which I still call bullshit considering people would check that before any game’s initial release and yes, it may be just an anime but it doesn’t mean any type of logic should back thrown in the backseat. There’s also that this is a dialogue-heavy show, which is fine for an anime although the dialogue can be dull a few times, possibly enough to put you into sleep.Characters in here are actually……decent although slightly askew with more character than meets the eye. Tsukasa, the lead character, is kind of a jerkass in the game, but in the real world has been through a lot of depressing things in his life. Mimiru, one of the first characters we met in the show is the tomboyish energetic player who, like any other player, plays there for fun and when it comes to helping Tsukasa, she seems more like the lead rather than him. If it would’ve been focused on her from the beginning, I would have liked it more. Bear is the older yet kind of wiser player; Subaru (which I did joked about her name because I didn’t know at first, ‘Subaru’ is also the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster.) is the one of the heads-in-charge of the Crimson Knights, who wants to keep things civil in “The World” (BTW, most generic name for a MMORPG game) and Crim is the one who helped mentored Subaru for when she first enter “The World”. BT is the insider of all things “The World” and……she hates lettuce? Wait, what was important about that? Oh, and Sora is the douchebaggish character who apparently assaults women when playing the game.The animation supplied by Bee Train is not really that stellar but offers nothing in the first half. Bee Train is being responsible for the infamous girls-with-guns trilogy (Noir, Madlax, El Cazador de la Bruja), which only two of them are my favorite (Noir, ECDLB) and most of it is just talking and talking and for a game that is RPG, I expected to be at least more balanced with the action and dialogue but it was a major drag. Character and art design are nothing risqué and mostly very safe territory and the closest thing to some fan service is the outfits that Mimiru and Subaru got on in the game.One thing I can say about the music is that it’s the best thing going for the show as I found every piece of music, including the opening “Obsession” , the ending  “Gentle Dawn”  and the background music, made by Yuki Kajiura, to be the more interesting part of the show. Hell, I hear on the DVD you can select an option to only hear the music and there’s the Bandai/PCB Productions dub, which is decent as best but has some stilted acting from the cast as they are really no standouts, although this is the first time I hear noticed Brianne Siddall, who usually play young boy roles in anime, and hearing more of Amanda Winn-Lee since she went from Texas voice-acting from being in L.A.FINAL VERDICT: This has a good premise going for it but met with lackluster execution but manages to go somewhere in the final part of the series. I can honestly see why most people love it, which associates it with the RPG element, which I will recommended to those who loved it but if you’re like me and you enjoyed the soundtrack more, just get that and don’t look back. online role playing game in the near future, characters try to play out the goals they set for entertainment and passing of time.

A great deal of the series focuses on conversation, often introspective ones. Dives into philosophy.Realistic characters who are more diverse than a typical hyper-active ""defeat everything"" Bildungsroman shounen, this includes a realistic and clinically depressed amnesiatic lead. The characters all experience a variety of e.g. trauma and coping mechanisms, and these themes may not be appreciable for those searching for a simple feel good escapist story. In my experience, those who have dealt with trauma typically have...a far higher appreciation of this anime.Social issues which were taboo or out of the general public consciousness in Western countries at the time of production, dealt with on a philosophical basis and with thought experiments. These include dealing with what it means to be alive, the differences between online and real-ife lives, the relationship of technology to society, virtual versus physical bodies/embodiments or soul vs flesh, amongst other issues which were taboo and very-well=written into the story. Including aspects of romance.Lush designs. The artwork for the settings are phenomenal, with lush detail and a wide variety of settings, they enthral you with mystery and a sense of needing explloration. .hack// brings to life an rpg fantasy which was really just a dream when it was created. (Bear in mind this series was released before World of Warcraft and all it influenced.) The series presents a romantic image of a complex RPG and both the mundane and the arcane tasks and behaviours one can espouse there. Note: communications in the series correspond with period communications.Ethereal, otherworldly, divine music. The soundtrack to .hack//SIGN is perfectly developed to flow with the series. The soundtrack also holds immense standalone value and is probably the best OST I\'ve ever heard. Kjiura Yuki simply outdid herself in her work for .Hack/SIGN and this cannot be overstated.Multi-layered story. .Hack//SIGN serves as the classic introduction point to the .Hack// franchise. (however one could start elsewhere.).Hack// is a multimedia franchise which created something of a shared universe, long before the MCU. This was both praised and scorned (if you lived in a region where access to .hack// materials was difficult to procure.).Hack//SIGN focus primarily on the wavemaster Tsukasa, and is principly the story of Tsukasa and their development amidst a greater world of events.However, the story is not only the story of Tsukasa and where Tsukasa\'s story ends, other stories continue. .Hack//SIGN is the prequel for example to the original trilogy .Hack// games, which follow an important character from the installment.Other characters also have other lives, actions and histories; and exist in their own installments which serve as prequels, sequels and concurrent stories. Expect for example to hear mention of famous characters or events from in-universe, and have these names appear again. The series portrays this realistically (as the players experience news and have their own memories), but also these ""loose ends"" are hardly loose as they connect with bigger events beyond a single-installment.The franchise has in fact many layers of depth, from the real world, to The World, to a slow unravelling of mysteries of The World and the behind the scenes and everything in between.What not to expect:Action/fighting. This is just about the opposite of an action anime. The series relies heavily on talking. Problems are not generally solved by fighting, and reprecussions of fighting/arrogance, ireesponsibility, loss are all weighed highly.Classic shounen / Escapist power trip. The lead character is most often in need of help, reluctant and anti-social.Fast pacing. The series is not fast-paced as it focuses on slowly building character dynamics. You learn a lot about characters, their mindsets, and how each introspects and views the world. It brings up many interestign psychological, sociological and philosophical points as a result; but the series has slow resolutions to psychological events, with a lot of weight, much like in the real world. The latter part of the series does speed up with a lot of larger events oming together and reaching a head, but don\'t expect these to come on early or quickly. The characters grind so to speak.""strong male lead"" - Tsukasa is not what would be described as a strong male lead. A better comparison often made would be Shinji from Evangelion, who is damaged and clearly ""going through some stuff."" Except in Tuskasa\'s case, there is no giant robot.All in all, I recommend this anime to:those interested in slower anime (it\'s nice watching late at night due to the settings to), beautiful art and music, philosophy/psychology/sociology, RPGs of the 90s, romance, LGBT, trauma, relationships, communication, thought experiments, mystery.Note: For a good retrospective of the installment, I highly recommend the video series done by youtuber: Nero a far higher appreciation of this anime.Social issues which were taboo or out of the general public consciousness in Western countries at the time of production, dealt with on a philosophical basis and with thought experiments.

The opening intro is incredibly well done and alluring. One of the best anime openings of the 2000s.The characters? There aren't many but they're heavily developed as the story unfolds and they all have a story to tell.The setting is an MMORPG called The World where a young boy named Tsubasa is suddenly teleported to. He didn't go there willingly and he has no...idea HOW he got there nor he can he log out.The beauty of .hack//Sign isn't the world itself but the story. See, the MMORPG isn't the plot. It's a backdrop.The MMORPG they're in is purely used as the setting for the story. It's about the characters whose stories are as human as they can be.The characters all suffer from real world issues. They all play the MMORPG to escape their lonely or troubled lives just like most people. They want a distraction.If you're expecting a heavy action based MMORPG anime like Sword Art Online, this isn't that.This is PURELY a drama. It's a mystery drama. There is no grinding for higher levels or trying to become stronger.It's purely a drama/mystery set within an MMORPG setting.There's about 4 characters in the entire show with minor NPCs and other PCs who only appear 1 or 2 episodes showing up.These 4 characters are heavily developed thoughout the show and the bond they form is truly something, you learn about their life outside the MMO and who they actually are + their troubles (i.e alcoholism)I can't really compare this show to another because it's just that deep.There's genuinely moments that make you question what is going on.There are moments that may trigger you if you have PTSD from abuse.There are VERY dark moments involving or relating to suicide/self harm.This is not a cute Shonen type anime. This is not an anime where everybody is happy.This is a real life anime set within an MMO setting.I will reiterate what I said earlier..the MMO IS NOT PART OF THE PLOT.It's purely the backdrop for the events that unfold.I highly highly highly recommend this anime purely because it's got an incredible score (as in music), a very very well developed cast of characters and the animation is very crisp even today.And there's a plot twist you wouldn't ever expect.The entire anime is about Tsubasa and finding out who he is and why he is in The World. But it's also about real world problems impacting the lives of those around him.It isn't supernatural. It isn't for kids. It's a very deep and incredibly well crafted anime.Tsubasa doesn't have super powers. He isn't the hero of the story. He is merely another player.The story doesn't have a hero. Just like real life.If you like realistic heavy drama anime that will leave you questioning what is going on and wanting more then I highly recommend it.It's one of those late night adult swim Seinen type shows.Just remember if you decide to watch it..Tsubasa isn't the hero. And nobody is coming to save him. idea HOW he got there nor he can he log out.The beauty of .hack//Sign isn't the world itself but the story. See, the MMORPG isn't the plot.

But for some reason, I felt the unique need to express my views on this series unlike any of the others I have seen.Art Style:While the art style is a bit old given when it was aired it is mostly a clean viewing experience. There is the odd frame where the animation quality is noticeably lower but fortunately my attention was captivated enough for the odd error to be easily ignored.Sound:There is a few points to be covered here. Overall the sound was pleasant to listen to, no errors, nothing \'too\' out of pace. But. I found myself...asking why on earth some sections played specific music. A few separate scenes with a \'murderous\' character had the suspense killed by a jaunty tune that you would expect from a comical scene. Not one with high tension and at key story points, this irritated me as a more serious tone would have been far more gripping. However, the use of no sound or edited sound during specific scenes allowed a clear sense of separation between reality, The World and the characters memories.Story:I will be honest. I had no grasp of what was supposed to be happening story wise for a good portion of the start of this anime. Asides from a lot of conjecture and a few ideas nothing solid is presented until a ways into the series which I feel may cause a lot of people to give up on this anime early. Once the story dropped a few plot points and explained a couple of things (sometimes too conveniently) having an understanding allowed me to enjoy the anime more rather than questioning everything with no bite.Character Progression:Having finished the anime I am happy with how the main characters were in terms of story. There was a lack of character development all around with some training montages that seem to yield no results except to build the characters confidence. Given that the intro is supposed to show the main characters you would expect them to \'feel\' like main characters once being introduced. But some of the characters took a ridiculous amount of time to be included in the main story and become involved with the other characters.A major character flaw that was painfully in my face was that if a group of people in a video game knew someone was in there for real, they would act in a completely different manner. I\'m not talking about ""oh god lets get you out of here"" but using their intelligence as real people to help someone. There is talk of the real world and logging off so the fact reality isn\'t used to their advantage confuses me. If breaking character, meeting in the real world and logging off is common talk why not go the distance and log off at ideal times such as before death etc. Not to mention a character knowingly making things difficult for the person stuck inside the video game with the knowledge they can come to harm goes against the morals of the normal person playing the character.Subbed Version:Now... I understand not all subbed versions will be the same, but the two versions I viewed had, at times, horrible translation. Hearing common phrases that were translated so wrong in responses to characters made me feel like I was missing a lot of context and some conversations made little sense apart from just agreeing with each other. The intro... I understand some things don\'t translate well into English but an introduction about ""A headache"" and other nonsensical lines made no sense to any part of the series. While the intro didn\'t look too shabby, the dialogue looses appeal.Personal Views:I\'m not quite sure why I decided to write this review, possibly just to share my odd experience of this anime or to express my thoughts to come to some understanding. I only rated this anime a 6 due to the slow pace, late story and odd music choices. Now I understand people might expect a lower score from all the negatives I have listed but for some reason I quite liked it overall. I guess I enjoyed how different the anime was. A lot of Animes focus on epic battles, fan service or some kind of niche but there is more to this anime than the surface shows.

Hack.Sign is not for everyone, I was unsure if it was for me until part way through. It was a nice change from the norm.', 'Kinda funny how this show comes off as a deconstruction of SAO and other Isekai anime even though this came out years before the Isekai genre went supernova.Anyway, I can certainly understand why the show has a cult following from it\'s great soundtrack, solid characters (Ex. Sora is by far my favorite and Dave Wittenberg is a delight in the role) and slight psychological horror atmosphere (Ex. Tsukasa\'s real-world flashbacks). There are intriguing themes touched on (Ex. depression, social isolationism and escapism) and at it\'s heart it\'s a rather touching story of strangers coming together to help a person in need.But MY GOD...is this anime slow!! I don\'t mind slow-pacing at all (Ex. I love Tarkovsky flicks) but this show did not need to be 25 episodes. Too often the dialogue gets bogged down by drab repetitive exposition and the whole thing ends of a frustrating inconclusive note. It\'s ties to the hack game series also effects this show\'s ability to stand on it\'s own. The animation is solid but nothing quite spectacular.It surprises me that this show aired on Toonami because the promos made it look like an action show when that is far from the case. The action is few and far between and frankly, not very spectacular either.A flawed but unique series that brings a refreshing emotional depth to it\'s ""trapped in a game"" premise. is this anime slow!!

It really did have some interest for me despite my general avoidance of MMORPG themed shows. I wanted to watch it because .hack is such a huge franchise. After testing .hack//Legend of the Twilight, I wanted something a little more mature and decided to watch the first anime of the franchise.The premise is really interesting. I liked that the ""trapped in the game"" theme was reserved for just one mysterious player. The story really does handle the premise well overall, but I do not like the WAY it was told. Most people will tell you this...is anime has trouble with pace and they are very correct, but it is more than just slow. I find that much of the dialogue was just talking in circles and no one really used intelligent deductive reasoning. That is a huge problem in a story that is meant to be an intellectual mystery. It felt like every character wanted to know the answers, but didn\'t want to process the clues on their own so they would just go to someone else to do the thinking for them. After a character would meet with several people, there wasn\'t any new information. That was a real drag, especially in the beginning.I felt pretty frustrated with how hard the main character, Tsukasa, was to crack. His aversion to people while understandable, was just hard to watch. I didn\'t understand why someone who was so confused about their own situation would be so determined not to gather information.The character development was alright. With the extent of the dialogue, I would have liked to have seen more fleshing out from these characters. This all falls back to the issue where everyone just likes to talk about nothing. several scenes were short conversations where they did little more than greet each other and then share a snide remark before the next scene abruptly transitions.The middle of the anime was the strongest story telling, as the plot finally gets rolling. There were some very emotional scenes and circumstances that made me feel more attached to the players and we start to see the personalities develop. Unfortunately, by the very end they wasted all of the careful buildup on an utter disaster!**possible spoiler**They set up a final boss battle and then never explain how they resolved the problem. They had all this time in 26 episodes to make a great ending and they just didn\'t have a climax or resolution. The OVAs do help explain that everyone makes it out, but that feels like a cheap shot.**end spoiler**The art is beautiful. The character designs are pretty detailed and compelling to watch. The background work is solid and feels like a true 3-D space. But damn this studio had trouble staying consistent. Throughout the series, Subaru\'s mark changes shape dozens of times, the proportions changed on the costume embellishments, and it is clear that different people worked on different episodes.""The Eve"" was actually comical because of the blatant animation shortcuts. We see shadowed faces from a far perspective during quite a few conversations. They pretty much gave up on shading the faces when you did see them and they were largely expressionless. They used very few frames and people simply appeared in their paces rather than smoothly approaching.The shortcuts indicate that they were losing budget, but the remaining episodes look really good. The budget hunch does make sense however given the way the story ended.I liked the sound for the most part. The music is very pretty even though the lyrics don\'t really grab me. A lot of the vocals are in English and the pronunciation isn\'t terribly distracting like a lot of Japanese attempts at English. I feel that the balance was off and the music was too loud for the dialog though. The dubbing in English and Japanese is pretty average to fairly good depending on the character.Despite the problems, I did enjoy the anime. While lost in the execution, I still wanted to see more, because I really wanted to know what was going on. I felt connected enough to the characters to invest my time in watching another episode of fruitless chitchat.Overall I feel pretty neutral about the production.

That isn't to say the other characters don't get to shine, well they do, and some are well rounded while most fall short of development but nonetheless are interesting (in their own way) and important.This may lack action but the mysteries are interesting enough of a reason to stick around. :) the series is Tsukasa and everything revolve around him.

Considering it's the flagship series of a massive commercial franchise, it's extremely baffling how this is the show that got made: There is almost no action, the story progression is extremely slow, there is zero fanservice (a major bonus as far as I'm concerned), and nearly the entire show is just still shots and dialogue. There is even a gay relationship between two of the main characters that involves neither offensive okama caricatures nor awkward unfunny homophobia nor titillating male gaze lesbian kiss scenes.The story's conceit, of getting stuck in an online game, is basic by now thanks to....hack spawning a litany of rip-offs, but those series are mere specks of dirt on the soles of .hack//Sign's boots.This is a show about the alienation we feel in modern society, the dangers of not logging off (thank you to my friend Abdul for that one), overcoming abusive parents, confronting your failures as a father, and the joys of escapism. The series tells you the importance of not getting sucked into escapist fantasies, in the gentlest, most sympathetic way possible.Thanks to this being the start of an enormous franchise, there is a lot of depth to the story, setting, and characters that's lacking in generic stuck in a video game isekai clone #45992.

These characters are good precisely because they're not totally likable; just like real people, they have relationships outside of you, they have moments where they are too stressed or frustrated to be friendly or helpful or funny or insightful, they don't have complete self-awareness, and when they experience those negative emotions it's not necessarily in a way that's funny or entertaining.The art is great for the time the show was produced.

Also, this show was actually part of a much MUCH larger story and unless the viewer were invested in all of it, SIGN would seem like a very boring show.This series was part of a larger package called ""project .hack"" and included a four-volume Playstation2 game series and accompanying four-volume OVA.  The idea being that the show was the prelude to the games which happened concurrent to the OVA.  It was an ambitious idea, but had the...unfortunate side effect that despite the series having a conclusive ending, there was still a lot that was left unexplained...  until you play through the games.This is probably one of the first series to introduce the idea of being ""stuck"" inside of an MMO game.  Because it was intended to be more of a seamless lead-in for the rest of the franchise, when viewed separately is unfortunately where things fall apart.  The viewer has to have bought into the .hack// universe and continued the storyline for any of it to make sense.  The show follows a single character, Tsukasa, a caster character who cannot leave the game, and different groups of players who are either out to help Tsukasa, or they believe he is the key to some secret event within the game.The artwork is pretty consistent throughout the series and outside of a few key locations, there isn\'t a lot of detail in either the characters or their backgrounds.  What is notable is the contrast between scenes depicting the game world and the real world.  The game world is always bright and colourful, while the real world is shown in varying shades of grey with some very muted colours.The heart of the show is in the characters and its a shame that they don\'t get the attention they warrant.  Mimiru is one of the main characters and one of the first to reach out to Tsukasa, but by the end of the series you know nothing about her.  The others get some slightly better treatment, the paraplegic, the travelling businessman, the estranged father, the aging model, the annoying middle-school student, and so on.  Don\'t get me wrong, there is some character development, it just seems to be bogged down in filler or left to be ""discovered later"".The sound for the show is actually quite good.  SIGN is among the list of shows where I sprung to buy the soundtrack.  Yuki Kajiura provides the music as well as the opening and closing themes.  The music ranges from some beautiful piano pieces to more celtic-sounding tunes.Despite what my review seems to say, I did enjoy this series.  A big part of that enjoyment came from having immersed myself in the .hack franchise.  By the time I had gotten around to watching this anime, I had already completed the games and the accompanying OVA.  The result being that I already had a pretty good idea of what was going on.Would I recommend this series?  Yes, as part of the .hack// package.

I mean I\'ve played the first two games that were on the Playstation 2 and read a few of the mangas and books but my introduction to the series was through the .Hack//Sign anime. I first saw this anime airing on I think it was the Adult Swim block on Cartoon Network back in 2002ish. While I didn\'t watch it from the beginning. I did watch a few scattered episodes and was blown away by the world within the World, the fictional video game of the...anime. And not to mention that really cool opening with what looks like a lady trying to be like Tron just dancing. It definitely gave me some chills.I finally got the chance to sit down and watch it a few years ago, though I forgot to write a review on it here like I intended. So, I rewatched it for the second time and well, let\'s break down my review of the show. eh?Story:.Hack//Sign is the story of a young player, a Wavemaster (which is basically a magic-user in The World) named Tsukasa, who discovers he is unable to log out of the game and he has no memories of what happened prior to waking up with no memories. So he goes around inside the game, trying to piece together what happened to him and who he is. And along the way, he meets other players in the game, who all try to help him figure out why he can\'t log out. To me, the premise of being trapped inside a VR-esque game can be both exciting and a little scary, but honestly, I like this plot very much. Though if you ever want to get the full story of the .Hack series as a whole you would have to read all the novels, watch all the animes, and maybe play the games. But I\'m happy with just enjoying the little story that .Hack//Sign tells. So while most of the anime takes place in The World, we do get some flashbacks and a few scenes of what\'s going on in the real world.ArtThe art and animation are very beautiful. Everything looks fluent and pretty. The characters all look awesome too, even the Grunties, the mascots of the anime\'s ""Game World"" look adorable. Of course, there are some creepy aesthetics in the show as well like Macha, the cat character who has ties to Tsukasa. I like it a lot. The dungeons that the characters go into always made me want to go into the anime and explore them, too.Sound:As I said earlier, the music is amazing, especially the opening and of course the ending song is gorgeous. The background music often sets the tone during serious conversations between the characters or even makes things creepier during certain scenes. The English dub, which is what I grew up with, is pretty good though sometimes the characters sound a bit weird to me, I think that\'s just me. Overall, the music is quite possibly the strongest point in the anime.Characters:Well, the characters are all well designed and every single one of them was endearing though sometimes Mimiru came off as a pushy brat and Tsukasa himself was a bit standoffish at times. My particular favorite among the characters was Lady Subaru, who I thought was a princess of sorts within the game when I first saw this show as a 12-year-old. I also liked how brotherly Bear was to everyone. He was pretty much the big brother to everyone and knew when to be serious and when to try and take everyone\'s minds off of their troubles. Of course, the one thing I have to complain about is how Bear and Mimiru resemble Orca and Black Rose. I don\'t know how common their ""avatars"" are supposed to be but coming from someone who doesn\'t know much about the .Hack series at all, I\'m just gonna say that it feels lazy to copy and paste the designs of one character onto another unless they\'re supposed to be clones or copies of the original characters. That\'s my only complaint.Enjoyment:I thoroughly enjoyed this little series. I just wish it was a lot longer because I wanted to know more about The World, but I suppose I better watch the other animes and read the novels for that.Overall:I highly recommend this if you want a good fantasy series that\'s not long and dragged out or just want something to binge on a weekend. But let me just say that this is the first anime to feature people being trapped in a game. So if you like Sword Art Online or Log Horizon, or just the .Hack series in general than this is well worth the watch. anime.

I feel like I\'d seen this before..I think I watched it in the past but I\'d forgotten.  I was reminded of this anime from seeing it on a friend\'s list here on this site.. I\'d remembered playing the games and wanted to give the anime a shot.Wow.  Just wow.I\'m pretty picky when it comes to anime.  The gory, crazy stuff doesn\'t really do it for me.  The darker stuff, not so much.  I\'d never been tempted to write a review before, but after finishing this engaging anime in < 3 days, I felt compelled to....My friend didn\'t seem to like it as much as I did.Story:The story revolves around a character named Tsukasa who, by an ""accident"", becomes trapped inside an online game called ""The World"".  Trapped meaning he cannot log out.Art:The art style .. really isn\'t *that* good.  It seems dated.  However, I\'ve always been a proponent of ""graphics don\'t make the game"" and that is obviously the case here.Sound:Alright.  I wish I could give this more than a 10.  The music in this show is OUTSTANDING.  I don\'t think I\'ve EVER heard better music in an anime.Character:The characters are deep and engaging, all having their own extremely defined personalities.Enjoyment:I\'m not really even sure why I\'m addressing this, but, hey.  I was so engaged I watched the entire series in less than 3 days.Overall:One of the best animes I\'ve ever seen.  It\'s dark, deep, engaging, mysterious, fun.. and the list goes on and on and on.

It takes place in an MMORPG (Multi Member Online Role Playing Game) and set the bar for all other online computer game animes and mangas. However, this anime is not what you would expect it to be; a hack and slash dungeon crawler. It is a character study, a story that focuses on the growth and development of the characters. If you are looking for high octane action and mind numbing brain candy, this is not the anime for you by any means. But if you love character development to drive the story and like using your brain...during your anime experience then you will not be disappointing. .hack//SIGN delivers structural complexity and character strife in full force. Falling in love with characters never felt so natural.CharactersThe entire cast acts like one big dysfunctional family that all center around the protagonist, Tsukasa. Everyone has their own personal drama that exists inside and out of ""The World"" which becomes integral to the plot. Everyone is foil for another even as they change and learn from their experiences all the while trying to find out more about Tsukasa\'s offline identity. Throughout the series we are shown real world clips of everyone\'s offline identity which can be a huge eye opener and explain a lot as to why these characters act the way they do. Just like when you play a MMORPG this diverse cast bands together to reach their goal in an epic battle where the fate of ""The World"" sways in the balance. Complex character relationship and betrayals will leave you begging to know more.SoundProbably one of the most rewarding soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. See-Saw\'s Yuki Kaijura composed the character defined soundtrack for the series, inspired by Celtic music and video game themes. This gives the soundtrack a very misty mountain feel to it with adventure looming over the horizon. Lyrics for all the songs are very powerful in terms of sucking you into this dream world of might and magic. The opening themes ""Obsession"" and ending ""Yasashii Yoake"" (優しい夜明け, Gentle Dawn) are both performed by See-Saw and set the perfect town for the series. The voice acting in both the Japanese and English Dub are exception, but nothing out of this world. It\'s always nice to be able to listen to an anime and not be thrown off by the voices. The characters being an important part of the story, the characters voices needed to fit their roles well.Art and AnimationOriginal character designs by Evangelion master artist Yoshiyuki Sadamoto reflects well the ""Swords and Sorcery"" genre, also relying on Celtic imagery: Director Mashimo acknowledged similarities between Bear\'s design and Mel Gibson in his role as William Wallace, an example of Celtic warrior. The action animation, for what little there is, is top notch and exciting. When things become action packed in this anime .hack//SIGN can kick things into high gear and deliver. The flashback and real world imagery is always seen through a T.V. static lens with the sounds filtered or taken out all together in exchange for silent film subtitles instead. This gives these moment a very creepy, uneasy feel as if something has gone terribly wrong. This also has to do with the fact that the majority of the anime takes place in game,  when we are taken out of game it feels very wrong and unsettling. The art of .hack//SIGN leaves you with many unforgettable scenes.EntertainmentWith all the praise that .hack//SIGN gets this is where it falls short. .hack//SIGN is one of my personal favorite anime of all time, but even considering that when I put on .hack//SIGN I know what I\'m getting myself into. Watching this show is mental endurance trial 25min long 26 times over. The only way the story progresses is by the next character interation so you need to be vigulent from conversation to conversation. Re-watching the series is something you need to schedule in advance. Because of its slow nature .hack//SIGN is a difficult series to pick up again after a short amount of time. The story is complex and mysterious with conspiracy and dramatic relationships, but unless you like talking, no matter how highly recommended .hack//SIGN comes to you chances are you won\'t enjoy it. If you have the will you won\'t be disappointing, .hack//SIGN\'s delivery is slow, but gets in your blood very quickly.Over all .hack//SIGN is a series is a great series breaking the mold of cyber punk anime and pioneering a new theme. It is not as action packed as desired, but what it lacks in action it makes up with an amazing story and supreme character development. The art and animation sets the tone for a fantasy world that almost seems real with a soundtrack that seal the deal for this virtual dream land that is ""The World"". For anime fans who are looking for a deep anime that can stand on its own as a solid series .hack//SIGN if a fabulous choice, but if you\'re looking for something that will get your blood pumping more, this may be a series to avoid.SuggestionsIf you enjoyed .hack//SIGN and are looking for something similar or if you didn\'t enjoy it and are looking for a series that may give you more of a rush, here are a couple suggestions that you may find interesting. Try them out and read their reviews if you\'re not sure. First, is Sword Art Online which also revolves around the mmo element, featuring the main hero and heroine trying to conquer all 100 floors of the game and free everyone.

If you do nothing else, listen to the soundtrack. It\'s long but it is entirely worth it. It\'s Kajiura Yuki so that\'s hardly surprising, but still.Overall, the story is boring. Imagine all the really dull aspects of the average video game, like farming for special loot or ingredients or fishing. Except now that\'s a show you\'re watching.Since I played WoW for several years and still play ""Diablo 3"", I thought it would be interesting to watch, and I could connect better with characters who commented on RL problems and logging out and...stuff. And it was an interesting way to have ""normal"" people exist in a fantasy setting, especially without the problems of taking away narration time featuring sleeping, cooking or eating.But it\'s like this series is highlighting every problem playing MMORPGs has. You get on, and you don\'t actually accomplish anything. Why fight? To get better gear and level up. Why get better gear and level up? So you can fight better. It features trolls, gankers, nubs, and the more ridiculous aspects of online gaming. To accurately feature an MMORPG, these things must be involved, so I understand their purpose. And with the rise in the number of games in use (especially when this was made), this is an important aspect of our world for people to see. I suppose if it\'s just a commentary on how stupid these things are... I don\'t know. Personally, I wouldn\'t record the average day for me on D3 or WoW because I know it\'s boring. This seems to just be a confirmation of that. That\'s not interesting. It\'s kind of bleak and uncomfortable.

Those are nice, even if they don\'t feel like the focus the majority of the time.Overall it\'s pretty boring and slow and the characters aren\'t very likeable. Unfortunately if you want to watch something about video games, your best option at the moment is basically ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" (not to throw shade at the film; I just can\'t think of a decent anime/manga alternative). If you want a good fantasy series that\'s warm-hearted but with stakes and an emphasis on slice-of-life, watch ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" or ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" or read ""Fruits Basket"". Skip this.

Listen to the soundtrack.', '""Trapped in a video game"" has been a consistently enjoyable sub-genre for me and Yuki Kajiura, who did the soundtrack here, is literally my favorite musician and composer, period, as reflected in my favorite people list in my profile so I really, really wanted to like this. Unfortunately, I just didn\'t.It\'s slow and boring and there\'s really no way around that. The pacing drags this show down in a huge way. This entire story, told in 26 episodes, could have been told in 18 without much trouble. There are other valid criticisms too such as shallow and minimal character development, a 47 year old man...hanging out with a bunch of teenage girls daily and no one having any problem with it and a convoluted, messy plot that suffers from a serious lack of explanation but the biggest issue, far and away, is the pacing. There\'s a ton of talking and not much of anything else. There\'s very little action and for an MMO this game looks boring as hell because hardly any time whatsoever is spent showing players actually playing the game.It\'s not ALL bad. The base plot concept is really cool and explores some deeper themes. There\'s an intriguing mystery at the core of all this. And, of course, Yuki Kajiura delivers the goods and provides a gorgeous soundtrack. But, again, I just cannot stress strongly enough the extent to which this is overshadowed and borderline ruined by the exhaustingly slow, sleep-inducing pacing.If you\'ve got the patience for something that moves very, very slowly and dialogue heavy anime doesn\'t bore you I guess this is worth a look. Ultimately I respect this anime more than I actually like it. It\'s the OG of the genre and it paved the way for better shows in the future. Hats off for that. I don\'t see too much value here beyond that though and I have no interest in rewatching this.OBJECTIVE RATING- 6.5PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6 hanging out with a bunch of teenage girls daily and no one having any problem with it and a convoluted, messy plot that suffers from a serious lack of explanation but the biggest issue, far and away, is the pacing.

I don\'t see too much value here beyond that though and I have no interest in rewatching this.OBJECTIVE RATING- 6.5PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6', 'Ever since the trapped in videogame type of isekai sub-genre became a fad, you could read some people saying that this one show, the first of them all by a long margin, is actually the best, and since those comments come from people who hate that genre, I always wanted to check it out. I was initially planning to review the franchise as a whole once I finished it, but who knows if that will even happen.Obviously, this anime is quite outdated when it comes to visuals, for a 2002 anime the artwork is solid and the backgrounds are great, while everything else is just...fine, the character designs were once iconic, but now come off as simple and kind of generic, plus the character models can be inconsistent at times. Since the series is dialogue-heavy, the characters remain mostly standing or sitting while talking, which means the actual animation is mostly static, even though there are a few fights in it, which in turn are decently animated for the time but the motions are still nothing very impressive. Coming from that era, most of the special effects are quite good, but there is also prominent CGI that by now is crude and weak looking, not so much as there was in other shows from that time, thankfully, but it’s still there and affects the overall.The sound department was and is still praised, the sound effects were very good for its time, although a bit outdated by now, the voice acting a bit atypical and very mature for its type of series, with Mitsuki Saiga being the best possible choice for the protagonist, and the soundtrack is easily among the best and most atmospheric in the whole medium, especially the opening. The composer is the well-known Yuki Kajiura, who would go on to make very similar soundtracks in later works, mixing a little bit of different influences depending on the aesthetics of each title. The problem here is the directing, which is weird at times, using the themes in ways and moments that feel misplaced, which is why I have to take a point from the overall sound department.The plot has to do with people playing a VRMMORPG, but one of them, the protagonist, can’t logout, so it becomes a problem because of the effects that that can have on her body, and for everyone else, who considers her a cheater that’s breaking the game and is responsible for certain things that are happening in it.The series is not an action adventure like every other that would follow it in its genre, it’s a mix of slice of life, as it shows the role playing of everyone and what and how they do in the game, as well as real life issues of each one becoming important regarding character dynamics, and mystery, as the objective is to find the true identity of the main character, aspects of the videogame they play, and by extension the setting itself, from its very core and beginning, as well as finding a McGuffin that can lead to that, and also, well, prevent the world from that game to crash, of course, that was obviously needed to happen.The anime shows how some of the characters take the game more seriously than others, some just want to have a good time, some just want to chill out, and others take their in-game roles very seriously, more than they should, which is actually a bit of a weak point from the anime. Well, at least every perspective is explained through the exploration of the characters both in game and also outside of it, though to a much lesser extent, with the exception of the main character, of course.Some, mainly the protagonist, are there for escapism purposes, others to build bonds that they lost in real life, or to do something for someone else, and it’s interesting to see how everyone is confronted about what they want to do in-game and their way to achieve that, with obviously the anti-escapism of the main character being the main theme, character arc, and message in the show.And that’s its main difference with the other series in its sub-genre, which would ditch every attempt at a serious exploration of a meaningful message nor care for characterization, and mutate into power fantasies where bland overpowered otaku and/or gamer protagonists with no personality whatsoever defeat one dimensional villains and get all the girls in the world..hack//Sign is not like that in the least, Tsukasa is initially distant and aggressive towards others, a loner, cynical even, and although that makes up for a good character arc as she warms up to others and face her reality, it’s true that you don’t want to follow a main character like that all that much. Well, at least her reactions are justified when you take in count that a lot of players attack her out of the blue with no explanation nor much solid justification. That is a nice detail not only because it shows that she is not very liked by others, but also because it establishes her character better than just having her being an antisocial just because and to fit with the emo fashion of the era. I said that but that aspect of her personality is also explored through her in real life persona and drama, which is quite heavy and serious and treated tastefully, and obviously won’t be covered here.She is also not powerful in the least, if I remember correctly she is a middle level spell caster in the game, and although with very high potential, it also means that could be beat by anyone in a 1v1 in the game, if not for the broken items she acquires at some point, which actually turn on herself after a point for plot reasons.Another good aspect of the show is showing how the existence of Tsukasa is seen by the rest of the players, as a some sort of threat for the stability of the game and world they interact in and with, leading some to go for aggression, while others try to communicate, reason, understand and bond with her, to get to the bottom of the mysteries of the show together. Eventually this is resolved and abandoned because of the stakes that the show goes for near the end, when everyone unites to face the biggest threat and matter at hand. That is something that I also found to be a positive, compared with other anime from the genre that have high stakes from the beginning, but also characters that don’t care much about them, or give more importance to whatever the protagonists do in ways that don’t feel plausible in the least, and that make them look like idiots.Another thing I never liked on later titles is how similar the avatars of the players were to their real life designs, .hack//Sign not only has them looking completely different in game, some even change their gender, something that also happens in our real world and life.Now for the negatives for which I don’t rate .hack//Sign higher despite my praises.First, although the protagonist is eventually fleshed out and developed and gets a catharsis, as I said she wasn’t very likeable in the beginning, it’s understandable for the reasons I mentioned, but not many would have the patience to follow a main character so apathetic that also has amnesia, thus being both unlikeable and mysterious in a bad way, since she doesn’t remember who she is, and thus can’t be fleshed out until late in the series.Then, as well done as it is, this is still a series where people take playing a videogame more seriously than they should, they are not even professional gamers, why do they care so much? It’s kinda cringy to watch.Then, as much as the series tries to introduce high stakes near the end, at the end of the day, it’s still just the world within a videogame, besides the protagonist, everyone can just logout and unlike later anime, death is irrelevant for everybody besides the protagonist here, so the stakes are not as high as the show tries to make it seem like they are.Speaking of which, Tsukasa goes through several life threatening situations, which in theory should raise the stakes since she can’t logout, and thus starts feeling the effects of the game on her own body, but something happens to either save her in the last moment, or even after apparently being badly hurt, the only thing that get affected are her memories and stuff, which she regains at the end anyways.Also, it doesn’t make much sense for the antagonist to let her roam free throughout the series while she needed her, that’s what ends up being her downfall in the end.Then there is the end of the series, which at the last moment throws a cliffhanger hinting at more stuff to come, which you’ll never get to see unless you read other manga, or light novels, or play the videogame series, or listen to drama cds. The series is just a middle point, and its ending the entrance, to a much much bigger and longer franchise, which tarnish what was otherwise a very solid ending up until that point.Two ovas were released afterwards, and they are not worth watching in the least. One is mostly and unrelated and irrelevant side story of a character that doesn’t appear in the main series, until it shows a bit of the past of a main character, which not only comes out very late, but it also contradicts part of what was shown about her in the series, while the other is just fanservice for longtime fans of the franchise, since it reunites the cast of the anime with ones from the games, some of which have very similar character designs and thus ruins the uniqueness of the ones from the original, because it takes place after the all the plot points from the initial games are over, thus, if you are an anime only, like myself, you won’t even have an idea who all those people are and where did they come from, and even then, that ova can barely count as an outcome, as it is just a festival for the characters to celebrate, while not bringing closure to the anime in the least.Its legacy was apparently quite tarnished, since the genre moved on to something completely different than it, and later entries wouldn’t follow its ending, and would mutate to a more comical and lewd approach, thus departing from what gave it its uniqueness in the first place.Personally, I enjoyed .hack//Sign a bit, for basically being the opposite of what I came to hate about modern anime in later years, but it’s still understandable why it’s not liked very much. It’s visually outdated, it takes a while for the protagonist to become likeable, there aren’t many nor very high stakes, the series is incomplete, and people usually want to watch videogame anime for their takes on the core mechanics and the adventures in the world the makers come out with in their series, not a very static and dialogue heavy anti-escapism series about the introspection of antisocial people or straight up losers. And even I had a bit of a tough time to appreciate the anime, despite loving some heavy dialogue series and movies, because those are usually about existential or psychological topics, while this one is about people taking seriously playing a videogame. It’s worth watching for its themes, messages, character immersion and atmosphere, but the plot is certainly not very engaging and slower than it needs to, and the ending is somewhat lacking, so it’s more of an acquired taste type of show for veteran viewers, the exact opposite of what you’d expect from its premise, and what its genre would become. fine, the character designs were once iconic, but now come off as simple and kind of generic, plus the character models can be inconsistent at times. Since the series is dialogue-heavy, the characters remain mostly standing or sitting while talking, which means the actual animation is mostly static, even though there are a few fights in it, which in turn are decently animated for the time but the motions are still nothing very impressive. Coming from that era, most of the special effects are quite good, but there is also prominent CGI that by now is crude and weak looking, not so much as there was in other shows from that time, thankfully, but it’s still there and affects the overall.The sound department was and is still praised, the sound effects were very good for its time, although a bit outdated by now, the voice acting a bit atypical and very mature for its type of series, with Mitsuki Saiga being the best possible choice for the protagonist, and the soundtrack is easily among the best and most atmospheric in the whole medium, especially the opening.

Characters are nice but you will not attach to them and are not so memorable.In conclusion, .hack//sign is good but I will not recommend it to anybody.

I don't think it was executed as well as it could've been.To be better it would've moved faster, done away with...unnecessary exaggerations, and had a better soundtrack.For me, it's the type of anime you play in the background while doing something else. unnecessary exaggerations, and had a better soundtrack.For me, it's the type of anime you play in the background while doing something else."", 'A fantasy based anime series which focused on the interactions between different people participating in an online game. These people live vicariously through this game which presents a mystery from the moment the series begins.

The series focuses on...trying to figure out who Tsubasa is in the real world so as to be able to save the person as well as the effects of Tsubasa’s continued existence in ‘The World’; the way in which he has an impact on all of the characters he encounters and wonders if his existence was foretold, since he is supposed to set forth in motion events that would bring stability in ‘The World’.ART 6/10Due the fact that the series was about an online game, the characters were drawn as such to reflect that feel as well as the setting, which gave it the added touch of game play graphics.

However, I also find that parts of the animation and art style of the show are comfy and special.

I would like to point out that my views are completely unbiased because I never played the games, so I am not a fan of the series, just someone who decided to watch the anime.Story: 2/10I remember hearing about this series when I was just in elementary school. I remember the dubbed version coming on late nights, but I used to watch other anime and never really got into it. Back then I used to...think ""I\'m definetely going to watch this from the beginning."" From the eyes of a child, it looked different, the character designs looked cool, the soundtrack sounded amazing, and I was very new to anime and only watched dubbed versions that came on television. In the end, I never really got around to watching it until now, when I\'ve reached adulthood. I had really high expectations, but now if I had to describe this series in one word, it would be ""disappointing"".I understand this series is probably what has inspired other shows based on MMORPGS like Sword Art Online and is probably original to the ""stuck in a game"" plot. It has a very unique premise for its time and that\'s why I\'m giving this a 2/10 instead of 1/10. The storytelling is just downright awful and I couldn\'t stand watching it. There is just so much...dialogue. Characters just sit around and talk for a good 90% of the show. The story barely moves forward in each episode. Don\'t believe me? Go on Wikipedia Episodes list and look at each episodes summary. Just skim through if you don\'t want to ruin the story for yourself. In the end, I just read up online what happens in the show because I could no longer put myself to another 12 episodes of pure torture.To be honest, I didn\'t know much about the series. I did some research and I realized that its part of a series of games. I realized later that its probably the reason why its so dragged out when it could have been much more condensed. It\'s sad that it was dragged out for the sake of the fans and probably to generate cash when it could have been made great with some proper storytelling.Art: 3/10Looking at the character designs now, some of it is cool and some of it is just downright weird. I don\'t know why I thought it was really cool.It\'s an old series, so the animation is not fluid and the overall art isn\'t that great.Sound: 6/10Soundtrack is good, but it\'s used in some odd places, making it a little awkward.Character: 3/10The story progressed too slowly, so as a viewer, I did not get attached to any character. The main character in the beginning was just annoying, always running away from someone acting a little friend. You barely even get to see him actually, because its mostly the other characters sitting around and discussing things about the main character.One thing I don\'t get is why were the other side characters so worried about him, always rushing to his aid, when he doesn\'t even care about them and treats them coldly.Enjoyment: 1/10I hate to say this, and despite my hatred toward harems, I thought sword art online was much more enjoyable than this. I don\'t mean to compare shows, but if you look at my reviews from SAO, I haven\'t given it a high rating, but since these two are similar in storyline, I would have to say SAO beats this.Overall: 2/10I think a lot of people like this show according to the reviews, so I do think that people may enjoy it despite it being slow, and that\'s completely fine, people have different tastes. But I do think that if you\'re an impatient person  like me, don\'t bother with this series. think ""I\'m definetely going to watch this from the beginning."" From the eyes of a child, it looked different, the character designs looked cool, the soundtrack sounded amazing, and I was very new to anime and only watched dubbed versions that came on television. In the end, I never really got around to watching it until now, when I\'ve reached adulthood. I had really high expectations, but now if I had to describe this series in one word, it would be ""disappointing"".I understand this series is probably what has inspired other shows based on MMORPGS like Sword Art Online and is probably original to the ""stuck in a game"" plot.

While these negatives are there i think the main point of this series isn't action but introspection towards its' characters and their problems. The slow plot is rough at first but once it opens up it gets very intriguing. Past the few negatives the positives weigh outweigh them and more than make up for some...of the few shortcomings this series has.The art overall is as mixed as it gets. Some shots look amazing while a lot more often the character drawings are a solid meh to sometimes bad. Luckily most of the character designs are solid and fit the overall aesthetic of the show, if a little bland.The music and the opening are amazing i revisit this shows soundtrack often cause there is almost nothing like it. It has a strong Celtic style while the intro has a more techno style as if you're entering this world which really fits the theme for everything and mix that with the vocals that say a lot about the plot make for a haunting soundtrack that you wont forget.Probably the best part of the anime is the characters. they are almost all complex and more than just one note characters, eac character you find out has problems of their own and are for some reason seeking escapism in this world.The plot is a slow burn which isn't a negative in a series where you follow these characters and find out about their motivations. it truly feels like once things start hitting at the end you know these people well and are invested in whats going on. While the plot is slow its worth it by the end you really care for everything that is going on here. of the few shortcomings this series has.The art overall is as mixed as it gets.

Nearly 13 years later, I decided to give it another shot.The art style is good, and the soundtrack is phenomenal. Sadly, that's all this anime has going for it. The story is alright...I do really like the premise, but how the producers carried it out onto the big screen is pretty lackluster and almost seems half-a$$ed. The dialogue was ghastly, and cheesy in most cases. There were a lot of..hiccups in the story progression that made me feel like I missed an episode somehow or that the episodes...weren't consistent, and things that didn't make sense...like a character that was with the group a second ago is now elsewhere almost as if they were never in the group in the first place.And the ending was terrible.

Apparently this is a multimedia project, so others more immersed in the franchise might be more positive than me.The only other positive thing I have to say is that the voice acting was actually pretty good. Definitely some talented voice actors in the cast.The fundamental flaw of this anime is that it is extremely...poorly directed. I literally felt like I was watching a highschool art project.

I would recommend it if you like 2000s midbudget anime with strong concepts.One thing that took me by surprise was that the show's tone was completely different than...what I expected. Growing up the only significant contact I had with the .hack franchise was that my older brother owned two volumes of .hack//legend of the twilight. I guess I had sort of expected this show to feel similar to it, but it really doesn't. Make no mistake, that's to its benefit. I won't praise it too highly by comparing it to Serial Experiments Lain or Boogiepop, because it's much lighter than those, but it could fall under the same general survey in late 90s-early 2000s anime. It captures the feeling of playing a 3D CG video game from that time period perfectly, as well; it's oddly sparse and full of surreal landscapes.I enjoyed the characters, but since this is part of a multimedia project and there are bits of that I haven't experienced for myself yet, I did find them largely falling a little flat (w/ the exception of Hotaru). For now I'll give it the benefit of the doubt on that and assume that the cast becomes more fleshed out.The character design and art direction are a strong suit, though I think that the execution isn't always as solid as it wants to be. In particular I think a lot of the cinematography/scene transitions can feel dated, and there are a few experimental shots that don't really work (the only one that really does, though, is my favorite shot in the whole show).The show's soundtrack is middling, with a few great tracks (those English-language vocal tracks are all stellar) and a couple horrendous ones (Sora's theme is annoying). My biggest complaint with it is that whoever was in charge of the audio mixing did a terrible job, because there are tons of scenes where the background music is so loud it almost completely masks the voice of the person talking (I don't know if this issue is present in the dub).I know I'm listing a lot of complaints, but my thing is that while I do have many minor nitpicks about the show... they're just that, minor nitpicks. The foundation and concept of it are rock solid; it's just execution, execution, execution.Also Tsukasa is cute and I support her and her relationship with Hotaru. what I expected.

The mystery around the danger facing Za Warudo and focusing around the Key of the Twilight is much more of the investigative kind, so people looking for action will probably be bored.The relationships between the characters are fascinating, and the one that forms between Subaru and Tsukasa is very moving.

The soundtrack and the art, though it\'s a dated anime, definitely stood out as the best elements this series had to offer though admittedly, I personally, as a connoisseur of animation, wasn\'t exactly driven to finish this series because of the art or the music. Nonetheless, it provided an unforgettable atmosphere that I will constantly go back to whenever reminiscing about the .hack// series. When it comes to the entertainment value, most of it came from the characters or rather lack thereof, as I found them to be quite......Driven by experiences that weren\'t their own.Without spoiling anything, I understand the series took a concept that, at the time, did not exist, that concept being the usage of cognizance and existence within a virtual medium, a trope that is common today yet was essentially unknown at the time. The characters themselves are incredibly one-note and felt more like a checklist that needed to be fulfilled rather than their own fleshed-out individuals, but that doesn\'t take away from the mature themes that could be found within the show and though their exploration was vague it still provided an amusing experience with the story beats presented. But I would\'ve liked to see more of that in the show.The first half of the show was impossibly-difficult to get through in my personal experience due to the sluggish pace, the honestly unbearable main character and the struggles they went through as well as the lack of interesting dynamics between the cast at the beginning. It wasn\'t until what I would consider the second half that I felt immersed in the plot, and it was a difficult journey to get to that point but once I got to that specific point in the middle of the series it did start to pick up and drew me in enough to cause me to binge the rest of the show. Overall I found the experience to be a mixture between confusion, anger, a test of patience though a rewarding one up to the very end.The show was alright for me, I\'m not nostalgic for it so I am viewing it from a critical lense and while I understand that the show was innovative for its genre and its spiritual successors as well as other entries in the isekai genre, it frankly just didn\'t do it for me. Maybe my opinion is biased because I am a ""modern"" anime viewer, but truthfully I didn\'t find it to be that deep or interesting. Certain dynamics between the main character and the rest of the cast felt forced at best and nonexistent at worst, but don\'t let my words dissuade you. Every opinion is valid, this is just my own.

The MC maybe a young child, even then how he acts towards some characters was ridiculous.The few action scenes were slow and barely action really.

At all. You see 4 monsters in the show total. Apparently one of the most popular mmo\'s of all time in universe with millions of players. You\'ll see about 57 people in the background over the entire show. But the main characters will bump into each other constantly as if guided by some other-wordly force (not even getting into the fact of the entire main cast living in the exact same city, what a HUGE coincidence). And with a...soundtrack that is odd at some times, very good at others but usually ill-fitting of what\'s usually going onAnd yet, despite all that, it had me hooked. I wanted to know more about the breadcrumbs of plot it would give us, about the characters, their motives, their personality, both in and out of the game. Hack will spend most of it\'s time having the cast meet up in pairs of 2 and slowly (and I mean really slowly) get to know each other. Sometimes they\'ll be deep discussions, sometimes they\'ll talk about current topics, but most of the time it will be about nothing at all. Just like how we would in real life. It doesn\'t make for the most interesting viewing experience but it does build up these characters, love them or hate them you\'ll get to know them pretty well. But not as well as you\'d like, because just as this show finally picks up it\'s pace and decides it\'s time to finally actually have a plot and reveal it\'s hand about ""The World"" and what\'s really going on?The show endsOne of the most abrupt ends ever to end a show as the entire cast is lazily force logged out of the game right at the final battle and.....that\'s it . I felt like I was just sucker punched in the gut. All the build-up of getting to know this cast, finally seeing them put their differences aside for a greater cause, and it\'s all for nothing. You\'ll get a brief 20 second shot of Tsukasas\'s fate which is actually very sweet, but I feel as if we were robbed of a lot more. All of these characters we had grew to love or hate are cruelly ripped away from us via an abrupt fade to black. Did Subaru finally come to terms with the real world and the difficulties it brings? Did Silver Knight find his purpose without Subaru and the Crimson Knights? Did BT find that connection she was deeply missing in her heart? Who the hell were Helba and Balmung? AND WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING WITH SORA AT THE LAST 2 MINUTES? And many more questionsUnfortunately it seems that 70% of the questions you have won\'t be answered, because we won\'t see 2/3 of this cast ever again, outside of a few cameo\'s in the Hack IMOQ videogames and the short 20 minute OVA which is a final farewell send-off not just for the characters of Hack sign, but for everyone in this series. That includes the characters of 2 short novels, 4 videogames and 2 anime shows. So I\'ve got a ways to go before I can comment on if that ones a worthy send-off or not, but as of right now I just feel let downFor a story that tries to tell a message of how important it is not to lose yourself in videogames and escape the real world but to instead embrace it, we never get to see anyone outside of it, except for a few brief flickering shots, it will merely tell us how certain characters have met in real life, but it will never expand upon it or show us. And I really wanted more of that. Their motivations and desires in real life were what drove them in the game. Silver Knight and his desire for justice, Bt and her desire to be loved, Bear and his desire to protect others, Mimiru and her desire for friendship and so much more. And that really breaks my heart, because despite all of it\'s shortcomings and weak budget this show had that something special that pulled so many people back when it first aired that wasn\'t just a fluke, as it\'s pulled me in even now all these years later.My brain says 6/10My heart says 8/10I\'ll settle on a final score of 7/10 soundtrack that is odd at some times, very good at others but usually ill-fitting of what\'s usually going onAnd yet, despite all that, it had me hooked. I wanted to know more about the breadcrumbs of plot it would give us, about the characters, their motives, their personality, both in and out of the game. Hack will spend most of it\'s time having the cast meet up in pairs of 2 and slowly (and I mean really slowly) get to know each other. Sometimes they\'ll be deep discussions, sometimes they\'ll talk about current topics, but most of the time it will be about nothing at all. Just like how we would in real life. It doesn\'t make for the most interesting viewing experience but it does build up these characters, love them or hate them you\'ll get to know them pretty well. But not as well as you\'d like, because just as this show finally picks up it\'s pace and decides it\'s time to finally actually have a plot and reveal it\'s hand about ""The World"" and what\'s really going on?The show endsOne of the most abrupt ends ever to end a show as the entire cast is lazily force logged out of the game right at the final battle and.....that\'s it . I felt like I was just sucker punched in the gut. All the build-up of getting to know this cast, finally seeing them put their differences aside for a greater cause, and it\'s all for nothing.

I though that the way the series changes formats was cool. It starts as a novel, then a short story, then this anime, then a video game, ect. ect. The story while not the most original idea is interesting. Players of a popular virtual reality MMORPG have been going comatose while playing the game, and no one can figure out why. Then along comes the main character who can't remember who he is, or log out of the game. I wanted to like this anime more but there were only three...or four interesting characters, the pacing of the story was incredibly slow, and the fighting was given a back seat for emphasis on politics between the games factions. However despite these flaws it was told a fascinating story, and kept me interested. or four interesting characters, the pacing of the story was incredibly slow, and the fighting was given a back seat for emphasis on politics between the games factions.

This review will contain spoilers, particularly about the ending however, what you at LEAST need to know that isn\'t a spoiler is, if you watch this anime, expect to have to play the games to get all the answers and possibly also watch the other anime in the franchise for any remaining ones and even then I cannot assure you you\'ll have all the mysteries solved as i have not played any game or seen any anime besides this one. I have however taken...a look at stuff which tells me this is likely the only way you\'re going to get the answers you seek at the end of this season and episode 27 and 28 of this series... (Though someone claimed some of the answers but not all are answered in .hack//Legend Of The Twilight, cannot say if true or not...)Now, onto the review but as i said spoilers will be mentioned..hack//Sign is an anime that has not aged well, I\'d argue however it wasn\'t even good back in the day either and yet, somehow it draws you in. The mystery is nothing special and the writing is honestly bad. Lots of times the anime will simply skip parts so a character or a group of characters will be in one place both during and at the end of the episode, and the next thing they\'re suddenly in another place, not having shown or continued from where it left off both during and at the start of the episode. The acting in both the sub and Dub is good (I didn\'t watch the sub much, but what little I saw was as good as the dub) but thanks to the writing, the characters often enough speak in a slow or unrealistic manner, same with their actions. Speaking of action... do not expect to see much of that at all, despite being an MMORPG VR game, the battles are laughable, I swear so many compare this to SAO but none ever ONCE compare it to Spice and Wolf, which it shares FAR MORE in common with in the sense of its mostly just characters talking but unlike Spice and Wolf, .hack//Sign is not even CLOSE to being on the same lv of how GREAT that anime is. SAO it shares a few themes with but honestly, a LOT of anime shares similar themes (Especially these days with so many VR game anime popping up left and right) and in case you\'re wondering, there is NO comparison for how GOOD SAO is compared to this one. Sure I like SAO and will admit it has its own faults (many i fact) but if you\'re comparing the two as many have prolly done, SAO is the superior anime/series/franchise here hands down. Bonus points that you DON\'T need to play a SINGLE SAO game to understand whats going on and have the mysteries solved for you :PI normally never make comparisons to other anime when i review an anime unless its one in the series of the anime am reviewing, however, since a lot have made comparisons to SAO and seeing as this is likely the 1st trapped in a VR game world or one of the 1sts odds are, I felt it was needed to make those 2 comparisons. (Fyi, Spice and Wolf is FAR superior to this, even though its mostly talking its night and day difference between it and .hack//Sign)Anyway, that\'s enough of the comparison. I\'ll just say this, as I said at the start of this review, this could\'ve been a 6 or even a 7 depending on the ending, and by now you might\'ve guessed WHY it\'s rated a 4.0. That is because at the end, the anime just ends... abruptly... The enemy would NOT log them out, yet that\'s what the anime seems to indicate happened... I suspect its a fake world and they\'re still in The World but alas, I\'ll not know unless I talk to a friend who knows, go read up on a wiki or go play the game(s) and if your viewer base has to do ANY of that, you have sadly, succeeded at something that NO writer should EVER make a reality as it turns the viewer off, it ruins it for anime only watchers and I say this not lightly because .hack//Sign left MANY MANY questions UNANSWERED on TOP of that abrupt ending! Again, this is what we call bad writing. The worst part of this is knowing they had EVERY opportunity to answer every question but they seemingly don\'t and that\'s made worse when they made more and more anime series in this franchise but didn\'t bother to properly continue this in the anime. (.hack//Legend Of The Twilight ""might"" answer some of this but since its focus is on two characters not in the Sign anime and has them playing as avatars based on the look a like Tsukasa and Mimiru called Kite and Black Rose respectively, it is unlikely this would continue the story with the Sign characters and even then you\'d need knowledge of Kite and Black Rose possibly from the game(s) to fully enjoy that anime...)It goes without saying but, even if the games are available to play (Which i doubt) I wouldn\'t be interested in playing them, especially when the anime\'s writing and animation were so laughably bad and unrealistic and as an anime only fan of this anime, i guess that means my friend and or a wiki is my only option for knowing what the anime SHOULD have told us. Like I said before, .hack//Sign somehow draws its viewers in, despite how bad it is but, it really did get lucky to release when it did, as bac then it was better as not many if any did what it did, however, that still doesn\'t make it a good anime/series and somehow it gained many games, anime and more. That just shows you how important timing is for when you release something as you know this wouldn\'t have gotten a sequel much less a game (and if it did not more than 1) if this had released in this day with modern art but the same style of animation and lastly, while the mysteries are what will likely keep you hooked, the stuff they DID answer was honestly, meh to bad. Totally not worth watching is my take on this but who knows, maybe you\'ll like it? Hopefully this review helped you to decide if you wanna watch it or not.Oh, bonus round! You thought we were done?

Doraemon Movie 08: Nobita to Ryuu no Kishi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2657/Doraemon_Movie_08__Nobita_to_Ryuu_no_Kishi,"[""My overall take: Fascinating from a meta perspective, but not the most engaging Doraemon movie.In this movie, Nobita and his friends find a dinosaur civilization underground. As a paleontologist, what interests me the most about this movie is the scientific inspiration behind it. The idea that troodontid dinosaurs could have evolved into human-like sapient forms had they avoided extinction was directly based on a thought experiment put forward by paleontologist Dale Russell in 1982. The film also depicts a bolide impact as the cause of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, a relatively new and controversial idea at the time. By the way, this won't be the...last appearance of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction in a Doraemon movie...Sadly, I didn't find most of this movie quite as engaging as its premise might suggest. I did appreciate the reveal close to the ending, and the fact that there's no irredeemably evil villain to be defeated is a pretty fresh concept for a Doraemon film, with the main source of conflict turning out to be a misunderstanding. However, it takes a long time for these pieces to fall into place. It might have been that I went into this film knowing that Russell-inspired dinosauroids played a major role (whereas the protagonists don't learn that they're dealing with sapient dinosaurs until over halfway through the story), but I thought that the setup took far too long. The lead-up to the main plot in Doraemon movies can often be quite enjoyable, with Doraemon frequently showing off a wide variety of gadgets to help the main characters navigate hazardous terrain or convert inhospitable environments into comfortable living quarters. Yet what little there is of that here felt relatively short and unmemorable. Much more time is spent on a subplot where Suneo keeps catching glimpses of the underground dinosaurs and tries to convince the others that what he's seeing is real, which eventually puts them in contact with the dinosauroid civilization but wasn't particularly compelling otherwise.There are also aspects of the worldbuilding that I thought could have been fleshed out more. For example, in addition to the city-dwelling, technologically advanced dinosauroids that the main characters get to know, we see that the underground world is home to at least one other sapient culture, consisting of a kappa-like species that leads forager lifestyles. Are those also descendants of troodontids? That is never explained, and the foragers are never portrayed as anything more than secondary antagonists. In the end, I think this is a fascinating Doraemon movie, but not one that lives up to its full potential as a work of entertainment. last appearance of the end-Cretaceous mass extinction in a Doraemon movie...Sadly, I didn't find most of this movie quite as engaging as its premise might suggest.

Ensemble Stars!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32212/Ensemble_Stars,"[""I honestly loved Ensemble Stars. I loved all the characters and ALL of the songs in the show. I never knew it came from a game until finishing the anime and looking more into it. I'll be honest the ending was completely rushed but I'm hoping for there to be more in another season (hopefully) if there is more story in the game.The show left you with some questions of like Who? What? Where? When? and Why? and they are possibly answered in the game but the game is only available in Japan so it is hard to translate without a guide that doesn't...have all of the stories from the game up.I'm honestly shocked it has such a low rating for the show because I always dive into shows not knowing anything and I hate predicting stuff.Predicting everything ruins the show (imo) and that's why everyone says this wasn't that good or rated it what they rated it. I enjoyed the show. The soundtrack for it is amazing. Even if you hate the show, the songs in it are great.TL;DR the show is great. The songs are phenomenal even if you don't like the show. It could be pretty generic if you know your facts and what to expect in anime but who cares, frickin enjoy it. have all of the stories from the game up.I'm honestly shocked it has such a low rating for the show because I always dive into shows not knowing anything and I hate predicting stuff.Predicting everything ruins the show (imo) and that's why everyone says this wasn't that good or rated it what they rated it.

For people who aren\'t into mobage, I think the series is going to be pretty forgettable and, unfortunately, fails as a gateway into the franchise.(To be fair, the anime had 24 episodes to convey what the game had...over 2 years to flesh out).As a long time player and fan myself, I can attest: I had a much better experience with this anime than my boyfriend, who knew nothing about the series and came out of the first season confused, unsatisfied, and largely unimpressed.The story in a nutshell is that the main character, Anzu, is the only female student in an all boy\'s idol program at Yumenosaki Academy, acting as a producer in training. The school is known for churning out talented idols who later become very successful in the business, but we soon learn that there is some sort of corruption behind the scenes involving the school council, and the main cast of boys, a band called Trickstar, decides to start a revolt.I\'ve always liked the overarching story of Ensemble Stars, because tackling the subject of corrupt practices behind showbiz is something most series in the idol genre don\'t do. And knowing how the story goes from my experience playing the games, I think that the roadmap for a successful anime was definitely there.However, the story and development of the cast suffers so much from poor pacing, that the entire anime feels like ""and-then-this-happened"" story telling, and it doesn\'t ever come together in a way that makes sense or is ultimately satisfying. The main plot of ""Viva La Idol Revolution"" often gets completely ignored at times because the focus gets shifted to trying to develop a massive and convoluted cast of characters, which seems counterproductive because in an effort to steer the story back on track, most of them get lost in the fray, anyways.Speaking of characters, I do have to give credit where it\'s due and applaud the studio for at least trying to make every character somewhat relevant. We\'re introduced to a huge roster of idols-in-training, each with their own motivations, sounds, and tiny little quirks.Unfortunately, many of them end up being a distraction to the main story, and feel forcibly shoved in and out of the show for the sake of trying to diversify the cast and giving each boy screentime. There\'s a heavy implication that we\'ll be getting a season 2, so I question why the studio insisted on cramming all of this extra character development into a season where the main arc was very meaty to begin with. Many of the idol units that we\'re introduced to have little to no relevance to the main conflict, anyways, and it feels like a disservice not only to the revolution arc but to each idol unit as well. The games go to great lengths to give each of the boys and their groups interesting back stories that all connect in a ""New Year\'s Eve"" way, but most of that just ends up getting lost in translation because none of them are given the proper amount of focus necessary to tell those stories properly. As someone who is already familiar with these characters and their arcs, it was a pleasure to see them referenced, but for the average person who is meeting these characters for the first time, it can be a lot to digest.(Anzu also fell really flat in my opinion, but as a stand in for the ""player"" in the games, I can let that slide since she\'s essentially just a self-insert for the viewer.)As far as the design and animation, I\'m mixed on this one. Each unit has its own theme and distinct sound direction, which I think is a great touch. Trickstar has a really bright pop-rock sound, befitting of the optimistic protagonist trope. Ra*bits gets a softer and twinklier pop sound that falls in line with their innocent and cute aesthetic. Valkyrie has a heavy baroque influence with lots of strings and darker instrumentation that falls in line with their gothic inspired outfits, and so on. While not all of the songs were bangers for me, the overall quality of the sound production was impressive.The costume design is also really great; while idol animes are always chock full of creative outfits, the stage costumes do a great job of reflecting each unit\'s sound. As a result, almost every unit is able to establish a memorable identity, which is a miracle considering my last point about how messy the character development gets.The animation itself is easy on the eyes. There are beautiful and vibrant colors abound, and the art style for the series has always been that perfect balance of ""cute enough that it\'s endearing"", but ""mature enough that we can admire the attractive 2D men"".On the flip side of that, the Enstars art style is infamous for suffering from same-face-syndrome. Despite every character having a personality loud enough to stand out from the crowd, everyone looks pretty much the same. Every character shares the same 2-3 styles of eyes, everyone has the same facial structure, and everyone has the same generic build of ""lean male - not too broad, could be a twink"". Without the amazing costumes and the pretty crazy hairstyles, none of the characters are really distinguishable. This is a problem that persists in the games as is, but it\'s definitely amplified in the anime.Then there\'s the issue of how the performances are handled using 3D models. Don\'t get me wrong, I understand why this practice is done (3D models are a lighter load because the assets can be reused, the animators don\'t have to worry about drawing so many characters in so many dynamic and often synchronized movements with even more dynamic camerawork, etc), but the transition was often jarring to me. I think the only idol anime that really does a great job at blending 3D models into 2D cuts during performance sequences is the Idolmaster franchise, but that\'s a conversation for another time. It could be a budget thing - I know these models and some of the motions were reused from the development of the rhythm game. But with so many other idol animes that go through the same pitfalls of 3D sequences looking out of place, the disconnect between the 3D rendering and the 2D animation felt like such an easy problem to sidestep, so I was disappointed.Overall, the anime isn\'t bad by any means, but it\'s not remarkable in any way, either. If you\'re already familiar with the series, the experience of being able to finally see the characters you\'ve come to know and love can be almost surreal and that alone makes it worth it. But if this is your first foray into Enstars, or even just the idol genre in general, I imagine you\'re going to have to drag yourself through a good chunk of this season. There are plenty of far better idol animes out there that also have game counterparts and are still able to sustain themselves without using their source material as crutches (see: Idolish7, Idolmaster, Love Live, etc).My verdict? A perfectly average anime. Take that however positively or negatively you like. over 2 years to flesh out).As a long time player and fan myself, I can attest: I had a much better experience with this anime than my boyfriend, who knew nothing about the series and came out of the first season confused, unsatisfied, and largely unimpressed.The story in a nutshell is that the main character, Anzu, is the only female student in an all boy\'s idol program at Yumenosaki Academy, acting as a producer in training.

As someone who is already familiar with these characters and their arcs, it was a pleasure to see them referenced, but for the average person who is meeting these characters for the first time, it can be a lot to digest.(Anzu also fell really flat in my opinion, but as a stand in for the ""player"" in the games, I can let that slide since she\'s essentially just a self-insert for the viewer.)As far as the design and animation, I\'m mixed on this one. Each unit has its own theme and distinct sound direction, which I think is a great touch. Trickstar has a really bright pop-rock sound, befitting of the optimistic protagonist trope. Ra*bits gets a softer and twinklier pop sound that falls in line with their innocent and cute aesthetic. Valkyrie has a heavy baroque influence with lots of strings and darker instrumentation that falls in line with their gothic inspired outfits, and so on. While not all of the songs were bangers for me, the overall quality of the sound production was impressive.The costume design is also really great; while idol animes are always chock full of creative outfits, the stage costumes do a great job of reflecting each unit\'s sound. As a result, almost every unit is able to establish a memorable identity, which is a miracle considering my last point about how messy the character development gets.The animation itself is easy on the eyes. There are beautiful and vibrant colors abound, and the art style for the series has always been that perfect balance of ""cute enough that it\'s endearing"", but ""mature enough that we can admire the attractive 2D men"".On the flip side of that, the Enstars art style is infamous for suffering from same-face-syndrome. Despite every character having a personality loud enough to stand out from the crowd, everyone looks pretty much the same. Every character shares the same 2-3 styles of eyes, everyone has the same facial structure, and everyone has the same generic build of ""lean male - not too broad, could be a twink"". Without the amazing costumes and the pretty crazy hairstyles, none of the characters are really distinguishable. This is a problem that persists in the games as is, but it\'s definitely amplified in the anime.Then there\'s the issue of how the performances are handled using 3D models. Don\'t get me wrong, I understand why this practice is done (3D models are a lighter load because the assets can be reused, the animators don\'t have to worry about drawing so many characters in so many dynamic and often synchronized movements with even more dynamic camerawork, etc), but the transition was often jarring to me. I think the only idol anime that really does a great job at blending 3D models into 2D cuts during performance sequences is the Idolmaster franchise, but that\'s a conversation for another time. It could be a budget thing - I know these models and some of the motions were reused from the development of the rhythm game. But with so many other idol animes that go through the same pitfalls of 3D sequences looking out of place, the disconnect between the 3D rendering and the 2D animation felt like such an easy problem to sidestep, so I was disappointed.Overall, the anime isn\'t bad by any means, but it\'s not remarkable in any way, either. If you\'re already familiar with the series, the experience of being able to finally see the characters you\'ve come to know and love can be almost surreal and that alone makes it worth it. But if this is your first foray into Enstars, or even just the idol genre in general, I imagine you\'re going to have to drag yourself through a good chunk of this season. There are plenty of far better idol animes out there that also have game counterparts and are still able to sustain themselves without using their source material as crutches (see: Idolish7, Idolmaster, Love Live, etc).My verdict? A perfectly average anime. Take that however positively or negatively you like.', 'as a long-time fan of ensemble stars, i am conflicted on how to view the anime and review it. to put it short... it\'s alright. nothing too special or extraordinary, and definitely not a flaming pile of garbage (at least, not yet).this is just a pet peeve, but the way they translate the nicknames in the subtitles just... bothers me. the lack of appellations and translated nicknames like mika\'s ""oshi-san"" really just feels weird, especially since this was never kept consistent with summer live. jun\'s ""ohiisan"" being allowed to remain while other characters have their nicknames translated to english equivalents like ""teach"" is a strange...choice.without prior knowledge of the series and story, the story feels really weird and clunky due to the way they\'ve decided to tell it. i understand the placement of things such as magicians assemble/""the ex-fine story"", but it feels really all over the place. the translated version of the main story which many more people are used to doesn\'t have all this tie in with the stories of ex-valkyrie, the oddballs and ex-fine. those came later as the game progressed and while i see why it was added, it just kind of feels weird and took away from the main story. overall, the storytelling really doesn\'t feel like it\'s as good as it could be and as far as i\'m aware it\'s hard to follow for people who aren\'t super invested in the franchise, which is a bit of a problem for people wanting to get involved. from what ive seen from the pre-existing fan base though is that most people are having fun with it, which is definitely good! i just think it could be betteras someone pre-invested in the series long before the anime came out, i really like how scenes were played out in the anime. my favourites so far have to be literally all of kiseki so far, the makoto rescue sequence & knights being confronted about kidnapping a guy, the hokuto cameo in magicians assemble (which is actually SUPER plot relevant, trust me) and the hokke/trickstar reunion scene & baby hokke flashback. i do find it annoying how some of my favourite parts were cut (like chiaki calling out during the DDD and akiomi threatening him with detention and the hokuto/eichi dialogue snippet of ""hm... it tastes like tea"" ""because its tea"" from the start of summer live), though. i can understand why it is since theres a limited amount of time per episode, i just really wouldve liked to see those parts included. can\'t win em all, i guess. it\'s still got some pretty good comedic value like the actual series, which i find to be a partial win, to be honest.anyway, onto more positives! i am really loving these new songs for intros and outros!!!!! they all go so hard and i genuinely enjoy listening to the ending credits. i don\'t really know what else to say. its so good. especially both the trickstar and eden versions of the second opening ""kiseki"". [chefs kiss].i also really love the way that performances by the characters were animated, ESPECIALLY the final showdown between fine and trickstar at the DDD, akatsuki from that one dreamfes that establishes the corrupt system at yumenosaki and ra*bits in their competition with trickstar. choreography and setting design is REALLY good here and it was so much better than i visualised when reading the main story for myself. i really loved this part of it.overall... the anime is pretty okay i would say. its got its problems and its not necessarily easy to wholly understand for newer viewers, and i don\'t think it should be used as the ""holy grail"" of starting enstars because... lets be honest, the written translations of the main and side stories covered in the anime > the anime itself. it\'s definitely got novel for people who are already into the franchise, though, and i appreciate that a lot. overall, its a pretty okay adaptation and it seems to be doing kiseki some justice so far. choice.without prior knowledge of the series and story, the story feels really weird and clunky due to the way they\'ve decided to tell it. i understand the placement of things such as magicians assemble/""the ex-fine story"", but it feels really all over the place. the translated version of the main story which many more people are used to doesn\'t have all this tie in with the stories of ex-valkyrie, the oddballs and ex-fine. those came later as the game progressed and while i see why it was added, it just kind of feels weird and took away from the main story. overall, the storytelling really doesn\'t feel like it\'s as good as it could be and as far as i\'m aware it\'s hard to follow for people who aren\'t super invested in the franchise, which is a bit of a problem for people wanting to get involved. from what ive seen from the pre-existing fan base though is that most people are having fun with it, which is definitely good! i just think it could be betteras someone pre-invested in the series long before the anime came out, i really like how scenes were played out in the anime. my favourites so far have to be literally all of kiseki so far, the makoto rescue sequence & knights being confronted about kidnapping a guy, the hokuto cameo in magicians assemble (which is actually SUPER plot relevant, trust me) and the hokke/trickstar reunion scene & baby hokke flashback. i do find it annoying how some of my favourite parts were cut (like chiaki calling out during the DDD and akiomi threatening him with detention and the hokuto/eichi dialogue snippet of ""hm... it tastes like tea"" ""because its tea"" from the start of summer live), though. i can understand why it is since theres a limited amount of time per episode, i just really wouldve liked to see those parts included. can\'t win em all, i guess. it\'s still got some pretty good comedic value like the actual series, which i find to be a partial win, to be honest.anyway, onto more positives! i am really loving these new songs for intros and outros!!!!! they all go so hard and i genuinely enjoy listening to the ending credits. i don\'t really know what else to say. its so good. especially both the trickstar and eden versions of the second opening ""kiseki"".

I don\'t know how much draw there is for someone not already invested in the boys: The plotline\'s Kill-la-Kill-meets-idol-boys shtick is entertaining, to an extent, but it takes itself too seriously to really stand out. Additionally, the show is so concerned with giving every boy their screentime that the main story often gets sidelined--or, depending on how you look at it, the show devotes far too much...time to the Saturday morning exploits of ""power of friendship!""

On that note, the show also features episode-long diversions in the plot that can feel completely out of left field.That said, however, I think this anime adaptation is an absolute treat for anyone who already loves these characters. I have a blast watching new boys show up and bounce off of one another. The show plays up the quirks of its wackier characters in ways that the game and the manga can\'t quite convey--like Shinobu\'s constant scrambling and mumbling, Kanata and Mika\'s adorably odd speech patterns, or the pure visual comedy of Rei scrolling through his social media feed from the inside of his coffin--and it\'s just a joy to watch. Really, this anime functions more as a fun little companion piece to the game than a strong standalone show.The art direction and animation are nothing to write home about. There are a couple of faster-moving scenes that are granted a couple more frames\' attention (the fight between Koga and Kuro in episode 1 or 2 comes to mind) but even that\'s pretty standard, comparatively. The interchanging use of both hand-drawn and 3D animation during live performances is a little jarring, but the 3D models are kind of cute, so I don\'t mind as much. Speaking of the lives, I found the songs the characters performed to be quite catchy, and they stand out quite nicely from the show\'s regular soundtrack (and the OP, unfortunately). The ED also features interchanging songs from different units that are always a nice treat. It\'s still one of those ""nice if you already like idol songs/J-pop"" things, I guess.TL;DR Ensemble Stars is a mediocre, skippable anime, but if you play the game or even just know about the characters in passing from your Tumblr mutual or something it\'s good fun. time to the Saturday morning exploits of ""power of friendship!""

Simply getting to see the characters I love moving around in anime format was great, and it was very fun sharing in the hype with my fellow fans. HOWEVER. The anime as a whole when looking past my love for the franchise was very poorly done. I understand that they were trying to give every character from the game screen time but considering that they were trying to showcase the main story of the original game- which is extremely meaty- it just didn't work out very well. The main...plotline is nowhere near as compelling as it is in the game- and maybe I only felt that way because I was experiencing it for a second time- but I think it really missed the mark. As for the tiny portion of the giant pool of in-game events that were chosen to be adapted into the anime... Well let's just say it's done worse than the main plot. They literally just shoved bits and pieces of the events in, and although a few got full episodes such as Ryuseitai's Supernova event from the game, they are missing important details and even major plot points. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this anime unless you are already an Enstars fan. If you want to get into the franchise and don't know where to start, the Ensemble Stars Wiki is a great place. From there I suggest looking up translations of the stories and/or downloading the new English version of the game. plotline is nowhere near as compelling as it is in the game- and maybe I only felt that way because I was experiencing it for a second time- but I think it really missed the mark.

THEN come back and watch the anime. Then the experience will be genuinely good. You can also get the mobile rhythm game but know that it is from a different 'era' of Enstars. The anime is in the '!' era, while the current game is in the '!!' era.

Read the story translations first. I recommend reading the main story, the war, and maybe 1 or 2 other ones that interest you because they include a character or unit you like. THEN come back and watch the anime. Then the experience will be genuinely good. You can also get the mobile rhythm game but know that it is from a different 'era' of Enstars. The anime is in the '!' era, while the current game is in the '!!' era. So some characters and the stories won't line up with the anime.If you still want to watch the anime first, then you can do that. Just read some of the stories soon after if the anime interested you in the franchise at all.Basically - The anime is good. Just have prior knowledge of the franchise and it'll be great.""]"

This is usually because whatever show it is was something that aired a long time ago and I'm binge watching the entire thing. Nothing is more frustrating than spending an extra 22 minutes watching a recap to something you just watched. But this time I'm actually watching Honzuki no Gekokujou as it's airing and boy oh boy do you feel those months in between seasons. Coming back to a show with this intricate of a narrative I was tempted to go rewatch the entire first two seasons. Thankfully I didn't have to when I saw there were...these nice short recap episodes. Perspective is an amazing thing, huh.These do a great job summarizing the key points of the narrative and helping you remember all the characters. I grew a new appreciation for these kinds of recaps and how it can quickly help you get back into a show that hasn't aired in a while.

High School DxD Hero: Taiikukan-ura no Holy,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37719/High_School_DxD_Hero__Taiikukan-ura_no_Holy,"['[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––(High School DxD Hero Episode 0: An important retcon of the final four episodes of High School DxD BorN)It has been three years since the last High School DxD season with the previous installment being High School DxD BorN.  A season that deviated from its original source material, and added anime original content, specifically episodes 9-12, and major changes to it overall storyline.  Changes that angered light novel fans, its author Ichiei Ishibumi, and many others individuals.This is what happened: Ichiei Ishibumi changed to a different studio, i.e. Passione, and with that change comes a new director, a new series...composition, and a new character designer.  This is why the art style is different from previous High School DxD seasons.  And because the final four episode of High School DxD BorN was met with criticism and dissatisfaction from its author and fans, this episode will act as a retcon of those episodes and will bridge the gap for season 3 and 4 of the High School DxD series.STORY:I will say it again.  Forget the final four episodes of High School DxD BorN.  In this episode, the Rias Incident and the whole Loki Incident/fight never occurred.Here are some similarities between this and High School DxD BorN: the whole Shalba Beelzebub appearing and killing Dodoria, Asia being send into the Dimensional Gap and assumed dead, the activation of Issei’s Juggernaut Drive, defeating Shalba Beelzebub, and Issei being stuck in that transformed state, and Vali’s team arriving and bring Asia back from the Dimensional Gap.Here are some differences between this and High School DxD BorN: Irina coming in and carrying a huge projector from Odin, the use of the ""Oppai Dragon Song"" to calm Issei, Asia confessing to Issei behind the school gymnasium, and the introduction of new characters.While, Passione could have reused the same animations from season 3 with only the difference being the art style, that isn\'t the case here.  Passione, instead, recreated these scenes using different perspectives and camera angles, while adding new minor details.  Thus, making the episode more dynamic and interesting.Overall, if Passione continues to make proper adaptions like this, then I believe season 4 of High School DxD will be good.ART:The art style is now very similar to the light novel, unlike its previous installments where the characters appear very mature and realistic.  I understand that the art style may be more softer tone, colorful and simpler in its design, but with these changes comes better animations all overall.  The character animations and action scenes have dramatically improved in terms of frame rate and flow, and the character design are more in line with the light novel\'s design.Overall, people will still enjoy the cute female characters with great personalities, the ecchiness and nudity bounces in full force, and the story line will once again returning to its light novel roots.TLDR: The author and studio are saying, “Fuck those final four episodes of High School DxD BorN because it’s wrong and deviates from the light novel.  Watch this episode instead because it’s proper and follow the light novel more closely.” composition, and a new character designer.

But plot-wise, I don\'t think we need this episode as ""bridge"", we can continue into 4th season(DxD Hero) with final Born memories in mind.Story:As I stated above, this one is has some differences from final 4-episodes of DxD born but I think it\'s  unnecessary. Main difference is Rias \'Arc\' that\'s completely removed. I don\'t read the...LN, so I don\'t know the reason, but to us who\'ve watched Born, we can\'t just erase it from our memory, right? The other major difference is how they resolve Issei rampage, and I would say this with 100% confidence, how DxD Born resolve that is ten times better than this. How could you change beautiful moment into silly joke? I don\'t care even if that\'s deviation from Novel, I still think it\'s unnecessary to create special episode for this crap.Art:Different studio handle 4th season including this, it\'s not unusual if they want to change art and animation style. I don\'t really want to complain, as mostly it change into lighter tone but at least they\'re still recognizable. BUT.. the one that I won\'t accept, and probably stay the same for entire 4th season is.. Rias Appearance. What a terrible things they did to the mature, elegant, beautiful looks of our Ruin Princess, they completely ruin it (no pun intended). And here, they change her into cliche cute and plump girl. Usually I like those kind of character art, but for Rias, that\'s complete bust of character. And I need to endure it for this and next installation of DxD?So to summarize this, I won\'t recommend this episode for DxD anime fans (anime-only, as LN reader would have different perspective). That recommendation also applied to those who are completely new to DxD series (are they even exist?), they would need to watch the first 3 season anyway, and that\'s from different studio, result in different art style and plot, like it or not.

It has been more that three months since I last checked the series and never looked back since then. That stupid television dance gag made me tab out quicker than I did with any other series. I couldn't find the point why they had to alter the ending of born for something stupid. Was the 4th season any good? I have no clue. I'll leave the answer to those who find enjoyment in this series. The first three season was ok I just couldn't handle that opening scene and find any reason to watch the...series anymore.

There are quite a bit of changes so let\'s go.Juggernaut: I\'ll split it into three phases: begining phase, fight phase and ""Aftershalba "" phase.1st phase: Issei getting into Juggeranut. I think BorN did this transition way more intense than this rework so here BorN wins.2nd phase: Issei fight with Shalba. I think both are epic so...I\'ll leave it at draw.3rd phase: Here comes the funny part, BorN 3rd phase is mainly non canon, we see Issei fighting with Vali in his Juggernaut drive to weaken Issei berzerk, after using Divide Rias come and try to awaken Issei which eventually happens. Now the Canon one, Odin sends a radio with Oppai dragon song which our protagonist play to Issei which leads to his return to normal, good way to ruin a serious moment. I\'ll give it to BorN. Even though it\'s not canon I liked overally fight and serious ending better, this also can be used as a stop of DxD being a little bit of horror themed.Why it\'s getting 7/10 while BorN was 6/10? Because there are some added scenes like Cao Cao scene for example, which looked really sickLittle after edit: Overall I think this was unnecessary episode, I would rather see rating game: Rias vs. Sona I\'ll leave it at draw.3rd phase: Here comes the funny part, BorN 3rd phase is mainly non canon, we see Issei fighting with Vali in his Juggernaut drive to weaken Issei berzerk, after using Divide Rias come and try to awaken Issei which eventually happens.

So i was confused. The i saw that and i thought wtf reallly, the LN is more perverted then the anime. Because of the story it is different, then the normal one. You see the charakter act different and this is huge.I dont have problem with the perverted stuff, but that was kinda cringe. The Scene where they sing and all that stuff....I don't like that and the new art style. But i am happy for every LN fan's, i now how it is when this is not 1:1 and especially when the LN better is.As a anime fan i recommend the normal ending.btw i saw that by the relase and not in 2021 ^^ I don't like that and the new art style.

With this one being more canon than the other, as well as a showdown of the animation work of the new studio that's taking over the production of season 4.- Story (7.0/10):I personally liked the way this ending took root more, it made a lot more sense and used some past plot points to justify the yet ridiculous conclusion. What I liked, even more, is the minimalistic fanservice here, the lack of fanservice really helped to get the viewers to focus on what's going on, which...did make the confrontation and Issei's transformation more emotional. But the rest still was low on effort and quality.- Art (6.5/10):I think that this might be the downfall in regards to the animation, the colors are more vibrant and attractive, but the art style just doesn't work with Hich School DxD, we used to have sharp edges and hard colors, but everything looks soft and out of proportions, for instance, Asia looks like she suddenly grew a cup size or something.Sometimes faces look very ugly and unappealing, the really screwed the face features mapping this time.- Sound (6.0/10):I give this low score mainly because of the poor auditions, the voice acting felt so blunt and forced, like when Issei screams, he sounds like his voice actor was doing his last recording for the day after 20 hours of none stop work, very tired and lazy. And what doesn't stop only at Issei!- Character (6.0/10):Again, which the poor character design,n this art style just doesn't deliver the old nostalgic vibe of the previous series. I even struggled to recognize some of the characters due to the staggering change they went through.- Enjoyment (7.0/10):I know I've stated so many flaws, but I still enjoyed what I've seen for what it was, I like me some High School DxD every once and a while, and this one did deliver, even though barely.- Overall (6.5/10):I wouldn't highly recommend this, but it could serve as a good startup to get your a bit familiar with the nex animation and direction, and also, to make you reconsider your hype for the 4th season.Although, it's not that necessary, and is very skippable. did make the confrontation and Issei's transformation more emotional.

As if this was a Saturday morning cartoon like Tiny Toons.This very noticeable in how the hair and eyes are drawn for all the characters.

Rias' and Akeno's hair no long flows they might as well be hard plastic wigs.Heck Rias' hair is no longer crimson, it's just fire engine red.  Once silver hair is now dull light gray.The animation is much more...simplistic as well.

This is because the original studio TNK stopped animating the DxD series and a different studio called Passione took over the DxD project. It took a while to readjust myself to the art style found on the light novel as opposed to the anime art style many of us had been used to thus far but nonetheless it didn't take too...long.If there's one thing I found absolutely hilarious about these specials: Grabbin Dragon haha long.If there's one thing I found absolutely hilarious about these specials: Grabbin Dragon haha"", ""MINOR SPOILERS AHEADOh man, this was so much better than the Born version. I was tearing up from laughing so hard. When Irina brought the music, I knew what was coming and just couldn't stop chuckling. Vali's and Biko's reactions to the whole thing were just the icing on the cake.The Juggernaut Drive was done better too. It felt more powerful than the Born version. Passion did a good job in getting that part feeling right. Same with Asia's transfer to the dimensional gap. It looked more catastrophic than the Born version, so it didn't throw you for a loop at an inappropriate time.Animation...style is different, but still good. I don't mind it one bit. I look forward to watching the rest of Hero. Long live DxD style is different, but still good. I don't mind it one bit. I look forward to watching the rest of Hero. Long live DxD""]"
Hyper Police,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1180/Hyper_Police,"['Anyone who knows me or is familiar with my reviews will note I have a soft spot for nineties anime. This could stem from my having grown up on nineties anime and feeling a familiar warmth when encountering the older animation style and conventions of this bygone era. But I personally think it stems from my love for anime that treats itself not as some sort of totally serious medium. Many nineties anime, such as Hyper Police, The Slayers, You’re Under Arrest, Great Teacher Onizuka, Tenchi Muyo, etc. understood that they were cartoons and managed to balance silly moments with usually decent stories and typically...conventional, but loveable characters. Even the classics like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop combined that comedic, cartoonishness with serious plot.I like having fun, and the nineties was a time when anime was okay with being stupid and cartoony for the sake of entertainment. Nowadays, you very rarely get that sense of fun when watching anime. Maybe it’s just me and my nostalgia. Maybe I have a soft spot for Hyper Police’s style. Maybe I’m going to overrate Hyper Police purely because of my love for this sort of anime.So take that into consideration when reading this review.Hyper Police takes place in a world where monsters, humans, and gods coexist, though not exactly on friendly terms. Humans are given all kinds of government aid and many aren’t big fans of the monsters. Natsuki is a bounty hunter in Tokyo, where she works with her friends to take down the big bad guys and earn enough money to live. She’s a cat girl, her love interest is a werewolf, and there’s another werewolf who tags along.When Sakura, a nine-tailed fox with only eight and one-fifth tail, sees Natsuki’s lighting attacks in action, she decides that she wants to steal that power to gain her final tail. She joins the bounty hunting agency to get closer and, of course, eventually befriends Natsuki and decides against killing her.It’s a pretty basic set-up for an episodic anime. Very early on, though, the bounty hunting agency closes down and everyone goes their separate ways, which leads me to wonder what all the set-up was for in the first place. We’re given time with characters at the beginning who barely matter in the least. That’s not to say there are any characters who are given too much time and don’t make an impact later on, but I feel that the abruptness of the shift in plot was too early and didn’t have enough build-up.This, truthfully, sums up the rest of the plot. A samurai from the sixteenth century shows up and after two or three episodes he’s married to Sakura. One episode she’s completely infatuated with him, the next it opens with babies running around. I don’t take offense to moving the plot quickly, but sometimes you should build things up much more before you let major plot events like a marriage happen. It’s bad enough the marriage isn’t even shown and the characters aren’t given enough time to gel before it happens. Later on, there’s an episode that makes you wonder why they even got married in the first place.This problem is compounded by the tonal shifts. It starts as a bounty hunting adventure, becomes a sort of comedy, starts dealing with relationships, then toward the end gets serious again with the idea of humans having racial problems with monsters.That’s way too much jumping around. If Hyper Police had focused on perhaps one or two of these facets rather than juggling so many, it would have benefitted. Instead it juggles romance, comedy, action, and a serious plot and doesn’t do so very well.But nobody remembers Hyper Police for any of these things; they remember it for the cute girls! And Hyper Police delivers the goods. Cat girls, fox girls, dog girls, bounty hunter girls, prison warden girls!That said, the male characters are hopelessly in love with our female characters. Batounan is in love with Natsuki despite the fact she’s like, half his age. She’s in love with him too, so I guess it all works out in the end. But then there’s a guy named Tomy who is in love with a girl who works at the prison and he winds up in all kinds of silly situations trying to admit his love to her.The dub is…tolerable. There are no good voice actors which might contribute to why this anime, despite having a dub and DVD release, is so little known in the states. Names are pronounced one way, then another , then the original way. Some of the voice actors seem to be phoning it in, especially Poe’s, who speaks in this airy, bored way that isn’t even convincing despite Poe’s uncaring attitude. It’s a real amateur hour.The music is alright with a decent opening and overused tracks during the show. The animation, like the music, is just average.So what do I like so much about Hyper Police?It’s got cute girls, it’s definitely funny, the setting is fun, and there is a definite sense of silliness that pervades the anime and kept me watching. It’s got a lot of problems and could benefit from better pacing and writing, but it is too entertaining to pan for its failings.I can’t recommend it to everyone. Hell, I couldn’t really wholeheartedly recommend it without knowing you well. It’s a perfect example of nineties cheese, and Lord knows I love cheese. conventional, but loveable characters. Even the classics like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop combined that comedic, cartoonishness with serious plot.I like having fun, and the nineties was a time when anime was okay with being stupid and cartoony for the sake of entertainment.

It’s a real amateur hour.The music is alright with a decent opening and overused tracks during the show. The animation, like the music, is just average.So what do I like so much about Hyper Police?It’s got cute girls, it’s definitely funny, the setting is fun, and there is a definite sense of silliness that pervades the anime and kept me watching. It’s got a lot of problems and could benefit from better pacing and writing, but it is too entertaining to pan for its failings.I can’t recommend it to everyone. Hell, I couldn’t really wholeheartedly recommend it without knowing you well. It’s a perfect example of nineties cheese, and Lord knows I love cheese.', ""Although animal people are a famous anime trope it's rare to see a setting where every character is part animal and humans are the minority.Hyper Police's world is very detailed - from the visual design that always brings new ideas of monsters, characters and mechanics, to the the dialogues that explore laws, ethics and lifestyle, it almost feels like a real parallel universe.Some episodes focus on side characters and so you get a lot of different approaches to this world. There's a variety ensemble of at least 10 recurring characters, each unique and interesting enough to receive a spin off of its own.Almost every character...has a love interest and the main couple, Batanen and Natsuki, is one of the sweetest ones I've seen. I was on the edge of my sit for every small development between them and it was extremely fun watching their chemistry.The show never gets repetitive or boring. The writers control the pace with a tight grip, always finding new character interactions or situations to put them in to keep the narrative fresh.The episodic structure of the show sometimes feel forced, but if you're looking for an epic story with drama, twists and turns you're in the wrong show. Still, the show has a story continuity and there are some really unexpected character and world developments.If you're looking for a fun entertainment with light drama you must watch this anime.

Highly recommended."", ""Hyper police is one anime I was interested in but when I seen the entire show, I was disappointed but its not a bad anime to watch. So here is my review of the show.Story:5/10The story follows Natsuki who is a rookie bounty and half human/half cat in a world where humans, monsters, and gods live together after mankind has fallen many years back as now in this time they call it the holy era. Natsuki and the other bounty hunters jobs is to keep the peace from many monsters and sometimes human who are trying to breaking it. That's the plot and here...is my main gripe. Its episodic. That's the reason why I'm disappointed because there is no plot to speak of until when its at the very end of the show. There are times that does show a plot but mostly its just filler. But they are entertaining enough to see and the comedy is pretty decent enough. So while the plot is non-excision, at least it does a good job to try to entertain me which is why I give this section a five.Art:7/10The art is ok at best. It doesn't look great but its not that bad ether. Character designs look well enough and the action scenes are well fluid in animation wise. I like how the world looks as it really shows that it use to be all beautiful before the holy era began. So the art is while not great, it is fine for what it is.Music:6/10The op by AYA is really one of the catchiest songs that I've heard and the ending by Yuko and Chiyako is also my favorite ending so for. But what about the other music. Well they didn't impress me as its like any generic music you hear  in the 90's. Nothing special but it fits and they don't sound out of place.English dubs vs english subs:This is where I'm gonna decide which track you should listen. The dub is ok at best as its not that bad compare to the other 90's and 80's dubs but I do have my gripes. Batanen voice is a little to deep in my opinion, Natsuki is too high and annoying! And secondary characters are hit or miss. One voice that I praise is Dorothy who did the voice for Sakura as she really gives her character personality. Now I only watch this in dub as I couldn't find the japanese version online. Its like it doesn't exist and I look high and low for it. So if your gonna see this then skip if you want subs but those who wan't dubs then this is good to listen to if you can handle the voice of the main character(seriously her dub voice is annoying).Winner: English dub by default unless if you know where the subs is then the english subs is the winner.Characters:6/10The cast is decent enough to follow. There really isn't much depth to them but there personalities are very good and clever even if I have seen this before. They kinda develop as the episodes go by but they still act the same. So in terms of characters they are enjoyable but don't expect them to develop them well.Enjoyment:5/10I did enjoy this when I watch it but as I go on, it kinda drop. I was expecting at least some sort of plot line like how the world is form because it didn't explain it well. But if your in for something to waste your time then this is for you.But if your hoping for good story telling and character development then skip it.Overall:5/10 Average is my main gripe.

My lyrical stylings aside, Hyper Police is another mid-nineties anime that I missed the first time around and which I\'ve watched now in my continuing quest to test the operational lifespan of my eyeballs. It share\'s a certain mid-nineties aesthetic which newer anime fans (or even older ones who lack the myopic eye of nostalgia) may find offputting. But it’s a style I find to be quite enjoyable - probably as it’s the style of anime that was in vogue when I first started...watching it and as such formed the mental foundations on which my love of the medium was built.Anyway, introspective blather aside, Hyper Police is a fairly by the numbers action series with the usual flavouring of romance, comedy and character development. The plot is fairly episodic with no particularly entrenched back-story. This makes it excellent for casual viewing as most episodes can be watched in isolation. In some ways it comes across as ""Wicked City PD Blues"" or ""Renegade: Demon City Shinjuku"". Now whether those analogies a) make sense to you and b) intrigue you is not my problem. While Hyper Police isn’t bad there\'s probably a lot of other stuff you could (and should, yes that’s right should) be watching instead. But for a ""backup"" series that you can casually throw on in the background it may be worth a look. watching it and as such formed the mental foundations on which my love of the medium was built.Anyway, introspective blather aside, Hyper Police is a fairly by the numbers action series with the usual flavouring of romance, comedy and character development.

To get that out of the way: one-note 90\'s-era cliches and stereotypes drive almost everything, and the plotting is mostly episodic with gradual changes in the recurring characters, which is enough to keep it alive but not enough to make it inherently compelling. The finale baffles me just as much as ever on a rewatch of the series, almost a decade later: although it\'s a cool ending, and some of the best writing in the series, the big moments all read as non-sequiturs thrown in to make it try...to add up to something.And all of that is a shame, because the setting is full of little worldbuilding details that bring it alive: The bounty hunting business, the post-apocalyptic cityscape, the street scenes with dozens of different anthro people and moments of physical comedy. It just gets dragged down by all the screen time spent on reprisals of predictable character moments, simple misunderstanding plots, and low-risk reset-to-zero conclusions: things that infest anime today too, but are a little more grating for being dated.However, when it works, it\'s good. Generic villain characters frame most of the episodes, and those are great foils that consistently bring out the best of the main cast. Age has mostly been kind to the visuals, too: no high budget animation, but the visual design has some classic stuff. These good elements are good enough - and distinctive enough - that I wanted to rewatch it over ""better"" old series, which might be enough to recommend it to a discerning viewer(given the caveats). to add up to something.And all of that is a shame, because the setting is full of little worldbuilding details that bring it alive: The bounty hunting business, the post-apocalyptic cityscape, the street scenes with dozens of different anthro people and moments of physical comedy.

The character developments are a bit rushed, but still made me feel attached to them.At first I stayed for the comedy, but as the story progressed, I started to watch to see the main character's growth.I'm not really good at reviewing. All I can say is  although the ending is kinda rushed if you like rom-coms with a bit of drama and slice of life, give this anime a chance. The music also sounds nice, although I don't speak Putonghua, the melody and lyrics were really soothing. Fair warning the voicings...are a little but missed matched in the last few videos.

I initially dropped it after the first 2 episodes but seeing how the corona virus has caused a lot of delays in other animes, I decided to pick it up again because I was looking for something to watch and I remembered that it was quite funny.But as the anime progressed, the story started to get more interesting. The villainess started to get increasingly sly with her plans to drag Qin Ya down, to the point where I honestly hated her guts (a sign of a villainess done well). It was enjoyable...to see the characters grow, especially Qin Ze, although the romance seemed a little rushed.Like the previous review mentioned, the ending did seem rushed but overall I did enjoy the story.

The anime portrayed Qin Ze as having a strong passion for music, and I think the singer was able to deliver that perfectly with his stunning vocals.Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a music/idol anime with a touch of reality and romance in it, then this anime might just be your thing :) to see the characters grow, especially Qin Ze, although the romance seemed a little rushed.Like the previous review mentioned, the ending did seem rushed but overall I did enjoy the story.

It's impossible to think that this anime would be so underrated. It's literally a hidden gem. It's rare to find an anime so fulfilling at every episode.

The biggest selling point would be the quality of the content and animation which are 2 of the many great qualities an anime needs to be rated high.

You wouldn't expect long elaborate things from it, and it gives you what you should expect. A simple plot line, a clear progression to the end. The story is about two men in a world where some can use magic. Personally,...I thought it played pretty well in four episodes with this idea, specially when linked to its character development.Characters: 8The character personalities were well made to match the theme of the anime.

BL anime in itself is quite rare (as compared to, oh i dunno, harem and/or ecchi types??) and a BL anime with special attention to animation style is exceedingly rare. But given a typical plot line of a BL manga (no spoilers here), whatever is lackluster in the plot or the characters is really made up for in the animation quality. Cmon, this is a BL anime that's not only HD, but...also beautiful!? You don't get to see these often at all. Plus I personally think the characters have very cute reactions. Typical, yes, but still cute.Also, if you're not a fan of BL, or can't stand the sight of two guys together, then just don't watch this. If you're unsure but curious, you might as well give it a try--the episodes are only a couple minutes long and you'll be able to decide for yourself if you like if after the first episode. :) also beautiful!?

The fact that the events happen so quickly doesn't really give you time to feel anything for the characters.Art: 8As always the studio does a great job with the backgrounds and the general...art.

Plus the voice actors made a good job.Characters: 6We have two characters: Kashima (the one who works to much and doesn't have any interest in love) and Utsumi (the kind and accepting characters that falls in love with our main character). It's all very cliché really but at least there's some character developing happening.Enjoyment: 6It's a short anime that you should definitely watch if you want something with a good ending and that will make you feel happy at the end. However if you are looking for a good plot maybe you should look for something different.Overall: 6"", ""I pressed random on Crunchyroll and was directed to this anime. \u200bAs someone who has never seen this type of art style before, it was mesmerizing. My eyes stayed glued to the screen for all 4 episodes.The story was simple and easy to follow along.The music was lovely, and the sound effects appropriate.The characters were wholesome and endearing. Not once did I second-guess the character’s intentions.Just a straightforward and heartwarming short series. Even with the struggles present in the story, it remained lighthearted. It's perfect for anyone that is not looking for anything long and heavy. I enjoyed it immensely.If...I were to describe the series in one word it would be: lovely. I were to describe the series in one word it would be: lovely."", ""Honestly I really enjoyed these 40 minutes. Even though it was a short story and not many different characters it was still pretty satisfying to me. Unlike other I want to look towards the positive side of the anime, which is for me more important.The story pretty much focuses on the main character's emotional life and them as an individual, it shows how one thinks about themselves as a person. I was able to relate to the the character's judgements as it strongly spoke about how a person judge's their own personality and how it can be a good or a bad thing. There is...not much to the romantic part (bl scences and all) but rather it talks about the issues of a character as in accepting themselves for who they are...(PS. I came here as a fujoshi, there were cute scenes between the main character and his love, even though there were no hardcore romantic scenes, STILL I wasn't dissapointed it was rather a fun experience facing the truth)This is pretty uncalled but still I have to mention it ->(ANIMATIONS WERE A BLAST LIKE HOW THEY DID THE BACKGROUND, OPENING AND THE SPECIAL HIGHLIGHTS) not much to the romantic part (bl scences and all) but rather it talks about the issues of a character as in accepting themselves for who they are...(PS.

Kachou Ouji,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1025/Kachou_Ouji,"['Rock \'n\' Roll, the sound of sexual liberation, youthful revolt, and living in excess. Since its early induction in film and other media, this genre of music has become synonymous with the ""live-fast-die-young"" lifestyle, almost becoming a checklist shorthand in the process. Whether it be used mockingly (This Is Spinal Tap) or genuinely embraced (Nana), rock \'n\' roll has become a cornerstone in establishing tone and character. A correlative feature eventually made it a faux-literary device whenever brought up in any media that denotes the lifestyle mentioned.All of which brings us to the anime in question, Kachou Ouji (Black Heaven). A show about a...nine-to-five schmuck going through a midlife crisis, who, through a series of ridiculous events, is pleaded by a blonde bombshell from outer-space to save the world by picking back up his musical instrument. With his guitar playing skills becoming the only way to protect mankind from annihilation, a life defined by decades of tedium has finally been reinvigorated. This is the tale of a former rock star who ended up cutting his blossoming career prematurely to raise his family. A decision that led him into the cubicle-space hivemind, beating away at his keyboard day in and day out in order to bring bread to the table. With nothing to look forward to but heaps of paperwork and business seminars, this otherworldly woman offers him an escape from his vapid lifestyle; a man past his prime given a second chance at what he loves. And in the process of playing his music to save humanity, he also—you guessed it—rekindle the fleeting youth of his glory days.If you haven\'t guessed by now, the story and premise of Black Heaven is not just literal, but also allegorical. It externalizes the inner turmoil that our protagonist is going through, creating a metaphysical environment that allows us as viewers the chance to examine him in the process. Its narrative structure and motifs are similar to that of other abstract works like FLCL (Fooly Cooly) and Abenobashi. While being nowhere as bombastic or eccentric as FLCL, it similarly handled the protagonist\'s midlife crisis to how FLCL handled its coming-of-age themes. With rock \'n\' roll and the guitar being used as a motif to embody that youthful spirit and unkempt sexuality, what is seen on the surface is only as important as what they truly represent in our protagonist\'s life. This lends itself to several innuendos, some subtly surfacing to the foreground while others are shamelessly on-the-nose. Black Heaven is all about guided interpretation. Where some shows with this narrative structure may have some semblance of ambiguity as to what they\'re alluding to, Black Heaven is very upfront about what it represents, taking no detours to beat around the bush.Black Heaven is far from your typical anime outing, and perhaps no defining feature best establishes that than its targeted demographic itself. It should come as no surprise that a majority of anime is aimed at teens to young adults. Black Heaven\'s sense of humor and situational awareness is, first and foremost, directed towards older adults (which should be a no-brainer given the subject matter). It\'s an anime that thematically has more in common with Oscar-winner Crazy Heart than it does anything found in the medium\'s usual canon.It\'s not something that\'s trying to be gut-wrenchingly funny or instantaneously gratifying either, as it instead decides to draw humor and intrigue from relatable, commonplace issues that come with adulthood and all that it entails. It\'s a show that approaches the ordinary through a warped lens, never letting the growing pains of everyday life slip pass it. It\'s humorous because you ""get it."" You ""get"" the frustration that comes standard when dealing with an overbearing boss. You ""get"" how being caught up in the work environment could place distance in your social life, as well as your imitate relationships. You ""get"" how daily responsibilities can often strong-arm you into placing your hobbies on the back-burner. You ""get"" what our protagonist Oji Tanaka is going through, and in the process, chuckle at it, having experienced similar things yourself. And even if you haven\'t found yourself facing the same dilemmas firsthand, you\'ve possibly seen this occur with your parent/guardian(s) in retrospect. If you\'re old enough to grasp these troubles, it\'s easy to appreciate the show\'s endearment and honesty in depicting the growing pains of being a worker-ant and family man.While most of Oji\'s problems were played up for comedic effect, there\'s still a general sense of pity draped over his situation. Here\'s a man unsatisfied with the status quo of his home-life to such an extent that there\'s a rift forming between him and his loved ones. With a son whom he feels alienated from and a marriage just going through the motions, Oji is at the end of his proverbial rope, dangling with nothing left but memories of his youth. And as surreal as the concept may get at times, the humanistic endeavors remain down to earth.The mundane meet surrealism, comedy meet sobering reality—Black Heaven juggles them simultaneously, resulting in Oji\'s journey being a roller coaster ride of failure and triumph. At one minute you\'re snickering at his misfortune, and by the next, you\'re rooting for his success. And while other named characters occasionally get screen-time, the story remains Oji\'s, and Oji\'s alone. It\'s his woes; everyone else is just along for the ride.And really, at the end of the day, that\'s all the show needed to do. There\'s just something inherently intriguing about viewing someone else\'s plight. We never want to be at the receiving end of these troubles, but seeing others work through theirs always manages to command viewer attention.And to keep that attention, the show straddles our lead with a few companion characters. One of which is the extraterrestrial-bombshell mentioned earlier, Layla Yuki. Apart from our protagonist, Layla receives the most screen presence throughout the show. With a compelling mystique and sultry demeanor, it doesn\'t take much for her to honey-trap Oji into submitting to her whims. She encompasses an innate desire, a type of sensuality that could only be birthed from unbound sexual freedom; which makes her not only a pivotal character but a symbolic presence as well. She\'s the embodiment of Oji\'s bachelor days, free of marriage, of parental duties, of responsibility. His desire for her is a desire for his former self, which ties into an unspoken real-life truth for a reason men of his age often cheat with women still at the prime of their youth. Yes, there\'s a sexual urge present, but the motivating agent on a subconscious level is often just wanting to feel ""young"" again.Aside from her, we\'re also introduced to a ditzy comedic trio (names irrelevant) who operate similarly to that of The Three Stooges. They often lend their assistance, whether it was requested of them or not, and usually end up being more trouble than they\'re worth. Despite serving no further purpose beyond their hijinks as comedic reliefs, they were a welcome addition to the show. This also extends to the other side characters as well. They don\'t demand your attention, but their inclusion was still well-received. They breathed life into the situations that they were a part of and contributed in their own little way to making Oji\'s expedition one that was far more wholesome than had it been a one-man show.Another aspect that adds to this journey is without question the music selection. Given that the show chronicles the life of a former rock star, a proper opening theme was in order. And what better way to get each episode kickstarted than by having the intro song be performed by John Sykes, a writer for the rock band Whitesnake and former guitarist for Thin Lizzy. The song ""Cautionary Warning"" from Sykes\'s 1997 album, 20th Century, served just the right amount of spunk and bravado needed to get you pumped up for each new episode. With a snarling cadence that could only be delivered by a veteran with experience in his craft and a guitar riff that\'s toe-tappingly infectious, the opening song is a love-letter provided by Sykes, boasting all the tricks he\'s acquired over his luxurious 30+ years performing in the music industry.Almost serving as a counterbalance to the electrifying opening, the closing track is a bubblegum pop number with hints of jazz and funk undertones. It\'s cute in a way that befits Black Heaven\'s warped sense of style and humor.But even after factoring in everything going for it, there are still many issues that plagued this anime. For one, despite the strength of the standout musical tracks, the actual musical selection was insufficient; often reincorporating an instrumental version of the opening theme for whenever the protagonist picks up his guitar. While the gradual progression of the song along with Oji\'s own progress in the show was a nice touch, the sheer amount of times the song was used did nothing but lessen its ""pizzazz"" as it continued onward. There are a few other accompanying tracks sparsely scattered throughout the show\'s run-time, but they were mostly drowned out by the Cautionary Warning tune\'s repetition.Unfortunately, this cut-rate mentality didn\'t stop there, as it also affected the visual presentation for Black Heaven. It\'s below average, even by the standards of late 90s animation. Reused sequences were often implemented whenever it was possible, and outside of a few keyframes demonstrating some semblance of quality, still-frames were often used to cut corners. On top of that, the character designs are widely inconsistent or reduced to misshapen blobs if they\'re in the mid-ground or further away. ""Shoestring budget"" is what immediately comes to mind when discussing Black Heaven\'s production value. This isn\'t one of those cases where you could make the counterargument of ""it\'s supposed to look cheap."" It doesn\'t take a rocket scientist to see Black Heaven wasn\'t high on the Studio heads\' priority list.Outside of presentation issues, the show lacked screenplay polish that could have been tightened up with a script revision. This doesn\'t come as much of a surprise, given the chaotic state of the presentation at times. Where it\'s forgiven is the fact that the premise doesn\'t go to waste despite the blemishes spotted upon initial viewing. Some things just needed to be trimmed down a little more to allow for a better flow in the narrative.Despite these shortcomings, Black Heaven never felt bogged down by any of it; in fact, it could be argued (by some) that a few of these imperfections added to the show\'s charm. But that\'s more a matter of subjective preference than impartial assessment. It could have been assembled better but isn\'t handicapped by these drawbacks. What it lacked in pristine visuals, diverse sound selection, and a tighter script, it more than made up for with a sense of integrity and commitment to its tale.Black Heaven was born out of the need to tell one story, Tanaka Oji\'s story, and by extension, teach us to live life to the best of our capabilities; finding happiness regardless of the hand we\'re dealt.If you take the general storyboarding of American Beauty, add a dash of absurd allegorical visuals of Fooly Cooly, and filter it through a similar comedic lens of that of Welcome to the NHK, what you\'d get is this humorous Japanese-salaryman monstrosity. Black Heaven was quite the surprise for me. Despite its humble offerings, Oji and company always manage to find a way to keep me entertained. And even when it played things out comically, the adult subject matter was always handled with a sense of responsibility.Cheeky, charming, funny, and oddly enough, sobering, Black Heaven is a title that teaches us to find the silver lining, even during times when we find ourselves in a depressing slump.It\'s not something that\'s going to blow your mind with groundbreaking revelations, nor is it a grandiose tale to defend earth (despite what the immediate premise alludes to). Where Black Heaven shines is in its commitment to telling a man\'s intimate struggle with no need for party tricks to keep the attentiveness of the viewer. It remains a small-scale identity crisis only inflated in relevance by the protagonist that\'s going through it. Where other titles would topple over with such self-imposed constraints, Black Heaven uses this very limited range as the driving force behind its narrative. It treats its audience with respect, trusting that they\'re mature enough to understand the intentions. There are not that many shows out there that could dare to do the same, and while a bit rough around the edges, its heart was in the right place. And for if only for that reason alone, Black Heaven has effectively become a mainstay among my cherished favorites. nine-to-five schmuck going through a midlife crisis, who, through a series of ridiculous events, is pleaded by a blonde bombshell from outer-space to save the world by picking back up his musical instrument.

It starts out pretty plain but by the end you are at the edge of your seat. The setting goes from a hapless salary man's every day life, to a battle that the fate of the universe rests on. The Legend of Black Heaven is a wild ride with some of, if not the best, music that you have ever heard in a Anime.Story: I can honestly say that while the story is beyond a doubt a very original creation, it does lack some polish. Some events in the story take...place much to slowly (around the beginning especially) but by the end of it, the writers get it right and you're trying desperately to find the next episode to find out what happens. Don't worry if the first few are a little bland, you'll thank yourself by the end.Art: Art is perhaps the one field where Black Heaven really falls short. Now don't get me wrong, some of the space scenes are done in a very impressive CG and they look amazing! Unfortunately the reason they do look so good is that most of the artwork is nothing more than average. You won't find anything really special in this department either, but it's not so bad as to distract from the fun.Sound: AMAZING! &lt;--- The one word that really describes the sound and the soundtrack for Black Heaven. The fact that the story centers around a band, and the fact that music is an extremely integral part of the Anime makes the sound even better. While character development and action may be the most important and cause some of the most heart wrenching moments in other Animes, Black Heaven's music will make you cry, laugh, and rock on! To put this into perspective, the first ever OST I downloaded was this one, and I love it.Character: Both Oji and Layla are very memorable characters for me.  I loved it whenever they were on screen, even more when they were both on. Oji (AKA Gabrielle) makes it possible to love this series; his transformation from depressed cubical dweller to rock god is shown amazingly.However most of the other characters, while either interesting or pleasant, didn't leave me with lasting memories of them.Enjoyment: Again Black Heaven ranks very highly for enjoyment. This is a direct result of Oji and his great music. There will be times early on when it seems to drag, but these don't last very long. Layla's assistants also do a great job of putting in comic relief every time you see them. Personally, I enjoyed it even more the second time around.Overall: I give it an 8/10. I was tempted to give it an even higher mark but I know I shouldn't. This Anime is not perfect, nor will you mistake it for being one. But despite all of it's flaws it has a little bit of magic to it. A magic that you will feel every time Gabrielle strums his guitar. Honestly the music in it makes it a must see, or at least a must hear. (I wanted to give sound a 11/10 but they wouldn't let me) place much to slowly (around the beginning especially) but by the end of it, the writers get it right and you're trying desperately to find the next episode to find out what happens.

It tells the story of Oji, a gen\xaderic Tokyo salary\xadman going through a mid\xadlife crisis. After des\xadpair\xading when his wife throws out his favour\xadite elec\xadtric gui\xadtar, a sexy alien co-worker tells him that he is the one man with the abil\xadity to power an inter\xadgalactic super weapon using his gui\xadtar playing.Not that the space opera plot really mat\xadters that much. The super weapon runs on roughly the same energy...that the robots in Gur\xadren Lagann ran on, except this time it requires gui\xadtar play\xading to trans\xadform said spirit (which Black Heaven calls ‘groove’) into energy to run the weapon. We’re never given any reason why they’re fight\xading or who they’re fight\xading. One of my run\xadning the\xador\xadies through\xadout the series was that this was all in the main char\xadac\xadters head. The anime itself kept to the theme that this was all a dream, never cross\xading the bound\xadary between the real world and the space battles.What pur\xadpose the space  gui\xadtar play\xading battles really serve is a big meta\xadphor for the lead char\xadac\xadters mid life crisis. For everything that hap\xadpens in the space battle zone, there’s a clear cor\xadrel\xada\xadtion between what’s going on in his head and the real world. The real\xadisa\xadtion that nobody really cared about the songs he was play\xading in the space\xadships was a meta\xadphor for how he had got\xadten so wrapped up in try\xading to cre\xadate a spark in his mid life that he hadn’t real\xadised how his head was totally in the clouds. The numer\xadous sexual meta\xadphors con\xadnec\xadted to escap\xading to play his gui\xadtar, while played for com\xadedy pretty fre\xadquently, cor\xadrel\xadated to how he wanted to escape his whiny wife and unsat\xadis\xadfy\xading home life.Black Heav\xadens greatest achieve\xadment is that it man\xadages to keep both the gen\xaderal story and the meta\xadphors great fun to watch through\xadout. Purely on the sur\xadface level, Black Heaven is still an incred\xadibly fun anime. The char\xadac\xadters all have clear per\xadson\xadal\xadit\xadies and flawed in their own ways. The fail\xading mar\xadriage of Oji and his wife has no clear per\xadson you’re meant to side with. There’s a panic and fear sur\xadround\xading the women when she real\xadises that their mar\xadriage is fail\xading and he might be off with another women, but she struggles so hard to under\xadstand his pas\xadsion that it’s under\xadstand\xadable how Oji wants to cre\xadate a spark in his life with this meta\xadphor\xadical mis\xadtress of space gui\xadtar play\xading. Oji is a hugely flawed char\xadac\xadter him\xadself, prone to fre\xadquent feel\xadings of ela\xadtion and depres\xadsion. One of the parts I really liked about Black Heaven were how the most extreme moments in his emo\xadtions were set inside the ramen stall. It was the one place he could visit and be him\xadself without the show ever actu\xadally say\xading that itself.There’s so many little things I love about this anime. The grow\xading rela\xadtion\xadship between Oji and his son, where at the begin\xadning he knew noth\xading about him to Oji becom\xading the dads idol. The kids TV show Fly\xading 5 con\xadstantly provid\xading indir\xadect com\xadment\xadary to what was going through Oji’s mind at the time. The way the show never lost its sense of humour, whether it be through the hil\xadari\xadous sight of middle aged office work\xaders try\xading to fit a bass gui\xadtar over their ever-expanding bel\xadlies to the occa\xadsional yet rather lib\xaderal use of fanser\xadvice through\xadout the show (bunny girl press-ups spring to mind). It’s a story of iden\xadtity crisis wrapped up in a Heavy Metal Macross package.It’s far from per\xadfect and I’m not so blind as to sug\xadgest oth\xader\xadwise. Made in 1999, the anim\xada\xadtion isn’t par\xadtic\xadu\xadlarly good even for its time. The anim\xada\xadtion is pretty fluid but has a tend\xadency to re-use frames a hell of a lot and far away shots of char\xadac\xadters can often give them mis\xadshapen heads. The anime has a single utterly awe\xadsome theme song that it uses the entire way through the show. While this does add a lot when you hear how the song evolves through\xadout, it does start to get a bit much as it goes on. The comic relief trio don’t do an awful lot for the plot either and can some\xadtimes take up time being not very funny.My biggest com\xadplaint though is how I felt it star\xadted to lose sight of the bal\xadance it cre\xadated between the real world and the space opera right at the end. I get what it was going for and how Oji had come to terms with this dream by the end, but I felt it didn’t quite get the bal\xadance right the same way the rest of the series did. Even so, Legend of Black Heaven is one of the greatest anime I have ever seen, just in case that big fat 10 mark hadn't given away that already ;) that the robots in Gur\xadren Lagann ran on, except this time it requires gui\xadtar play\xading to trans\xadform said spirit (which Black Heaven calls ‘groove’) into energy to run the weapon. We’re never given any reason why they’re fight\xading or who they’re fight\xading. One of my run\xadning the\xador\xadies through\xadout the series was that this was all in the main char\xadac\xadters head. The anime itself kept to the theme that this was all a dream, never cross\xading the bound\xadary between the real world and the space battles.What pur\xadpose the space  gui\xadtar play\xading battles really serve is a big meta\xadphor for the lead char\xadac\xadters mid life crisis.

Even so, Legend of Black Heaven is one of the greatest anime I have ever seen, just in case that big fat 10 mark hadn't given away that already ;)"", ""For me this story has nothing to do with music, that's just accessory. The true jem about this anime is the story. With more money to avoid some scene repetition, this could have been one of the greatest anime i ever saw. This is definitly not for young people who are usually longing for strong,in  rough emotions. When I saw this anime i took pleasure in seeing that the main character is an adult,simple, regular person. No fancy things just plain normal. He could have chosen a life to follow his dreams, but instead like a man, he took up his responsibilities, dedicated himself...to his family. Nobody had to die, no overreaction. By contrast to many predictable, and drama queens animes, in Black Heaven there is no big drama, it's just simply sad. There is no blood sacrifices, no impossible, platonic hyped love. It's the most realistic essay of the human condition i've seen in anime in a very long time. He doesn't have a special power, he just happens to know how to play a song. For some it may be very boring, due to the small amount of action that you observe in the anime, however it is this tranquillity that allows it to develop the so well the characters. It reminds me of the 70's & 80's movies. Very few special effects and more concentration/focus on the character/plot development. The sound may be a bit repetitive after a while, but nevermind that, the rest will compensate for it. It's a serious anime for serious people. to his family. Nobody had to die, no overreaction.

It's a serious anime for serious people."", 'Kachou Ouji or Legend of Black Heaven does stand out quite a bit. It\'s a slice of life that features a middle aged salary man with a mid life crisis as a protagonist (not very common in anime) who also happens to be a former rock star and misses his glory days. He has a wife and kid who don\'t understand his obsession with the past and the show itself plays out like a black comedy filled with sexual innuendos and features themes such as the difficulty of aging, nostalgia and the hope for a happy life despite losing your youth and glory.Sounds like a...great show right? Well, sadly it\'s hard for me to get on board with that even though I really wanted to.Notice that this anime also has a \'sci fi\' tag attached to it, and sadly this ends up being the show\'s biggest weakness in my view. Not only because the sci fi genre doesn\'t integrate that well in to a slice of life about a middle aged man who desires to relive his youth, but it also ends up forcing the protagonist in to situations, making the story often take bullshit turns and by extension hampering its themes. Spoilers ahead.The first episode opens with a space battle which is used to establish this work as a science fiction series right away. But this scene doesn\'t do a very good job since it really doesn\'t become relevant until episode 2, it has metal music played over it and is followed by an opening sequence filled with interesting trippy visuals and a metal song accompanying that. So that scene could\'ve easily been brushed off as some kind of visual metaphor.But sadly that scene becomes center stage later even though the 1st episode (which was the show at its best) focuses solely on the protagonist\'s mid life crisis and how all the color was sucked out of his life as an aging salary man.In episode 2 the protagonist meets a hot chick who encourages him to play the guitar and relive his glory days.She later turns out to be an alien who\'s just taking advantage of his unexplained guitar playing powers that somehow helps her and her allies shoot stronger lasers at their faceless and motivation-less enemies in space.What happens in between episode 2 and 5 is that his wife is getting annoyed by the fact that this alien woman is taking up a lot of his spare time  with his family (and suspects he\'s cheating on her) and so hi-jinks and misunderstandings ensue.Up until the end of episode 5 The protagonist does not realize he\'s being taken advantage of and when it is revealed he does not take this revelation kindly (despite the fact that she explains this to his face in episode 2) and he mistankingly believed that she genuinely wants to hear his music.. which is followed by a slow and meditative episode 6 made up of the protagonist just contemplating, thinking about where to go from there.Episode 6 could\'ve been a great turning point for our protagonist with him eventually realizing that he\'s better off living his boring but adequate life rather than living a lie or reliving your youth by becoming somebody\'s tool. But sadly the main character submits to his desires and becomes a tool for an alien war he knows nothing about.. Which would\'ve been fine if he was punished for his actions eventually, but the show does NOT condemn him for it. In fact, he ends up rewarded for his behavior which included neglecting his wife and kid.Thus for the rest of the series he keeps playing his guitar on the aliens\' space ship assisting them in defeating their enemiesI should also mention that later in the series the protagonist tries to convince his old band members (who have families and moved on with their lives) to join him in playing music for this space war ""to no avail""... only to magically appear on that space ship later with no explanation on how they got there.The biggest insult for me is that near the end of the series earth is also at stake all of a sudden  which leaves the band members no choice but to play more music and lend their powers which gives the characters even less agency. On top of that, the wife divorces the protagonist due to his neglect only to regret doing so a few minutes later (and also magically appears on the space ship somehow) when she realizes what\'s at stake.To me, all of this reinforces what a lazy plot device this whole sci fi bullcrap was all along, it simply doesn\'t give the characters much of a choice and as a result of this, the protagonist receives no further development in the second half of the show. He just willingly becomes the aliens\' tool and that\'s where his character arc ends. It makes it feel like nobody really learned anything and that there were no consequences to his actions.Leaving all that aside, none of the characters stand out all that much but they\'re not bad either.The protagonists\' wife and kid are fleshed out decently and given enough screen time and comedic moments for you to care about them and understand their relationship with our protagonist. I even liked some of his old band members and the sexy alien lady. But aside from him, his wife and the alien lady, none of them really have much of a character arc to speak of and I personally feel that these three arcs are all kinda botched in the end.Visually this show is pretty cheap looking. The animation is stiff, still frames are used fairly often and the characters look ugly and off model at times. On the other hand, the first episode had good cinematography with interesting camera angles and solid framing all around and so does the rest of the show but to a lesser extent. The character designs are distinct and seem to compliment their personalities pretty well.I also liked the use of color, everything in the protagonist\'s mundane life seems to be washed out with dull colors to reinforce how the color was sucked out of his life, hell, he even wears a white suit. This contrasts nicely with a much more colorful pallet when he\'s reliving his glory days.The music is very good but also a little disappointing since there really aren\'t that many songs. You have a fantastic metal opening theme that fits the series well and visually gives you a glimpse of the protagonist\'s former lifestyle but different versions of it are pretty overused throughout the show including when he himself plays the guitar.The ending song is a weird pop song that you sorta get used to. Voice acting is fairly good for what is required and the voices do match each of the characters\' personalities just fine.Overall, this show isn\'t a complete waste of time, it does have its moments, the comedy wasn\'t too bad and it\'s somewhat recommendable for being unique. But I personally don\'t think it lived up to its promise all that much and it just let me down with the way it handled its themes and characters. great show right?

The main reason to watch this anime is the sound.The story is really build up around the head character who is the mayor band leader. But in the whole story there are only like three different songs, of which one is played constantly. That's sad because the guitar player really is gifted, the music is great so it would drive everyone mad if there were more different songs!!!!!! "", ""Hey folks bullitbaby here again with another hopefully down to earth review.This anime is quite simply NOT worth watching but definitely worth LISTENING to MOST of the soundtrack if you like rock and roll guitar.WARNING: If you play guitar definitely do NOT watch this anime.  The absolutely MENTALLY DISTURBING animation of him playing these power jam KILLER riffs is not bad, it's INSULTING, BEWILDERINGLY AWFUL, LAZY, UNCREATIVE, UNINFORMED and HAUNTINGLY BAD.But how about the animation in general?Sure it's 1999 animation so we'll be fair and compare it to...Ghost in the ShellHunter x HunterEvangelionEtc etc.Based on those camparables, it absolutely, does hold up to scrutiny in more ways than i care to list.It appears from the very obvious logo in pre and post credits, this anime had the financial backing of PIONEER, the company well known for things that sound good LOUD.I give the SOUND a 9 or 10 depending but mostly a 10 because it definitely is AMAZING and without a doubt LOUD.  How much Pioneer had to play in that I don't know but IT DEFINITELY lives up to he PIONEER name as we know it in the late 90's.I honestly think, imho, this idea was sold as a rock Opera and had ALL the AMAZING POTENTIAL of such an endeavor.  Honestly, what an AWEWOME idea that ripping on guitar could provide fuel for fighting an intergalactic war.  And with Pioneer behind it, the whole anime should have been amazing, but alas, only the soundtrack Is.As for the storyline overall it could have been seductive, erotic but tasteful, engaging, and of course ROCKIN!!!, ya know like rock and roll but becomes none of those things.Nevermind how the anime also takes the same bad musical playing animation and equally bad space battle scenes and REUSES THEM over and over.  It's downright strange these regular scene deja vus makings something bad even worse.  Of course I know animation takes tons of time and talent.  I'm sure the temptation for anime artists to reuse a scene is always there cuz NOONE will ever notice.  Unfortunately, it happens so many times here, its impossible NOT to notice.Nothing else really needs to be said.  I could evaluate all the opportunity this anime squandered but then I'd have to explain how a musician feels when their playing to a person whose never picked up an instrument.Thanks for reading and I hope this review has helped you to STRONGLY consider checking out the soundtrack and avoiding the anime at all cost.

It’s heard to rate something that does not have a definite feel to it and this one seemed almost all over. It’s a slice of life with a lot of other things mixed into it and it just feels… off a bit. It’s not bad, but its not good ether leaving it in what I call no mans land along with a couple others that I have watched. The characters are rather likeable, Oji not really being my all time favorite but I think it really wasn’t created...for my age or gender. This feels more like it was made for those that were about 30 and up men that are in their mid-life crisis and find out that they lost several of their glory years stuck behind a desk. It’s something you might have to just go though before the character stands out.In this story, it’s a rocker who just wants his old life back after having it cut short. Unlike slice of life, he has to fight an alien race in order to save the planet and all with the power of his rock. It’s not a school boy or girl in trouble with love which is really different.The animation is all over the place. The characters look almost abnormal in how there bodies are created, Oji’s chin seems to fall off when he’s surprised, and all sorts of things happen. There is a lot of fan service and a lot of drama because of it.. If you’re going into this for amazing battle scenes, forget it. When there are battles and it isn’t much, most of the time it’s the weapon going off to rock and roll and mostly just the guitar. The rest of the time, its mostly slow images of life.The music, you really have to be the judge of. It’s alright for the 90’s but not really present day music. for my age or gender.

Black Heaven is not a one-time anime. You will watch it more than once. It\'s not deep. You dont have to rewatch to understand whats going on. You will remember this anime randomly sometime later in life and feel the need to watch it again. It\'s freaking great.It\'s about passion, and sticking to it. its about friends, family, love and depression. But there is no story-book lesson to learn here....It\'s not a shounen moral piece. It follows a man who decides what he wants to do with his life, always choosing what he loves above all else. That\'s probably the biggest draw of the work, the truly ""adult"" protagonist. This aint one of your high-school-shitfests. Oh, look, originality!Look, this is about music, and there are only like three songs tops in the series. IT\'ll get annoying if you marathon it, but hey, its the same as listening to it on the radio that way. The tunes are hella catchy.The art is kinda old. Not MSG old, but like, maybe, low-budget from 08th MS team-tier.  It looks good enough. Check out the first episode sometime. Actually, no. Set a day or two aside for this one.

It\'ll be fun.You are my instigator, you are my aggravator, you are my space invader, CAUTIONARY WARNING I PROPOSE~~~~~', ""Guitars, babes, saving the universe, hairmetal, and comedy--The Legend of Black Heaven is where it's at. Sure, it's an unrefined production effort that could be better, but it certainly stands out as a show that's worth watching at least once. After all, the series is only thirteen episodes and the pacing is fair enough that it could be finished in one or two sittings.The bare plot of Black Heaven does leave something to be desired, though. Don't expect any great twists, deep characterization, or huge revelations. However, I feel, that's one of the coolest things working for the series. As a portrayal of the routine,...usual life and diminishing dreams, it does well to stay away from those tropes and still be enjoyable.What really sold the series to me, though, was the brilliant depiction of Japan's rock scene. The show reflects on the decline of what rock once was as well as the uprising of more contemporary music in an interesting way, manifested through the main character. In fact, Oji comes to personify a sort of social commentary on the Japanese, showing how easily dreams are deferred for a salary-man's job. Several times throughout the series, characters are nagged back into reality, leaving us with the question of what's more important. This all works to make the message of staying true to oneself and following up on your dreams even more potent.My major gripe with the show is that, despite being a show focused on music, only a few songs are actually used throughout the duration of the anime. Sure, they're -cool- songs, but it'd be interesting and refreshing to hear something new in a show that's about rocking out.All in all, the anime is worth the time invested. It's a somewhat ecchi and slow-paced show compared to others, so I wouldn't reccomend it for someone who hasn't seen many series. However, fans of late 90's/early 2000 era anime, music-nerds, and anyone who's up for a glimpse at a solid portrayal of Japanese society should enjoy this a good bit. What's there to lose?

I felt that it hurt the over all because it ruins the whole rock and roll image. it\'s like watching a badass good guy for a while and latter you find out he is whiped by his wife. that is just lame.2: the whole band quit  and have lives of the own. not a bad thing , but it kind of hard for them to ""sneak"" out to play music.3: the whole affair image was just...filler. the whole office thought they did with good reason.  i thought slowed  down the story a bit. it was not need for it all. ether him single or have the alein  layla be a guy. so there is no affair to slow the story. the art was good and the theme of it being a music anime was done great. giant space guitar was great:)the sound was the best and saving grace of the series. i do like rock music. but i felt it was a great theme for space battle.Character: Oji was made of awsome. he was smart and understanding with his band mates. he was not over the top nor a loser. a rare thing to be seen.the only character i did not like was oji\' wife yoshiko. she only nagged when he was around. this is a rock and roll sereies not a bad drama. the family felt like filler.enjoyment: ok, the music and the art is what will keep most people watching. the story was a little hurt with the ""filler family"". some thing you do not see often but done badly here.overall: it is a cheap series to pick up. so the price is right. just pretend the wife is not there and it comes together better. filler. the whole office thought they did with good reason.  i thought slowed  down the story a bit. it was not need for it all. ether him single or have the alein  layla be a guy. so there is no affair to slow the story. the art was good and the theme of it being a music anime was done great. giant space guitar was great:)the sound was the best and saving grace of the series. i do like rock music. but i felt it was a great theme for space battle.Character: Oji was made of awsome. he was smart and understanding with his band mates. he was not over the top nor a loser. a rare thing to be seen.the only character i did not like was oji\' wife yoshiko. she only nagged when he was around. this is a rock and roll sereies not a bad drama. the family felt like filler.enjoyment: ok, the music and the art is what will keep most people watching. the story was a little hurt with the ""filler family"". some thing you do not see often but done badly here.overall: it is a cheap series to pick up. so the price is right. just pretend the wife is not there and it comes together better.', 'The Legend of Black Heaven&hellip;well it is a slice of life/comedy about Rock and Roll and Space&hellip;the two are not in fact mutually exclusive you see.  The series is pretty good for the year it was made in, which really doesn&rsquo;t affect anything unless you are some sort of visual-anime-snob.  The series is fun to watch and listen too, the music in my opinion is pretty good.  You&rsquo;ll enjoy this series if you like less slapstick styles of comedy (although there is some of that in there).  I finished the series in a single night, which says something for it, but...it does get a little repetitive and when the novelty of the ideas and themes wears off it can become slow in the middle, B+ effort, so sayth Lord Nyarlathotep&hellip; it does get a little repetitive and when the novelty of the ideas and themes wears off it can become slow in the middle, B+ effort, so sayth Lord Nyarlathotep&hellip;', 'I originally ran into _Black Heaven_ due to its inclusion in an _AMV Hell_, and then finished _Black Heaven_ while scanning an old anime encyclopedia (so all quite nostalgic). I wanted to like it because it seemed like a funny take on _Macross_, but the constantly repeated music, the slow and repetitive plot/pacing (in 13 episodes?!), and the occasionally very ugly animation all doomed it to pure mediocrity. ', 'This was a series that seemed to have so much going for it, and most of that potential ends up squandered. The plot sounded like something out of Heavy Metal, crossed with Interstella 5555, it featured some promo art gorgeous enough to hang on my wall (see the DVD cover if it\'s not on this site) and the opening theme was stunning in both audio and video. But as for the show itself... Well...What I thought I\'d be getting was a schlocky, pulpy, devil-may-care sci-fi story that lives up to the heavy metal lifestyle it seems to profess so much love for. Maybe my disappointment...is my own fault for thinking the show was going to offer something that it wasn\'t prepared to offer. Instead, the bulk of the show is like a coming-of-middle-age slice of life... comedy? I feel compelled to use the question mark because most of the jokes or gags are just groan-worthy.As I said, I was in love with the opening sequence. But then if you watch the ending sequence, it looks nothing like the rebellious heavy metal love letter from the opening, and instead makes the show look like a soulless pop-appeal throwaway entry in the moe slice-of-life genre. In a sense, the show finds itself caught in a war between these incompatible ideologies, and I saw the latter side winning more often than not.The portions of the show where that metal ideology shines through approach the territory of ""pretty good series."" But even then, there are problems. The space battles use some very dated CGI, and while John Sykes\' musical contribution to the series was its highest point of quality, it\'s obvious he gave them one track and nothing more, because the instrumental version of the OP is used ad nauseam in nearly every musical sequence. I can\'t exactly say I got tired of it, since I still listen to the song long after having finished the series, but a greater variety could have helped the story.Overall, the story didn\'t build up to a climax that I particularly cared about, nor did it pack the kind of punch that I really want in a sci-fi work, particularly one where rock or heavy metal music are touted as themes or influences. There\'s a plot development near the end where the enemy space fleet finds their own musician to fight back against the main character, but again, nothing too powerful comes out of that subplot. The greatest item of value in the series, outside of John Sykes\' Cautionary Warning, is a scene that went somewhat viral under names like ""worst black guy in a Japanese dub."" It was a funny scene, but not really for the reason the creators intended.It might be enjoyable if you\'re looking for a lighthearted family comedy first and foremost, if this gels with your sense of humor. But if you\'re seeing the promotional material I\'ve seen, read the synopses I read, and saw the opening sequence I saw, and you want something like that, I\'d direct you to something like Interstella or Heavy Metal before I\'d ever direct you to this.

Black Heaven features office grunt and middle-aged man Oji reliving his days as a rock guitarist when he unknowingly becomes the major tool an alien race needs to combat an enemy threat that could wipe out the Earth if not stopped. The fun from the series comes from the show\'s mix of sci-fi/adventure and slice-of-life comedy as Oji\'s life turns topsy-turvy from interacting with Layla and the aliens. Oji gets his head too into the clouds over reliving his younger days with Black Heaven where it effects his work and home life, the aliens need his help...at the most inopportune times and the three alien gals who serve under Layla contribute some of the best comedy relief I\'ve seen in an anime thanks to their lack of common sense when it comes to understanding elements of Earth culture. Despite the comedy, the series does have its serious moments where Oji\'s revival of his music interest strains his marriage and he gets into a moment of disillusionment when he realizes the reality of his situation as Earth\'s hope for survival from the enemy fleet, as well as Layla developing admiration for Oji\'s guitar playing and outlook on music.The visuals to the series are solid with clean details and vivid color with scenery and character designs. Animation shortcuts are apparent at points, particularly with reused shots of animation from Oji\'s guitar playing and the firing of the fleet\'s ""ultimate weapon"". The show\'s soundtrack, as to be expected with the show\'s use of rock music for a plot element, consists mostly of rock and metal music tracks which fit quite well with the show\'s varying situations.Black Heaven isn\'t without its faults though. The series doesn\'t go into great length explaining what exactly the enemy alien threat is, explaining much about the war that the two fleets in and why Oji was seemingly ""the chosen one"" to help Layla and her forces with their conflict. The show also gets in the annoying habit of abruptly bringing about some plot twists way too conveniently in its second half, particularly the reuniting of the band and the resolution to the whole conflict.Outside of these issues, Black Heaven was an enjoyable romp for its effective mix of genres, the trio of alien gals adding in some unpredictable antics and its focus on Oji reliving his younger days while trying to fend off a hostile alien threat. This is a definite hidden gem for anime fans as I don\'t hear of the anime mentioned in many online circles of discussion. at the most inopportune times and the three alien gals who serve under Layla contribute some of the best comedy relief I\'ve seen in an anime thanks to their lack of common sense when it comes to understanding elements of Earth culture.

That being said if you get too bored with episode 1, jump to episode 7 and watch to the ending then go back if you want to pick up the loose ends.The music is IMO really good; shedding guitars, thumping bass, grooving drums, and keys straight from the 80's.The art style especially on the sci-fi scenes really fits, but the best visual on the show is the psychedelic moments hands down. The everyday scenes I find less noteworthy.Some of the characters really annoy me with just plain...stupidity probably added for humor or something.Overall had it not been for the extremely sluggish start it would have been quite good. stupidity probably added for humor or something.Overall had it not been for the extremely sluggish start it would have been quite good."", 'Kachou Ouji (Legend of Black Heaven) is a 13 episode TV anime original produced by studio AIC and A.P.P.P. It was directed by Yasuhito Kikuchi (Macross Frontier) and aired from Jul 8 1999 to Oct 7 1999.The story goes something like this. Ouji Tanaka is a middle-aged sallery worker, working a dead end job, and living in a tiny apartment together with his wife Yoshiko and their son Gen. Ouji is living his mundane everyday life with nothing exiting happening. The only thing to remind him of the exiting times of the past is his flying V electric guitar that he used to play when...he was in a metal band called Legend of Black Heaven. One day a woman called Layla Yuki starts working at the company Ouji works for. She is very interested in Ouji, and it turns out that she is an alien who has come to get him to play his guitar for them in, cause his music is the only thing that can activate their ultimate weapon to protect the earth from getting involved in a space war. Ouji happily agrees and gets to live out the glory days of his past and rekindle his love for music.There are a few characters that could be worth mentioning, but I\'m only gonna stick to the most important ones.First we have our main character Ouji Tanaka. He\'s the former guitarist of a metal band called Legend of Black Heaven, who had aspirations of making it big in the music world, but sadly it didn\'t work out for them. Now he\'s working a dead end job and living with his wife and son, and nothing exiting happens.Secondly we have Layla Yuki. She\'s an alien commander who come to earth to get Ouji, cause they need his music to activate their ultimate weapon which only activates from his music.Finally we have Ouji\'s wife, Yoshiko. She was once a groupy of Ouji\'s band, and they ended up getting married. Now her life together with Ouji is not going great. While Ouji is unhappy and stuck in the past, she wants to move on, and in order to make room for their new life and child she tries to throw away all of Ouji\'s music related things, and even ends up throwing away his flying V guitar.The animation in this show is not good. This show definitely does not excel in the visual aspects. It\'s not bad enough that the show is unwatchable because of it, but you\'re not gonna be blown away visually. Also the CG is as you would expect from a 90s anime.The music in his show on the other hand is very good. Being mostly made up of metal and hard rock this is right up my alley when it comes to music. Everything from the OP, all the way up until the ending was very good. However the ending really felt out of place. Almost like it didn\'t belong to the same show, and their choice to use the song they did for the ED was a strange decision. Another complaint I\'ve got about the music is that while I think it\'s good, I do wish they would have had more music to use. Because, even though I really liked the OP song Cautionary Warning, hearing it played on most of the episodes as an insert song as well got a bit boring. But if you like that song as much as I do, it won\'t really be that much of a problem.Overall I was surprised by this show. Hearing about it and reading the synopsis it sounded like just another stupid anime premise, and it definitely is, but this is the sort of stupid I can get behind. I enjoyed the show, and even though the writing at times got a little weird (shocking, I know) it for the most part felt like the show had a very good idea of what it wanted to be and do. At least up until the end where they started pulling some weird stuff because ""aliens"". The only other thing that got a bit annoying for me was the 3 retards of the show. They were to this show what Jar Jar Binks was to Star Wars, just a waste of a comedic relief character, and having 3 of them in this show isn\'t exactly a dream come true. But despite this I enjoyed the show, and I would definitely recommend this show if you just want a dumb show about a man fighting aliens with metal music. he was in a metal band called Legend of Black Heaven.

definitely one of those anime's where you can put two things that don't look like they would work, but somehow do well mostly.The story is about Oji Tanaka who is a former lead guitarist of a band and now lives a normal boring life with his wife and son until one day a mysterious woman named Layla asks him to use his guitar to fight an intergalactic battle.Now from seeing a story like that you know you're in for a wacky ride, but this was actually pretty serious as we see a former band leader who seems to look like...he has nothing worthwhile in his life until he has been asked to do what he does best again and seeing how his character shifts from being lifeless to being full of life shows that getting old doesn't really snuff the fire in you and it was really interesting seeing these guys who think they have lost their youthful spirit until they realise it's the only thing that can save the universe.It was also kinda interesting how the power of Groove could power a weapon which seems incredibly absurd, but since this is anime anything can happen really plus it was also fun seeing how our MC's new activity affected the current life he has and the people around him it made it seem like it was some weird superhero movie of sorts.Despite the story being unique it did sort of feel a bit meh in some areas like the fact that they tried to force in some kind of romance with Oji and Layla which just didn't make any sense since Oji is already married and has a kid so the fact this was kinda forced in there really hurt the story a bit.There isn't many characters in the show that make a big impact apart from a few, but those few definitely kept me going throughout the show.Oji is the male MC and he is the former band's lead guitarist, he is pretty much a man who is questioning where his life seems to have gone as he believes his life right now is dull until now and you see his character develop back into the youthful nature he has and he even starts taking note of his family more well sorta, he seemed like a cool guy and once he got going he definitely showed a determined and non-quitting side.Layla Yuki is the female MC and was instructed to keep an eye on Oji so that they can use him for the ultimate weapon, as a character she was actually pretty bland to me, she pretty much did what I was expecting of her and that was a forced love interest which seemed unnecessary since Oji was already married, the only interesting thing that happened to her was her opinion of Rock itself and seeing her mood change because of it was something at least.Yoshiko and Gen are Oji's wife and son who do play some kind of important role in the show, Yoshiko is pretty much the usual nagging wife you'd expect though honestly her nagging was understandable since she didn't know about the whole space war thing till the end so she had no idea what was going on especially since she was hearing rumour's that Oji was having an affair and Gen is very hyper just like a normal kid and thinks the whole space battle thing is just a real representation of his favourite TV show he does find out about the space battle stuff early on and decides to keep it a secret.Then there are Oji's other band members Sato, Yamada and Suzuki who are all in the same lifestyle as Oji, but are also looking for that lost spark and all these guys along with Oji prove that getting old is something that shouldn't stop you from doing what you love doing most.Finally there is also the 3 alien officers who help out Layla who are called Kotoko, Eriko and Rinko, these 3 were really funny and pretty much were the best female characters of the show as they were always mistaking things that people said for something else which always lead to bad situations where they got the wrong thing or were being a nuisance for the other characters.The artstyle looked alright as the characters especially the male characters had a decent amount of variation, the spaceships looked cool despite being CGI, but at least the CGI looked good compared to other anime's that I've seen use it.It was funny though seeing the Power Rangers being referenced in this show and recalled Power Saucers which just didn't seem to make any sense, but it was still a good reference.The music was actually very good compared to other musical anime's and even though the same track was used throughout the show much like what Fuuka did it actually expanded upon as more bad members were introduced which extended the musical pieces being played so it just got better and better to listen to each time.The comedy in this show was a hit and miss for me, it was funny whenever the 3 alien girls showed up as their antics always caused trouble for the characters and their lack of understanding certain things made for some funny entertainment I think the funniest thing they did was the routine they had Layla do which seemed so bizarre, but really funny.Overall this was a decent Rock & Roll space battle anime that could have been better in some aspects, but was pretty entertaining to watch so music or sci-fi lovers might find this enjoyable. he has nothing worthwhile in his life until he has been asked to

space battle anime that could have been better in some aspects, but was pretty entertaining to watch so music or sci-fi lovers might find this enjoyable."", ""Definitely not worth watching this one. Animation is not good. It's choppy and lacking details. Backgrounds are one gradient away from non-existent. It's as if someone realized they can't use black so they made some silly spotlight looking gradient. To make matters worse it's static and repeated about 55 times each episode. Impossibly lazy. Same goes for character animation, still bodies with only lips moving and reused shots.Characters themselves are annoying and not believable one bit. Wife which throws away everything husband likes, then goes on to worry if he's not liking her anymore while not missing a single opportunity to criticize him for everything,...him being the only provider while she stays at home and fails child education. And it keeps going like that. One unbelievable action after another. And main character's child is the absolute worst. He behaves as if education is not a thing and he's free to do whatever he wants and break anything without any repercussions. At times it feels he's there only to be a tool for writers to create drama when needed. Characters seriously made so upset I desired for ability to slap them.For some reason it's also rated as 18+, not sure why. There's nothing in there to warrant such rating apart maybe from few adult suggestive shots which were not really necessary at all and had no purpose.Only, and literally only, redeeming factor this show has is music and it's entirely too short. Few awesome riffs here and there make you want whole 20 minutes were just filled with music. Not worth watching at all. him being the only provider while she stays at home and fails child education.

You may think rock music and a space battle have nothing in common. Well, you are quite right, but it somehow works in this anime. A middle-aged ex-musician never lost his passion for rock music even though he has wife and a kid now. He decide to save an entire universe with his song. He is a very likeable character even though he is an average joe. I like how his relationship with his wife was presented. Music is nice, but there is just one or two songs which is devastating. Art isn't...much to look at and characters look off model most of the time. Also this isn't an anime I normally enjoy so I gave it a 6. It is a definition of a fine anime. Nothing great nor bad. much to look at and characters look off model most of the time. Also this isn't an anime I normally enjoy so I gave it a 6. It is a definition of a fine anime. Nothing great nor bad."", ""Kachou Ouji is a fun romp from 1999 with an engaging premise and fun execution, limited both by the resources available to it at the time and by shortcomings well within their control to fix. The idea of Ouji being a regular salaryman, thrust into the limelight of a galactic war to save the earth centering around his passion for music is pure gold, but at the end of the day the execution fails to live up to its premise. The story as a whole is fun and cool, but also nonsensical, and not in a way the bones of the show feel ready to...support. There are too many problems for the show to be taken seriously, but the show itself isn't stunningly cool or wacky enough to forgive those problems. Perhaps the biggest problem with this somewhat generic storyline with a twist is the fact that I had trouble suspending my disbelief while I watched it. It wasn't consistent enough to fix those problems, and it wasn't quite good enough to forget about those problems, so the whole time I was very aware I was watching an anime. As for the art, it is on-par for a late 90s anime, though the 2D often feels flat in the middle of the season, which shows in their faces and their inability to express emotion. They also reuse shots over and over again, and 100 percent of the 3D is atrocious, but again it was the 90s so while its unsightly, I can't in good faith fault the show for those things. The character design and background concepts were really well done, and the conceptual nature of these aspects were communicated with a great deal of skill. The sound is where this anime really shined. The musical compositions made for this anime really did rock, and though they repeated pieces fairly often, they mixed it up often enough to keep things fresh too. Beyond all the hard hitting music, the sounds of the world also held up really well, like the sound of a file against a nail, or the varying sounds of footsteps depending on the footwear of certain characters. Speaking of characters, I feel like that was a definite weak spot for this anime. Ouji and his whole schtick is funny and connects with the viewer well, but his motivations are oftentimes incomprehensible, and his reasoning often lacking. Same goes for his wife Yoshiko, who often seems to be flying off the handle of one extreme or the other for no reason at all. The rest of the characters were alright, and added a lot of depth to the show itself, especially the alien trio and Ouji's old bandmates, but except the alien major guy who was written like he was animated- with a stick up his ass. At the end of the day I had a fun time watching Kachou Ouji, but it didn't blow me away, which a show like this needs to do if it is going to work. Look at Gurren Lagann for a good example of something like that at play. Now the finale, THAT blew me away, but it ended abruptly and even itself didn't necessarily feel earned. It almost felt like this show was filler between episodes 1 and 13, thrown together to justify episodes 1 and 13. If the rest of the show showed the level of dedication and quality that episode 13 did, this show would probably rank closer to a 7, but alas, it did not.

Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34825/Keppeki_Danshi_Aoyama-kun,"['We were expecting a football animation. Instead, we received a comedy with some interesting and funny moments.Aoyama is a soccer star that suffers from a cleaning complex. He hates being touched. He needs to see everything clean. He needs to cook his food. How can a person like this be the center of the attention and one of the youth soccer stars from Japan?In the beginning, I was waiting to see a sports anime and football matches every time. After some episodes, the football became irrelevant. The story focus on the events full of jokes and actions from the football squad and all the...persons related to it. The jokes aren\'t bad, sometimes are silly but are executed smartly. However, there are few moments dull.The characters are standard as we can expect from this kind of comedy. Aoyama is another guy that is good in everything that he does and sometimes is annoying. Also, he needs to clean everything. His friends are the ones that carry all the responsibility of the comedy. Without them, Aoyama could sink in boredom. Let\'s thank the other characters for the jokes.  Ayoma has lots of admirers, including a person that loves him. The plot mixes everything, football, manga, a love triangle, fights, challenges and maybe some stupid actions. You will laugh at the situations. You will laugh after seeing some epic moments, but after some hours you will forget the fun and will focus on other things.This kind of animation is fun for the first time, but you aren\'t going to repeat it.The art and the music are standard. Do not expect too much from it. It was created to fill the time. At least the art isn\'t like the ending of the anime.The sound isn\'t a big thing.

THIS."", 'This anime made me feel conflicted in my feelings for it because I really enjoyed it yet had some serious gripes with it. It\'s hard to put everything into a good review because I\'m not a reviewer, this is just a regular viewer take on it, so I\'ll try to be as coherent as possible. This is just what I thought of it, but somehow it didn\'t affect my enjoyment so please take my gripes with a grain of salt.-Spoiler Alert-I\'ll start off by saying that Aoyama shines as a main character. He\'s funny, talented, and overall a somehow very strong character without being too...detailed. The rest of the football team (minus Gotou) shine best when they\'re only support characters highlighting Aoyama. Their individual episodes are mediocre at best, though some of the topics handled are unique to a lot of anime I\'ve seen, and overall they don\'t deserve a lot of main screen time. Heads up, I\'m going to talk about Gotou like a main character because she\'s arguably the most enjoyable of any character. Her love for Aoyama is genuine, her anger and signature weapon is entertaining, and her ability to bring life into this anime is there. I don\'t think I would\'ve liked this anime half as much without her. As well, the only time I really cared about Zaizen, who\'s portrayed as some sort of main character but is really only a side character, is during the last 10 minutes of the last episode. Maybe the issue with having a character like Aoyama is that most of the other teammates are useless in any sort of actual sports situation compared to him, and Zaizen is especially useless up until these last moments.This anime tries to push some sort of idea that Aoyama cares about his teammates deep down by eye contact alone and that never really holds up. It\'s joked about that he\'s there for the toilets and the white uniforms only, and it really made me think at the end that was all there is to it. There are really no moments when the anime makes you think they all care about each other as friends rather than just teammates, as most everyone is very selfish in the sense that they\'re using Aoyama as a way to get to nationals.Some of the more interesting characters come from people we only see once or twice, like Ozaki. Though it really seemed like they were scrambling for filler episodes despite only having a 12 episode air schedule, which seemed like too little of an amount of time to have to flesh out the characters they already started out with.I had a huge gripe with the character of Odagiri, not because of any sort of ""shipping"" issue but because she seemed to be thrown in as some sort of development plot point for Aoyama that really never came to have any lasting effect. The entire time I saw her, I wasn\'t positive if she was supposed to be a love interest or just solely some sort of outlet for Aoyama to practice contact. If she was going to have a lasting effect, it would\'ve made sense for them to introduce her earlier on in the anime so that we could see that change. In any case, they could\'ve spent that wasted character time fleshing out Zaizen as a good friend, or Gotou as a solid rock for Aoyama to lean on, as both always came off as genuine and trustworthy people more so than the rest of the football team.I can\'t say much for the art or sound, as I don\'t know what would be good or bad, I really don\'t have talent on that end. If it was atrocious, I\'m sure it would\'ve been obvious to me so I guess it wasn\'t bad.Overall, if this somehow gets a Season 2, they really have a lot of work to do, as they didn\'t lay a very solid foundation in the first season.I still enjoyed it though? Somehow I was still laughing at the jokes and watching along. It\'s a dumb fun kind of anime, you have to be willing to enjoy it for what it is, which is a whole lot of comedic nothingness. detailed.

BUT, the comedy is the main part of this anime. So the soccer part indeed comes pretty short. Nevertheless, I REALLY enjoyed this anime.The comedy is very good, reminds me a bit of Saiki, which is in my eyes a masterpiece of comedy.The animations are stunning, something you have never seen in a soccer anime.The characters all have their own funny style, but they dont get much development, because this is more like an episodic anime like Saiki.Personally, I think that...they should have focused more on the soccer part. It would have been huge to see a hyped up soccer game in such great animations.To keep this review short and to not give too much away, I will end it here.If you want to watch a funny episodic soccer/school Anime with great animations, you should DEFINETLY give this anime a chance. If you just want to watch great sport tournament arcs and character improvements, then this anime  probably does not suit you. they should have focused more on the soccer part.

A clean freak playing soccer. Normally soccer leans more toward the dirty side and I really wanted to see how they pull this off, and trust me they did it really  well.This anime is so absurd yet so funny,  and what makes this anime so good are its ART, Characters and Story.Lets begin with Art, this anime...is one of those, which switches to chibi every now and then and I have no complaints here. The motions are also fluid and in some part the character are like teleporting (not fluid) and its works out well. And remember the iconic doodle-ish eyes of Saitama, you will see something similar to that here ever so often.Moving on to the characters, when I say characters I ACTUALLY MEAN CHARACTERS, NOT SOME LIFE LESS GENERIC SHITS, most of the characters (not all) have few traits and makes unique and funny and even the generic one are funny and seem to blend well.Story, this anime is not that story heavy. Its more focused on making you laugh (or thats what I think it is) and the sports part is also there just for the sake of making this show funny(also what i think). 4 episodes in i really dont see a serious story, nor do I think it will in later episodes.  For me I watch it for enjoyment not story.So this anime is funny, has varieties of characters and is funny, and has great art style which fits the theme and makes it funny(ier), I know i said funny 3 times coz ITS LEGITIMATELY FUNNY!!!

My experience with sport shows is I had two categories: the competitive and serious one such as Haikyuu and then the non competitive (or just not focused on the competitions) comedic one such as Yuri!!! on Ice. Yes, Yuri!!! on Ice does have the main character enter a competition but the anime doesn\'t really focus on the competition. It focuses on the characters. Back to Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun, it doesn\'t fit in those two types I\'m familiar with. This show was weird because it focus on comedy half of the time.Being a comedic show with sort of plot...progression with end game objective, the story becomes fragmented with the episodes dedicated to 2 character spotlights. The show doesn\'t just focus on Aoyama and his sport team. We do the coach, manager, a mangaka, a basketball girl (yes, we had an episode on basketball instead of soccer), and a fellow germaphobe student. Since comedy is binary, you will have some episodes which give you laughter or not. I had my favorite characters, the manager/stalker who loves Aoyama and the judo guy.Since I\'m not good with names and didn\'t bother with checking it for the review, the characters in this show might be hard to remember for those who aren\'t good with names like me. You will remember their quirks.That\'s pretty much the strength of the show\'s comedy: the wacky characters and their interactions. For sports, the show does up its animation during its few intense soccer matches. It doesn\'t feature as much if you wanted soccer.The weakness of the show for me is it ends with a weak bang. It doesn\'t really entice me for a second season. It was like a one trick pony ice cream that you just wanted to taste first time and won\'t go back. It\'s a shame because I loved the show when I saw the first few episodes.6/10 for me in rating this show. I wish it went out with a bang or have some plot objective but being a comedic show, it might have killed its sport element. With a cast huge, you can barely remember all of them.

Also, despite lacking any development between characters, there were filler episodes and they were just dull.TL;DR: Don't watch if you're looking for something amazing (the plot is...weak), but do so if you're looking for v cute boys that are kinda funny ^^ weak), but do so if you're looking for v cute boys that are kinda funny ^^"", ""This is just a short and sweet review because I enjoy this anime a lot!Okay for starters, when the show first started airing, I was a little confused because I was expecting some epic sports anime like Haikyuu!! or Kuroko (i have never read the manga for aoyama, don't judge me), but boy was I wrong.To sum things up, this is a light and comedic anime that has little sports actually involved. So if you came here to watch something specifically about soccer, try to find something else because that is definitely not what you will get.This anime mainly revolves around Aoyama and...his cleaning habits. All the girls love him and want him, but he is totally dense and seems to never care what they think. People either love him or they hate him but then end up joining the loving side. It's pretty great, to be honest.I have a good laugh every episode, and what's great is that every episode is a new story that centers around the one main topic: Aoyama.It's one of those animes that you watch to have fun and laugh at, not to be taken seriously.

Putting that aside, if you\'re looking for a short-running show with some comedic moments, you may find enjoyment in Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun.Aoyama\'s perfect character is very boring to me, he doesn\'t have any conflict or any sort of progression in the twelve episode season. He doesn\'t have any motive to join Fujimi High School\'s underdog soccer team besides that the jerseys are white. Aoyama has a legion of followers, both male and female, that see him as an idol. Their ""Clean, clean Aoyama!"" chants get annoying very quick. Aoyama\'s only interesting character...trait is that he\'s a germaphobe. He won\'t eat food prepared by other people, he rarely allows people to touch him. One of Aoyama\'s underdeveloped traits is that he\'s a gamer, and he acts very differently in-game while in-person.Most of the side characters are dull and they are only used for comic relief. Most of the jokes that are from the side characters are used time and time again. There\'s just not enough time to develop the side characters to be multi-dimensional. Most of the other people on the soccer team are given one trait, or just there. Bottom line, they\'re mostly forgettable. I\'ll give the show some slack because there are only twelve episodes. Only occasionally are the side characters successful in their comedic attempts, and I find it most often with Gotou\'s interactions with the other characters. The times when Aoyama interacts with the other germaphobe makes for some interesting dialogue.The times when Fujimi High is playing soccer is very predictable, and with Aoyama only actually trying in the final five minutes, the result can always be known. The most interesting episodes in this show are the times when Aoyama & crew are put into a unique situation outside of school, or when the side characters get the spotlight.Unfortunately, some of the most interesting characters are the ones only seen in one or two episodes. The Ozaki-centered episode is by far the most interesting, with his attempts to make an interesting manga based on Aoyama\'s actions in school. Umeya\'s episode with Gouto is also one of the better ones.The OST is nothing special, its generic j-rock that you can find in most animes. The animation is clean and fluid. The animation style used while Aoyama is gaming is a nice change of pace. The outro animation also has a unique style. Passable.All in all, Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun seems rushed, poorly planned, and executed inadequately. Aoyama\'s singular trait is boring, and most of the gaffs of the side characters are overused. The show\'s strongest strength is when they do succeed at comedy, and it\'s seldom used side characters. There are better shows for you to watch. trait is that he\'s a germaphobe.

It's more biased toward slice of life than sports in general. If anything, I would say that it's slice of life involving soccer rather than soccer with small slice-of-life moments.But if...you're looking for simply another sport anime, funny (wtf) moments, fan-service, (one-sided romance), dude team-bonding, (gay-shippings), and OP character, look no further because this anime gives you all that.This anime, for me, was a pretty decent one, but would have been better if they'd made it longer (wouldn't it be better if they made all anime longer?!!).

The only difference is that Aoyama is a germophobe, an interesting and comedic trope that gets kinda stale by the end of the anime. However each episode isn't always centred around Aoyama which leaves open space for both people living around Aoyama and himself to grow. Unlike Sakamoto, Aoyama isn't too mysterious, his intentions aren't confusing and...his past isn't shrouded in mystery, the only mystery is his family.

If you're expecting a sports anime, it's probably time for you to leave, because this is definitely not what you're looking for. This was a mess-- a good mess-- but a mess nonetheless. I'm gonna unravel what happened in this series for the people who are on the fence about watching this.First off, I started watching this show because I saw a clip of a cute scene from around episode 8-ish on youtube, and expected the whole show to be somewhat similar. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, but it wasn't all bad either.To begin with, the plot is a strange,...strange thing. I have never played or been interested in watching soccer, so I expected to be bored. However, there is strangely little actual soccer content. While it does have some aspects of a sports anime, I think it's very little and a little inaccurate. Overall, it does a better job as an episodic comedy with a few running gags. It wasn't exactly my style of humor, but I enjoyed it somewhat still. In addition to a comedy, it's almost partially Food Wars and has a few Ouran High School Host Club-style jokes tied in. Overall, it's not a bad plot, but it's not really overarching and doesn't make a lot of sense a lot of the time.Hands down, this is some of the most beautifully simple animation I've seen in a while. I watched this after watching a lot of shoujos and old anime, so maybe it impacted me more than I thought, but every character is honestly so beautiful. The backgrounds are done with great precision and everything seems pretty realistic, in all honesty, despite being anime. In addition, some of the water/sports graphics in general were honestly so well done that I rewound to watch it again. It was also one of the main reasons I wanted to watch the show in the first place.The soundtracks were honestly nothing special. All of them were pretty forgettable except the closing, which was supposed to be somewhat of a parody.Despite the series being named after him, Aoyama himself is not very interesting other than his being mysterious. He is pretty much perfect in everything. The only time we see any character in him is through his video game avatar where is isn't limited by his crippling fear of germs. Other than that, he hardly shows any real human feelings. On the other hand, some of the other characters were honestly pretty fun and unique, but none enough so that they stand out from the crowd of millions of other anime characters. Overall, pretty humdrum as far as that goes.This anime isn't bad. I'll say that upright. At the same time, in my standards, it wasn't all that good either. It was honestly pretty lukewarm. I enjoyed it enough to get through it, but I probably will never watch it again.I would recommend this if you: like perfect main characters, like sports anime bc of the hot guys, like running gagsI would NOT recommend this if you: are here bc you like soccer/serious sports anime, are expecting this to be about Aoyama's crippling germophobia (I mean it is, but not really dealing with the issue or getting him any help, is what I mean), like a lot of plot or character developmentHave a great day everyone! strange thing.

Instead you see how the daily lives of the cast of characters surrounding Aoyama-kun are sometimes affected simply by him just existing.There isn't really a progressing story here, its more of an episodic series which can be a negative to some.

I don't know if it's like other sports anime, but it plays out like a character driven slice of life show.The story doesn't really matter as nothing much comes about in this show. The only information you need is the main character is named Aoyama and he is a germaphobe. The start of the show introduces him and the small cast of side characters and seems to be a comedy show revolving around the struggles of a boy not able to deal with germs. However after the first...few episodes it switches pace.After we are introduced and are comfortable with Aoyama, they decide to give most of the prominent side characters their own episode in which they resolve some problems with the help of Aoyama. The side stories where pretty lame, and it was kind of jarring to go from the Aoyama being the main character to a side character or not even in some episodes.The art was great. Everything was smooth and pretty, and the way that they gave some characters their own style was cute. Gotou's chibi character was adorable.The characters as mentioned before were the driving force of the show. Aoyama was a fun character as a staunch germaphobe he cleans everything, wont eat food others prepare, doesn't want to be touched..etc. It was fun watching him deal with the struggles of playing soccer with that condition.Everyone else has their own shtick but it really doesn't feel like it matters. They give some characters their own issues and episodes but nobody sticks out from the crowd, and even when they do they never become part of the show. Like what happened to abs guy, or any of the girls, or the other clean freak...etc. They introduce characters, then drop them. It's so bad that towards the end of the show a character changes their hairstyle and it took me most of the episode to realize he wasn't a new character.Overall I enjoyed the show. The writers wanted a comedy show and they stuck with that. There were points where you think the show might go another direction, but nope. Aoyama was a great character, and his personality isn't seen very often. Even though they shelve Aoyama several times, they bring it back around and allows you to take in the other characters. The only thing I can complain about is how bland the characters turned out to be. I mean the characters themselves have traits that allow them to stick out. How can you not remember a guy that always busts out his abs and flexes them, or a yandere-esque girls with a flower sticker bat with nails in it. However that's what makes it so sad, they are all pointless.TLDR: It's alright. Characters are a bit lame, but Aoyama is fun and pulls it all together. It's a tossup not sure if its worth recommending. few episodes it switches pace.After we are introduced and are comfortable with Aoyama, they decide to give most of the prominent side characters their own episode in which they resolve some problems with the help of Aoyama. The side stories where pretty lame, and it was kind of jarring to go from the Aoyama being the main character to a side character or not even in some episodes.The art was great. Everything was smooth and pretty, and the way that they gave some characters their own style was cute. Gotou's chibi character was adorable.The characters as mentioned before were the driving force of the show. Aoyama was a fun character as a staunch germaphobe he cleans everything, wont eat food others prepare, doesn't want to be touched..etc. It was fun watching him deal with the struggles of playing soccer with that condition.Everyone else has their own shtick but it really doesn't feel like it matters. They give some characters their own issues and episodes but nobody sticks out from the crowd, and even when they do they never become part of the show. Like what happened to abs guy, or any of the girls, or the other clean freak...etc. They introduce characters, then drop them. It's so bad that towards the end of the show a character changes their hairstyle and it took me most of the episode to realize he wasn't a new character.Overall I enjoyed the show. The writers wanted a comedy show and they stuck with that. There were points where you think the show might go another direction, but nope. Aoyama was a great character, and his personality isn't seen very often. Even though they shelve Aoyama several times, they bring it back around and allows you to take in the other characters. The only thing I can complain about is how bland the characters turned out to be. I mean the characters themselves have traits that allow them to stick out. How can you not remember a guy that always busts out his abs and flexes them, or a yandere-esque girls with a flower sticker bat with nails in it.

As i said i was looking for something to watch this just popped up thought there would be romance, some story but nope all i got was a mildly...funny sports anime with almost no story.Story: the only question i have here is that is there even a story to be told? Or just a guy going about his life? You might be arguing that oh what about dragon ball? What story does it have? None its basically just fighting to entertain the people. This “story” is not a journey nor an actual story, it doesn’t tell anything and when it does it actually has potential to do so, but all of that wasted potential on long boring episodes, in each episode i’d say is pretty much the same thing no devolopment its just comedy with sports nothing else, unlike some other popular animes like naruto, tokyo ghoul, fairy tail, you might say well they just go around and find something to do so isnt that the same? In this case anime like these have adventure a sense of journey something always new, then we turn to this anime, same thing, no character devlopment, nothing really.Art: The art i’d say deserves an okay rating as it’s quire dececentSound: Uh sorry can’t really rate this, i’m not a sound expert so i’d just say its okayCharacters: the characters were quite enjoyable with some being actually unique in a way unlike some generic character let’s say.Enjoyment: me saying that i hate this anime is a wrong term for this nor me saying that i like this anime is also wrong, i enjoyed some of the episodes most of them were just bland and boring,Overall: I mean the anime is okay, it’s just not for me, but if your a persom who has a sense of humour i’m sure you’ll enjoy this anime, funny sports anime with almost no story.Story: the only question i have here is that is there even a story to be told?

Aoyama-kun is more like a school comedy that uses the soccer club as a setting than a series that\'s ""about"" soccer.  That\'s a good thing though, as the series is very funny and has a number of great characters.  It\'s held back by the disjointed structure of its plot (to the extent that there is one) but the characters are the main attraction here, not the story.  If you\'re wondering whether the series can sustain the high concept gimmick at the center of the show...for 12 episodes without getting boring, the answer is yes, mostly by making the MC the least interesting part of the show and giving all the personality to the supporting characters.Positives:+ It\'s funny. Lots of good jokes and gags.  Moka and her spiked bat covered in flowers and kittens is the best ongoing gag in the series.+ Good characters.  Aoyama, the title character of the series, has little personality and often disappears for long stretches and I didn\'t even really mind, because all the other characters are so good.  It\'s hard to praise specific characters without going down the whole list.  I don\'t want to write that much and you don\'t want to read that much, so I\'d just say that basically all of them are fun and entertaining in their own ways.+ Easy to watch.  The episodes go by fast and you never get bored.  It\'s a simple and undemanding show that can entertain with very little effort required on the part of the viewer.  I promise I don\'t mean this as a backhanded compliment, it\'s a good thing sometimes.Negatives:- Too disjointed.  It can be explained to an extent by the fact that this is a slice of life show and never pretends otherwise, but it\'s almost maddening how many interesting storylines and characters get introduced and then vanish from the face of the earth, never to even be referenced again for the remainder of the series.  There needed to be more follow-through on these stories and the series shouldn\'t have introduced characters that would be in for one episode before never appearing again, such as the manga writer or the rival soccer player and his girlfriend.- Weak romance subplot.  Part of the broader problem with not following through on stories, but introducing a love polygon between Aoyama, Moka, Mio and Tsubasa only to drop it 2 episodes later like it never even happened was poor writing.

Aoyama-kun don\'t really have super serious overarching story. After all, it\'s a comedy. Maybe. This show seems a bit confused. There\'s just enough focus on football that it fails to maintain either identity. I just got off of watching Bamboo Blade, so it\'s definitely possible to balance slice of life, comedy, and sports in one show.Perhaps it\'s just that Keppeki...Danshi\'s comedic style doesn\'t really mesh well with me. The show feels very similar in style to something like Sakamoto desu ga, where it\'s a one man show. The MC\'s bizzare actions fuel the entire show\'s comedy, and it\'s always the people reacting to said MC. I guess it just kind of gets stale really fast. For me, this show didn\'t even get stale, it was just unfunny to begin with. Random is not funny, and that\'s the vibe I get from watching the comedy scenes. There\'s not a lot of variety if everyone else is very grounded in common sense, and then you have to create a bunch of scenarios and gags where Aoyama is still in character, the one special main character that acts as a boke for everyone else to tsukkomi on.

Kuutei Dragons,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39531/Kuutei_Dragons,"['Kuutei Dragons had all the components necessary for a really interesting show but ultimately failed to put them together in a satisfying way. Airships straight out of Laputa, amazingly beautiful dragons, world travel and adventure...what could go wrong? Well, a few things.First off, the sole motivating force of the show is just ""we hunt dragons for money and because they taste good."" We never get much more than that, and it\'s just not enough to drive twelve episodes unless you really, really like watching dragon hunting (and eating). Almost every one of those scenes, and there are a lot of them, play out identically: people...fire guns at dragons, dragons get hit, one particularly reckless character (Mika) jumps on the dragon to kill it, and then we see Mika drool over whatever dragon meat dishes the cook prepares.This is a shame because there are so many suggestions of what might have been. There are hints that some characters, especially the outwardly cool beauty Vanabelle, have complex prior histories that they\'re trying to escape by signing up to become drakers on the Queen Zaza. Takita, the newest crew member and the main character of the show, is given slightly more character development but we still never know why the hell she joined up for what is described, by all present, as a thankless, low-paying, and low-status job. And then there\'s the resident glutton, Mika, who lives only to eat every species of dragon possible and take insane risks in pursuit of that goal.  You\'d think that, as much screen time as he gets, Mika might become more complex. You would be wrong. The other characters just fall flat, even when they\'re given chances to shine.Similarly, the world building is actually really great, but it rarely gets the attention it deserves. The episodes spent with a focus on towns or cities shone as great examples of how to create a complex backstory about an economy and culture that\'s in some ways dependent on dragon hunting yet suspicious and possibly a bit fearful of those who do the actual dirty work. There are also great moments that expand on the insular world of the drakers, who have a history and hierarchy all their own. I really wanted more of this, as it provided a richness that the vast majority of the other episodes just lacked.Secondly, the CGI animation is frequently very distracting, especially when it comes to characters\' facial expressions. I\'ll fully admit that, compared to a lot of CGI shows I\'ve seen, Kuutei Dragons was far better than most, but the faces were frequently awful and drained a lot of emotional impact from otherwise intense scenes.And finally, I just wasn\'t sure what this show wanted to do. It clearly didn\'t want to problematize the idea of dragon hunting in a moral way. It also wasn\'t sure if it was a slice of life story that just happened to be about dragon hunting, or if it was mainly an action story that put hunting first and foremost above everything else. Because what we got was a lot of slow, slice of life material without any character development, and hunting scenes that ended up being too formulaic and repetitive to drive an action-oriented series.Without having read the manga, I can only hope that, if Kuutei Dragons gets a second season, we delve more deeply into the characters and the world they live in. The show has potential, but after twelve full episodes they didn\'t convince me that anyone knows what to do with it. (Also, could they please build a railing around the entire ship\'s deck? That\'s been annoying me to no end, and it\'s ridiculous). fire guns at dragons, dragons get hit, one particularly reckless character (Mika) jumps on the dragon to kill it, and then we see Mika drool over whatever dragon meat dishes the cook prepares.This is a shame because there are so many suggestions of what might have been.

The episodes spent with a focus on towns or cities shone as great examples of how to create a complex backstory about an economy and culture that\'s in some ways dependent on dragon hunting yet suspicious and possibly a bit fearful of those who do the actual dirty work. There are also great moments that expand on the insular world of the drakers, who have a history and hierarchy all their own. I really wanted more of this, as it provided a richness that the vast majority of the other episodes just lacked.Secondly, the CGI animation is frequently very distracting, especially when it comes to characters\' facial expressions. I\'ll fully admit that, compared to a lot of CGI shows I\'ve seen, Kuutei Dragons was far better than most, but the faces were frequently awful and drained a lot of emotional impact from otherwise intense scenes.And finally, I just wasn\'t sure what this show wanted to do. It clearly didn\'t want to problematize the idea of dragon hunting in a moral way. It also wasn\'t sure if it was a slice of life story that just happened to be about dragon hunting, or if it was mainly an action story that put hunting first and foremost above everything else. Because what we got was a lot of slow, slice of life material without any character development, and hunting scenes that ended up being too formulaic and repetitive to drive an action-oriented series.Without having read the manga, I can only hope that, if Kuutei Dragons gets a second season, we delve more deeply into the characters and the world they live in. The show has potential, but after twelve full episodes they didn\'t convince me that anyone knows what to do with it. (Also, could they please build a railing around the entire ship\'s deck? That\'s been annoying me to no end, and it\'s ridiculous).', 'Basically whaling.... Yep, it\'s a show about killing flying whales that don\'t appear to be harming anyone ""Dragons"", harvesting, eating them and selling them for profit.  Okay there is more to it than that but it\'s kinda hard to get past that if I\'m honest, they\'re not heroes, they\'re ""whalers"" killing harmless creatures for profit.Whats next, animal traffickers for wet markets?If you can get past it the series does get a a little better, the show has it\'s moments I guess but most of the characters are unlikable from the start for me.I know whaling is a thing in Japan but to...put out a series out that resembles this act in any way is distasteful and will be divisive. I\'m surprised Netflix would want this show, they must be desperate for content. put out a series out that resembles this act in any way is distasteful and will be divisive. I\'m surprised Netflix would want this show, they must be desperate for content.', 'This is the first time I write a review. A few days ago, this show has a 6.X rate here (now 7.X) and I am very curious as I have watched ep1 when it aired all 12eps. I don\'t think it will be that low so I go to watch more. I eventually finished up the whole show, which doesn\'t always happens.After finished this show, I think people may have two main problems to be disappointed.First: this is a CGI show, it cannot give us detailed facial expressions with this quality, and the expressions are rather rough especially in close cut for their eyes. And...of coz it is in 12 like the other JP 2D/3D animes. (I didn\'t do any research on this but I believe it is due to the file size or format limitation of airing on TV, or even just the conventions, even Beastar is in 12)Second: they are killing dragons which reminds people of whaling. They also aviod to address the problem that killing dragons is not a health way to the make human society works. They treat this as a food show with yummy dragon dishes almost every ep, it may make you feel uneasy about all this.Okay, so what do I think?Story: 8As I mentioned above, ""whaling"" is a serious problem for this show, but I do think they are not showing this just to disgust you, they show all the yummy dragon dishes just make me think what human are actually eating, because I don\'t know how dragon meat tastes like, this is just we human messing with the Earth itself, just using dragons as a way to get us the audiences to have a weird feeling, so not a big problem in my opinion.The setting of this world is unbelievably detailed, the whole system of hunters, use of dragon\'s meat, oil and organs, and also how they fly etc is amazing and real. The different kinds of dragons are also well written and intriguing.However, I think they can tell us more about the world, the character and the history of the world, I am pretty surprise they managed to make me finish the whole show without telling me enough of these.Art: 6This is a CGI show, and it is not gonna be the best for me as a 2D art lover. The 3D feeling works quite well for the dragons and some scenes but when it comes to character development it always lower the impact, especially when we need great facial expressions.(I must admit the quality is good, so if you don\'t have a thing for 2D art you won\'t have problem with this show)Sound: 9OP: amazingly fitting the feeling of the showED: normal for meOST: stellar level, in ep1 the beginning I am in love with it, the isekai fantasy and adventure feeling is almost perfectCharacter: 8Mika, Takita, Vanabelle are very likeable. I don\'t need to tell you the details, you just need to know there are a bunch of characters as they work on a ship, but you can easily find everyone unique and they work tgt around the main characters effectively. (Some side characters like Ula and Nanami are also likeable)But, you will be going through this show without knowing the background story of the main character, I must say this is a weird thing as I don\'t feel off about it when I am watching.Enjoyment: 8I enjoy the story, the world, the setting and the music, I don\'t really enjoy is the yummy dragon dishes they are showing but it is not a dislike from me, just don\'t really enjoy. Also, I find that they don\'t have railing on the airship is kind of odd, but they don\'t really explain anything and the enjoyment comes from auidence\'s own understanding of the show, weird enough.Overall: 8Well, I must say I will probably hold the ep1 watched status forever if I don\'t see the 6.X rate here. It is hard to tell you to watch it til the end, but you can certainly give this a shot and even if you don\'t feel like watching the whole show, you may want to pick it up suddenly like me.This is not going to be a show for everyone but I hope you will not be brothered by the two main problems I mentioned above too much if you are watching it.LIEat of coz it is in 12 like the other JP 2D/3D animes.

All the characters are likeable, yet their actions are cringy. It\'s like watching an episode where you get to see the antagonist\'s side or viewpoint on things even though I\'m sure that\'s not what the creators were going for. They hunt almost extinct creatures that aren\'t harming anyone for money/food and the show makes it seem like it\'s a cool job. They also do a \'Shokugeki no Soma\' (Food Wars) thing with yummy dragon dishes. My version of an english dub for every episode would be: ""What...a beautiful dragon, ... let\'s kill it!"" or ""Should we hunt these almost extinct dragons? Oh wait, there\'s one now! Kill it!"" or ""Why is the mother of the dragon we slaughtered earlier so angry at us? Kill it too!"" I\'m going to keep watching to see where the show goes, kind of like a curious passerby of a horrific accident. Fingers crossed that the story improves. -UPDATE-Sooooo... I finished all 12 episodes and actually enjoyed the parts without the monotonous ""whaling"" alot. There were emotionally touching and endearing scenes that made you care about the characters and their stories.

Since I don\'t read manga, I do best my to judge an anime on its own merits rather than its faithfulness to the source material. So, with this mind, is Drifting Dragons worth watching? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe series follows the airship Quin Zaza as it flies across the world, chasing dragons in order to harvest their bodies for profit. The main characters are dragon hunters, or ""drakers"", as the series calls them, and we follow their adventures as...they encounter and hunt new kinds of dragons each episode. For the most part, the show focuses on the drakers\' daily lives and the complications and intricacies of their jobs, such as finding and killing dragons, fixing their damaged airship, stopping and refueling and so on.The narrative progression of this show is painfully slow and the show waits till its second half to give the story some meaningful conflict. Aside from dragon hunts and a pirate attack, the show doesn\'t really do much to keep viewers invested in the story. The premise is good but it takes its sweet time to develop and viewers will find their patience tested, but I can assure you, the payoff is satisfying. Once the show reaches its second half, things become a bit more dramatic for our heroes. There\'s a much better balance between action, comedy and drama and a true sense of conflict pervading the series\' later episodes. Like I said, the show does get better but you must be really patient with it. That said, if a show takes this long to become this good, then viewers won\'t probably stay long enough to see it. (6/10)CharactersMy ability to enjoy a TV show is closely tied to my ability to sympathize and relate to the characters. For the most part, the main cast doesn\'t evolve that much. They\'re friends, they hunt dragons, they keep the ship clean and that\'s it. There\'s not much to know about them. The so-called main character, Mika, isn\'t much as a character as he is a plot device with dialogue. He only exists to kill dragons and eat meat. There\'s not much depth to him. Sure, he is good at his job and does care for his friends, but for the most part, that doesn\'t amount to anything. His partner Vanabelle is a bit better. We learn that she joined a draking crew because she feel that she couldn\'t belong on land, but her character development just stops there and from then on, she doesn\'t become important again.There are two characters that actually evolve and change over the course of the story. First, there is Takita, the female protagonist. In the beginning, she\'s little more than green rookie and a voice for the audience, asking the questions viewers would ask if they found themselves in her position. As the show moves forward, she gradually but steadily learns about dragons and draking and eventually finds her resolve to become a draker.The other character with a genuine character arc, and in my opinion the best character in the show, is Giraud. He\'s a young man who takes his job seriously and wants to impress his friends and colleagues with his dedication. Even when he finds himself out of his depth, he still wants to do right by the people he cares about. He is the only character in the series with something to prove and something to work for and I really enjoyed his evolution throughout the series. (7/10)ArtI guess this is one aspect pretty much everyone will agree the series nailed. The visuals were nothing short of spectacular. While the human designs are okay, the dragons were easily the show\'s best visual highlight and it\'s clear the designers had fun with the dragons. Another standout are the hunting scenes. The choreography was amazing and the movements didn\'t look stiff or forced. I admit I\'ve seen better CGI in other shows, but Polygon Pictures did a good job at animating the main sequences without having to worry about excessive details. (8/10)SoundThe voice work on Drifting Dragons was amazing. Some of my favorite voice actors, like Sora Amamiya, Souma Saito and Kana Hanazawa, participated in the main cast and it was a treat listening to their talents here. Tomoaki Maeno did a good job as Mika even though he wasn\'t really given much to work with. We also got great supporting work from VAs like Ayane Sakura, Maaya Sakamoto, Junichi Suwabe and Takahiro Sakurai.The soundtrack was fittingly epic. I really enjoyed the opener and the closer; both pieces really captured the mood of the series. If nothing else, you will enjoy Drifting Dragons for its technical aspects. (9/10)OverallIn closing here, Drifting Dragons is a good show. No, it\'s not a masterpiece and it definitely takes its sweet time developing its story and characters, but if you\'re really patient with it, you have fun with it. Despite a few rough spots here and there, mostly with the story and the characters, the show ends on its strongest note, so those unimpressed by earlier parts but committed to finishing will have something to look forward to.

I don\'t understand why the overall rating for this thing is 7+.You will see slayers of ""dragons"" raving about killing them and eating their meat. Except that the report is quickly made, it\'s neither more nor less than a kind of propaganda that tries to make the image of whale hunters prettier.They say it themselves: as long as there is some we will never stop. WTFFF?I know that in Japan, whale hunting is traditional. But we are in the 21st century, it\'s time to evolve and understand that our footprint...on earth is disastrous ....

I wasn\'t sure how I\'d feel about it, at first, because of the animation style. They chose the same animation style as is used on shows like RWBY, which is a show that took a while for me to get into, specifically because of the animation style. Other actual anime that have been done this way, are not ones I\'ve been able to stick with.However, Kuutei Dragons only took a couple of episodes to suck me in, and align me with a character I could identify with, which...is something that is necessary for me. I can\'t really find it in myself to stick with any form of fiction, where I don\'t have at least one character I identify strongly with.

I can't help but draw parallels to Japan's whaling practices. This anime seems to justify and even glorify it and instead of using whales they use something that resembles a dragon but are giant slugs, also the two dimensional characters taken from the lowest rung of jrpgs that only you care when you see a little of the slice of life but the rest is awful, selfish and plain characters. Specially Mika that becomes my most hated anime character ever. An anime that works as blatant propaganda for the Japanese whaling industry; nothing more.But yes, there are a few on good...things like some of the backgrounds and some episodes but overall this is only good if you like Food Wars or another anime about cooking. I wouldn’t  recommend it but if you want to see it you will find -maybe- some good things. things like some of the backgrounds and some episodes but overall this is only good if you like Food Wars or another anime about cooking.

I thought it would be as interesting and engaging as Kouya no Kotobuki Hikoutai as it had similar elements, but it was nowhere near as good.This series is mostly about eating, preparing and butchering dragons with occasional hunting and drama, aka, everyday life of a dragon hunting crew.Takita and Jirou's arcs were okay but the overall experience is still lacking, especially when you're binging it on Netflix. They overused one tune and looking at the CG over and over is not fascinating at all.Overall, it's okay if you have nothing else to watch. "", ""This is just a piece of propaganda trying to justify why whaling is fine and them trying to show you the struggles of being a whaler. They try to justify it by saying it tastes delicious, and they use every piece of it for their needs such as the organs for medicine, and the fat for fuel.They try to show you the struggles of being a whaler like not being welcome anywhere, and being one of a few ships left who do it.They even admit in the first episode that the dragons seldom hurt humans.If you can look past the obvious allegory then maybe it's...worth a watch. I cannot, so I'm dropping this. worth a watch. I cannot, so I'm dropping this."", 'This was a really weird show.  I tend to just jump into shows with little to no knowledge of what their content is, and that was the case with this one.At first I was like, oh cool, they are kinda steam punky air ballooning around hunting dragons.  Well, that feeling lasted through the first episode.  Then it quickly became ""why am I watching this?""  After the first dragon hunt, you basically need no more action in the show for a few reasons:1.  It\'s repetitive2.  There is no clear reason for why the audience should care if they...kill another dragon.3.  No particularly interesting choreography.So if not for action, why watch the show?  What else do we have to look forward to?  Let me quickly dive into these possible elements that pop into my head.Story (plot):  To put it bluntly, it\'s non-existent.  What we have is 13 ish guys and 4 girls on an airship essentially doing the fantasy equivalent of whaling.  And that\'s it.  They have no interesting goals, there is no looming threat.  They literally just are a group of whalers trying to kill these seemingly docile creatures for food and money.  Not to mention none of the dragons look like dragons.  They are random combinations of sea creature and reptilian features.Characters:  This, in my opinion, is the best part of the show.  There are several interesting characters that you want to see interact and develop.  The show is *kind of* an ensemble, but there are two standout characters that get most of the screen time and those are Mika and Takita.  Unfortunately these two are pretty low on the list as far as interesting.  Mika is just annoying, boring, and wants to kill dragons as much as possible because he\'s hungry.  He\'s the strongest character (of the males at least) so he gets pretty much all the action scenes.  But so what.  Takita is way more interesting than Mika, but I still rank her only near the middle as far as characters I want to see more of go.  She is good for gags and jokes though since she is the new girl on the ship.  But the other characters are pretty interesting, and that really becomes the only reason to watch the show once you realize there is no plot and the action is pointless.World Building:  Not bad.  It\'s a pretty interesting and well developed world for such a short series.   But it would be far better if there was a threat or any sort of conflict at all.  It\'s really hard to care about this peaceful utopian world thriving on the dragon trade.Comedy:  Nothing too memorable, but I know there were some moments in the first half of the show that made me smile.Drama:  Nothing.Intellectual stimulation:  Nothing really.  It might be interesting if they wanted to go into the morality of what they were doing, but that wasn\'t the direction of the show.  I will say that the final plotline that spans the last few episodes was confusing and not in a good way.  It kind of presents a moral dilemma but then the answer that they come up with is nonsense.So, overall I\'d say not a great show, but has some interesting characters.  I honestly spent most of the time just feeling sorry for the dragons.  I feel like this show must have been written by somebody very interested in whaling and/or farming livestock because that\'s more or less the premise.  And unless you really find it interesting to watch harmless creatures getting killed, harvested, and then cooked you may not find the premise appealing.  I give it a 5 because I was able to mostly enjoy the show, despite it\'s problems. kill another dragon.3.  No particularly interesting choreography.So if not for action, why watch the show?

The first was that I got the feeling that they try to justify nowadays whale hunting of Japanese fisherman.2. And secondly: as other people here also mentioned. Mikas main drive is fresh dragon meat. The show was missing some originality in this point.Otherwise I would say were a bit spoiled from all these epic anime series that fit so much action into 12/13 episodes. In my opinion they did a great job filling the 12 episodes with...content, it`s not stuffed with interesting plot and action like a triple A title but still very nice.The Art and Sound design is stunning as always at polygon, so even if the story lacked something im looking forward to a second season. 10/10 content, it`s not stuffed with interesting plot and action like a triple A title but still very nice.The Art and Sound design is stunning as always at polygon, so even if the story lacked something im looking forward to a second season. 10/10', 'This is literally the worst ""anime"" I\'ve ever watched - or rather - tried to watch.It basically follows along an airship of dragon hunters, who, there\'s really nothing else to it, hunt dragons. They hunt them, they butcher them, they sell them, they eat them. That\'s literally it, episode after episode. Beautiful, majestic dragons get introduced only to be eaten moments later.In one instance our crew discovers a small dragon that flew off from another ship. They catch it and.. surprise, they eat it. The episode ends with the other ship\'s people looking for it, revealing that it was a gift worth a fortune....Aaand that\'s it, the episode is over and the incident is never brought up ever again. There is virtually no plot in this anime as not even the smallest plotline ever gets pursued.I kept watching, thinking that surely there is gonna be some plot development. Like the main character finding resentment and disgust for the act of whaling - wait, sorry, dragon hunting (that mistake was not even intended, which says a LOT.) - but nothing of the sort happens. It just keeps on going, one dragon dish following the next. There is one character that stands out and always jumps head-first into combat with these dragons and taking them down in a dominating fashion. His motivation? Delicious meals of course, as plain as any other character.So yeah, if you\'re into a one-dimensional anime that glorifies whale-hunting, you\'re in for a treat (hah!). Art and sound are nice, although the CGI is offputting at times. I cannot bring myself to give it more than 2 stars though just for art and sound alone, as literally everything else about this is a flat 0. Very upsetting to watch.

Very upsetting to watch.', 'This is my first review here so I ll try my best.Story: Never heard about the manga this is based on but I really liked the story base here.  There was big potential on never ending exploration of skies for new dragon kinds but at the end it really did not deliver on it. The very last two episodes got my attention really going on: baby dragon, dragon mountain ""arc"". Most of the show is kind of a filler around basic formula: we see a dragon, we hung it, Mika jumps, Mika eats... So much potential - such a bad delivery.Sound: Hm... It did...not bother me, but it was too quiet most of the time, also sound effects for dragons and action were really mediocre.Character: The only ""developed"" or driven character in my eyes is the Takita, she is the newbie dragon hunter and she wants to prove herself, also she needs a roof over her head and food. Sad part is that character\'s back stories are never really told, most of the time one protagonist will tell something like: I don\'t have where to go, so I fly and hunt.Vanabelle is kind of a missed opportunity as well, why does she drinks so much? why does she feel so motherly to Takita? Nothing was answered. Mika, well he is just the regular jump, kill, hot guy trope.Art:  I did not mind the 3d style that much, even though I am myself a 2d anime enthusiast. The only big distraction were the face/face movements of the characters that were so bad looking, slow and really distracting to watch. Dragon designs were either hit or miss, but all in all it was not such a bad show from the art side of things.Food ""porn"" side was good (anime food junkie here) but it was just slap on  and it felt really out of place.All in all it is a pretty mediocre final product with such a great potential to be something much better if we look at the core idea by itself.

Netflix anime usually are like this, great idea, not so great end result.', 'Drifting Dragons had the potential to be amazing but blows it thanks to the problems with 3D animation and a lackluster (arguable nonexistant) plot.The plot is mostly slice of life as it follows the Quin Zaza in their daily duties as Drakers (Dragon hunters). From hunting to selling the parts in port, Drifting Dragons covers it all. However, the concept of the show is what does the majority of the heavy lifting. Action and cooking sequences supplement the narrative, they alone aren\'t enough to make up for an unexplored plot that was set up from episode 1. Within the first few minutes it\'s mentioned that...the Quin Zaza are one of the last few draker crews. Never throughout the 12 episode run time are we given an explanation as to why this might be. We do see the superstitions surrounding drakers lead to ostracization from those on land, but we are never offered any explanations as to why there are so few crews in the sky. We do the perils that come from being a draker and a single other crew, but this interesting plot point is never revisited. It\'s possible this will be explored in a second season, but as of this review it\'s been 3 years since the show came out with no mention of a second season. Instead, the first half of the anime is episodic with the back half following a bit more of a plot. What we do get is fine, but painfully average considering the concept and potential it holds.The characters interactions are one of the best parts of Drifing Dragons. The crew is fleshed out just enough to feel like a real crew whose been working alongside each other for a long time. Takita (our main character) is the newest member of the crew. She\'s a bubbly girl excited to be a draker and doesn\'t undergo any development, but she is usually the person inspiring change in those around her which makes up for it. However, she is not given any motivation as to why she joined the crew in the first place. One of the episodes starts out by saying ""everyone joins the crew for their own reasons"" then doesn\'t even bother to give a reason outside of two side characters. Takita left me wanting more out of her since she is a great character. Mika is the deuteragonist and the main source of action. He lives to hunt and eat dragons. No more, no less. This kind of character can work, but to me felt like there was an overemphasized importance. Giraud and Vannie round out the main cast and neither of them did much for me. Giraud got some good development but became distracted by a mediocre love interest and fell into irrelevance. Vannie is the tsundere of the group and undergoes the most subtle changes becoming less cold and distant by the end of the season. The interactions between the crew at large is what carries the character score as its one of the best aspects if the series. They\'re able to naturally riff off of each other and feel like they\'ve been living this way for years.The 3D animation is one of the biggest problems with the series. Besides not adding anything that 2D wouldn\'t have had, it adds a certain slowness to the series that becomes really distracting. Simple things like blinking or head movements take a half second longer than they should to fee natural. There\'s a certain stiffness there that\'s hard to explain other than seeing it for yourself. The character designs also have something weirdly consistent with them. Everybody has thunder thighs. I thought maybe it was the draker suits, but just about every character has giant triangle thighs when they\'re wearing pants. The best part about the animation is how spectacular the scenery and Dragon designs are. Thankfully, they were given the most focus and knocked my socks off every time we would see something new.While the character interactions and scenery are some of the best parts, the music is what really makes the show. The opening is amazing to the point where I wanted to watch it almost every episode (and I\'m a serial opening skipper). The tracks during the episodes really add the the whimsical and epic nature of the concept. It\'s perfect for the concept of the series and I really can\'t find the proper words to describe why it works so well.  There\'s a certain airyness that plays well with the action in the sky and underscores how amazing what we\'re seeing really is. The music adds this extra layer of wonder and awe missing from the other parts of the show.Overall, I rather enjoyed the series. It was a good 12 episodes and didn\'t overstay its welcome. I wanted more out of the series but was satisfies with what was provided. I hope there\'s a second season at some point so that maybe I can retroactively increase my score, but as of now the anime is only good, not great.Plot: 5/10Characters: 7/10Animation: 6.5/10Sound: 9/10Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 6.9/10 the Quin Zaza are one of the last few draker crews.

Kyojin no Hoshi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5834/Kyojin_no_Hoshi,"[""Introduction:This is the one anime that every Japanese person must watch for sake of their 'common knowledge.'  Although this is not very popular in the United States and other countries, due to the long history since its airing in the late 1960s, many of its aspects has become iconic for Japanese culture.  Even the recent anime industry incessantly refers to this anime, such as Bakemonogatari and Doraemon.  I was born in 1993, but had the opportunity to watch this when I was young as a result of my parents' recommendation, and I had never regretted once that I...had watched the entire series.Story: 9The executive producer had really put a lot of effort into the plot, spanning 182 episodes.  Throughout the course the story, the protagonist encounters many hardships, including academic, athletic, and family matters.  He is forced to make sacrifices in order to pursue his dream to become a professional baseball player, sometimes even if it results in expressing disapproval against his own father.  Eventually, he succeeds in becoming an excellent pitcher, and meets several tough batters with whom he establishes a rival relationship.Art: 7I will have to mention that back in the 1960s, there were no computers used for animation, and thus the only way to have anime was to draw EVERY SINGLE FRAME on a different piece of paper.  As a reference, several minutes required about 1000 frames or drawings.  Thus, one must respect the time and effort it took to produce something that is 182 episodes long.  Perhaps the only complaint I have for this anime is the art style: it is simply too old for my taste.Sound: 8Considering the technology that was available back in the 1960s, this is much better than average.  Sound effects when sliding in a base, hitting the ball, or someone huffing and puffing, were all well done.  I have nothing much else to say here.Character: 9Each character's unique attribute contributes to the overall audience's enjoyment.  This can be as simple as the hair style, or something complex like having to undergo long years of intense baseball training in the woods.  Each character (even the minor ones) is made sure to possess at least trait that somehow relates to another character's.  Furthermore, the roles of the minor characters serve to highlight the major ones, and plot balances are well maintained.Enjoyment: 9If you've read everything so far, my review might sound like senseless babbling, but this is a result of my trying to not spoil anything.  I guarantee: not spoiling anything will  increase your overall satisfaction when watching this anime.  As mentioned before, this is extremely popular in Japan (about 30% of the population recognize the title name), and can be attributed to the great enjoyment that this provides.  Unless they detest baseball in general, people of all age groups are guaranteed to enjoy.Overall: 8 had watched the entire series.Story: 9The executive producer had really put a lot of effort into the plot, spanning 182 episodes.

It is also about the relationship that someone can have to a sport, what that means and how it relates to the human relationships outside and inside of that sport. The series also explores youth, growth success and the price of that success.You might notice similarities in the presentation and some of the themes if you're familiar with series such as Ashita no Joe, Attack No 1 and Ace wo Nerae, however Kyojin no Hoshi is more about family, and...the individual relationships of the MC than those other series, these relationships are explored through fierce rivalry, drama and struggle that is constant throughout the series. The struggle explored in the series is both physical and emotional.The art in the series is incredible, utilising visual gimmicks that you might be familiar with from series like Attack No 1, the animation and the art also enhances the culmination points of the series. Visually the art gets more detailed on those parts which makes you feel tension of the situation through that visual presentation.  I'd say the usage of such presentation enables another level of engagement from the audience in those parts where the tension and struggle culminates. The series also features lot of sports commentary which I think makes the experience of the matches feel more immersive as it is almost as if you were watching a real match.Other than the above visual presentation I mentioned the series also puts emphasis on the emotional aspect of the sport and portrays it visually creating impactful visuals throughout the series. While the method that is used exploring some of the themes is more focused on the relationships of the group and family than the individuals own struggle like in Ashita no Joe and the others I mentioned earlier, I'd say that it doesn't really make the any less enjoyable. The struggle when it comes to the relationships in the series is also presented from multiple perspectives, and how different characters experience their relationship and struggle relating to that in different ways.There is also a sentiment about war and tragedy explored in the series as one of the themes, featuring footage from the war and exploring the effects of war to the individual, relationships and to the sport.Throughout the series as you grow with the characters you start feeling the weight of their struggle yourself and get immersed to the deep relationships and dynamic that the characters share, I'd say this enables another layer of enjoyment when it comes to the series.Overall I'd say that the series is an epic journey through youth and the struggle relating to that and what it means to when it comes to the relationships as you strive towards something as specific as success/sport and presenting a question if it is worth that price. the individual relationships of the MC than those other series, these relationships are explored through fierce rivalry, drama and struggle that is constant throughout the series.

Or did Wapan program their male population to be such pussies that they can\'t handle the opposite sex?', ""This is the third and final series that comprises the whole Koihime†Musou franchise. And, once again it did not let me down. Storywise is is really great, and not a lot of brainwork is involved to watch it, because it is light and fluffy with the occasional serious moments.I like the change to chibi mode when things need to taken with many pinches of salt. And the series does climax in the final two episodes and it finishes off with everybody living happily ever after.That catchy ending song is there, and everybody who has appeared in the series makes an appearence.My only...real gripe is that there were too many characters and often it was not easy to tell who was who. But, it also has the biggest collection of cute anime girls in any one place at one time. If you like boobies then this one is for you, and if you enjoy a lot of laughs and a mildish plot you may enjoy it as well. But, if like me you were just looking to have some enjoyment and to pass the time then I do recommend all 3 series.Would a 4th season work? no. But I would like to see some sort of closure episode where everybody goes home.Characters to watch?  there are just so many, but Mouki Bachou, Gentoku Ryuubi, Shiryuu Chouu, and Unchou Kan'u stood out from the herd. And, if you look at it rationally, the story is really about a group of 3 girls who go out on a journey to find themselves and to kick bandit ass! real gripe is that there were too many characters and often it was not easy to tell who was who.

A new enemy appears along with the 2nd season\'s enemy...But you know. If you wanted to REALLY learn about China\'s ""3 Kingdoms"" era, you won\'t get it from the Koihime Musou franchise. As a matter of fact, you\'ll get more of the same: cute girls being cute, fanservice (which I don\'t have a problem with), and guys being dealt with in horrible ways.I still think it\'s a horrible trade: Having some poor guy get beaten up just to...look up women\'s skirts or see them naked.
