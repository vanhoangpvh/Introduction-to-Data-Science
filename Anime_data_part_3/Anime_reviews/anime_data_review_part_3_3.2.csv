Break Blade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22433/Break_Blade,"['Titles do not usually hold much - if any - meaning. But in the case of Broken Blade, which is better known in Engrish as \'Break Blade\' (BB), the title refers to the broken blades visible on the head and back of Rygart\'s (the lead & pilot) robot. The titular broken blades also - symbolically - link into Rygart\'s character. One of the two things they symbolise is how broken as a person he is in Break Blade\'s universe due to his ""unsorcerer"" (can not manipulate quartz / use technology) limitations. The other is how mentally broken he becomes as he goes from being pacifistic...to the extent he refuses to fight back when hit to killing in a war. What they SHOULD NOT also be able to symbolise is how its adaptation is so hopelessly broken that it is better to skip it ALMOST entirely. Never before has an anime title been quite so depressingly accurate...A blank TV slot in 2014 for twelve episodes? Easy money wanted? THE SOLUTION: Copy & paste six OVA-movies from 2010-2011; splitting the 50 minute episodes into 20x2. To hell with there being no time to correct the anime original rushing / alterations from the movies that required a remake in the first place, much less fit in all of the content from the movies. JUST DO IT!... Insanity is said to be repeating the same actions and expecting different results. And the sad thing is, I would prefer this series to be an act of insanity. Or outright stupidity, even. Better that than laziness driven by greed.Before anything else, let me make this clear: I, Aion, like BB. *A LOT*. In the same way that Evangelion stands out from the \'mecha\' (neither Eva or BB are strictly MECHANICAL) crowd by being almost anti-mecha due to its psychological breakdown / post-traumatic stress disorder approach to piloting, so too does BB. It is not a series where a teenage boy has always dreamed of piloting a walking war machine and then learns some harsh lessons about war along the way. Instead, it is a series where an unwilling young adult, lacking in discipline and mental strength, as well as natural talent, forces himself to fight when he has no desire to do so. What follows the battles is never triumph; it is despair. The lead, Rygart, had been a farmer before discovering that only he - a social outcast due to a rare inability to manipulate quartz in world where 99.9% of people can - can control an ancient robot. The very reason he is an outcast with no loyalty to his nation proves to be the reason he ends up fighting in a war for his nation. A tragic irony that illustrates just what type of series BB is--a series that refuses to glorify or paint an heroic gloss over war. And I would not have it any other way... which is why it is a pity I can not say the same for this anime!::Manga vs. Movies vs. TV::Now, stay with me as I *TRY* to make sense of this for those in the dark, with as few spoilers as possible:There is a fan favourite bishie-psycho character called Girge. He is CRITICAL to the eventual mental breakdown AND growth of Rygart; post-anime especially. In the movies, the best part of the series - a Girge 1 vs. 6 fight - was cut. Worse yet, what occurred immediately after was also cut. This created numerous issues with the series going forward, including even the end of anime fight, and not just in terms of how the fight played out (kicking intelligence vs. swinging shuriken). The meaning was changed to such an extent that the fight ends in the manga with people cheering for Rygart as he laughs in an insane manner... to silence and Rygart passing out in the movies. Other, even more problematic issues include the movies COMPLETELY removing the Krishna-Orlando political intrigue, as well as turning a LENGTHY siege where Krishna tried to hold out in their capital into a nonsensical last stand where Athens\' army LITERALLY ran in a straight line and jumped over the walls in one attack. An elaborate faux betrayal \'lure them in\' strategy was removed in favour of a time-saving CHARGE! and Rygart swinging a gigantic weapon around like an angry monkey. And, NATURALLY, the Orlando content is important if there is any hope for a sequel. Orlando did not even arrive to help! Practically everything from (roughly) ch35-51/52 in the manga got cut and/or butchered; dialogue replaced with rushed stupidity.So, now we come to this \'TV version\', some 3-4 YEARS after the movies, with the promise of putting right past mistakes. The 12 episode length should have been a warning. There was ZERO new content in episodes 1-9. Everything copy & pasted from the movies. NOTHING to identify the TV version as its own entity. Not even touch-ups or remixed music. Episode nine (where things NEEDED to start changing) ended with Rygart moronically charging after Girge during an ambush, just as he did in the movies. Even the fate of Rygart\'s village in the same episode was not altered. Episode ten *DID* add THE Girge fight.... however, episode nine had made it made it clear that any changes would be entirely superficial. And this proved to be the case: all that was added was the fight and a THIRD CANON event (in episode 11) that held no value whatsoever without changing the circumstances surrounding those events. You see, in the manga Girge and Rygart are captured immediately after the fight. And what plays out in this scene will forever haunt Rygart. In both the movie and TV versions, Rygart falls off a cliff and never learns what happens. The animation studio went for an easy fix, not wanting to fully re-animate, and failed to even paint over the cracks. A facepalm worthy accomplishment, for sure.EVERYTHING else in the \'TV version\' played out the same as in the clusterfuck movies 5-6\'s \'sprint to the end; THE HELL WITH DETAILS--CUT!\' finale. Not surprising since more episodes and TOTALLY re-animating everything from Rygart\'s return to his village (ep9/movie5 onwards) was required, but still... Rygart relied on brute strength / luck in the climatic battle via swinging a yo-yo of doom, followed by his believed-to-be-dead-in-the-anime little brother JUST HAPPENING to walk up to him at the end, immediately after the climatic battle at the end of a war (not at all forced). Then, bizarrely, Rygart does what I assume was supposed to be the insane laughter from the manga; it coming across more like relief than a psychotic release due to the timing. And as a parting shot, the show even managed to rub salt in at the last by ending with \'Goodbye!\' instead of \'See you again in season 2!\'. I can not wait for the third attempt at a BB anime that MIGHT actually adapt the manga so there can be a sodding sequel. CAN. NOT. WAIT.::Other Complaints::-- Rygart\'s Characterisation:In the manga Rygart still does actions that can be described as stupid, but he also saves the people from his village AND learns enough from Girge to fight in the final battle using skill rather than brute force. In both anime, he disobeys orders to go save his village - failing to save anyone - and he fights brainlessly in the final battle--leaving viewers with the impression he risked lives without saving any and remained useless. There is no sense of \'Wow, he saved lives!\' or \'HE IS GETTING BETTER!\', and this leads to people hating the character, which is unfortunate given that he is one of the more interesting characters due to his struggles and how he starts to go off the deep end later.-- The Girge FightThe best part of the manga, which was skipped in the movies. It was added to the TV version. It is the ONE positive to come out of... this. But I was not impressed, OF COURSE. With no budget whatsoever having been spent in the 9.5 episodes that came before, I expected the entire budget to be dumped into this one fight. Maybe with a new epic piece of music to distinguish it from the rest of the action. Instead, I just got speed-lines and re-used music. So, rather than a reward for enduring, it came across more like a final insult. ""We will spend ten minutes on the scene, dutifully, but we will treat it like just another scene."" That is how it made me feel. And, maybe because of nostalgia and/or the disappointment, I felt NONE of the manga tingles I recall from when I read the fight in the manga and was left in awe... even though action is the weakest aspect of the manga due to it being hard to follow. It just left me indifferent.-- The Opening: Junction HeartAlmost anyone that has heard the movie opening by Kokia (Fate) and watched the visuals it is paired with ends up emotionally moved. The song is beautiful, granted, but the real reason for this is that it gives an insight into what sort of series BB is, with an anti-war vibe given by the direction and the music giving a sense that the human condition is going to come under examination in the show. Junction Heart, on the other hand, as you might expect with such a generic name / HEART is... well, generic. The song is vaguely uplifting / exciting average action anime fair, while the visuals consist entirely of facial close-ups from the re-used OVA, a \'zoom through characters\' part re-used from the Kokia opening... and brief bits from the ONE new fight scene. It is THAT lazy. And the ending \'animation\'? One massive page of character stills panned from left to right. Not even worth mentioning. NO EFFORT.-- 50-to-40 Scene Removal / ShorteningHonestly, this did not bother me TOO MUCH. But it was always a background issue. A second adaptation should never offer LESS; even more so when simply copying & pasting from the first adaptation. The earliest example I noticed was when Rygart talked to Narvi and they cut the dialogue from the scene; just briefly showing them interacting. That was the strategy: cut as many corners as humanly possible in order to make it fit. The one episode where it was really noticeable was the one where Rygart trained and Girge was introduced. It jumped around so much that it was confusing to see what happened to General True when it switched to him, having cut the first part. Many others commented on this particular episode.::Closing::Just to be CRYSTAL clear, this is NOT a \'purist hates anime adaptation; RAGE\' review. How can it be when I rated the movies 8-8-8-7-7-6 and this \'TV version\' is a slightly abridged version of those same movies? No, what this is is a \'Break Blade fan HATES anime inexplicably COPYING a flawed adaptation, which required a remake, 3-4 years later for an easy cash-grab\' review. People new to BB, much like myself when I watched the movies, regard the series highly and will see my score as being 110% unfair. But they are not seeing the full picture: they did not watch this same content years ago, then read the manga and - after getting their hopes up - wait years to see logic defied by having the same mistakes repeated anew, with only 10-15 minutes of new content. Not re-drawn, not re-animated, not re-scored: just ONE fight and meaningless death added. Hopefully this is the first and last time I get to experience a \'second adaptation\' (/having an editor copy from the OVA) that fits in even less content whilst not fixing any of the problems created by the first adaptation. It hurts my brain just thinking about the pointlessness. It is as if the animation studio were so incompetent that they attempted to fix the problems without having read the manga. That is the only conclusion I can draw from the way the scene in ep11 was... executed. And I can not decide if that is more offensive than simply copy & pasting the movies.When an anime is low budget, creativity is often used to mask it. Break Blade 2014 had neither money nor effort applied to it. It is a recap movie delayed so long that no-one cares; when there is no hope of a sequel--a recap movie presented as a TV series that deceives those unaware of the movies. Watch the movies, YouTube the Girge fight and read the manga. Do not even bother with this. It looks pretty for a TV series, it has an epic yet emotional soundtrack... and yet, these positives belong to the original version: not this recap. STAY AWAY... especially if you go into it having watched the movies. Only those new to BB could get anything out of this, and even then it is better to just watch the movies since at least then you are not watching an abridged version of an abridged version! to the extent he refuses to fight back when hit to killing in a war.

Unfortunately this is just a ""12er"" (only 12 episodes), and this is just not enough to develop a deep story and profound characters.The strongest part of this anime however is, without a doubt, the art, animation and sound. It is just incredible. The highest quality you´ll probably ever see in a mecha anime. A lot of details, colours, special effects. The mechs are a 100% hand-drawn, yet they still look better than any other made with CGI.The way the producers used the art in combination...with the sound of moving and clashing metal gives a (more) realistic feeling of super big and heavy machines moving and batteling......and this brings me to the next point, which makes me give this anime a straight 10/10: the batteling of the mechs. mother of god. i´ve seen gundam animes and what not, but this is just over the top deluxe mecha fighting like any boy or man dreams of. the fighting is so intense at one point that watching an entire episode seems like just 5 minutes passed. The enjoyment is fantasticso... this is why you should definetly watch Break Blade if you like mecha animes. It won´t give you a super story and super characters like other ones, but it will blow you out of your socks with the animation and the mechs battleling the shit out each other.-peace- °_°V with the sound of moving and clashing metal gives a (more) realistic feeling of super big and heavy machines moving and batteling......and this brings me to the next point, which makes me give this anime a straight 10/10: the batteling of the mechs. mother of god. i´ve seen gundam animes and what not, but this is just over the top deluxe mecha fighting like any boy or man dreams of. the fighting is so intense at one point that watching an entire episode seems like just 5 minutes passed.

The art is simply fantastic.As a fun of mecha animes, i am a harsh...judge when it comes to art and battle implementation between mechas.Well in terms of meele battle this definitly one of the best animes with mechas around,they are just awesome and so fun to watch.Sound 7:Decent sound and music soundtracks.The quartz weapons sound kinda strange though, but in general quite satisfied with the outcomeCharacter 8:I love the Characters,Rygart the protagonist its not the usuall super duper talent who gets to operate a machine for first time and starts to nail the battlefield.Nevertheless he is decent and it takes long time to get used to it, not to mention even at the important battles he doesnt manage to make the difference(something i really like personally). The character development of the other persons is very well balanced and solid aswell, and everyone gets some respective time.My fav is Baldr commanderEnjoyment 8. I have been enjoying the specific anime very much, maybe cause i really love that type of anime, but beyond thats its an anime worths seeingOverall 8. I DEFINITLY reccomend the anime to mehca lovers, beyond thats its still a very good anime to watch, with decent plot and anime development, i kinda beileve the 7.57 its a bit harsh i think it deserves better, in my eyes its the second best anime after Mahouka rettousei this spring season, but thats a personall opinion! judge when it comes to art and battle implementation between mechas.Well in terms of meele battle this definitly one of the best animes with mechas around,they are just awesome and so fun to watch.Sound 7:Decent sound and music soundtracks.The quartz weapons sound kinda strange though, but in general quite satisfied with the outcomeCharacter 8:I love the Characters,Rygart the protagonist its not the usuall super duper talent who gets to operate a machine for first time and starts to nail the battlefield.Nevertheless he is decent and it takes long time to get used to it, not to mention even at the important battles he doesnt manage to make the difference(something i really like personally).

Before TV series there was series of movies, and the thing is both of them are the same thing. It really is hard to point out difference between those two, more so TV series is fundamentally chopped movie without any will of redeeming ending for manga fans.Art and animation is really enjoyable, combined with battle music can easily stun viewer. Manga is easily the best mecha comic you can read, and so Movie/TV series could become one of the best mecha production - Movie ended differently because...it overtook manga release, that was understandable at that time(manga release was and still is painfully slow). BUT TV series never bothered with straightening it up, like they never gave a f*ck.If i had to evaluate TV/Movie (they are the same thing, just different opening/ending) then yes its strong 7/10 cuz of cheap ass rip off (for my personal score 9 out of 10 for a 1-3 parts of movie).Do not believe anime viewers only - go and read manga, its probably THE best mecha manga you can get. it overtook manga release, that was understandable at that time(manga release was and still is painfully slow).

Break Blade\'s promising premise coupled with it\'s intriguing introduction only makes the following trope-filled, messy remainder of the show hurt more by contrast. The great visual work, animation and fight choreography (for the mecha at least) coupled with the work of Yoshihisa Hirano for the soundtrack keeps the viewer excited and intrigued during a good deal of scenes, I will admit. However the story and characters do not manage to uphold...this standard.The setting, while intriguing initially; falls apart as the world is ""fleshed out,"" or in Break Blade\'s case, a lack thereof. The core element of the BB\'s universe, the quartz control, is barely explained, and characters rattle off statistics as if even they don\'t fully understand how it works. One minute the cords containing the quartz within the golems are the most integral part, the next the strength of the quartz within the weapons is most important, and then near the show\'s end the quality of the quartz is now the key element.This effect extends beyond the quartz control; elements such as how pulse guns obtain their power (is it the size of the bolts or the strength of the pilot?) or what the best way to do battle in a golem is (are numbers really that important when a couple of strong golems can wipe out an army?) are boiled down to the infuriating anime trope of ""____ technique or weapon is effective when the plot finds it convenient"" Sometimes bolts can destroy a golem in one hit, and sometimes the BBs armor can shrug bolts off as if they were anti-personnel rounds. It doesn\'t matter as long as the viewer sees the bad guys killing a lot of good guys so they know they\'re bad.But hey, maybe that stuff doesn\'t matter. It\'s a Mecha anime, right? You don\'t have to think about it logically! However, if you stop thinking about the cool things like how the golems work while you watch Break Blade, you now have to think about the characters and their motivation.BB doesn\'t have bad characters at first. Upon starting the show, you\'re introduced a pretty cool, airhead MC, a chill king with a cute owl and serious ace rival-type. The only annoying one is Lee really at the beginning, and upon finishing the show, I would\'ve preferred 10 versions of Lee over what we got towards the end. Spoiler warning if you still plan on watching the show. Just know I wouldn\'t recommend it for the following reasons; so keep reading if you don\'t care too much.I guess I\'ll start with Rygart, who has an interesting set up for character building where he could be learning about the reality of war and how impractical it is to let your enemy live; contrasting with his upbringing and the teachings of his father. But after his first ""kill"" he spends a day brooding but is then fine with killing any soldier afterwards (as long as it isn\'t Zess). His character\'s growth could have made for a neat message about how impractical it is to not take lives in war (a refreshing idea in this genre) but that idea gets completely thrown out the window when a 12 year old successfully takes out an entire troop without killing a single person (all the while filled with rage and propaganda-feuled hatred) The only other element to the character of our hero is that he is Zess\' friend, so there could at least be a dynamic between the two where they are both misunderstood yet forced to fight, but no, Zess gets injured in like the 3rd episode and doesn\'t return in the show WHATSOEVER until the veery end. There are no cuts to him back home at all in the show, and all the characters (except for Cleo, but we\'ll get to her) simultaneously forget about Zess\' existence. And that\'s pretty much it for our MAIN CHARACTER. There are a few weak attempts to show emotion in Rygart through his little brother and Girge for some reason, but they all feel awkward and out of place. Hell, the guy gets more pissed when Girge makes fun of him then when he sees his entire village where he grew up slaughtered.Speaking of Girge, I\'ll go over him quickly. He is brought in somewhat late to the cast and he is introduced as this insane loose cannon; but the only crazy thing about him is how crazy overpowered he is; for no explained reason. Again, because the ""plot finds it convenient"" Girge gets the ability to damage named character\'s golems, and as such he ends up fighting more often than our main character and singlehandedly kicks every antagonist\'s ass in; only to be killed off immediately after for again; no reason, as if he was a filler character meant to patch up some plot holes and give an excuse for more cool robot fights. The entire cast goes from hating him to liking him, he has a tacked-on side plot with the Baldr, and the only crazy thing he does is to pretend to be scared.Now I could go over every 2-dimensional villain or frustratingly incompetent ally, but I\'ll just cut the fat and skip to the top 3 worst characters in Break Blade. Here they are:#3: Nike: Pointless fanservice character. Let\'s make a little girl who\'s somehow stronger than most of these trained soldiers and give her a custom mech with a cheesy ""kill-off named characters you\'re supposed to care about"" function. Oh and lets also make her crazy but not ever elaborate on that. Don\'t forget headpats!#2 CLEO: We spent more time talking about how this 12-year-old has big boobs than we did talking about anything else. Did you get that she\'s 12? We also threw in a bunch of other elements because we weren\'t sure what to do with her character past the boob part. Well let\'s make her a clutz, and let\'s make her not fond of killing, but let\'s also make her a newty- I mean a natural born pilot who can learn how to pilot the super hard robot in a day (for some reason). She also is really good friends with Lee so that\'ll create some drama when Rygart ""kills"" her, but wait, that would mess with her side that doesn\'t like killing; so let\'s just have her brood for a bit but then get over her best friend\'s death. Oh and everyone\'s off fighting a war so someone needs to keep the queen company so let\'s spend a lot of time outlining a completely unbelievable scenario so we can get the underage girl to sit in lingerie with our other fanservice character. Who cares that the idea of a Queen bringing a POW to live in her bedroom with her is absolutely baffling, even for anime (I won\'t even get into the scene where ""Cleo escapes"" I\'d be here all night) we need the Queen to show her boobs somehow!#1 Sigyn: What a mess of a character. You have the romance elements, which are fine, although like most things in BB, just sort of established; not explained. Like neither her nor her hubby wear their rings, but why is that? Is is just because everyone knows she loves Rygart? Why does she even love Rygart so much? Whatever that part isn\'t the worst anyway. You\'ve got the fanservice of course. It\'s not particularly engaging or sexy; it just feels outrageous and out of place. If you actually expect me to believe this Queen goes to bed in a see-through silk vest and panties while she has a POW in her room you must think I\'m pretty stupid or you just don\'t give a damn. With BB it\'s most likely both. But then Sigyn is also a scientist and engineer? It\'s not exactly made clear. She can do this so they don\'t have to have another character to be the ""tech explainer."" Isn\'t handy how she made the Rygart a weapon to use to defeat the final boss right before the fight? Our Queenie sure is smart! Except for the POW thing and her multiple attempts to do something stupid where her aides have to stop her. The reason Sigyn is #1 on this list is because she is boring. She is sort of cute in some scenes but she isn\'t written well enough to be likeable, or bad enough to be funny.And that\'s pretty much it for the characters. No one really stands out that much and weirdly most of the established ""main characters"" are swept aside when the story actually starts to progress. The erratic actions and unclear motives of everyone in Break Blade makes the viewer feel confused and disconnected.To wrap it up, Break Blade is a unique type of bad anime. One that is hard to hate. It tried something new (sort of) and had uniqueness and skill in it; but not in the right places. It exists as an example of how art and sound direction can\'t carry an anime. No matter how hard I tried to invest myself into the fights in the later parts of BB, I couldn\'t get as excited as I did in the beginning; where I felt some tether to BB\'s setting and characters. As that withered away, so did my tether to the show as a whole. It\'s sad that the whole show had to suffer on the part of the poor story and character direction; but it was there and caused Break Blade to be an unenjoyable show to watch. I would not rewatch this show; even for laughs; and I would not recommend to watch this show fully. Maybe if the setting or designs appeal to you; watch the first 5 episodes and drop it before it disappoints you and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.TL;DR: Skip this one; but if the you like the designs or just love medieval Mecha, look up ""Break Blade fight compilation"" and you won\'t miss much. (or just watch Escaflowne / Panzer World Galient) this standard.The setting, while intriguing initially; falls apart as the world is ""fleshed out,"" or in Break Blade\'s case, a lack thereof. The core element of the BB\'s universe, the quartz control, is barely explained, and characters rattle off statistics as if even they don\'t fully understand how it works. One minute the cords containing the quartz within the golems are the most integral part, the next the strength of the quartz within the weapons is most important, and then near the show\'s end the quality of the quartz is now the key element.This effect extends beyond the quartz control; elements such as how pulse guns obtain their power (is it the size of the bolts or the strength of the pilot?) or what the best way to do battle in a golem is (are numbers really that important when a couple of strong golems can wipe out an army?) are boiled down to the infuriating anime trope of ""____ technique or weapon is effective when the plot finds it convenient"" Sometimes bolts can destroy a golem in one hit, and sometimes the BBs armor can shrug bolts off as if they were anti-personnel rounds. It doesn\'t matter as long as the viewer sees the bad guys killing a lot of good guys so they know they\'re bad.But hey, maybe that stuff doesn\'t matter. It\'s a Mecha anime, right? You don\'t have to think about it logically! However, if you stop thinking about the cool things like how the golems work while you watch Break Blade, you now have to think about the characters and their motivation.BB doesn\'t have bad characters at first. Upon starting the show, you\'re introduced a pretty cool, airhead MC, a chill king with a cute owl and serious ace rival-type. The only annoying one is Lee really at the beginning, and upon finishing the show, I would\'ve preferred 10 versions of Lee over what we got towards the end. Spoiler warning if you still plan on watching the show. Just know I wouldn\'t recommend it for the following reasons; so keep reading if you don\'t care too much.I guess I\'ll start with Rygart, who has an interesting set up for character building where he could be learning about the reality of war and how impractical it is to let your enemy live; contrasting with his upbringing and the teachings of his father. But after his first ""kill"" he spends a day brooding but is then fine with killing any soldier afterwards (as long as it isn\'t Zess). His character\'s growth could have made for a neat message about how impractical it is to not take lives in war (a refreshing idea in this genre) but that idea gets completely thrown out the window when a 12 year old successfully takes out an entire troop without killing a single person (all the while filled with rage and propaganda-feuled hatred) The only other element to the character of our hero is that he is Zess\' friend, so there could at least be a dynamic between the two where they are both misunderstood yet forced to fight, but no, Zess gets injured in like the 3rd episode and doesn\'t return in the show WHATSOEVER until the veery end.

It would have been much better if it ended with zess reuniting but I guess there's probably another continuation somewhere on the Internet. There's so little detail about other nations apart from the fact that MC is going to war because his friends nation allowed another nation to pass through them to invade their neighbours. Shallow plot leaves more to be desiredArt and design honestly loved the quality added in this anime, animation was so smooth with characters being finely created. I...would not have noticed the difference in this series (2014) and a series made within the last year based on art style and design. That being said many parts of the series were a single frame being panned or zoomed in, I guess it meant they had to focus quality on certain scenes more than others. Overall amazing art and designCharacter development: dense character palette, personalities were decent but nearly none of the characters developed, not even MC. They were all rather slow if at all, definitely space to improve with character development.Enjoyment: this was a neat watch for a 12 episode series condensed into 6 episodes at 50m each. Felt that there were parts missing like the high school back story all the main characters referred to, since opening ep 1 just shows MC near death in the desert.Overall: not really worth the watch if other shows are lined up, I'm glad to have finally watched this series after putting it off for so long though.

One more anime under my belt"", ""Before I begin I would like to clarify the fact that this review is regarding the (hopefully first) 12 episodes of this anime. In terms of potential I truly believe this anime has immense potential in the long run.For what it manages to accomplish in 12 episodes this anime is amazing, but that in and of itself is the issue. 12 episodes isn't really long enough for the story to develop and advance enough. Although you may binge watch the series in one go because the story is interesting enough for that there will be an unfilled void once you finish it. There are a...lot of unanswered questions, and it is all just left up in the air.WAIT! Before you go I would like to point out it is still definitely worth a watch, if not for the story and characters which may seem underdeveloped then for the art. Yes, the art! If you have read any of my other reviews you know that I have a hard time critiquing art. Well here it is, the art is awesome...It is hand drawn, but looks better than the majority of the cgi I have seen. Combine awesome art with a plot about mechs and we are a go. The battle scenes are great, and make the anime worth a watch.This anime is for those interested in an adequate story with a lot potential, that has amazing hand drawn art. It is an action and military based anime with a relatively serious mood. Honestly it does exceptionally well in the limited time allotted to it. lot of unanswered questions, and it is all just left up in the air.WAIT!

Although is lacking in some aspects, it's overall a rather good watch. This review will be with spoilers, and sorry for my not so good English :)Story-8The story is not too complicated, yet not too simple, one could say that it's just there to motivate characters to fight each other. Powerful country/aliens invades the weaker nation/race, something used quite a lot in mecha genre, not so much to talk about there, but as a whole it fits very good in the world of Break blade.Art- 10Art is amazing,...animation is gorgeous, fights are animated very well, I must point out  awesome design of mechas (golems ).

I gotta say that I personally like Break blade, for it's originality in mecha genre, for the fact that they put pilot's skills above raw power of MCs mecha, for the fact I was in love with Kokia's Fate song from movie adaptation.

The effort the animation team put on this is incredible for that time. Its been 7 years and the quality is so good.The detailing the reactions the physics of every fighting move, even when they get shot or falls down the animation and particle detailing is way too high than most of the other mecha anime out there.Its still underrated and not so popular among the new generations but daym this is one hell of an anime. I just fell in love with the effects and physics...and the work they put in this anime so this is a masterpiece for me.

It is also about several personal dramas around pilots and aristocrats and their interactions during these times. In theory this could have been a great epic of strife, ambition and tragedy around the needs of nations forced down the path of violence and destruction. In practice though it is hardly as interesting.The most obvious reason is the action. The whole thing looks like a dull Gundam rip-off, where the pilots keep monologing and explaining everything to the viewer instead of just letting us get it, minus the big explosions and the...poser mechas. It focuses too much on skirmishes and duels with simplistic field tactics that doesn’t make you feel you are watching a continent-wide war. What you mostly see is big robots punching or firing at each other with invisible fragment bullets, the gunshots of which are almost as if they use a silencer and the damage they inflict is a simple dent. Even hand-to-hand battles are simplistic to the point you don’t even feel you are watching mecha action but some b-grade armored dudes brawling. Heck, the mechas themselves are made of crystals and not metal and you feel they are big chunks of rock. They are in fact called golems that mostly act as armors. It’s dull to look at.The only time the action becomes interesting is when the elites of the war are having showdowns. All of a sudden the top pilots can use weird superpowers and a bit more strategy which makes everything look better. The rest of the time is as a whole boring action-wise and I never understood why they even need entire armies when it’s just the elites doing all the work and deciding the outcome of the war. Couldn’t they just have a tournament or something? It would spare them the thousands of deaths as well as the waste of resources.So the action is mostly a miss but what about the sociopolitical angle? Nation A invades nation B and must win before nation C decides to aid B against A. And that is all the politics you get in this show. In fact, nation C doesn’t even matter since everything was decided by the duels of a handful of pilots; so we might as well screw the tens of thousands of troops that were sent to die in this so-called war. Don’t go expecting any complicating mind games and unexpected plot twists because you won’t find any; the whole story is straightforward and simple enough even for elementary kids to follow. There are several scenes where generals and kings chat about their next move and it ends up being dead time as all you hear them say is how cool their few elite pilots are and how they alone can win the war. I believe this was done deliberately so the kids would be amazed and buy the plamo kits easier.Let’s proceed to the drama part; maybe that will be good… Nope; it is again weak. One guy is worried about becoming a heartless killer, another girl gets captured and has duty clashing with morality and… um, that’s all of it actually. What, you expected more? Sure, there are about two dozen different characters in this anime that affect the plot in some way, yet besides the generic shonen lead blondie, the rest have a very weak presence in the story. They all talk and they act and nothing seems important to remember because they are all typical shonen archetypes that solve their differences with good old fashion SMACK THEM DOWN. And since the action is mostly boring not even that works in the show’s favor. I hardly understand their motives, like why the blonde queen is sleeping with the big busted loli who tried to kill her, or why is there a woman that looks like a kid, or why did the megane dude surrendered and allowed to be killed in battle when he owned everyone during the fights. And who the heck is the opposing elite general? I don’t know anything about him other than he is an ass with good fighting skills. What is going on here and why should I care? This is all paper thin.The production values are far better than your average anime, but the mechas move rather crudely and fight simplistically, while half the backgrounds are barren wastelands with rocks. There isn’t much variety in locations or uniforms either. The only thing I visually remember is that blond queen who gets naked every 15 minutes, just so the viewer can stay awake through the uneventful scenes.As a whole it is a wasted world of multiple nations at war and of supposed political games that even my 10 year old nephew can understand. There is very little to see or expect in this series, and frankly I don’t understand praise it got for its supposed amazing story and wonderful animation. An average Gundam series has ten times more exiting action, an average shonen series has far more interesting characters, and the story can be described in three lines of text. Character interactions are basic and in effects throw in the bin the whole setting.If you have watched any actual good war epics, I don’t recommend it. If you have seen shows with good mecha action, I don’t recommend it. Heck, the average viewer would find it hard to stay awake through the dull plot or the simple fact it is a mecha show. Don’t believe a single person who claims this is some sort of masterpiece when it fails to be good even among its contemporaries. poser mechas. It focuses too much on skirmishes and duels with simplistic field tactics that doesn’t make you feel you are watching a continent-wide war. What you mostly see is big robots punching or firing at each other with invisible fragment bullets, the gunshots of which are almost as if they use a silencer and the damage they inflict is a simple dent. Even hand-to-hand battles are simplistic to the point you don’t even feel you are watching mecha action but some b-grade armored dudes brawling. Heck, the mechas themselves are made of crystals and not metal and you feel they are big chunks of rock. They are in fact called golems that mostly act as armors. It’s dull to look at.The only time the action becomes interesting is when the elites of the war are having showdowns. All of a sudden the top pilots can use weird superpowers and a bit more strategy which makes everything look better. The rest of the time is as a whole boring action-wise and I never understood why they even need entire armies when it’s just the elites doing all the work and deciding the outcome of the war. Couldn’t they just have a tournament or something? It would spare them the thousands of deaths as well as the waste of resources.So the action is mostly a miss but what about the sociopolitical angle? Nation A invades nation B and must win before nation C decides to aid B against A. And that is all the politics you get in this show. In fact, nation C doesn’t even matter since everything was decided by the duels of a handful of pilots; so we might as well screw the tens of thousands of troops that were sent to die in this so-called war. Don’t go expecting any complicating mind games and unexpected plot twists because you won’t find any; the whole story is straightforward and simple enough even for elementary kids to follow. There are several scenes where generals and kings chat about their next move and it ends up being dead time as all you hear them say is how cool their few elite pilots are and how they alone can win the war. I believe this was done deliberately so the kids would be amazed and buy the plamo kits easier.Let’s proceed to the drama part; maybe that will be good… Nope; it is again weak. One guy is worried about becoming a heartless killer, another girl gets captured and has duty clashing with morality and… um, that’s all of it actually. What, you expected more? Sure, there are about two dozen different characters in this anime that affect the plot in some way, yet besides the generic shonen lead blondie, the rest have a very weak presence in the story. They all talk and they act and nothing seems important to remember because they are all typical shonen archetypes that solve their differences with good old fashion SMACK THEM DOWN. And since the action is mostly boring not even that works in the show’s favor. I hardly understand their motives, like why the blonde queen is sleeping with the big busted loli who tried to kill her, or why is there a woman that looks like a kid, or why did the megane dude surrendered and allowed to be killed in battle when he owned everyone during the fights. And who the heck is the opposing elite general? I don’t know anything about him other than he is an ass with good fighting skills. What is going on here and why should I care? This is all paper thin.The production values are far better than your average anime, but the mechas move rather crudely and fight simplistically, while half the backgrounds are barren wastelands with rocks. There isn’t much variety in locations or uniforms either. The only thing I visually remember is that blond queen who gets naked every 15 minutes, just so the viewer can stay awake through the uneventful scenes.As a whole it is a wasted world of multiple nations at war and of supposed political games that even my 10 year old nephew can understand. There is very little to see or expect in this series, and frankly I don’t understand praise it got for its supposed amazing story and wonderful animation. An average Gundam series has ten times more exiting action, an average shonen series has far more interesting characters, and the story can be described in three lines of text.

HAPPY HOLYDAYS EVERYONE ^^ u start seeing the second season u will get captured by the storyline and by the way the plot and story starts to develop and the evolution of the romantic part was prety good too (^^)Loved the arts from the final batle it reminded me litle of gurren lagann :D and the OP of the first season in the final batle was EPIC!!!!well overall i give t a 9 cause it was realy emnjoyable art was prety good the story developed very well and the sound (speacialy in the end) was very good and because it ad a very conclusive ending, it was not like most animes in oour days that have inconclusive endings thats why i advise u to see this anime :DPS: DONT TRY TO WATCH THE SECOND SEASON WITHOT SEEING THE FIRST UR U WONT UNDERSTAND A THING!!   HAPPY HOLYDAYS EVERYONE ^^', ""The whole story of Asura Cryin' is quite bizarre and maybe complicated but everything does make sense despite all its weirdness.First of all, if you are reading this review (no spoiler) I assume that you've seen the first season; understood the relation between handlers, burial dolls and demons(akumas); and most of all that you’re interested in what happens next (the sooner you watch the sequel the better because of all the terminology you have to remember).Following the first season Tomoharu now knows that the Asura Machina uses the soul energy of its burial doll; in his case the emotions and soul of his friend Misao....Because of this, he’s now looking for a way to separate her from Kurogane (name of his Asura Machina). On the other hand, his demon friend Kanade, as an unnatural being in the world, can’t use her powers to aid Natsume because of the “Hizaika” (the effect that makes demons disappear little by little when they use their abilities without a contractor).So this is the initial setting given in this second season. All about the journey to find some device to save Misao doesn’t look promising at all but I must say that what makes this season very superior to the previous one is the crazy turn of events and the main plot regarding all those flashbacks you’ve seen before. Yes, all those confusing flashbacks from the first season that made you wonder “what was that again?” are now explained in this sequel. Now the story is no more about finding Naotaka, escaping from the student council or finding some stabilizer; this time the series has bigger plans for Natsume and company. Since there’s much more at risk the events occurring now involve more action and give a feeling of curiosity about what’s coming next.The art of this anime is no better than average, it doesn’t overwhelm you but it could disappoint you especially considering all the mechas and powers you see in it. In contrast of the art, the sound is awesome I personally loved the OP/ED by Angela the most; also the voice roles are accurate to the personalities. As for the characters, the main difference to the first season is that Ania plays a bigger part in this season.Overall, the enjoyment of this anime is guaranteed in almost all of it, if you liked the first season or you think it was interesting but not well developed you will find Asura Cryin’2 fascinating. This second season is the bigger half of the story so you won’t be lost in the end wondering what happened.

Well this would be one of them.I was skeptical at first about continuing the series and even after I started watching, it was kept on hold at episode 1 for the longest time. Assuming you have watched the first season, you should know why. Simply put, the first season was full of ambiguity and there was only a rough grasp of the current plot.Now, to end the first season off with nothing but questions about everything we had witnessed, anyone would assume that...the explanations would follow in the season season. Well time to be disappointed ladies and gentlemen because what we are going to get, is far from explanations.As for the explanations, without getting too in depth and ruining the fun for all of you(if you so happen to be the masochist to find out yourself), what the end result is, is that not only does the story get more ambiguous because of the new stuff that gets thrown at you, you basically get no explanations on anything from season one. Not One(good one at least).As if it couldn\'t get any worse, it does. By the end of the series your going to have so much contradictory information in your head, that you have no way of making sense out of this huge mess of poor planning.Asura Cryin\' as a whole, is a perfect example of the ""try too hard to put in everything and fail miserably"" type anime. It tries to appeal to, too wide of an audience, that it stretched itself so thin, that it snapped.To put it simply, try taking a small rubber band about 3-5 cm in diameter and try to wrap that around your family sized box of cereal.  What is the end result? The rubber band breaks and whips you in your hand. Not only will it leave you in pain and pissed off, but u got an opened box of cereal in the end to add insult to injury.As for the rest of the anime, it was alright. Some characters were great, some blew, and some will even confuse you more. The second season incorporates more sound tracks into the series, but none too inspiring. I found myself liking the first seasons OP more than anything else from the series and a bit disappointed in the rest of the sound tracks.There was no way I could enjoy this to its fullest because I personally was too focused on the terrible plot. However, because Asura Cryin\' tried so hard to appeal to everyone, I got to see some of the character development I had wish to see.To conclude, Asura Cryin\' sucked. Watch it if you really want to see the conclusion (believe it or not there is a very conclusive one), but if you really wanted to see a well knit plot, don\'t bother. the explanations would follow in the season season.

I\'m only saying this because I watched season 1 and I had watched it 1 episode a week just because I didn\'t get into it enough to watch it nonstop. THIS season however is different. I had to sit through school and keep looking at the clock wondering when school would get out so I could go home and watch the rest of season 2. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time due to how action packed it was, and the...story was a big improvement from season 1.The story in this season had a much bigger plot, and it was a really interesting one too. The entire season is basically talking about different dimensions and alternate worlds. That intrigued me to start thinking about what it would be like to have another me somewhere. The entire story didn\'t have to deal with alternate dimensions alone, it continued the plot line involving the Asura Cryin\' and Takatsuki vanishing and Misao and Tomo remembering their past. The story is totally crazy and it\'ll have some ""Didn\'t see that one coming"" moments.Art was as good as the first season. The fight scenes were animated beautifully and the character art was impressive. I\'m saying this because the characters are portrayed differently in some of the episodes, which was cool because at some point in animes you want to see the characters wear something other then what they usually wear. That and the visual effects were also quite impressive.I like the voice actors and stuff, but when I watched it, it was one of those ""Turn the Vol. up because it\'s too low, then turn it down again because it got too loud"" animes. That\'s the only thing that I noticed they could have improved when making the show. Other then that, the sound effects were good, voice acting was good, it was all good.I personally liked the characters a lot. They weren\'t really annoying, they looked good, voice actors did a good job bringing a good picture to what they would sound like in real life. It was well done. Ania remains my favorite. She can\'t be replaced in my opinion.I enjoyed this season a lot. Personally, out of all the animes that haven\'t been dubbed yet, this is one of my favorites. I recommend this to all those who liked Asura Cryin\' season 1, and to all the people who didn\'t like the first season. It\'s a big improvement, trust me.

Almost everything gets explained by the end, but til then you will be completely lost and wish that someone would just sit the MC (and us) down and take 10 min. to explain stuff to him.StoryI give this show massive props for having the story it wants to tell and using almost the entire 2 seasons to tell it.  Far far less filler episodes than most series, and a VERY twisty plot that keeps throwing new ideas and curveballs at...you.  I greatly enjoyed it.  This show also has a complete ending as well, not just one thrown in because they weren't getting another season.

Rest of it wasn't bad.  I found all the characters voices to match their personalities/art style anyways.CharacterNot bad at all.  Nice little romantic triangle going on with MC, ghost girl, and demon girl, but it's not the focus of the series.

Basically, the twists in plot still remains and is good, you wouldn't know when friends turn into foes or whether foes turn into friends. New characters were introduced and a new storyline was formed, making the anime more interesting than the first season. This season got better and better towards the end as the characters turn more serious as time goes by and trusts one another in order to cooperate. The ending was pretty good although some of the characters who failed in achieving...something they wanted in the anime had a pretty sad ending but good thing was that the main character ended up with the main heroine I wanted. Another part of the ending that I want to point out is that they used the first season's opening theme song once again which gives me a exciting feeling when I watch the main character fighting against the 'final boss'.

You can read it even if you didn\'t see the show, there\'s no massive spoilers.It was the first show I watch in my life (well, after bleach but I don\'t put Bleach, One piece and all these shows in the same bag as the little shows, like Asura Cryin).It\'s one of my favourite.I thought it was because it\'s the first show I watched, so there are kind of magic things, you know, the first time. So I marked it at ten, the first time I saw it. And then I watched...other show, all different from others. And I put a lot of ten... And I remember Asura Cryin, and then I said: ""Well, no it\'s not as good as Durarara, Angel Beats, ect...""So I decided to rewatch it.I did it. Everything is clear now, I know why I love this show. It deserves a 10.Let\'s begin with a quick synopsis, about the two seasons.We follow the story of Natsume Tomoharu, a young student who has the entire house of his brother for him because his brother moved out for a time. He have a mysterious ghost, which is reality a ""spectral projection"", who followed him everywhere, it\'s Misao.They moved in all the Natsume stuff, because it\'s the beginning of the scholar year. When they moved, someone get them a suitcase, really heavy.This suitcase is in reality an altar for what they\'ve called ""Asura Machinas"". Some people in the school are also ""handlers"", the persons who have an Asura machina.On the other side, there are people who have more power than humans, and it\'s more like supernatural powers, they are called ""demons"".Natsume is a nothing more than a human, but he will go through his proper discovers.We will follow the story of this world, well, I think said universe rather than world is more correct.I\'ll not said more things about the story, to not spoil.Where Asura Cryin did well, it\'s the plot. To be honest, is one of the plot the most worked that I saw, I think. You can\'t predict what will happen. And another thing is also good, is that the two seasons are really connected, well the second one is the direct next part of the first.I\'m a bit boring about Mecha anime, maybe because I saw too much show of this category. But Asura Cryin is not a basic mecha anime. Their powers are not overpowered. If they use it to much, there are some repercussions. And that\'s why it\'s interesting, and also that\'s only why the story is pretty interesting and well-constructed.There\'re some magic things in this show, like the voice that came out when an Asura Machina is called. It\'s the voice of the spectral projection first, and it becomes the voice of a machine. It\'s such a detail, put it put you in the show, and you are really excited to see what will happens.Let\'s see part by part.Story: 10/10As I said, it\'s one of my favourite show. The story is well constructed, and there is always some rebounds. They also succeed to make a good happy end, without inconsistencies. And I appreciate that!Art: 10/10Asura Cryin was published some years ago. The art is not bad, I like the design of the machinas, the universe and characters are also good. I have nothing to keep out about it.Sound: 10/10Well, the two opening and the two endings are... Awesome. It just in total harmony with the show, especially the second opening, which begins a bit slow and become faster.The ambiance music are also good, but once again, I think I don\'t really take care about it. My ear didn\'t bleed at any time in the anime, it\'s mostly the opposite. Which is a good thing, obviously.Characters: 10/10I was a bit in trouble to mark this part. I put 8 first, but maybe it deserves a 10. I don\'t really like Natsume. He\'s pretty... Basic. Takatsuki is also banal. That\'s why I was tented to put 8. But I think Misao, Shuri, and hopefully Saeki (well I maybe forgot some others), got really interesting behaviours. Misao is always hyperactive, she gives a really good rhythm to the anime, Shuri also, and Saeki is pretty interesting, because he give a bit of serious in the anime.The ""bad side"" is also well represented; they have good behaviours and ideology, that\'s why I finally put 10.Enjoyment: 10/10Well, I think you understand. I pretty like everything in this anime, except some moment, when it\'s a bit like ""love story time"", but it never happens too much, so that\'s pretty good. Honestly I rewatch the two seasons in maybe 3 days. It\'s pretty short for me, and I enjoyed it maybe more than the first time I saw it.One advice: stop thinking and watch it.But once again. Don’t believe everyone. Make your own opinion. other show, all different from others. And I put a lot of ten... And I remember Asura Cryin, and then I said: ""Well, no it\'s not as good as Durarara, Angel Beats, ect...""So I decided to rewatch it.I did it. Everything is clear now, I know why I love this show. It deserves a 10.Let\'s begin with a quick synopsis, about the two seasons.We follow the story of Natsume Tomoharu, a young student who has the entire house of his brother for him because his brother moved out for a time. He have a mysterious ghost, which is reality a ""spectral projection"", who followed him everywhere, it\'s Misao.They moved in all the Natsume stuff, because it\'s the beginning of the scholar year. When they moved, someone get them a suitcase, really heavy.This suitcase is in reality an altar for what they\'ve called ""Asura Machinas"". Some people in the school are also ""handlers"", the persons who have an Asura machina.On the other side, there are people who have more power than humans, and it\'s more like supernatural powers, they are called ""demons"".Natsume is a nothing more than a human, but he will go through his proper discovers.We will follow the story of this world, well, I think said universe rather than world is more correct.I\'ll not said more things about the story, to not spoil.Where Asura Cryin did well, it\'s the plot. To be honest, is one of the plot the most worked that I saw, I think. You can\'t predict what will happen. And another thing is also good, is that the two seasons are really connected, well the second one is the direct next part of the first.I\'m a bit boring about Mecha anime, maybe because I saw too much show of this category. But Asura Cryin is not a basic mecha anime. Their powers are not overpowered. If they use it to much, there are some repercussions. And that\'s why it\'s interesting, and also that\'s only why the story is pretty interesting and well-constructed.There\'re some magic things in this show, like the voice that came out when an Asura Machina is called. It\'s the voice of the spectral projection first, and it becomes the voice of a machine. It\'s such a detail, put it put you in the show, and you are really excited to see what will happens.Let\'s see part by part.Story: 10/10As I said, it\'s one of my favourite show. The story is well constructed, and there is always some rebounds. They also succeed to make a good happy end, without inconsistencies. And I appreciate that!Art: 10/10Asura Cryin was published some years ago. The art is not bad, I like the design of the machinas, the universe and characters are also good. I have nothing to keep out about it.Sound: 10/10Well, the two opening and the two endings are... Awesome. It just in total harmony with the show, especially the second opening, which begins a bit slow and become faster.The ambiance music are also good, but once again, I think I don\'t really take care about it. My ear didn\'t bleed at any time in the anime, it\'s mostly the opposite. Which is a good thing, obviously.Characters: 10/10I was a bit in trouble to mark this part. I put 8 first, but maybe it deserves a 10. I don\'t really like Natsume. He\'s pretty... Basic. Takatsuki is also banal. That\'s why I was tented to put 8. But I think Misao, Shuri, and hopefully Saeki (well I maybe forgot some others), got really interesting behaviours. Misao is always hyperactive, she gives a really good rhythm to the anime, Shuri also, and Saeki is pretty interesting, because he give a bit of serious in the anime.The ""bad side"" is also well represented; they have good behaviours and ideology, that\'s why I finally put 10.Enjoyment: 10/10Well, I think you understand.

Don’t believe everyone. Make your own opinion.', 'I found the second season of Asura Cryin\' to actually be better than the original season.There\'s far less instances of character overlap than the first season had.  I didn\'t find myself being as confused with ""who"" was on the screen at the time like I did with the first season.  They went the extra step and provided deeper characterization than the first season.They also concentrate on telling the story and seemed to have gotten rid of ""filler"" in the second season.  The story line was more compelling and there was a sense of urgency to it.  Unfortunately, at least to me,...they fell a little flat on delivering the final part of the story.The art was okay.  I really didn\'t notice anything that would push it above ""Good"".  It was better than some but not as good as others.This is not a music styled anime so they didn\'t do anything noticeable with the music.While this anime is not groundbreaking - overall - I was glad to have watched it. they fell a little flat on delivering the final part of the story.The art was okay.

What one is willing to do to accomplish their goals and the price you pay for those goals and the power you use.Story: The story in season one is kind of convoluted to say the least it mostly is their for setting up the main story that happens in the second season and for you to know all the terminology they use throughout the series. It mostly is about the main character Tomoharu learning who he is and...his importance to the world and why his best friend Misao is haunting him as a ghost. Kind of silly at first with all the crazy stuff that happens at the beginning but don\'t worry by the later half of the second season all should make since by then. If you can get by the first seasons convolutedness and are still interested I can guarantee that you will like the second season a lot more.Art: The art in the story is pretty good but not the best compared to other animes that came out around the time this anime aired but still good and the fighting scenes are also done fairly well too.Sound: I didn\'t really listen to much to the op and ed other than the first time they came on and the music they used was ok but not really memorable so don\'t come in excepting anything exceptional.Characters: The main characters of Asura Cryin\' are mainly just the science club members even though they all aren\'t said to be main on the MAL list but that is who the story mainly goes around is their group. But in a whole the mains are Tomoharu, Misao, and Kanade. All three mains don\'t really change who they are throughout the series they generally stay the same.Tomoharu is the main male lead who is almost literally thrown into the chaos of the world without really knowing what the hell is going on and why he needs to be involved while everyone else tends to keep him in the dark the whole time till they find it necessary to tell him what the hell is going on so I kinda feel bad for him at times and understand his reasoning of why he sometimes throughout the series decides to fight and sometimes wavers to the not fighting side to protect things he thinks others don\'t know about.Misao, the main female lead is Tomoharu\'s best friend that died in a plane crash and now ""haunts"" him but for the most part she is their for comedic relief and pushing Tomoharu when he starts to act like Shinji from Evangelion and also their for when the tension is high and settles everyone down mainly Tomoharu and makes them act rationally.Kanade is the other lead who is like the team mom pretty much. Everyone kind of just goes to her because she is nice and somehow always seems to shoulder the wait of what ever no one else wants too and is their to listen to everyone elses problems and give them advice.Other than the 3 mains being kind of normal and not all that exciting the supporting characters are where the story thrives not only do you see how they change somewhat throughout the story you get to see their backstories and what their resolve is made out of. The sometimes sad back stories will make you realize why they are the way they are and feel some empathy for them even so for the bad guys too. I don\'t want to say to much about them because I feel like you should watch for yourself and also it would take a long ass time.Enjoyment: I got a lot of enjoyment out of watching this series. Being kind of wacky at times and also pulling some fan service that wasn\'t over bearing made it good too but the characters, setting, and story made it interesting to watch and once you get into it you almost don\'t want to stop.Overall I can say that if you find the story interesting and remember all the terminology they use I can say that you will like this series it isn\'t too ground breaking but is defiently underrated even though kind of typical in the way the story goes but overall a fun watch I recommend it to those who want to see a action/romance/comedy series that has a somewhat serious plot to it.I hope you found this review helpful and I hope you consider giving this anime a try.Watch anime and keep it chill my friends.- MrLief 2014 Bokurano review his importance to the world and why his best friend Misao is haunting him as a ghost.

While I like the fact that many types are powers and factions (demons, mecha, cyborg, etc) have to fight one another, I feel that the series is trying to bite off more than it can chew. The different powers and factions aside, the many important plot keys like contracts, various devices and stuff makes it hard to digest what was exactly going on. The worst part is that the number makes it hard to place a stronger emphasis on one part of the story itself, which also indirectly results in several plot holes,...like, what's stopping Takatsuki from forming the contract anyway?And maybe it's because of the style of the original story, Asura Cryin' tries to do too many genres as well. It wasn't as obvious as the first season, but it still tries to do all of them within 13 episodes. It's not so bad until they inserted a beach episode somewhere in the middle of the season, trying to incorporate some fan service/moe/comedy/romance into the mix, ignoring the fact that the mood of the story is pretty tense and there are actually lives on stake while they are partying.But with that said, you can see that the story's still pretty gripping. There were many unknowns in the first season now that were explained, and the story makes many daring twists that could have spoilt the storyline... and risking a lot of plot holes (which did). Towards the end, the story had several over-the-top moments that had the series worthwhile after all.Though I've never liked how they designed the characters, I must say the animation's still relatively good. I've never liked the songs, but that could be just my opinion.Overall, watching Asura Cryin' can be frustrating at times due to the needless complexity and plot holes, but the bold direction of the story lines and many elements of the story makes it interesting to watch.Plot/Concept: Excellent!... ignoring the plot holes.Story Style: GoodAudio/Visual: GoodValue: 7 like, what's stopping Takatsuki from forming the contract anyway?And maybe it's because of the style of the original story, Asura Cryin' tries to do too many genres as well.

Unlike many shows it had had a nice conclusion that tied up many of the threads of the plot, which honestly is not something that I can say for an awful lot of series.  Just the fact that they bothered to give it a proper ending puts it head and shoulders above the truly crappy anime.Many people seem to have really hated this show and I suspect that expectations were very very high for some reason.  Personally I just found...it on crunchyroll one day and it was enjoyable enough to finish watching.I don't think it really is possible to watch just the first season and have any idea what is going on.Anyway, I can't say more without spoiling.  There really isn't anything that original here, and honestly if you are looking for some weird alternate universe science fiction you should go watch Noein instead, but really this series is not a bad way to kill time when you get off work in the evening.The one set of complaints I see that I really don't understand are about the animation.

To some people that I have talked to and the one other review that I read, they believe this is a boring show and is just a time waster. I say this was a fairly decent season of the two season series and I would definatally reccomend it. This one is defanatally one of my favorites. Compared to the first season which only had really one shocking moment, this season had several and kept me interested. The plot was also better and develped missing pieces that were left from the first season. Though I do wish...developers would go back to develope a back story to tell us what happened after the end instead of the wuick 2 min look through with what happens to all of the characters.Go watch it. If you don't want to watch the first season fine, but the second season I would say is worth the watch. developers would go back to develope a back story to tell us what happened after the end instead of the wuick 2 min look through with what happens to all of the characters.Go watch it.

Cuticle Tantei Inaba,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15109/Cuticle_Tantei_Inaba,"[""Yeah, it's a gag anime. A ridiculously cute, hyper, gag anime.Some of the anime's good points include: a rapid-fire funny dialogue, a cast of oddball characters, a truly out-there plot, the occasional jab at some manga/anime conventions, a short-skit format that never lets it drag, cute overload in every episode, and a ton of fujoshi fanservice (or is it a parody of fujoshi fanservice? Who cares, it works either way!)The art's very pretty when it's not chibified, and even the chibification's  used to full effect to prop up the gags, so it all works out in the end.The cast gives top-notch performances - I'd...never had imagined Ookawa Tohru could be this outrageously funny, for one. He also performs the ED btw, which is the comedy gem cherry on top of the ridiculousness sundae of the show.Of course, it might be a bit overwhelming and even seem nonsensical for people who prefer a more sedate or sober mode of storytelling. But if you're in the mood for something cute that doesn't take itself too seriously you should give this a shot. It delivers in spades. never had imagined Ookawa Tohru could be this outrageously funny, for one.

Ok, there's still the funny stuff, but the background of Hiroshi's life and family starts to get revealed and you  may find the seriousness in some episodes awkward, but later all the chibi gags will be back. And it's exactly the balanceament of both styles that made the anime really nice to watch.Just as I said above, the story is completely made of nonsense. The idea is so crazy that...it looks amazing, but it also could go very wrong. Inaba went by the right way, thankfully. I mean, when would I think that I'd be liking so much a anime about a werewolf detective fighting against a mafia goat?[Story - 8/10]The characters have really nice and creative designs that also resemble their personalities in some way. Kei, the 'only sane man' in this show has this plain look, for an example. The animation was very well done (and I watched the whole anime in SLQ!) and so was the colouring. I never heard of the studio before, but ZEXCS has done a very good work. (Looking at their previous works, I saw it's the same studio of Sukitte na Ii yo and Denyuuden)[Art - 9/10]The voice acting was very good! It was a bit strange to hear Hiroshi's seiyuu, Suwabe Junichi (who voiced Grimmjow from Bleach and Aomine from KuroBasu) to talk in such a high pitch, and Ookawa Toru (Mustang from FMA) did a amazing job as Valentino! Kei's seiyuu was also pretty good (poor guy, he screams a lot). I simply loved the opening! It's so fast paced and makes you more excited to watch the episode. The ending was ok, and the ost is rarely noticiable (I don't even remember if there was any music in the anime's background).[Sound - 8/10]Someone once said me that 'the characters from Cuticle Tantei Inaba looked like if the creator used some random rpg character generator and copied the results'. It's something like this, because there's no normal person in this! Even Kei, the 'only sane man'-type was a bit freak. And the coolest about the characters are this randomness! We have the hero with a hair fetish, the mysterious man obssessed with his leader (a goat), the psycho trap, a few last-episode characters... The triumph of this anime are the characters![Character - 10/10]So, this review is getting long and you may already be tired of me. Sorry. Resuming, the thing is - I LOVE Cuticle Tantei Inaba.

And how far can a show really go through just plain humor and gags? Well, pretty far if you consider this gem of a show which neither did get the attention it deserves nor did it fool itself with that notion. Rather the creator and the artists just tried to give enjoyment to the select few viewers it is likely to get and achieved even a certain level of perfection in their approach. And having a cool villain or rather a cool mafia goat (not joking...really) villain is a huge boost to this awesome attempt at insane comedy.The plot-line is absolutely ridiculous in a good way, it follows a werewolf detective Hiroshi Inaba in his attempts to catch the goat mafia Don Valentino through solving some really funny cases along the way. The overall story also has subplots involving Hiroshi trying to reunite with his brother and various other side characters including the narrator Kei generally goofing around. On a first glance it doesn't seem much as you expect some kind of show that is bound to get repetitive, well that is so wrong. Each and every episode has generally 2 parts in it and you never guess what to expect next. With a interesting cast of characters the writers threw one after another of these funny situations and you can never guess what to expect next. There are episodes featuring flashbacks and even chibi characters in a unrelated story and even a day at the zoo. Despite the randomness and wacky humor at a few times during the show you almost think the writer is trying to get serious with some emotional scene and right then you are almost smacked in the face with even more slapstick humor.There is a background plot involving the main characters' past and corruption in police department which seems to have a more serious basis but then again the writer pulls you back into the fray with his very rich sense of humor and enjoyable variety of characters.The story gets 8 out of 10.The characters as always are the life of a show like this and this show is quite lively with them. From the hair fetishist werewolf Hiroshi to his cross dressing over protective assistant Yuuta to almost normal yet manically cat loving other assistant Kei. From superhuman detective Ogi and his incredible family to all other minor side characters (such as the goat's Lorengo, hot blooded assassin Gabriella, cute mad scientist Noah and real weak brother of the main character to name a few) all are very unique in their roles and add to enjoyment in a very nice way. Special mention is to be given of the mafia goat Don Valentino, to me he is one of the most interesting villainous character ever in any anime out there (at least comedy wise). His unique way of speaking and his money eating tendency, his various tricks that usually backfires in weird ways and his unique sense of mafia honor really adds to the overall charm of the show. No matter what other people would like to tell you the goat is the star of this show, period.The characters are the most interesting and gets 9 out of 10.Although a show like this one obviously had a low budget the people behind it really did a great job of not making it noticeable through the animation. While it never really tries to reach any new boundaries with its art and animation it does the job perfectly well through its various comical drawing styles with nice chibi drawings and some excellent shots of the characters in many forms (as they even did a manly goat!) which overall add to the wacky humor and make you really laugh out loud.This gets 8 out of 10.The sound was once again quite nicely complimentary to the atmosphere of the show. But I have to mention the voice actors as in a show like this they have huge responsibilities which in this case they pulled off nicely. Tooru Ookawa was once again the star as the Don Valention, I mean that ending theme is something that I almost never could skip. He did an excellent job and despite everything most of the times I really rooted for the Don knowing fully well he would never succeed. Other aspects of music and sound on the show was not bad by any means but never really draws attention to any detail.The voice acting pushes the show to a new boundary so the sound gets 8.5 out of 10.At the end of this reminiscence, I really do keep remembering the fun I had watching the show, as at the last episode while the cast kept saying how they are sad this is the last episode I couldn't help but be sad with them. This show was something I enjoyed just for sure power of wacky humor and incredible cast of characters and would love to see more of them which I know is never gonna happen. Fortunately this show have much re-watch value and I just might do that in the future. Highly recommended to any fans of comedy or any one just wanting to watch a light show for fun.Overall Score -8.5 out of 10. really) villain is a huge boost to this awesome attempt at insane comedy.The plot-line is absolutely ridiculous in a good way, it follows a werewolf detective Hiroshi Inaba in his attempts to catch the goat mafia Don Valentino through solving some really funny cases along the way.

No matter what other people would like to tell you the goat is the star of this show, period.The characters are the most interesting and gets 9 out of 10.Although a show like this one obviously had a low budget the people behind it really did a great job of not making it noticeable through the animation. While it never really tries to reach any new boundaries with its art and animation it does the job perfectly well through its various comical drawing styles with nice chibi drawings and some excellent shots of the characters in many forms (as they even did a manly goat!) which overall add to the wacky humor and make you really laugh out loud.This gets 8 out of 10.The sound was once again quite nicely complimentary to the atmosphere of the show. But I have to mention the voice actors as in a show like this they have huge responsibilities which in this case they pulled off nicely. Tooru Ookawa was once again the star as the Don Valention, I mean that ending theme is something that I almost never could skip. He did an excellent job and despite everything most of the times I really rooted for the Don knowing fully well he would never succeed. Other aspects of music and sound on the show was not bad by any means but never really draws attention to any detail.The voice acting pushes the show to a new boundary so the sound gets 8.5 out of 10.At the end of this reminiscence, I really do keep remembering the fun I had watching the show, as at the last episode while the cast kept saying how they are sad this is the last episode I couldn't help but be sad with them. This show was something I enjoyed just for sure power of wacky humor and incredible cast of characters and would love to see more of them which I know is never gonna happen. Fortunately this show have much re-watch value and I just might do that in the future. Highly recommended to any fans of comedy or any one just wanting to watch a light show for fun.Overall Score -8.5 out of 10."", 'I don\'t like ""gag anime."" It\'s not that I don\'t have a sense of humor; I just don\'t have it for today\'s so-called comedy. People curse too much and think they\'re ""funny."" People hurt each other and it\'s called ""slapstick comedy.""But Psycho-Pass is too serious and Inferno Cop is ripping off Marvel\'s Ghost Rider.Detective Inaba is the type of comedy that takes no prisoners.

From the looks of the cover it seriously looks like an anime which you should avoid(because of the goat)- but don't judge the cover because you'll be loosing a good gem to your anime list.This story follows the Cuticle Detective: Hiroshi Inaba who is a artificial cloned Doberman that works for the police and a new threat arises when the goat: Don Valentino (master of a Mafia organization) makes his début in Japan.Story: So to say this story was fast paced and the only genres that it satisfied...was comedy and action i suppose. The story wasn't serious, even though it's categorized as a mystery there's only one mystery to the whole plot and it was given through within this 13 episodes but nevertheless i wasn't a klutz to give this one an eight unless it was entertaining. The whole story is a comedy and a little bit of seriousness added to the mix. The only flaw of this anime that it went fast paced with the character introductions(no not the main characters- but the secret characters)Art: The chara's were drawn very well- although there were some references from other anime like Yuuta is drawn like Armin from SNK and Inaba is very similar to Grell Sutecliffe from Black Butler. The chibi versions of the characters are so cute that literally it makes you go all fuzzy.Sound: The opening was good- it makes you feel nostalgic. This one is sung by the lead Seiyu who voices Inaba:Yuuichi Suwabe, and the ending was sung by the actor who voiced the goat. The soundtracks were okay- the choir like music in the last episode was epic. The seiyu's did a great job- Sugita Tomozaku(Gin-san) makes an appearance here- popular Seiyus like Fukuyama Jun(irony since he did Grell) and Okamoto Nobuhiko(Rin from Blue Exorcist) does minor roles but the other Seiyus made an enormous contribution too.Character: This one is a comedy and good one at that- but this anime could also get ridiculously serious at some point, the seriousness of the characters is at debate here- the villains are on neither side with the protagonists. I have never seen villains who get along side the protagonists like this. The punch-line giver,the cross dresser,the brother complex and the daddy's daughter fetishes can be found here. There are hidden emotions of the character's and you need to notice them and feel them. Hints were given throughout the anime and it would unmistakeably reveal that these characters are toughened up by the abrupt battles of the past.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this one- i was really sad when I hit the last episode. The show has class A comedy and jokes with punch lines. The character's have the cute version and silly/serious version. Definitely a must watch if you have the wolf/dog lover or a cat lover trait.Overall: It was pretty interesting, there were some surprising plot twists that you can never imagine. And the turnouts of the characters are quite surprising. I loved that there was an episode about the spooky forest of Aokigahara- this anime is overall very much nostalgic and many of the audience commented that it definitely deserved a second season.

I was curious about it after watching an AMV.There isn\'t much story, it\'s more of a ""bits-and-pieces"", ""daily lives"" kind of story. However, the one entire story is where a goat is the villain and steals money just to eat it, and there is a wolf detective who can derive information from hair. (It might sound really bad, but it\'s pretty good) Does an anime have to make sense to be great? I would say it was a pretty good and funny story because even though it was more of a Slice of Life anime, it added good comedy...when applicable. The story is meant for comedy, so it gives us a good laugh while maintaining action between detectives and the villain.The art of the characters was very appealing. Inaba Hiroshi is very handsome, the other main detective seems serious and cares about his work, and Inaba\'s 2 assistants both look capable and reliable. If you ignore that one of them is a trap. XDThe opening was quite good and was there to show the action in the anime, and introduce the characters within 1:30, but the ending was there for comedic effect, having Don Valentino (the goat) sing. It was meant just to loosen the viewer up and it was the cherry on top for a comedic anime like this.As the anime progresses, no matter how comedic an anime this is, you are able to see Inaba\'s backstory as well as another wolf detective that plays an important role. You also see the trap\'s assistant\'s relationships change, especially with Ogino (other main detective). Kei, the other assistant, also changes his views on the odd-ball group and ends up fitting in within the first few episodes.I really enjoyed the anime. It was a good one to kick back with and relax with. If you were having a stressful day, I recommend watching this anime to unwind. It has comedy, action, a touch of feels, and is a great anime. Unfortunately, I think this anime doesn\'t get the attention it deserves. when applicable.

It\'s not like the best I\'ve seen but I think the characters look fantastic, they\'re simple but have something special that makes them look unique. It\'s cute too, since they turn chibi a lot of the time.Sound: I really, really love the opening, listened to it for a month.Ending is funny, but kinda dramatic at the same time.Soundtrack is basically detective kind of music, it\'s fine.Character: Well, they\'re the best ones, I adore the characters. They might look ""normal"" but they\'re really unique, every single one has something that makes you like them. I didn\'t dislike any of them.They\'re not serious, don\'t have a super character development or anything, they\'re just like a character from a comedy anime should be: crazy.

Honestly it was kind of refreshing when so many of the show I had been watching were all such slogs of overly dramatic stories that could have benefited from a bit of levity. Most of the characters were a little flamboyant, which is a nice way of say very gay without calling it out directly. I'm not judging, but let's not beat around the bush about it. Honestly the trap is one of the more hetero characters.The power system was a...little vague, I'm not sure if they were supposed to be werewolves or if they were supernaturals dogs or something, I don't know it didn't seem all that important.

Inept supervillains are always hilarious, like a Japanese Dr Doofenshmirtz except instead of fighting animals with hats he is one. Did he wear a hat?

That is all I have to say but I have to write more for it to be a good review. Right? So what makes this anime so special, it is the jokes the slapstick comedy. The occasional fourth wall break and just the goofiness of serious situations. The anime knows how to capitalize on ones humour, if you don’t know how to laugh I swear this anime will...teach you at least how to smile. It is so weird over the top that the strongest character in this anime is a little baby. She has the power of creation, I am sure that when she grows up she can become a god of this anime world. She has the power of building houses and running away from a dog. On top of that she has a doting daddy which means that u are dead the moment you even dare look at her. Meaning anyone who watched this anime should be aware of the dangers that come with this anime. I for one almost escaped death, but I failed. So I am writing this not as a ghost to warn you to not watch but as a ghost to tell you. It was goddam worth it, this show is life changing. It changed my perspective on comedy that is why I am such a funny guy when I am with people. I am sure they laugh at my jokes because they are funny hahaha.

I wish this got a second season though… but haha what a joke right?So my ultimate score for this anime is a 10/10 because the humor just fits me.', ""Definitely a comedy anime~Story 7/10There are no solid story line whatsoever accept catching the goat, but it is really funnyArt 9/10The art is nice as I like how they switch in between chibi and anime mode, when things get serious then funny, they change really really fast lolSound 8/10The osts are not much of a big deal, the op is so-so and the ending song is.... a little weirdCharacter 7/10There isn't any much character development, and the side chars are just there, not much background etc. But all of them are lovable, and you don't really dislike any of them. their enemies, don valentino are...quite stupid thoughEnjoyment 8/10A few laughs definitely, it is an anime that will make you laugh and forgot that it's just an animation. But some might think that their gags were too forced and boring, but I think it's awesome \\m/Overall 8/10A very nice anime if you want lots of laughter, but if you do not like comedy that happens every minute in the anime... then well you might not enjoy it, but give it a try!

It's questionable. Wildly outlandish. Hopelessly weird. I loved it.What's with people re-imagining children's stories these days, anyway? Granted, CD Inaba isn't as recent as the various fairy tale movies that just came out, like Snow White and the Huntress or even the latest Alice in Wonderland, but I just found CD Inaba a couple of months ago and they all seemed to be rolling together.Though I have to admit, no one in Hollywood would ever twist nursery stories the way that Mochi did with The Wolf and...Seven Kids to come up with CD Inaba. It works though, in a ludicrously wacky kind of way. It's like they took a pancake, flipped it and it came down looking like strawberry smores with peanut butter syrup.The thing though, is that the end of the anime came so abruptly. A lot of the underlying plotlines were left hanging. Also, what the heck was Lorenzo keeping under the bag?! Seven Kids to come up with CD Inaba. It works though, in a ludicrously wacky kind of way.

Amanchu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31771/Amanchu,"[""This series. This healing series is one that is perfect for the Summer. Taking place near an aquatic setting with fun, waters, and diving. Amanchu! is a show that I can safely recommend to just about anyone.Adapted by the manga of the same name, you may find some similarities between this and Aria with its atmospheric setting. Also, it’s co-directed by Junichi Sato and his talent is easily recognizable in this series. Transforming a slice of life story into anime form isn’t always easy but he gets the job done with this anime. And I have to say, that is an achievement not to be...underestimated.The series has a relatively small cast but is very colorful in establishing their personalities. Hikari Kohinata (nicknamed Pikari) is the most cheerful girl you’ll probably meet in recent years as she spends her days being happy and diving. On the other hand, her classmate Futaba Ooki (nicknamed Teko) is a bit more on the timid side. Unlike Pikari, she lacks self-confidence and doesn’t have many friends. However, she is a sincere girl with a gentle personality. And through her growing relationship with Pikari, Teko begins to show more confidence as a person while also making valuable memories.In general, the show is pretty much a golden slice of life. What I mean by that is how the show is able to focus each episode like an episodic adventure of its own. It’s a series that doesn’t rely on complex storytelling but rather with its themes and characters. A major theme in the show is also friendship with Pikari and Teko’s relationship being the most prominent. The two are almost always seen together and they later join the school’s diving club. This opens up new possibilities for Teko as she learns about the mechanics of diving, as she didn’t even know how to swim prior to joining. Their teacher Mato Katori may be a strict person but she is also caring and really wants the club’s members to succeed. Furthermore, Teko meets new friends such as the Ninomiya siblings. In essence, Teko experiences new possibilities in her life that really makes a change in her character.If you want to experience some laughs and fun, this is definitely a show for you. Its comedy is well timed by the character expressions, dialogues, and reactions. I can also safely say that Amanchu! never relies on cheesy lines that may throw the viewer off. It comes out rather naturally with how the characters express their thoughts. Even though Teko can be quite timid, her dialogues in the series also feels fitting for her character. Of course, there’s Pikari who is hyperactive so expect tons of eccentricity out of her. The Ninomiya siblings fits somewhere in between as Ai resembles more like Pikari while her brother resembles more of Teko. These four makes the core of the diving club and their adventures is the reason why this series can be so exciting.In the meantime, the anime adaptation handles the show faithfully despite rearranging some chapters. I think the main point is that they are trying to construct the series to capture the important elements. The mechanics of diving, the relationship between Teko and Pikari, and making valuable memories are just a few to name. Background storytelling is kept at minimal although there is one episode that really gives the viewers an insight on Teko’s character. There’s also some subtle yuri vibes as the show likes to play around with Teko and Pikari's relationship. In retrospect, Amanchu! relies a lot more on its slice of life aspects that expresses excitement and fun.Anyone familiar with Kozue Amano’s Aria will easily find that the character designs from this series are also similar. Indeed, character designs looks very fresh that accurately adapts them into the story. Hilarious and super deformed character expressions seems to pop up often that are infectiously amusing; especially Pikari. In the meantime, the backgrounds feels natural and rich that depicts the ocean and other aquatic features with realism. There’s very minimal fan service as the show doesn’t rely on skin to deliver what’s intended. To easily sum it up, Amanchu’s visual quality can be easily described as visual porn.Character voice mannerism and soundtrack also deserves praise in the show. In particular, Pikari is like an energetic light bulb that never stops shining. Their teacher is also able to carry out her role with a mature voice that is very easy to understand and listen to. Soundtrack is quite atmospheric and smooth with a light touch for its OST. The OP and ED theme songs possesses a light voice tone that is exactly fitting for this series.Honestly, this is one of those shows that can almost make anyone feel relaxed after a stressful day. I mean, even if you plan to watch it on a random occasion, it will still induce you with its feels and heals. Amanchu’s story may not always be so appealing or complex. However, each episode has a life of its own that is valuable. The characters are represented quite well that comes together to share their love of diving, school life, and the joys of living. It’s just like the tagline, “fun for all, all for fun”. And you’ll get a lot of that. underestimated.The series has a relatively small cast but is very colorful in establishing their personalities.

This series tries to be relaxing and soothing which is typical for any anime that follows the Iyashikei format. There is no actual progression in this show making it a genuine timewaster. If you’re the type to enjoy a common prosaic structure, then this may be the show for you.The starting point of this show is very banal, here we follow the journey of Ooki Futaba (aka Teko) moving to a coastal location in Japan presumably due to her parents being transferred or something. It is known that she has moved from the busy...city life and has to immediately adapt to her new surroundings. She later meets a peppy and energetic girl in Kohinata Hikari (aka Pikari) who has a burning passion for diving. Teko is encouraged by Pikari to join the high school diving club, only to find out it’s on the brink of closing due to a lack of numbers. There we find out the other members are the Ninomiya twins, Ai and Makoto respectively. Katori is the club advisor for the club who also happens to be the teacher for both Teko and Pikari.The early episodes were actually interesting due to the basics of diving being explained in a way manageable for newbies. Concepts such as pressure increasing along with depth is relatively easy for anyone with common physics knowledge. The appropriate use of wet-suits and dry-suits being determined by the water temperature is just another example. It looked promising until we find out that Teko can’t even swim for sh*t once she gets into the training pool in episode 5-6. This is just deplorable writing, as it doesn’t make any sense for a non-swimmer in equipment to just plunge into the water. My anticipation for her to dive turned into dread when she needed swimming courses to participate. This is the last time we will see Teko diving for a while, which makes the rest of the show an everyday slice of life focusing on minor philosophical themes such as preservation of memories.Teko being the main character at first looked like another dull and simple-minded teenager but after moving locations it is hinted she grew more despondent, considering she had far less contact with her middle school friends. There was even a time where she mentioned she had a personal ‘void’ before starting middle school and that it was her old friends that enclosed the hole. Teko is an individual who resets mentally every time things don’t go in her direction. I guarantee you once she moves on to the next stage of her life (into higher education) she will be more dejected than usual, hence she is very flawed as it is inevitable the same process will occur periodically. This time it being with Pikari, who she has formed a very close and intimate friendship after her recent move.Teko does have some redeemable factors though, despite being timid at times she is very keen to experience new things with the help of her peers from the diving club. She is not extremely ambitious as she does give up at times probably due to a lack of confidence resulting in her low self-esteem. Despite that she does make solid progress from a fitness standpoint, by making more regular jogs and being able to fulfil the swimming requirement assigned by Katori. This causes no problems for Pikari, who is understanding of her circumstances and is willing to patiently wait until Teko is capable of doing so. Pikari enjoys the prospect of having a diving partner to accompany her which is a testament to the promise they made earlier.The art style for me is gorgeous, exquisite and really pleasing from an aesthetic standpoint. The female cast who make up the majority are very attractive looking and are a delight to look at, and then you have Makoto being the anomaly who gets some screen time. The character designs are intricate with them being highly detailed which suggests the animators have been quite meticulous with this project. Everything from the scenery backgrounds to the hair of the characters being colourful and dazzling just adds to my own immersion to the series. There are huge references to the Aria series with the Undine outfit being incorporated into the school uniform, as well as other things such as the chubby cats more or less looking the same. The use of puppet faces in the animation is new from the original creator Amano Kozue, which to me adds spice of variety to prevent things from becoming dull due to repeated use.The sound is very befitting for a SOL with the calm background music gradually setting the mood for the show. It really creates an atmosphere that would suit a quiet, plain town which is the setting for Amanchu! The music is being performed by Gontiti, a veteran group that haven’t worked on a TV series to date and for me did a fantastic job with their experience. The voice actors have done a spending job performing as their respective characters and they all more or less matched what was expected of their personalities.Pros:Great and heavily detailed art style (damn them girls are stunning and Makoto) ✓Nice complementary soundtrack ✓Iyashikei theme ✓Cons:Somewhat average characters that need more fleshing out ✘Pacing is lethargic (a marathon would be detrimental) ✘Can be repetitive at times ✘ city life and has to immediately adapt to her new surroundings.

(This includes groups, background characters & teachers.) I excluded previews for the next episodes along with flashbacks. 38 seconds is the longest time a character spent holding a reaction face. The title of most reaction faces and time spent making time is... Hikari, or “Pikari.” With all that nerdy stuff out the way, let’s get to my review.Story 6/10Perhaps one of the most underrated shows this season, Amanchu is a chill slice of life anime. The story focuses mainly on character Hikari and Futaba’s high school life, and their love...of diving. Hikari the lovely, energetic, frog faced angel has a love, hobby rather of diving. At some point in the beginning of the story Hikari and Teko are introduced. Hikari then initiates a conversation with Futaba at school. It’s their first “real” interaction until Hikari encourages Teko to join the diving club… and well you know the rest.Narratives, transitions, character introductions, were fine. The settings where certain events took place were great however, when it came to backstories and proper explanations the story falls flat. It took 9 episodes to finally get some information about Futabas’ past. Futaba being the main character, or the character that the story focuses on the most, you would expect the writer to go into more details about her. This simply was not the case for a long duration of the story. The lack of any proper backstories made me feel like important information was missing or that perhaps the writer had been planning to wait until the last moment to drop an important & dramatic scene. It’s like there was always a sense of some sort of build up that never seemed to be released.The pacing of the story is slow. This is a good thing because it lets viewers absorb little details, and really take in the beauty of the settings that the characters are in.  Not only that, because Amanchu has an awful lot of dialogue, this keeps things fresh, and allows viewers to understand the characters current situation better. If I had to say what my biggest concerns with the story were, the lack of any major developments in the plot and the story. The plot… it’s iffy. Sometimes there is a plot for an episode for example the writer was like “The plot for this episode… well I think I’ll have an entire episode focus on Teko and why she can’t delete pictures on her phone.”Sometimes a majority of the plots for certain episodes came off as uninteresting. Understanding that the manga is roughly 50+ chapters it’s sort of understandable that the story lacks a bigger goal for the characters.  I believe that maybe if the was an ultimate goal for the characters, for example, Hikari and Futaba want to become professional divers and win some sort of trophy for their schools’ team. Then I would love to stick around and see the resolution. The plot itself is so simple, that’s why I mentioned earlier that there were no major developments, and honestly it makes the show, feel almost incomplete. All of these, and I want to be nice and say “minor” but all of the problems are what ultimately led me to give the overall story a lower score.Art 7/10The  show  is very well animated, good quality and details all around. The opening animation was beautiful although I did have one problem. There is a scene where they’re all on the boat right. They jump off the boat wearing the diving gear and then the next scene they’re all in bathing suits. After that, towards the ending of the song, Hikari and Futaba are shown wearing their diving gear again. I’m sitting down thinking to myself “bruh, is this a joke?” I don’t know if this was done intentionally or if that was planned out. Either way that scene sort of ruins the moment a little. I mean I understand if they were doing it for fan-service bu- Oh! look at me, I’m rambling.I honestly love the anime’s character designs and background settings. The character designs, the school uniforms were certainly unique. One of my personal favorite things in school anime is seeing unique uniforms. This ranges from colors, designs, etc. I like that with the girls school uniform shows the shape and figures of their bodies. It leaves a lot to the imagination so to speak. The appearances of the ladies were pretty interesting. To me, the girls look like re-mastered 90’s anime girls. The eyes and hairstyle kind of make me think this way. The backgrounds like the beach, the ocean, clouds and pools. All of the background settings were amazing. Albeit they weren’t as great as I thought they would be.Characters 7/10I’ll be honest, in time I would love to see a more romantic relationship between Pikari and Teko develop. However, at the moment I am fine with them simply being best friends.  I mean Hikari is so energetic and Futaba has such a calm personality. I believe that opposites who attract make better partners.The two are obviously my most favorite characters in the series because they have the most welcoming personalities. It’s fun to see them interact with their classmates and teachers. It makes me feel like I’m involved in some way.  A majority of the characters with the series are inherently funny, friendly and likeable. However, I don’t think they are on the same level as Pik & Tek. Character development in Amanchu isn’t the shows strongest point. Although character growth does happen and personal changes through the story do occur. It does in fact take some time for the characters to realize their changes and accept it. It’s almost like a moral of the story feeling. I personally enjoyed seeing characters absorb new knowledge and make changes to their lives. The characters were great and I have very little complaints about any of them.Sound 7/10The opening song was pretty good, it was catchy sweet and mellow. The ending song was nothing special, it was catchy but not as special. I think that catchy songs tend to work better with slow-paced slice of life anime.. the voice actors were pretty good. I think that the female cast did an amazing job bringing their characters to life. I would’ve liked to have heard less “Gyops” and “Upyo’s” however; I did think it was kind of cute. The background songs were light-hearted, well composed, and did an excellent job setting the mood for certain exchange of dialogue.Enjoyment/Overall score 8/10As I may have mentioned earlier, the show is pretty chill. It’s full of dialogue which makes for very interesting conversations between characters. The art style, maybe the atmosphere makes it even more of a relaxing title. Now what do I mean when I say relaxing? To put it simply, Amanchu is a title that if you need to take a break from watching a bunch of action and fantasy titles. You could put it on and admire the beauty & quality that it has to offer. The only downside is that it has an awful lot of dialogue so if you’re transitioning from a title with lots of action and violence then you may want to skip this title. Now, when it came to my enjoyment with the show I’d have to say that the characters are what made this show fun.  Overall I enjoyed the title very much and would probably recommend it to anyone who likes to take things slow. of diving.

Now what do I mean when I say relaxing? To put it simply, Amanchu is a title that if you need to take a break from watching a bunch of action and fantasy titles. You could put it on and admire the beauty & quality that it has to offer. The only downside is that it has an awful lot of dialogue so if you’re transitioning from a title with lots of action and violence then you may want to skip this title. Now, when it came to my enjoyment with the show I’d have to say that the characters are what made this show fun.  Overall I enjoyed the title very much and would probably recommend it to anyone who likes to take things slow.', 'Iyashikei is a sub-genre of slice of life that I\'ve started being aware of after reading the critically acclaimed manga series named ""Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou"", one that I still love and consider not only one of the best additions into the respective sub-genre, but of the slice of life genre itself in general. A great female character, a really interesting take on the future landscape of Japan and AIs, episodic stories that are no less than charming and a very powerful ending make it one of the most fascinating experiences that come to mind when it comes to this industry. Following that, I had the...pleasure of coming across the all famous Aria, which is one that I really liked, taking place on planet Aqua (Mars after colonization and inhabitation), with a main character from Manhome (former Earth), that travels to Neo Venezia in order to become a successful Undine, making new encounters and experiencing happiness all over. Getting progressively better while focusing on both characters and worldbuilding in the first and second entries and finally unleashing all of its emotional prowess in the Origination, the whole franchise was nothing less than a ride. Home to powerful themes, both of the aforementioned series are optimistic in nature, and are very enjoyable at that. However, what I would consider their stupid little sister comes in. That stupid little sister definitely is not as good as the big ones, as implied, but definitely managed to be as fun, and of course, has a lot of room to improve. And maybe become better than the other two.Amanchu! is yet another anime project adapted from the manga of the same name, written by Amano Kozue of Aria fame, and directed by Satou Junichi, the master of the sub-genre. The latter has directed many works that I consider some of the best, including Princess Tutu and Tamayura, another underrated iyashikei gem. It takes place in a rural area very close to the sea somewhere in Japan and is about a girl named Ooki Futaba aka Teko, that came to live there from a city. A girl full of worries and anxieties, Teko does not know what to do and where the path named ""life"" will lead here. That\'s until she meets Kohinata Hikari aka Pikari, a very energetic, fired up and all gung-ho girl, who happens to be a scuba diving enthusiast, maniac even. The latter drags the former around and into the world of scuba diving. Teko experiences many new things that take a toll on her coming of age, meets new people including her homeroom teacher, an indecisive upperclassman named Ninomiya Ai, and her quiet brother, Ninomiya Makoto. All of them together dive into the sea of happiness and fun and learn how important these two things are. After all, this is exactly what this anime series is about.As previously implied, the plot itself is very simple. In fact, there is no definite plot to speak of, as the series take the episodic approach and is about random happenings in the characters\' lives, as well as others that emphasize Teko\'s development mostly. On another hand, Amanchu takes advantage of its simplicity and gives it yet another touch, that makes it even more fun than what normal iyashikei seems to me. That touch can be found in several scenes, such as the one in which Pikari chases after the teacher, as well as the easily recognisable yet sometimes overused chibi faces that are quite enjoyable to bestow. Another positive point is that, despite it being a series that takes a really optimistic point of view in life, it does not completely discard the sadness, worries, and implications that a person might experience in life, something that can be seen through Teko\'s face. Her development is significant and another really important plot point that reinforces the amount of good things Amanchu has, also coming into perfect contrast with Pikari, who might get lost sometimes, but indeed does think positively all the time.Nevertheless, as people say, there always is the positive and the negative side of things. To say the truth, more scuba diving would be plausible. Sure, the basics were introduced eloquently at the start, sure, Teko did not know how to swim and learnt how to later on, but I was not able to fully take a taste of this beautiful world of scuba diving. This is not as much a negative, as a personal complaint of mine, but I felt like expressing it. Now to truly start with them, Amanchu sometimes might seem to stick its arse into repeating the same messages over and over. In different ways most of the times, but the fact that it does repeat them still is there and is one that can not be ejected. Unfortunately, a second shortcoming is the pacing which sometimes strikes me off as inconsistent. The transition between the scenes might seem random in some cases as well. However, as repeatedly indicated throughout its length, Amanchu has this message of positive perspective, which might make us look at negative things as a double-edged sword. The way it portrays everyday things such as ""fun"" and ""entertainment"" is subject to savour, something that can not make me fully well dislike it. Even as I am writing this review, specific scenes come to mind, ones that made me happy helped me full well realize that yup, having fun is very important for a person, especially when he or her is undergoing peer pressure.In addition to the simple yet charming plot, Amanchu hits home with a vibrant cast of characters, that all are different yet share some of their worries. From Teko to Pikari to the teacher to Pikari\'s grandma, all of them seem to worry about life, because they are humans. What I truly loved about the section though, is that every single character seems to be true to themselves. What is meant by that is Pikari will always be the energetic person, Teko will always be the worrywart, Onee-chan will always hit Outoto-kun and Outoto-kun will consistently worry about her. How Amanchu handles archetypes, whilst managing to be consistently pleasant, is something I could appreciate to the fullest. Letting alone that those characters are always involved in wacky and unforgettable scenes, I was finding myself caring about them, and especially Teko, whom the spotlight will shine onto for a seperate percentage of this review.Teko is your everyday shy high school girl who does not stand out and does not have many friends. Her inside is full of worries and questions, about what to long for. Her encounters truly make her a character of wonder. This sense of empirism that always is present in the series manages to flesh her out exceptionally well. From her grade school days to her high school ones, the concept of changing is always evident when it comes to her character. She herself realised that she is the one that does not look at things positively enough, she is the one that realised that she can not appreciate things to the fullest, and finally she is the one that understood that both her past and present meetings are ones that belong to her and ones that only her can treasure. In the end, she had a lot of fun and so did I. Her coming of age, which will continue till the end of the whole story I presume, is something that is a sight to not miss. It is simple, it is fun, coupled off by the wacky adventures of our whole cast of course, it is easy to relate to, and it is something that does not try to be more than it is. What a great character Teko is. She also is super cute, with her chibi face and stuff. Her relationship with Pikari is a really enjoyable aspect of Amanchu, them being polar opposites and fitting the deal ideally.To get on with the other characters, Pikari, Ai, Makoto and Sensei and her worries about the weather which should be mentioned, all get seperate episodes throughout the series\' length, but are characters that I feel like need more introduction, after me loving Teko all that much. Even if they do not get developed more, I would not mind it, that being exactly one of the main characteristics of iyashikei itself, but I would definitely count it as a positive. The chibi faces each and every of our significant characters have are mottos and work as additions to their character and, most of the times, are really cute. Advisor Cha/Aria deserves a special mention because he is the best character in the whole series after Teko. Teko is a masterpiece herself.The art section is, for the lack of a better term, beautiful. The character designs are highly detailed and aesthetically spot-on, the landscape and sceneries are intricate and a really pleasant sight, the character designs are charming, especially the girl\'s bodies and uniforms which are given enough attention to detail, and the expressions are no less than wondrous. The chibi faces are sometimes annoying, other times work perfectly, but the characters\' facial expressions when things get emotional is when shit hits the fan. The animation, as expected of JC Staff and its animators, is smooth, with some exceptions of lower budget that could as well be passed by unnoticed.The soundtrack is a really strong counterpart of Amanchu, the exact same going for its predecessor, Aria. The music pieces create an atmosphere of wonder that fits the setting, with its calm and healing songs for the longest run, and ones that share a more playful tone when it comes to the wackier scenes. The opening piece is sung by Maaya Sakamoto, voice actor of Shinobu from the Monogatari Series. With her calm and soothing voice, and the lyrics that befit the series quite well, the song itself made me look forward to watching the content that followed it even more. The ending song is quite cute, though one that I did not give that much attention to.Enjoyment: 9/10I wholeheartedly enjoyed Amanchu, in a way that it almost made me forget about all of its shortcomings. To be taken in such a fun ride of both style and substance, one that is definitely not something that deep, but really relatable was my pleasure. I feel like I am way too biased, especially towards Teko and all the things surrounding her, but I do not care as much about it, because the series managed to take me on a trip, a small one, of conviviality.Overall: 7.5/10To conclude, Amanchu brings all mundane aspects of life together and, along with the interesting setting and its vibrant cast of characters, manages to become one of the most fun anime journeys that come to mind. It has its fair share of shortcomings, I am aware of that, but as long as I was left satisfied, I am content with it. The final episode was easily the best one out of the bunch, but I work by the phrase ""The journey always is more important than the destination"" and I can assure you, this particular one is worth it.

Anime of the Season.', '“I realized that the ocean reaches far and wide. Perhaps this vast ocean might have something may have something my significant self doesn’t. I might be able to find my true self” –TekoEvery season, there will always be that one show that gets overlooked by a lot of viewers due to various reason. Amanchu is one of them. First of all, it is a slice of life anime, that alone is enough reason for a lot of people to overlook this show. It seems that a lot of slice of life anime nowadays are just about high school girls and drinking tea. Another reason is...that people Amanchu doesn’t seem to appeal with a lot of viewers. Viewers tend to watch shows that they think are much better or those that are much impressing in their opinion. Honestly, at first I also thought twice on starting this anime knowing I might end up dropping it later on coupled with the fact I didn’t like SoL that much. But turns out, as I go pass a couple of episodes, I fell in love with the beauty that this show has to offer. This show is something much different than most SoL that I have watched. Before I dig even deeper, let me formally start the review.StoryThe story mainly focused on two of our main characters Hikari Kohinata (nicknamed “Pikari”) and Futaba Ooki (nicknamed “Teko”). Pikari is a very cheerful and energetic person who loves scuba diving while Teko is a shy and timid person who has a lot of problems concerning herself. On the start of their high school, Pikari dragged Teko into joining the diving club which triggers the start of this wonderful story about scuba diving and soul-searching. As I mentioned, this anime is about scuba diving which is something you won’t hear every day. Upon seeing this your initial reaction would be something along the lines of “sounds boring” or “sounds interestingly original”. But I’ll tell you right away that the beauty of this show is not from its aspects involving scuba diving. In fact, we were introduced to the scuba diving parts on the first few episodes only to be set aside midways and to reappear at the very end of the anime. Although the scuba diving aspect paved way to a very magnificent ending, still it doesn’t feel like it’s enough for a lot of people such as myself. For something that makes the anime unique or original is also something that is not emphasized so well. So now we’re thinking “If it’s not the scuba diving, what makes this anime good then?” Well, a while ago, I mentioned one of the main character as that type to faces a lot of personal problems, and I also mentioned the word “soul-searching”. This show is mainly about the characters and their relationship as they go through each other’s difficulties. Such difficulties that are too simple and too small and yet bares a very meaningful life lesson on its conclusion. Difficulties that makes you define who you are or what you want. This features are executed in a very relaxing and lighthearted manner that anyone  could find it very sweet and adorable. This along with the atmosphere of the show reveals a very beautiful show that a lot of people would love only if they paid attention to it.ArtRegarding the art, the character designs looks different from the typical look of a character. I don’t see it as something bad or something good although I can say it fits the atmosphere of the show. They also made use of some wacky faces in order to portray most comedic parts in which for me adds more vibe into the show. For me, the way the setting looked made the art stood out. The way they showcased the overall setting such as the ocean, pool and the beachside is something that is done right. This adds up to the overall beauty and atmosphere of the anime.SoundAs you’d expect from a SoL anime, it made of use of relaxing and lighthearted music which fits very well with the show. It made use of rhythmic acoustic music on most part of the show which is very fitting for this kind of anime. But if I could point out which really stood out when it comes to the sound and music of the anime, it is the opening and the ending theme of the show. I loved both of them specially the opening which did a very good job in setting up the mood of the show.CharactersAs I mentioned, this anime is all about character relationship and interactions. Although it mainly focused on out two main characters, the show also features three more characters to mention. The siblings Ai Ninomiya and Makoto Ninomiya which are co-divers and are schoolmates of out two main characters and Mato Kotori which is the adviser of the diving club. All three of them were given a huge amount of screen time and importance. In short, these characters doesn’t feel like they were left out through the whole anime even if the focus is on our two main characters. Halfway through the show you’ll see a lot of interactions between this small cast of characters giving way for character development. Now speaking of character development, let’s talk about our two main characters Pikari and Teko. They are very dynamic and is the perfect representation of how SoL main characters should be. Through the course of twelve episode, both of them are well developed specially Teko. Character development is always important in every show and yet it is something that a lot of shows nowadays lacked. But Amanchu surprised for having such dynamic characters which lead me to say that this is a pretty good anime.Overall, this show is a great watch. Though it saddened me that a lot of people overlooked this anime. I remember the sudden drop of viewers after the first episode. But yeah, I totally liked this anime and I would recommend it to anyone who is in need of a need SoL to watch. Thank you for reading. that people Amanchu doesn’t seem to appeal with a lot of viewers.

But yeah, I totally liked this anime and I would recommend it to anyone who is in need of a need SoL to watch. Thank you for reading.', ""First of all i haven't read the manga that Amanchu is based off so as a result the first time that i seen the story, characters and setting was in the anime itself.So then lets get startedThe story for Amanchu revolves around the character of Futaba Ooki who i call Teko and her move from the metropolis of Tokyo to a new oceanside town and her attempts to get used to her new surroundings and make new friends. Part of this process is going to a entirely new school and joining the schools diving club.Teko's character as a result of her personality...is quiet, timid and indecisive and as a result she has great difficulty in making friends. This is a problem that has plagued her since her primary school days. As a result she gets scared rather easily and as a result is reluctant to try anything new. At the start of the series the first friend that she makes is with Hikari.As someone that shares some of her personality traits i know too wellwhat she is going through in the series. And im glad that she is able to makenew friends and find a purpose.As the series progresses however her interactions and friendships with Hikari and the support cast and her introduction to the diving club allows her to experience many new things. These include normal events like hanging out with friends, swimsuit shopping and more importantly introduces her to the world of diving.  Through this Teko is able to slowly break out of her shell and make new friends and more importantly start to enjoy her school life.The character of Teko is voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano who is one of my favorite  seiyuu's and i think she managed to portray Teko's character pretty well.Hikari who is nicknamed Pikari by Teko and others is the other main character on the show. Hikari has a rather free spirited personality and certainly absent minded but surprisingly she can offer some really good advice at times. Hikari is also very energetic and already has a interest in diving before meeting Futaba so she helps Teko along in this.In the story Hikari serves as both the second main character and also the first friend that Teko makes in the new school. In the story Hikari introduces Teko to the world of diving and provides a lot of support to her as she is trained by the other members of the club.One aspect of Hikari that i liked was her facial expressions and faces that she makes from time to time. This i felt was for comic relief and i found them to be quite funny.The central aspect of the show apart from diving is the bond that Teko and Hikari forge as they develop their friendship. In that i believe that it was successful as Teko can rely on Hikari for support, advice and speak to her about any problems that she has.The Ninomiya siblings are upperclassman in the school that are also partof the dive club that Hikari and Teko join. The pair have such contrasting personalities that i do question whether they were true siblings when i first met them.Of the two the sister Ai is hot blooded and spirited and kind to her juniors while hard and violent to her brother. In the show she serves as the comic relief when she hits her brother. Interestingly enough though is that she actually has a softer side when she's exposed to issues of romance.The brother is called Makoto which is guess is a unisex name and his personality is completely different to his sister. Makoto unlike her sister is not aggressive and is actually more calm and level headed of the pair.The siblings role in the story in addition to providing comic relief also serveto advice Teko and Pikari on matters related to diving.Mato sensei serves as the homeroom teacher for Teko and Hikari and alsoserves as the adviser for the dive club. Personality wise Mato sensei is earnest and strict but honest and doesn't hide the fact that she loves to dive. She also serves to stop Hikari and Teko from making any funny moves by providing rational advice.The art and animation for the series i felt was well done and the environments especially the underwater ones were beautiful. The art for the cat and the kittens though was also pretty good and both looked pretty cute. Character designs i felt were pretty detailed and functioned asexpected.The music for the show was well done and i felt appropriate for all scenes. The opening and ending themes i felt were actually pretty good and easily set the mood.This show i felt had some strong voice acting on the part of the main cast especially Ai Kayano'sportrayal of Teko and Eri Suzuki's portrayal of Hikari. The Ninomiya siblings were also pretty good especially the sister who was portrayed by Saori Onishi of Ultimate Otaku teacher fame.Overall this was a really good anime that had a great story, setting and excellent characters and voice acting and a interesting subject as diving is not a subject often encountered in anime. is quiet, timid and indecisive and as a result she has great difficulty in making friends. This is a problem that has plagued her since her primary school days. As a result she gets scared rather easily and as a result is reluctant to try anything new. At the start of the series the first friend that she makes is with Hikari.As someone that shares some of her personality traits i know too wellwhat she is going through in the series. And im glad that she is able to makenew friends and find a purpose.As the series progresses however her interactions and friendships with Hikari and the support cast and her introduction to the diving club allows her to experience many new things. These include normal events like hanging out with friends, swimsuit shopping and more importantly introduces her to the world of diving.  Through this Teko is able to slowly break out of her shell and make new friends and more importantly start to enjoy her school life.The character of Teko is voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano who is one of my favorite  seiyuu's and i think she managed to portray Teko's character pretty well.Hikari who is nicknamed Pikari by Teko and others is the other main character on the show. Hikari has a rather free spirited personality and certainly absent minded but surprisingly she can offer some really good advice at times. Hikari is also very energetic and already has a interest in diving before meeting Futaba so she helps Teko along in this.In the story Hikari serves as both the second main character and also the first friend that Teko makes in the new school. In the story Hikari introduces Teko to the world of diving and provides a lot of support to her as she is trained by the other members of the club.One aspect of Hikari that i liked was her facial expressions and faces that she makes from time to time. This i felt was for comic relief and i found them to be quite funny.The central aspect of the show apart from diving is the bond that Teko and Hikari forge as they develop their friendship. In that i believe that it was successful as Teko can rely on Hikari for support, advice and speak to her about any problems that she has.The Ninomiya siblings are upperclassman in the school that are also partof the dive club that Hikari and Teko join. The pair have such contrasting personalities that i do question whether they were true siblings when i first met them.Of the two the sister Ai is hot blooded and spirited and kind to her juniors while hard and violent to her brother. In the show she serves as the comic relief when she hits her brother. Interestingly enough though is that she actually has a softer side when she's exposed to issues of romance.The brother is called Makoto which is guess is a unisex name and his personality is completely different to his sister. Makoto unlike her sister is not aggressive and is actually more calm and level headed of the pair.The siblings role in the story in addition to providing comic relief also serveto advice Teko and Pikari on matters related to diving.Mato sensei serves as the homeroom teacher for Teko and Hikari and alsoserves as the adviser for the dive club. Personality wise Mato sensei is earnest and strict but honest and doesn't hide the fact that she loves to dive. She also serves to stop Hikari and Teko from making any funny moves by providing rational advice.The art and animation for the series i felt was well done and the environments especially the underwater ones were beautiful. The art for the cat and the kittens though was also pretty good and both looked pretty cute. Character designs i felt were pretty detailed and functioned asexpected.The music for the show was well done and i felt appropriate for all scenes. The opening and ending themes i felt were actually pretty good and easily set the mood.This show i felt had some strong voice acting on the part of the main cast especially Ai Kayano'sportrayal of Teko and Eri Suzuki's portrayal of Hikari.

Ai Ninomiya voiced by Saori Oohishi, a senior member of the Diving club and a hot-tempered eccentric student and her brother Makoto voiced by Yuuichirou Umehara as well as LA\'s favourite character in the anime of being the Diving Club\'s advisor Mato Katori...why?...well LA will talk about that in the animation section.Where Amanchu\'s strengths comes from the diving as well as it\'s character chemistry which lurks upon yuri undertones a la friendship substitute with Pikari and Teko, nonetheless Amanchu\'s strengths are slightly unbalanced with these two elements, because of Teko\'s obstacle to become a full fledged diver the majority of the time Teko and the gang are outside the ocean, but that is where the character chemistry works into this. For a slice of life anime, the majority of the cast is easily likable and easy to get invested in, even when they are really doing nothing but goofing off. But for character chemistry for what a small cast it has, for a comedic standpoint Mato and Makoto are essentially the tsukommi in most of the skits with Ai and Pikari easily being the boke. Teko at best is either the spectator or boke at times, because of this, the characters really bounce off one another as they are easily. In terms of character development the newer senior characters of Ai and Makoto gets their own episodes so we get to know more about them, as for Teko, her own grips with shyness, memories and youth comes into detail for her with Pikari opened her up to this and in terms of relationship between the two, it actually ok to see this kind of character relationship dynamic of the shy character paired with the genki one, for as much character and theme focus we do get in Amanchu, they do pretty well on this front. The diving strengths comes mostly from the animation and even though the animation and the Amanchu anime itself won\'t get LA to do diving, the animation is a HUGE highlight in Amanchu.The plot of Amanchu does tend to go more into the friendships between these characters than the actual diving, sure the diving moments are relaxing on their own, but LA can kinda see why they put the diving element in the backburner in terms of plot.....Teko couldn\'t swim and that kinda takes a while to learn, so they put more of the friendship and youth themes as compensation for it and even the themes aren\'t as ""in your face"" attitude thus isn\'t as annoying in that department either and really, LA can\'t fault Amanchu! for that, however the little flaw LA came into this was that LA thought this was a slice of life DIVING anime and it was touted as one, there\'s very little in the characters ACTUALLY doing it (unless the technical features in diving count but still).In terms of animation, the animation is absolutely gorgeous from it\'s beautiful backgrounds especially the ""diving"" sections but as well as the rather detailed character designs, except for the comedic moments where the character\'s facial animation goes full chibi emoticons and really because of this was why LA loved Mato Katori\'s reaction expressions especially (￣Δ￣∥) whenever Pikari did something odd. As for the rest of character favourite emoticons...Teko - (〇o〇；)Pikari - (⊙ᗜ⊙)Ai - (◯ω◯)If anything the emoticons just brings out when it wants to be comedic in it\'s more relaxing times throughout the anime. Sure you can bring up the fact that these *ahem* muppet chibi faces can distract you or just be awkward in some beautiful scenes it brings you into and LA even felt that, but as a stylistic choice as derpy as the faces were, the REACTION based on the other characters namely Mato\'s reactions quickly change that to comedic moments.There are some flaws LA did notice for Amanchu, as much as LA is praising Amanchu, they had some problems, LA already said about the plot majority focus on characters instead of diving as well as some of the animation, but LA will pretty much dive *drum beat* into both of these flaws in a better detail. LA KNOWS that Pikari can be rather annoying due to her hyper eccentricities and even the anime and Pikari herself knows this and yes even she got a bit grating on LA especially on the ""whimsical"" side of things and her ""derpy muppet"" facial animation doesn\'t help that either. On speaking of which, the animation along with it\'s derpy chibi faces can be a mood whiplash from the more sombre moments to be going straight into those faces can break that. Finally yeah, the majority of the anime being focused on the characters instead of the diving can be VERY boring to those who just want to see the diving. But these flaws can be defended with the above statements LA said about these flaws, LA KNOWS about these flaws but can also defend it at the same time.In terms of voice acting, LA at first thought that Ai Kayano as Teko was rather grating with her shyness, but she quickly got better and became ONE of LA\'s favourite voice actors in this anime. Pikari\'s voice actor Eri Suzuki can get very grating with her ""WHOOP WHOOP"" noises to her eccentricities in general and for LA, she was ""just ok"". Ai\'s voice actor Saori Oohishi was the ""right kind of genki"" than what Eri Suzuki did and Makoto\'s voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara probably had the least screentime thus not much to talk about him. LA\'s favourite voice actor?...Shizuka Ito as Mato Katori as the straight man to Pikari and Ai, Ai Kayano comes in as a close second.Amanchu\'s final episode FINALLY gets to the diving and really the payoff of 9 episodes was worth it with it\'s beautiful ocean animation and scenery to a catharsis of seeing such ""wonders"" Teko and the rest of the gang sees and we get to see Teko\'s resolution to open herself up to everyone and break away completely from her shy side. The themes of friendship, youth and memories also go full circle by this ending. The ending was a great payoff by building upon the easily investable and likable characters who development themselves and their relationships with one another as the compensation to it (if you ""can"" see it).Amanchu is just another great slice of life anime of 2016 AND done by JC Staff, and just as much as there are some great strengths of Amanchu as well as it\'s flaws that can either cripple the experience or bore you, LA just can\'t hold any anger from its flaws to Amanchu as it ticked all the boxes for a great cathartic anime and the payoff for the ending was SOOOO worth waiting for. of the shy Futuba ""Teko"" Ooki voiced by Ai Kayano and centres around Teko opening up to everyone with Pikari helping her and subtley showing the messages of youth, friendship and memories.

There are a ton of slice of life shows out there and many of them fail to differentiate themselves from the rest. However despite this huge obstacle, Amanchu does successfully manage to differentiate itself from most by being something simple yet beautiful.Amanchu takes place in a rural town that is close to the ocean where the main character, Teko (Ooki Futaba) has recently moved to. Very soon after, she meets a strange girl, Pikari (Kohinata Hikari), who gets her to join the scuba diving club at school. From there, more characters are introduced (who are...associated the scuba diving club) and we follow the events that happen in these character's lives as Teko learns more and more about scuba diving.Like almost all slice of lifes, Amanchu doesn't really have a plot, instead each episode shows the events that happen in these character's lives. The events that happen in this series are rather simple such as finding a home for a stray cat or playing a game of red light-green light. However, one of the reasons why Amanchu is so great is because it manages to transform those simple events into something beautiful. The series does this through a combination of different factors, one big factor are the conversations between characters and/or thoughts of characters. Through these dialogues and monologues we get to see why each of these simple events hold a much deeper meaning than what it appears to be on the surface. Another factor is the calm and relaxing atmosphere the series manages to create through the characters and their relationships,  production values and the light hearted comedic moments that are sprinkled in. Those comedic moments rarely feel out of place and many are funny (although that differs for everyone).Another great aspect about Amanchu are it's characters as hearing their thoughts and conversations during each event allows us to see how each character views things which teaches us a lot about them. The character that sticks out the most is Teko, who is gentle, shy and withdrawn, but that's just the surface, her character actually has a lot of depth to it. As the series goes on we get to see many different aspects of her personality. Also as the show goes on we get to see Teko come out of her shell more and more. The catalyst for the majority of Teko's development is Pikari. Pikari's personality is opposite that of Teko's, she's very energetic, a bit out there and always wants to try new things and have fun. Although we don't learn as much about her as Teko, we still do learn a fair amount about her character and she is also the main reason to why Teko tries new things. They compliment each other very well and one of the best parts of Amanchu is the friendship between Teko and Pikari. This friendship is what drives a lot of the events and enables Teko to develop as a character. The other characters (the Ninomiya siblings, Katori-sensei) also play a role. We may not get to learn much about their personality beyond what's on the surface but they do get their time in the spotlight so we do get to learn a bit about each of them and how they see things.The production values are also top notch. The visuals themselves can be pretty beautiful at times, some of the scenes in the events that happen just look amazing. The characters are also very detailed. The backgrounds, while they don't look spectacular typically, aren't badly drawn either.The sound is also pretty good itself. For a series that leans on it's atmosphere as much as this one, the sound is very important for setting the correct mood. A lot of the time the music that plays in the background is very light , not overly complicated and does a good job at complimenting the mood of the event taking place. However there are some times when the music in the background is really captivating and becomes a major reason to why some scenes are mesmerizing. The VAs also do a good job voicing the character they play. The OP and ED also don't seem out of place and fit this anime very nicely.In terms of enjoyment, Amanchu isn't a series that everyone would enjoy. It's a slice of life which is not everyone's cup of tea and on top of that, it also moves very slowly. However if you don't mind those things then this show is something you will enjoy and can absolutely captivate you with it's moments of beauty and calm and relaxing atmosphere.In a sea of slife of life shows, Amanchu manages to stick out more than most because of what it manages to do. It sets up a great atmosphere, has great characters and manages to turn most of it's simple events into something beautiful.

It definitely is a series I will remember for a long time."", 'Amanchu!Art/Characters: The art style of this show is quite nice to look at, and some of the scenes are so beautiful and so all-encompassing that it really makes one feel special. The look of the water and the and the style of each of the characters really make the show come to life. Each character has their own unique look to them (save for the twins) and have a unique personality. The one downside to this would be the faces that the characters occasionally make. For example, Pikari, when she gets really excited she goes extremely simple and kind of ridiculous and has a completely...different look on her face. I really was not a fan of this. It was funny the first few times, but after the episodes continued, and the episodes had this other face on Pikari, Futaba, and sometimes even Ai, the joke just gets old. As for the characters individually, I really love Pikari’s optimism. It isn’t like an overly bubbly and generic happiness, but it is legit optimism. Not very many times have I seen a character that is able to embody true optimism without seeming artificial. As for Futaba, she is almost the exact opposite, pessimistic with the best, but she balances out Pikari and makes things seem real. Having a character like Futaba, that plays off of the strengths of the other main, makes this show very watchable.Sound/Music: The music isn’t something that I can get very excited about in this show and that really disappointing to me. While yes there are plenty of songs in the background and in the opening and closing animations, nothing really stuck out as being fantastic. There was occasionally a song the exemplified wonder and excitement, but it would quickly dissipate and it goes back to the generic background music that is repetitive and easy to forget. The sounds in the background could have been a lot better. I want to feel like i am underwater when I am with the characters underwater, but the sound is not quite what you are expecting and it just doesn’t deliver that rush that I know the characters are feeling.Story: This story surrounds two students out on the coast of Japan, Pikari, a high school first year who loves to dive out in the open ocean and spend time with her grandmother. And on the opposite side we have Futaba, a nervous girl also starting high-school but she just moved to the coast from Tokyo and is feeling extremely out of her element. The two become fast friends and before they know it, Pikari has convinced Futaba to go into the diving club’s club room and use their diving equipment so that Futaba can experience the thing that Pikari loves so much, even if it’s only diving in a swimming pool. The show explores the incredible feat that is open water diving and the amazing things that one can see, but it also explores the nature of friendship and how moving to a new place can be scary and nerve-wracking; but that can all disappear with just one person’s kindness.Personal Reflection: This show made me feel a lot of things over the summer, and I am glad it was over the summer that this came out because it gave me the opportunity to explore those urges I got to dive, in a way. While I wasn’t able to go open water diving, I got to experience something like it with this show. It gave me an interest that I have never had before, and who knows when it will happen again. When I watched Sword Art Online, something similar happened with MMORPGs, but that was a long time ago. Amanchu! may have had some hiccups and maybe it wasn’t the best when it came to music, and hey, so what if they used Pikari’s overly excited face as a way to say “HEY this part is a funny part”. The show made me feel warm and fuzzy, and made me want to jump into the lake I was living on and explore the depths that were just outside my door. The parts when Pikari’s face changed got pretty annoying, but only because I was so much more invested in the show when she was being serious. The faces made it seem really forced and it took me out of the world that they were in. If I could make a suggestion it would be to hold back when it comes to that sort of thing because it feel artifical, but when there is a real person (real in this context meaning not drawn awkwardly) laughing and showing excitement, it makes me want to get excited too, rather than just feel awkward. This is a show about two people becoming best friends and sharing a love for the ocean. If you love the ocean, love friendship, or just want a great story about someone overcoming their fears, check out Amanchu!Overall Score: 7.5/10 different look on her face.

Also English is not my native tongue so there will be some grammatical mistakes I think.Why I want to Review this Anime ?The reason I want to review this Anime in particular is that I think, it is one of the more overlooked Anime of this season. For a reference you can just look at the amount of Members it has compared to other shows. This and my second reason ( which you will find later on in my review) are what leads me...to write a review.Story:As most iyashikei(healing) slice of Life Anime the story is not the main focus of the show.There are no major twists or complicated Plot-Lines. Still there is a definitiv end goal for the show, for which most of the episodes build up to.The story takes place in a real-world setting and plays in a coast village in Japan. The majority of the story revolves around scuba diving, in particular the diving club of the Yumegaoka high school.Which leads us to.....Characters:In the show there are 5 major characters to consider. Of which there are our 2 main female leads and 3 more important side characters. The charakters are basically the ""meat"" of the story and should be one of the biggest selling points of the show.Starting of with:Hikari ""Pikari"" Kohinata:She lives near the ocean with her grandmother and helps her from time to time in her small diving club as a guide. She is already an experienced diver since she grew up near the ocean and always loved it. Besides that she graduated middle-school and has entered the local high school. Here she meets our second lead character Fuutaba Ooki, which she later just refers to as Teko. She instantly likes her and tries to become friends with her. This suits her character quite well, because she has a really outgoing personality which can be quite overwhelming for others sometimes. At the start of the series she is the main driving force of story progression. She is also kind and one of the most cheerful and upbeat personalities I have seen recently. Still, she is also a goofball in most situation and often has some childlike behavior.Fuutaba ""Teko"" Ooki:At the beginning of the story she just moved into town after she transferred to the local high school.Because of that she is scared at first of the new enviroment and what will happen to her. She is also sad that all of her former friends enrolled in a different high school than her. When she first meets Pikari she is quite reserved, because of her shy and timid nature.She is also easy to dishearten, but still hates to lose to others.However with the help of Pikari she starts to warm up on her new enviroment and tries everything to go one day scuba diving with Pikari as her ""buddy"". Without spoiling anything at this point I can say that Teko is the character with the most development and my favorite charakcer of the show.The Teacher and the Twins:The 3 main side characters of this show I don\'t want to spoil about. So I will only say about them that their role is mainly for some comedic relief and some mature guidance. However they are also shown as caring and kind hearted people.Overall the characters and their characteristics and quirks are nothing that is new or exciting. However they are done quite well for what they are and their interactions feel genuine and not forced. Besides that each of the 5 has enough screentime to shine. Also they don\'t fall out of character and the development of the group has a good pacing.All those things lift the cast of this above the average.Sound:The OP is one of the highlights of the show. It captures perfectly the feeling of the Anime and tells you right from the start if you will like the show or not. The serene voice of the singing made me never skip the OP. The ED is although not as good as the Opening still enjoyable. The overall soundtrack of the show is best described as fitting. Like the Opening it gives the show a harmonic atmosphere and improves the show in that way.Art/Animation:The second big selling point goes to its art. As a typical feed of iyashikei Anime the backgrounds are mostly drawn with lighter colors compared to for example action Anime. The art especially shines here in still shots of some beautiful nature or the scenes which play in bodies of water.The character models are compared to that rather generic, but still not bad.OK at this point I try to tackle the elephant in the room. I know many people will be turned off by the sometimes goofy looking facial Animation. For me personally it wasn\'t that big of an issue, but I understand that some people may not like them and the overabundance on them.Reommendations:I recommend this Anime to people that like:charming character interactionssome beautiful artworkscuba diving (obviously :P)a relaxing atmosphereall people that like iyashikei/Slice of Life Anime (especially Aria)I would not recommend this Anime to people that:dislike some goofy expressionsare more interested in a Plot-heavy storydon\'t like Slice of Lifes in generalConclusion:""Good Anime but has not enough water."" -6/10 IGN.Jokes aside for me it\'s the perfect Anime after a stressful day at work. It is no masterpiece and no Aria, however it is definitely another great entry in the list of Slice of Life Animes and I enjoyed every second of it. Which is my second reason that I wanted to review this show, because it is fun and I like to share fun.So:FUN For ALL and ALL for FUN to write a review.Story:As most iyashikei(healing) slice of Life Anime the story is not the main focus of the show.There are no major twists or complicated Plot-Lines.

Which is my second reason that I wanted to review this show, because it is fun and I like to share fun.So:FUN For ALL and ALL for FUN', 'New experiences are both great and terrifying.  They\'re a chance to go out of one\'s comfort zone, but at the same time, throw people into situations that they would otherwise see as dangerous or unfamiliar, and would therefore avoid them.  Some people like new experiences and cherish the ability to expand their horizons whilst others prefer to stay with what\'s comfortable with them without venturing out into the unknown to see what\'s known.  And so we have Amanchu, a story adapted from the original manga from Amano Kozue, telling the story of a girl in a town filled with new things to...explore.Story: Ooki Futaba transfers to the port town due to her parents\' work and is brought to a place where she had to leave behind all of her friends and precious memories that she holds dearly.  Now in this new place, without knowing anyone, she is introduced to Kohinata Hikari, or Pikari as she\'s nicknamed in the show and is tugged along to the scary but beautiful adventure of scuba diving, sparking her new high school life and the journey out of the shell that she had previously enclosed herself in.As expected from a story made by Amano Kozue, the general premise of Amanchu is simple, yet deep with subtle nuances of a deeper meaning.  On the outside, Amanchu looks like any other slice of life high school series with a gimmick or something \'unique\' about it in order to make it seem even remotely interesting to the audience, but in truth, the story follows Futaba\'s exploration with this newfound interest that she develops and her willingness to explore new things and get out there rather than hold onto the familiar.  As a result, the story has a really gentle but clear progression from episode to episode that ultimately creates a smooth and delightful end that can only be described as pleasant and fulfilling.The story is written in such a way that if you enjoy these kinds of things, than you\'ll like or REALLY like this show, but if you prefer something with more oomph, you will not find that here.  Things are taken slow and to many, that may seem like a downside.  Slow isn\'t bad, but Kozue\'s works tend to do this extremely often, so it\'s really more of a like it/hate it scenario.In the end, what is Amanchu?  Amanchu is a slow and calm show that details the journey of someone in a new place and struggling to learn and adapt to what is around them, ultimately becoming a different person that had grown out of their shell and blossomed into someone that has found true joy in the world.  It\'s a character-based show that doesn\'t have a complicated plot and uses that free run time to build upon its characters and really hammer in the kind of positivity, appreciation, and good feelings that Kozue\'s works deliver.  While it wasn\'t perfect, especially with its rather slow start, Amanchu picked itself up in its second half and gave us some good storytelling.Overview:+  Good plot without feeling meticulous+/- A bit too gentle at times-  Slow first halfCharacters:  As with all slice of life shows, characters are key in order to make the show interesting and draw in people to watch since the plot is for the most part, simplistic and generally uninteresting.First is Ooki Futaba, or Teko as she\'s called in the series, and our main protagonist.  As mentioned before, Teko is a girl who moves to this new town and is unfamiliar with what is around her.  Initially a loner character who looks over her phone with longing desire, she eventually becomes the show\'s best character and the true definition of the show\'s themes as you gradually see her progress through every episode with gradual change that many shows could only dream of when creating any form of character development.  Her story is for the most part completely fleshed out from her backstory to what she does in the series to improve as a person, taking up the majority of the runtime as a result.Then there\'s Kohinata Hikari, or Pikari, as she\'s referred to.  Pikari is the penultimate definition of ""Happy"".  Her character is the classic happy and cheerful girl who likes to explore new things and blow on the whistle she keeps around her neck to express just how joyful and full of energy she has.  She is for the most part the reason why Teko has her character development, as Pikari is the one who brings Teko into the world of diving and introduces her to her way of life and constant thirst for enjoyment and new things.  All that said and done, Pikari is...lacking.  As a character, we get how Pikari is and the kinds of things she does, but we never really learn about Pikari herself as a character.  There\'s a tiny blurb at the end of the series giving some detail, but aside from that...we really don\'t get much of an understanding of her which is really a shame because she\'s the catalyst and the reason why this series exists, and it\'s so disappointing knowing that the reason for everything in Amanchu gets shafted most of the time.The rest of the cast are side characters that participate in the series, but not really all that much.  They\'re part of the collective of \'we seem important but if you think about it, you don\'t really know much about us\', and as a result, they\'re background characters that when you really think about it, don\'t have much actual personality to them.  The twins and their diving advisor are the biggest victims of this because they\'re constantly in the series, but aside from a few little facts, we don\'t actually get much information about them as characters, probably due to the fact that Teko takes up most of that character time, which is a shame because I do want to know about Makoto.  He\'s a nice guy.Overview:+  Great main character with fantastic development-  Other main character gets shafted in those details-  Side characters don\'t get anything aside maybe a few little detailsArt: Produced by J.C. Staff, Amanchu is...well...average.  J.C. Staff has a habit of only putting effort into a show that they think will actually be profitable (like Shokugeki), and gives the rest of their projects the butt end of the stick with meh animation.  As a result, the art of this series doesn\'t particularly look all that great.  While they did draw the series in Kozue\'s unique style (consisting of long, form-fitting skirts, a rustic, wide-eyed look to characters\' faces, comedic \'second faces\', and an odd way of drawing cats), the actual quality of the art is less than what I expected.  The show appears like it was made in the early 2000\'s and doesn\'t have the quality that I would\'ve liked to have for the series.In addition, the color scheme of the show is muted and rather drab.  Nothing about it really stands out and I really didn\'t see much of the show looking fantastic or stellar in any way.  Which really is a shame because they\'re the people that made both Flying Witch and Sakurasou, both of which are shows that have really good animation.Overview:+ Kept the original artstyle-  Animation and color are less than average qualitySound:  On the flipside, Amanchu has a really nice soundtrack.  Complete with the gentle and flowing tones of the piano, everything from Amanchu\'s OP to its BGM, and even its cheerful ED are all nice and well-made pieces that fit with the show.  In particular, I\'d say that the OP ""Million Clouds"" is by far the best piece of music from this series.Personal Enjoyment: I\'ve like Kozue Amano\'s works.  The entire Aria series (which is probably the only aside from this series) is among one of my favorite series and I was really excited when Amanchu was announced because I got to basically see what I referred to as ""Aria 2.0"" for another season of anime.  Coming out of it...there were things I loved, things I hated, but overall, I still like this show.Did I like this series?Yes, yes I did.  I think the message and the overall plot was well constructed and is the central reason why I like this show.  It\'s a nice and gentle series with a deeper meaning that makes the entire experience just that much more satisfying to watch.  The gradual character development, the characters themselves, and even the cheeky little Aria references that\'re sprinkled in every now and then.  (The number of names you have for cats are VERY limited, Kozue-sensei.)What didn\'t I like about this series?Every character except Teko didn\'t get the character development they deserved, and the overall art quality of the series both really irritate me.  Admittedly, the better art wouldn\'t have fixed the story problems since that\'s more on the way the story goes, but at the very least put more effort into your shows, J.C.  I swear only 15% of their projects actually have decent animation.Would I recommend this series?If you\'re a slice of life lover like me or you want to watch a calm or meaningful story, than Amanchu is for you.  Despite its problems, the show has quite a number of good qualities that make it worth the while to watch.  I wouldn\'t say it\'s as good as Aria, especially since Aria itself has 4 cours of material compared to Amanchu\'s 1 cour, but it does have merit to it that really is worth watching. explore.Story: Ooki Futaba transfers to the port town due to her parents\' work and is brought to a place where she had to leave behind all of her friends and precious memories that she holds dearly.

But it\'s all right. Look up and see. There\'s an endless world of fun starin\' ya right in the face."" -Kohinata Kino(SPOILERS BELOW NOT REALLY MAJOR THO BC IT\'S SOL)It only took 7 minutes for me to realize I was going to love Amanchu!, these 7 minutes gave one of the strongest first impressions I\'ve seen in a long time for sure. The relaxing, nostalgic background music, the quiet humming of a motorcycle and the gorgeous background art assured...that I was already relaxed and taking in that lovely healing SOL effect only 30 seconds in. But seeing the grandma smoking a cigarette was what really let me know I was in for a treat.After the opening played (I\'ll touch on that later don\'t you worry now) a clumsy, shy girl rides up to the cliff by the ocean, right near a diving shop. Despite the fact that she\'s surrounded by natural beauty she\'s glued to her phone. While this shy girl (Futaba or Teko) sits on a rock there is another girl diving in the ocean below, diving. A girl who we will later learn is named Hikari (or her nickname Pikari). I love this detail because it establishes an immediate connection between these two without them even being aware of it, but it isn\'t just that. This scene creates a very important Dichotomy between Teko and Pikari: Pikari has a smile on her face because she is experiencing the world around her and doing something she loves, while Teko is glued to her phone and isn\'t smiling, she has closed herself off. And that is what Amanchu! is to me: a story about a girl who has closed herself off from the world due to being too timid, and her journey to escape that and learn to put herself out there and try new things.It is while Teko is on this rock by the sea that a giant wave splashes, startling her, and forcing her to look up and pay attention to her surroundings. She was in awe of how amazing the ocean was, the ocean that she had previously been ignoring and taking for granted. And it is during this scene where grandma Kohinata imparts the words from the beginning of this review.Story - 7It is difficult to put a score on a sol story as the enjoyment of the series rarely relies on the narrative. However in this case (and there are several others similar) the story is what drives it. The story is quite simply about Pikari dragging Teko out of her shell and Teko learning to pursue interests and interact with the world she lives in. It\'s about personal growth and the sort of symbolic goal of Teko eventually diving in the ocean that filled her with such awe at the beginning of the series, but only if she is with Pikari, a friend that she will come to treasure more than anything. Teko has to overcome her shyness and learn how to dive (which also involves learning to swim). Despite the fact that it is goal driven and there is certainly a story present, Amanchu is still primarily SOL, episodic, relaxing greatness and it delivers on that every single time, believe me.Art - 9HNNNNNNNG the art in this series is amazing,  in particular the character designs, they are detailed and unique and I just love them. The background art and the ocean look amazing too. I\'m not really an art critic but I think that amanchu nailed it, and unlike a certain show this season it didn\'t fall off in the art department. *COUGH COUGH ORANGESound - 8The soundtrack in Amanchu! is very relaxing and serves its purpose well in an iyashikei. I wouldn\'t bump the OST, but as background noise for the series it works miracles.The opening tho fam, the song gave me chills. It\'s soft and quiet and beautiful and then it picks up very suddenly. I really liked it it was far and away my favorite opening this season, and probably my favorite 2016 op. The ending was nice as well, no complaints.Characters - 8I really liked all of the characters, while many may complain about Pikari being annoying I think she is the perfect compliment to Teko, the complete opposite. Pikari being loud, enthusiastic and stubborn was the only way to pull Teko out of her shell effectively and they work together perfectly. Teko\'s development was really nice as well, watching her become less shy and more passionate was so satisfying. The twins (Ai and Makoto) entered later in the series and I liked them as well. Ai was insane and funny but she also served as a rolemodel for Teko and Pikari to look up to as she was older and more experienced. All of the characters just paired so well and all helped Teko\'s growth as a character.Enjoyment - 9I\'m a fucking sol fag ok I loved every second. It\'s extremely chill and relaxing with some occasional comedy mixed in.Overall - 8My personal aots spring 2k16, it was great. that I was already relaxed and taking in that lovely healing SOL effect only 30 seconds in. But seeing the grandma smoking a cigarette was what really let me know I was in for a treat.After the opening played (I\'ll touch on that later don\'t you worry now) a clumsy, shy girl rides up to the cliff by the ocean, right near a diving shop.

Despite the fact that it is goal driven and there is certainly a story present, Amanchu is still primarily SOL, episodic, relaxing greatness and it delivers on that every single time, believe me.Art - 9HNNNNNNNG the art in this series is amazing,  in particular the character designs, they are detailed and unique and I just love them. The background art and the ocean look amazing too. I\'m not really an art critic but I think that amanchu nailed it, and unlike a certain show this season it didn\'t fall off in the art department. *COUGH COUGH ORANGESound - 8The soundtrack in Amanchu! is very relaxing and serves its purpose well in an iyashikei. I wouldn\'t bump the OST, but as background noise for the series it works miracles.The opening tho fam, the song gave me chills. It\'s soft and quiet and beautiful and then it picks up very suddenly. I really liked it it was far and away my favorite opening this season, and probably my favorite 2016 op. The ending was nice as well, no complaints.Characters - 8I really liked all of the characters, while many may complain about Pikari being annoying I think she is the perfect compliment to Teko, the complete opposite. Pikari being loud, enthusiastic and stubborn was the only way to pull Teko out of her shell effectively and they work together perfectly. Teko\'s development was really nice as well, watching her become less shy and more passionate was so satisfying. The twins (Ai and Makoto) entered later in the series and I liked them as well. Ai was insane and funny but she also served as a rolemodel for Teko and Pikari to look up to as she was older and more experienced. All of the characters just paired so well and all helped Teko\'s growth as a character.Enjoyment - 9I\'m a fucking sol fag ok I loved every second. It\'s extremely chill and relaxing with some occasional comedy mixed in.Overall - 8My personal aots spring 2k16, it was great.', 'Looking for an anime about a group of girls (and one boy) going through school and club life with cartoonish facial expressions tossed in and a pinch of yuri subtext?  This one is for you.  Looking for anime about scuba-diving, along with all its splendor and trials?  You may want to look elsewhere.Amanchu is a very laid back and easygoing show.  The series will really show off it\'s well detailed scenery along with soft music to really set a relaxing atmosphere.  The story focuses on protagonist Futaba Ooki and her companion Hikari Koihinata, along with their sempai a pair of...twin siblings and their homeroom teacher/club advisor.  Each episode contains it\'s own story, even two sometimes, not building an overlying plot in the background.  Yep, it\'s really just the cast going through high school, and learning important life lessons over time.  Futaba herself is adjusting to moving to a new area and adjusting to going to new school and new people after leaving her old home and the friends she made in her previous school behind.Through Hikari\'s persuasiveness and pushiness, Futaba decides to join the scuba-diving club.  In the beginning episodes, the viewer is gradual introduced to the know how and basic info about the gear involved, the buddy system, getting a license, and measuring your air volume by depth and pressure of the water.   You\'d think it would continually keep expanding this, but it doesn\'t.  Why?  Because Futaba can\'t swim.  Around halfway in, Futaba couldn\'t pass her pool course exam because the club advisor, along with the viewer just found out about this very key detail.  Most of the second half is dedicated to more slice of life episodes with the characters just doing things with Futaba learning how to swim mostly offscreen.And the shift is especially egregious with how out of focus the scuba-diving becomes afterwards, especially due to how it just cuts off.  Even in the first half, Futaba wasn\'t learning about diving every episode.  She really only starts in episode 3 when she first signs up with Hikari, and it continues in the next episode, but episode 5 was dedicated to meeting their upperclassman.  And episode 6 is the face-palm moment when we learn she can\'t swim.  The club still gets together, but they aren\'t going to do any activities until she can swim, switching the focus around and changing POV to different characters, telling multiple stories.The main point of criticism is how this issue was never brought up before.  You\'d expect she reveal this fact the very first time she\'s expected to enter water.  Also, it should have been the first thing the advisor would check for before starting to teach her.  The advisor had the perfect opportunity to ask when she was drilling Futuba on diving basics when she and Hikari just applied to join, but didn\'t.  This was either something that wasn\'t planned in advance and added on the spot, or was planned for the sole attempt at really shallow and cheap humor.  On top of that, to make sure Futaba\'s first experience at diving is the finale, the episode before it was about taking care of a stray kitten, being after the one when she passed her pool exam.Ai Kayano did an excellent job voicing Futaba.  She conveyed the character\'s shyness and timidness really well.... to an annoying degree.  I give special mention to her role, because it really needed a specialized care in handling.Amanchu starts getting really preachy during the second half.  It was preachy before in the first half, but the second half is when it really goes all out.  There is no subtlety in it either; expect everything to be spelled out for you.  ""Don\'t be afraid to move out of your comfort zone"", ""How you view things is important; you can spin any negative into a positive"", ""Any setback can turn into an opportunity"", ""While school is important, the answers to life aren\'t in a textbook to be studied from"", ""It\'s okay to abuse your younger twin sibling""... wait, no, ignore that last one.  Each episode will take every chance it can get to hammer it\'s life lessons into your head.I was enjoying Amanchu at first, but got increasingly frustrated in the second half.  In the end, it became something I just wanted to finish.  The tone was really lighthearted, and the atmosphere was relaxing.  Still, my main problem was how the series executed it\'s themes very blatantly.  Someone would say something meaningful, and the target of it would be completely moved.  The problem was that it happened so frequently that the impact was lost fast, and it just became annoying the rest of the time.  Another point is that the cartoonish facial expressions were used entirely too often, often times killing the moment of important scenes.Also, I couldn\'t get invested in the characters (especially not Ai), due to there not being any overarching plot or stakes.  Both Futaba and Hikari are very hit-or-miss characters.  You\'ll either find them likeable or very annoying for different reasons.  Futaba takes her role as audience surrogate and main POV character to an extreme where we will know her thoughts about everything in painstaking detail.  Her shyness is ridiculously exaggerated; expect her to be embarrassed at the slightest thing and stammer a lot.  Oh, she\'ll also have many long-winded monologues that will sooner or later put you to sleep.   Hikari is the usual cheerful girl who can\'t stand still.  Expect her to make random noises most of the time either by mouth or whistle, and generally act like a little kid instead of a teenager. twin siblings and their homeroom teacher/club advisor.

From the team who made Aria comes another yashiki with water theme. This time it’s about diving.Our main character Futaba joins a high school on a seemingly distant region of Japan. At first she’s lost and sad because she had to move from big city and she lost all of her friends that she made. But then she meets funny energetic girl Hikari also known as Pikari and she discovers a brand new world of fun while also coming in terms with herself, her situation and her live outlook.It’s a fairly simple but quite enjoyable story. It presents lots of metaphors for anxiety...and loneliness while also being funny and happy. It is not all around pure and happy anime like Flying Witch for example. But arguably because of those sad moments, the happy ones shine much more.Characters are nothing special but once again they are very enjoyable. Pikari and her craziness, older sister Ai with her never-ending kicks and her younger brother Makoto who’s the victim of said kicks. Futaba is very relatable on pretty much all fronts. Her anxieties and her fears are something that most people encounter in their lifetime. As we see her overcome all of her weaknesses in return we also get to see her enter the exciting world of diving. Can’t forget Katori sensei/diving supervisor who functions as adult helping figure and is always there to help if needed.Production is fairly great. Yashiki’s soft animation pretty much never fails. Characters look good, talk good, walk good. The CGI is not overused and even if it’s noticeable when used on characters, it’s small use excuses that.Soundtrack is just like the show. Calming and relaxing. The opening has a fantastic song performed by Suzuki Eri, voice of Pikari.Overall it’s a highly enjoyable show if you like calm happy slice of life series with lots of cuteness and funny faces. It’s not dull happiness because the series presents negative moments as well.  I would definitely recommend watching this anime. Sadly however for me personally it doesn’t have much of a rewatch value. and loneliness while also being funny and happy. It is not all around pure and happy anime like Flying Witch for example.

Because in its own way it stands out. I first didn\'t know what to expect of this. Is it some kind of slow burning romance between girls, a summer romance, an adventure, a diving quest, ... Nope just a nice  summer story about a girl who finds herself in a new town and finding new friends and experiences along the way. Does is sound boring? Maybe at first? But the scenery,...the philosophical thinking and the journey of finding yourself and your path is something I didn\'t saw in a anime before. That was one of the reasons I just kept watching.The second reason is that it\'s such a chill anime, just relax and watch the story. It\'s something different than all of the action anime out there. Just relax... ;)Of course there was something that I didn\'t really liked at first. The art! Not the scenery! But the facial expressions. After awhile I was getting used to it, and it was more balanced further down the anime. But in the beginning I didn\'t really liked it sometimes. Oh yeah! The frustration was there! Because, come on! You\'ve got two beautiful main characters and their lovely friends. And I get that it was sometimes comical, but ugh, sometimes I want to see their expressions ""normally""!!! ><Overall, I\'m glad I found this rare piece this summer. When I just look at it, I just want one thing: please let it be summer soon again the philosophical thinking and the journey of finding yourself and your path is something I didn\'t saw in a anime before.

Spoilers ahead!)Our “diving” in the Jamaican waters was worse than we expected. The shanty was rusted and beat up. The snorkel masks we used looked like they hadn’t been washed in weeks. The spot chosen did not let us see anything interesting let alone memorable.Wanting only to get back on the cruise ship, we headed back its way. There, still sitting near the end of the dock, was the lady from before, continuing her chant as though it was her God-given destiny.“Watah one dolla’. Two bucks for da big one!” That’s all she said in her...thick, native accent. Over and over. That, and a “thank you” when she was given her money in exchange for the bottled water.I may have told this anecdote in the past, but it’s relevant to Amanchu!. Not just because of the diving but because of the situation. For, like Teko and Pikari, I choose to look at this one differently. I see it as a time where I tried something different and where I earned a quirky memory.In contrast, and thankfully, Amanchu provided nothing but joy.STORYAmanchu stars Futaba Ooki, aka Teko, a young lady who has just recently moved into town. As she dreads the new, unfamiliar world before her, Hikari Kohinata, aka Pikari, takes her by the hand, guiding her towards fun, the thrill of diving underwater, and an outlook on life that comes from the heart.While watching Amanchu, it’s almost impossible not to compare it with its sister series (provided one has seen said sister). Indeed, the anime in question is none other than the famous Aria anime. Known for its soothing atmosphere, the tranquil world of Neo Venezia, and those lovable, hilarious Undine.Keep in mind, this comparison does not only stem from the iyashikei (in English, “healing”) tone. For Amanchu goes out of its way to make such a connection more than obvious. The water-related premise. Nearly identical brands of comedy (silly faces, catch phrases). Erino Hazuki, the voice of Akari from Aria, voices Teko’s childhood friend (who has only a couple of speaking lines). Cha, the squat cat that lazily moves about the school, has a real name: Aria.The premise and the comedy are the biggest indicators, but, clearly, the anime has the Aria series in mind the whole time. This emulation (not replication since the anime is not an exact copy) results in two negatives.One, it prevents Amanchu from being what it wants to be. Appeasing the audience of Aria is a nice gesture, but when people describe the show as “like Aria but…,” its fundamental identity has been lost.Two, it does it to a fault. Since Amanchu wants to be similar, it pushes the comedy upfront a lot. Almost to the point that it drowns out the drama. Often, the anime follows a high-emotion scene with a funny one due to some misplaced sense of need rather than letting the emotions play out in full.However, the sisters diverge on a definitive point: character focus. Where Aria is mostly about the world it crafts and how the characters interact with it, Amanchu is mostly about the characters and how they interact with themselves.An important distinction seen through the content itself. Take Amanchu’s premise: diving. Besides the first couple of episodes, the final episode, and sparingly throughout the middle, it’s hardly focused on. Arguably, the anime choosing to (largely) ignore its own premise seems as though it were a foolhardy decision. But, in exchange, Amanchu emphasizes its cast. More monologues on their internal thoughts and feelings. Focus on what they do and like and perceive.Usually, the thoughts and the focus come from and go towards Teko. Whether it’s her appreciation of Pikari and all that Pikari has done for her or how she loves taking pictures on her phone, the anime makes it clear that this story is Teko’s.Along the way, Teko has many friends that give her simple yet heartwarming events. A street lined with cherry blossoms. A chalkboard chalk full of colorful pictures. A sincere treasure that holds more value than mere gold.Teko isn’t the only one treated this way, though. Pikari shows Mato a glimpse at some marigolds while on a moving train. Ai reminisces about her and her little brother Makoto’s time in the diving club through his saved items.The ocean and the diving may not play a huge, central role in the proceedings, but these two ideas tie into almost all of Amanchu’s (and therefore Teko’s) thoughts. The dark, murky water that gives way to a dazzling, clear blue. The buddy system and how the two partners fully support one another. The gentle invitation to try something different.Those events and these ideas culminate into one of the anime’s biggest themes. The ocean is a vast, unknown world all its own, hiding secrets for people to find, for people to seek out. That is, like the bottom of the ocean, there are new sights, new adventures, and new experiences worth discovering.One just needs the right mindset and a willingness to try.ANIMATIONAmanchu takes place mostly in an unassuming town and at a local school. Occasionally, it ventures elsewhere, like at a public pool or the mall. Regardless, the anime isn’t given much of an opportunity to show off any locations with extravagant detail. Lush greenery and blue waters are emphasized whenever possible, but, for the most part, it’s usually forgettable.However, Amanchu does not hold back with its scarce diving moments. Teko and Pikari floating in a pool filled with cherry blossoms or Teko looking up at the shining light as it dances across the ocean water gives these scenes the spectacle they deserve. Their contrast with the “duller” art makes them that much more powerful.One cannot not mention (a weird way to phrase that) the comedic artistry. More specifically, each character gets their own reaction face (more emulation of Aria) for situations in which the mood is lighthearted, silly, or otherwise funny. Teko gets swirly-scrawled eyes. Pikari’s pupils take up her entire eyeballs. Ai receives a monkey-like mouth that matchers her monkey diving cap. Combined with the squat figures and even rounder heads that they each morph into, these faces are a simple yet effective way for the anime to achieve its brand of comedy.They also help to mask the actual animation that goes on. In the beginning, Amanchu has a lot of movement. Teko’s eyes and hair move with fluidity, Pikari and Mato race against each other, and Ai kicks Makoto with undue force. Usually, when movement is restricted, the anime leans on the comedic faces since the reaction is more important than the movement. Of course, this isn’t always the case, like when Teko expertly dodges all of Ai’s slaps in their collective game of red-light-green-light. But it’s often the norm.Unfortunately, as the anime continues, it relies less and less on actual animation and more and more on the comedic faces. Not that it ever plummets to unacceptable levels, but much of it isn’t notable. Even its most important segment – Teko diving in the ocean for the first time – doesn’t include much in the way of actual diving. Arguably, it’s more about Teko being there and beholding the splendor of that new world, but, even so, the show doesn’t keep its animation levels anywhere but within an average range.Above anything else, though, the character designs shine. Pikari sometimes wearing a ponytail that takes the shape of a starfish when seen from the back. Ai’s unkempt twin-tails. Cha and Ohime having the same eyes as that of Pikari and Teko (respectively) when they enter comedy mode. The long, light-purple dresses the female students wear. The different casual outfits they don, and the diving suits they put on when, well, diving.But Teko’s design reigns supreme. Pikari describes Teko as a “beautiful mermaid” and rightly so. Her thin physique, flowing black hair (with a multitude of styles), and ocean-blue eyes complete with long eyelashes and those one-tenth eyebrows, give her a mature, charming design that carries her scenes with ease.CHARACTERSAs was said earlier, Amanchu is very much Teko’s story. Subsequently, the anime gives her a lot of time, exploring who she is, where she wants to go, and why she feels the way she does. Ultimately, Teko’s journey is more than satisfying.She starts off depressed. Saddened that she has been put into such an unfamiliar world. She’s afraid of what she may encounter and worried that she won’t have a place. All the while, she longs for her old life, her old friends. Wanting nothing more than to go back to where its comfortable. Fun. Familiar.In strolls Pikari, the girl with a whistle and a whoop. Pikari is the first to reach out to Teko, guiding her towards happiness. Not just in the literal sense when she leads her to their brand-new classroom. But also in the figurative sense when she talks with Teko and gives her that one-tenth nickname.The anime makes it immediately apparent how contrasting Teko and Pikari are. Especially with one of Pikari’s best moments in the whole show. Before they leave school on their first day, Pikari asks Teko which of their new books smells the best. Teko, quizzically, responds “Japanese?” To which Pikari agrees and smiles her big, beaming smile.This moment perfectly captures Pikari. She’s energetic, loves life, and does whatever she can to stay happy and, more importantly, bring happiness. In other words, Pikari is Teko’s foil. Teko’s quiet nature, negative thoughts, and general lack of enthusiasm form a dichotomy between the two, bringing with it the chance for Teko to grow through Pikari.And, expectedly, that’s what happens. Pikari gets Teko to break some rules and enter the diving-club room without permission, something she never would have done before. Pikari then alleviates her with that trip down the cherry blossoms. And she even motivates her enough to officially join the club (getting her to perform a demonstration of blowing out air from her ears).Teko slowly starts to open, trying new outlets and seeing life in a better light than she had when she first moved to this town. Her first true trial, though, comes with her first diving excursion (in the school’s pool). The water in her eyes and difficulty breathing scare her to the point that she just about gives up. But, thankfully, Pikari is there. Holding her hand, encouraging her on. Being the perfect buddy for her newfound friend.As Teko continues to adjust to her new world, she finds further comfort in diving. Their new clubmates – “Big-Sis Senpai” Ai and “Little-Bro Senpai” Makoto – are (always for the brother, usually for the sister) kind and inviting, giving Teko the goal she wants to now achieve: become an official Open Water Diver.Before she can get there, though, she must learn how to swim. And, when she can’t, she feels as though she’s bringing everybody around her down. But, and as she clearly states, she does not want to give up. Having found something that she herself wanted to take part in, she wants to see if the ocean contains something that her “insignificant self” does not. Her sincere gratitude towards Pikari, for everything she has done up to this point, is also not lost on Teko.While Mato gets some time in the spotlight, providing wisdom to the audience, and Makoto talks about his older sister, Amanchu puts Pikari at the center for a bit. To her, Teko is a mature, beautiful woman – who can sometimes, contrary to her usual self, act like a helpless doggy. She also notes how Teko hates to lose (from their school’s endurance exercises) and how learning about new sides to loved ones makes one want to love them that much more.Most importantly, Pikari imparts wisdom of her own. She tells Teko, “What matters is your approach and mindset! That “you don’t have to let things you don’t like get you down!”With these words in mind, Amanchu provides Teko with her greatest character moment in the following episode. Her phone fills up with pictures, preventing her from taking new ones until she moves the old ones away. She doesn’t want to, and so she reminisces about her old friends and the negative way in which she took her leave.Thankfully, and per usual, Pikari is there, giving Teko two amazing treasures. The first is the actual gift: the digital picture book. The second is the most important: reaffirmation of their friendship. Together, Teko realizes that she has been approaching it wrong the whole time. That the memories of her old life and the experiences in her new one are equally worth cherishing. As she best puts it “The places I cherish, and the places I love… Be it back then or right now, they only grow more and more beloved with time.”Thus, her mindset shifts permanently from that initial, overbearing sadness to appreciating her life and the newness within it. Yet, still, Teko goes through even more. Pikari teaches Teko that being at a loss is fine since “it’s a wonderful chance to have more fun” (and to “let’s-a-go” even more.) And, when the two save Ohime, the tiny kitty, Teko wants to do for the pet what Pikari has always done for her. That is, be there for her in her time of need.Come time for their first official ocean dive, Teko is the most excited. Her buddy check with Pikari goes swimmingly, but, as they prepare at the buoy to dive, Teko sees the fading light and the swathing darkness that engulfs it. She’s scared, but, when she sees the columns of bubbles from the other divers right below her (after losing her left fin), she becomes reinvigorated, wanting nothing more than to see the new world directly below her.Which she does. The various sea life, the rocky formations, the brilliant light that shines from above. This new world, something that she has never seen and could never see before, is one that she loves. In her own words, “I’m so, so glad I got to come here! See you soon.”She records in her diver’s diary what she saw on her first dive, and she passes the exam, becoming an official Open Water Diver. But, appropriately enough, it’s not quite the end, for Amanchu gives Teko and Pikari one last scene together.Pikari tries to put into words how thankful she is to Teko for going along with her and being her friend and loving everything that she loves. In return, Teko thanks Pikari for giving her “…so many new things to love,” a far cry away from who she was at the beginning of her tale. The final words from Teko ring out, she takes Pikari by the hand, and together they walk, awaiting the bright, amazing, and fun-filled future before them.And so, Teko’s tale concludes. Arguably, the twins, the teacher, and even Pikari (no matter how much of a foil she is) do not get a lot of attention and time thrown their way individually. A small blemish on the overall experience.But Teko’s small, gradual changes. Her transformation from a person scared of the unfamiliar to wanting to explore the new. The thoughtfulness backing it all. Everything comes together for Teko, creating in her a beautiful, heartfelt character journey that won’t be forgotten for a long, long time.SOUNDThe opening track of Amanchu is quite the calming piece. It starts off with soft, quiet singing and a host of dainty instrumental work that each refuse to overtake the listener but rather invite them in with a warm hug. The middle section picks up the tempo and the passion, coinciding with Teko’s own change over the course of the story. By the end, it reflects the beginning, letting the audience know that what they are about to see is soulful indeed.The original soundtrack aims for that Aria emulation one last time. Heavy use of acoustic guitar and emotional piano keys almost create a sense of nostalgia. Or, if nothing else, feelings of happiness, sweetness, and togetherness. Like Aria, it relies a bit too much on one singular track, but, like Aria, the tracks stand strong in their purpose and their execution.Interestingly, it also has a similar problem to Aria when it comes to its lyrical-based tracks. In particular, Teko’s ocean dive is overlaid with such lyrics. Rather than bolstering the moment, the track detracts from it since (subconsciously or otherwise) the singing forces the audience to focus on that rather than Teko’s big experience.The ending track of Amanchu mirrors many of the tracks in the OST. Shakers, a lot of acoustic-guitar playing, and soft singing lead the audience out of each episode with as warm and friendly of a goodbye as its hug was in the beginning.And the voice-acting is top-notch, too. Ai Kayano as Teko musters her courage with a soft, refined speaking voice. Eri Suzuki as Pikari brings enough whoopity-whoops to fill an ocean. And Saori Oonishi as Ai fires herself up and agitatedly reacts to victory.ENJOYMENTThere’s a lot I can say about this one.I can talk about how hilarious and cute it was to me. Teko bowing while saying thank you, but the tank of air on her back causing her to fall forward. Pikari saying that they “found the treasure that is you” to Ai, and Ai subsequently kicking the laughing spirit of Makoto out of embarrassment. The tiny kitty cat that made me squeal.I can talk about how much I liked Teko. How she always got super red out of embarrassment, her audible “Hehhhh…,” the way she floated in the water during her swimming test, and the kindness she always displayed.I can talk about some of my favorite moments. Pikari’s wish being that she wanted Teko’s wish to come true was so unbelievably nice that, in my notes, I wrote it down (with the same wording) in capital letters.I can talk about how, after many of the scenes, I said out loud, “I like this one!” I couldn’t contain my excitement over the show because it filled me with elation no matter what it did.But all I need to talk about is episode nine.Teko’s heart-wrenching realization on the phone with her soon-to-be old friends. Her thoughtful words on those friends that gave her more than she ever had. The amazing gift that Pikari and the others got for Teko. Teko’s shift in mindset, the full-circle phone call, and the final shot of both sets of “treasures.” Everything backed by the right music, the right timing, and the right execution.I cried. I had to reach for the tissues near me since tears were sliding down my cheeks. It was the first time in a long time that an anime got me so emotional, but it did so without a doubt. Her separation from her old life and the culmination of Teko’s words and the support she got from everybody else made the last five minutes of the episode simply wonderful.I am very grateful to the show for letting me experience something so genuine, and I cannot wait to cry at another scene like it somewhere down the road, within this medium that I adore so much.Amanchu!, like its spiritual predecessor, achieves its healing and happiness with ease. The story’s thoughtful events, the attractive designs of the characters, Teko’s amazing growth, the calming music, and the emotional resonance craft a beautiful anime worthy of praise. Water’s one dollar, and it’s two bucks for the big one. But this one is worth much more than that.SUMMARYStory: Fine, while it emulates its sister series a bit too much, its comedy, thoughtfulness, and ocean-related themes provide a solid narrativeAnimation: Fine, okay artistic direction, okay actual animation, and nice character designs with Teko’s on topCharacters: Good, almost all the cast don’t get enough attention, but Teko’s genuine journey from hating the unfamiliar to embracing the new makes her into a very strong characterSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, great OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Great, hilarious, heartwarming, and the first time in a long while that a tale from this medium got me cryingFinal Score: 7/10 thick, native accent. Over and over. That, and a “thank you” when she was given her money in exchange for the bottled water.I may have told this anecdote in the past, but it’s relevant to Amanchu!. Not just because of the diving but because of the situation. For, like Teko and Pikari, I choose to look at this one differently. I see it as a time where I tried something different and where I earned a quirky memory.In contrast, and thankfully, Amanchu provided nothing but joy.STORYAmanchu stars Futaba Ooki, aka Teko, a young lady who has just recently moved into town. As she dreads the new, unfamiliar world before her, Hikari Kohinata, aka Pikari, takes her by the hand, guiding her towards fun, the thrill of diving underwater, and an outlook on life that comes from the heart.While watching Amanchu, it’s almost impossible not to compare it with its sister series (provided one has seen said sister). Indeed, the anime in question is none other than the famous Aria anime. Known for its soothing atmosphere, the tranquil world of Neo Venezia, and those lovable, hilarious Undine.Keep in mind, this comparison does not only stem from the iyashikei (in English, “healing”) tone. For Amanchu goes out of its way to make such a connection more than obvious. The water-related premise. Nearly identical brands of comedy (silly faces, catch phrases). Erino Hazuki, the voice of Akari from Aria, voices Teko’s childhood friend (who has only a couple of speaking lines). Cha, the squat cat that lazily moves about the school, has a real name: Aria.The premise and the comedy are the biggest indicators, but, clearly, the anime has the Aria series in mind the whole time. This emulation (not replication since the anime is not an exact copy) results in two negatives.One, it prevents Amanchu from being what it wants to be. Appeasing the audience of Aria is a nice gesture, but when people describe the show as “like Aria but…,” its fundamental identity has been lost.Two, it does it to a fault. Since Amanchu wants to be similar, it pushes the comedy upfront a lot. Almost to the point that it drowns out the drama. Often, the anime follows a high-emotion scene with a funny one due to some misplaced sense of need rather than letting the emotions play out in full.However, the sisters diverge on a definitive point: character focus. Where Aria is mostly about the world it crafts and how the characters interact with it, Amanchu is mostly about the characters and how they interact with themselves.An important distinction seen through the content itself. Take Amanchu’s premise: diving. Besides the first couple of episodes, the final episode, and sparingly throughout the middle, it’s hardly focused on. Arguably, the anime choosing to (largely) ignore its own premise seems as though it were a foolhardy decision. But, in exchange, Amanchu emphasizes its cast. More monologues on their internal thoughts and feelings. Focus on what they do and like and perceive.Usually, the thoughts and the focus come from and go towards Teko. Whether it’s her appreciation of Pikari and all that Pikari has done for her or how she loves taking pictures on her phone, the anime makes it clear that this story is Teko’s.Along the way, Teko has many friends that give her simple yet heartwarming events. A street lined with cherry blossoms. A chalkboard chalk full of colorful pictures. A sincere treasure that holds more value than mere gold.Teko isn’t the only one treated this way, though. Pikari shows Mato a glimpse at some marigolds while on a moving train. Ai reminisces about her and her little brother Makoto’s time in the diving club through his saved items.The ocean and the diving may not play a huge, central role in the proceedings, but these two ideas tie into almost all of Amanchu’s (and therefore Teko’s) thoughts. The dark, murky water that gives way to a dazzling, clear blue. The buddy system and how the two partners fully support one another. The gentle invitation to try something different.Those events and these ideas culminate into one of the anime’s biggest themes. The ocean is a vast, unknown world all its own, hiding secrets for people to find, for people to seek out. That is, like the bottom of the ocean, there are new sights, new adventures, and new experiences worth discovering.One just needs the right mindset and a willingness to try.ANIMATIONAmanchu takes place mostly in an unassuming town and at a local school. Occasionally, it ventures elsewhere, like at a public pool or the mall. Regardless, the anime isn’t given much of an opportunity to show off any locations with extravagant detail. Lush greenery and blue waters are emphasized whenever possible, but, for the most part, it’s usually forgettable.However, Amanchu does not hold back with its scarce diving moments. Teko and Pikari floating in a pool filled with cherry blossoms or Teko looking up at the shining light as it dances across the ocean water gives these scenes the spectacle they deserve. Their contrast with the “duller” art makes them that much more powerful.One cannot not mention (a weird way to phrase that) the comedic artistry. More specifically, each character gets their own reaction face (more emulation of Aria) for situations in which the mood is lighthearted, silly, or otherwise funny. Teko gets swirly-scrawled eyes. Pikari’s pupils take up her entire eyeballs. Ai receives a monkey-like mouth that matchers her monkey diving cap. Combined with the squat figures and even rounder heads that they each morph into, these faces are a simple yet effective way for the anime to achieve its brand of comedy.They also help to mask the actual animation that goes on. In the beginning, Amanchu has a lot of movement. Teko’s eyes and hair move with fluidity, Pikari and Mato race against each other, and Ai kicks Makoto with undue force. Usually, when movement is restricted, the anime leans on the comedic faces since the reaction is more important than the movement. Of course, this isn’t always the case, like when Teko expertly dodges all of Ai’s slaps in their collective game of red-light-green-light. But it’s often the norm.Unfortunately, as the anime continues, it relies less and less on actual animation and more and more on the comedic faces. Not that it ever plummets to unacceptable levels, but much of it isn’t notable. Even its most important segment – Teko diving in the ocean for the first time – doesn’t include much in the way of actual diving. Arguably, it’s more about Teko being there and beholding the splendor of that new world, but, even so, the show doesn’t keep its animation levels anywhere but within an average range.Above anything else, though, the character designs shine. Pikari sometimes wearing a ponytail that takes the shape of a starfish when seen from the back. Ai’s unkempt twin-tails. Cha and Ohime having the same eyes as that of Pikari and Teko (respectively) when they enter comedy mode. The long, light-purple dresses the female students wear. The different casual outfits they don, and the diving suits they put on when, well, diving.But Teko’s design reigns supreme. Pikari describes Teko as a “beautiful mermaid” and rightly so. Her thin physique, flowing black hair (with a multitude of styles), and ocean-blue eyes complete with long eyelashes and those one-tenth eyebrows, give her a mature, charming design that carries her scenes with ease.CHARACTERSAs was said earlier, Amanchu is very much Teko’s story. Subsequently, the anime gives her a lot of time, exploring who she is, where she wants to go, and why she feels the way she does. Ultimately, Teko’s journey is more than satisfying.She starts off depressed. Saddened that she has been put into such an unfamiliar world. She’s afraid of what she may encounter and worried that she won’t have a place. All the while, she longs for her old life, her old friends. Wanting nothing more than to go back to where its comfortable. Fun. Familiar.In strolls Pikari, the girl with a whistle and a whoop. Pikari is the first to reach out to Teko, guiding her towards happiness. Not just in the literal sense when she leads her to their brand-new classroom. But also in the figurative sense when she talks with Teko and gives her that one-tenth nickname.The anime makes it immediately apparent how contrasting Teko and Pikari are. Especially with one of Pikari’s best moments in the whole show. Before they leave school on their first day, Pikari asks Teko which of their new books smells the best. Teko, quizzically, responds “Japanese?” To which Pikari agrees and smiles her big, beaming smile.This moment perfectly captures Pikari. She’s energetic, loves life, and does whatever she can to stay happy and, more importantly, bring happiness. In other words, Pikari is Teko’s foil. Teko’s quiet nature, negative thoughts, and general lack of enthusiasm form a dichotomy between the two, bringing with it the chance for Teko to grow through Pikari.And, expectedly, that’s what happens. Pikari gets Teko to break some rules and enter the diving-club room without permission, something she never would have done before. Pikari then alleviates her with that trip down the cherry blossoms. And she even motivates her enough to officially join the club (getting her to perform a demonstration of blowing out air from her ears).Teko slowly starts to open, trying new outlets and seeing life in a better light than she had when she first moved to this town. Her first true trial, though, comes with her first diving excursion (in the school’s pool). The water in her eyes and difficulty breathing scare her to the point that she just about gives up. But, thankfully, Pikari is there. Holding her hand, encouraging her on. Being the perfect buddy for her newfound friend.As Teko continues to adjust to her new world, she finds further comfort in diving. Their new clubmates – “Big-Sis Senpai” Ai and “Little-Bro Senpai” Makoto – are (always for the brother, usually for the sister) kind and inviting, giving Teko the goal she wants to now achieve: become an official Open Water Diver.Before she can get there, though, she must learn how to swim. And, when she can’t, she feels as though she’s bringing everybody around her down. But, and as she clearly states, she does not want to give up. Having found something that she herself wanted to take part in, she wants to see if the ocean contains something that her “insignificant self” does not. Her sincere gratitude towards Pikari, for everything she has done up to this point, is also not lost on Teko.While Mato gets some time in the spotlight, providing wisdom to the audience, and Makoto talks about his older sister, Amanchu puts Pikari at the center for a bit. To her, Teko is a mature, beautiful woman – who can sometimes, contrary to her usual self, act like a helpless doggy. She also notes how Teko hates to lose (from their school’s endurance exercises) and how learning about new sides to loved ones makes one want to love them that much more.Most importantly, Pikari imparts wisdom of her own. She tells Teko, “What matters is your approach and mindset! That “you don’t have to let things you don’t like get you down!”With these words in mind, Amanchu provides Teko with her greatest character moment in the following episode. Her phone fills up with pictures, preventing her from taking new ones until she moves the old ones away. She doesn’t want to, and so she reminisces about her old friends and the negative way in which she took her leave.Thankfully, and per usual, Pikari is there, giving Teko two amazing treasures. The first is the actual gift: the digital picture book. The second is the most important: reaffirmation of their friendship. Together, Teko realizes that she has been approaching it wrong the whole time. That the memories of her old life and the experiences in her new one are equally worth cherishing. As she best puts it “The places I cherish, and the places I love… Be it back then or right now, they only grow more and more beloved with time.”Thus, her mindset shifts permanently from that initial, overbearing sadness to appreciating her life and the newness within it. Yet, still, Teko goes through even more. Pikari teaches Teko that being at a loss is fine since “it’s a wonderful chance to have more fun” (and to “let’s-a-go” even more.) And, when the two save Ohime, the tiny kitty, Teko wants to do for the pet what Pikari has always done for her. That is, be there for her in her time of need.Come time for their first official ocean dive, Teko is the most excited. Her buddy check with Pikari goes swimmingly, but, as they prepare at the buoy to dive, Teko sees the fading light and the swathing darkness that engulfs it. She’s scared, but, when she sees the columns of bubbles from the other divers right below her (after losing her left fin), she becomes reinvigorated, wanting nothing more than to see the new world directly below her.Which she does. The various sea life, the rocky formations, the brilliant light that shines from above. This new world, something that she has never seen and could never see before, is one that she loves. In her own words, “I’m so, so glad I got to come here! See you soon.”She records in her diver’s diary what she saw on her first dive, and she passes the exam, becoming an official Open Water Diver. But, appropriately enough, it’s not quite the end, for Amanchu gives Teko and Pikari one last scene together.Pikari tries to put into words how thankful she is to Teko for going along with her and being her friend and loving everything that she loves. In return, Teko thanks Pikari for giving her “…so many new things to love,” a far cry away from who she was at the beginning of her tale. The final words from Teko ring out, she takes Pikari by the hand, and together they walk, awaiting the bright, amazing, and fun-filled future before them.And so, Teko’s tale concludes. Arguably, the twins, the teacher, and even Pikari (no matter how much of a foil she is) do not get a lot of attention and time thrown their way individually. A small blemish on the overall experience.But Teko’s small, gradual changes. Her transformation from a person scared of the unfamiliar to wanting to explore the new. The thoughtfulness backing it all. Everything comes together for Teko, creating in her a beautiful, heartfelt character journey that won’t be forgotten for a long, long time.SOUNDThe opening track of Amanchu is quite the calming piece. It starts off with soft, quiet singing and a host of dainty instrumental work that each refuse to overtake the listener but rather invite them in with a warm hug. The middle section picks up the tempo and the passion, coinciding with Teko’s own change over the course of the story. By the end, it reflects the beginning, letting the audience know that what they are about to see is soulful indeed.The original soundtrack aims for that Aria emulation one last time. Heavy use of acoustic guitar and emotional piano keys almost create a sense of nostalgia. Or, if nothing else, feelings of happiness, sweetness, and togetherness. Like Aria, it relies a bit too much on one singular track, but, like Aria, the tracks stand strong in their purpose and their execution.Interestingly, it also has a similar problem to Aria when it comes to its lyrical-based tracks. In particular, Teko’s ocean dive is overlaid with such lyrics. Rather than bolstering the moment, the track detracts from it since (subconsciously or otherwise) the singing forces the audience to focus on that rather than Teko’s big experience.The ending track of Amanchu mirrors many of the tracks in the OST. Shakers, a lot of acoustic-guitar playing, and soft singing lead the audience out of each episode with as warm and friendly of a goodbye as its hug was in the beginning.And the voice-acting is top-notch, too. Ai Kayano as Teko musters her courage with a soft, refined speaking voice. Eri Suzuki as Pikari brings enough whoopity-whoops to fill an ocean. And Saori Oonishi as Ai fires herself up and agitatedly reacts to victory.ENJOYMENTThere’s a lot I can say about this one.I can talk about how hilarious and cute it was to me. Teko bowing while saying thank you, but the tank of air on her back causing her to fall forward. Pikari saying that they “found the treasure that is you” to Ai, and Ai subsequently kicking the laughing spirit of Makoto out of embarrassment.

She looks like a supermodel but she suffers from social anxiety. Futaba recently moved to a seaside town and there, she quickly befriends an apparently mentally handicapped girl who goes by the nickname of Pikari who, throughout the series, teaches the protagonist that the secret to a happy life is to stop stressing about stuff and enjoy the little everyday things.The series clearly wants to get the message across that regardless of the fact that someone might look utterly braindead to you, you still might be able to learn quite a bit from that person and...they might impact your life in a positive way. So be nice to weird people and try to get to know them!The rest of the characters in the show are quite forgettable because the series focuses mostly on the relationship between the Pikari and Futaba and forgets to develop the supporting cast, which is a shame because their teacher had the potential to become a very interesting character.Amanchu!'s color palette is quite soft and soothing and it fits the series very well.

I loved the way this show looks because of it.Also, there is quite a bit of diving in this series."", ""***THIS IS A VERY LIGHT SPOILER REVIEW***I vividly remember watching a series called Aria in my earlier anime watching days. It had me mesmerized with its amazing visuals, music, and character interactions. It told the story of 3 young women working on getting better at their craft. For 3 seasons it developed into an amazing series that I wish we had more of.Amanchu is written by the same author that did Aria and while it does do a great job of hitting most of the marks laid by Aria, I feel that it missed its stride in a few instances.Story: 3.5/10What made Aria...great was that almost 100% of the time you had character interactions while the craft building was going on. In Amanchu however a lot of the character interactions happen outside of the diving portion of the anime. In fact we do not see a complete dive until the last episode of the season which really disappointed me. Yes the show is mostly about general character building like in Aria but sidelining the main activity in the anime was not the best move in my opinion. If we ever get more seasons of this show then maybe I'll get what I want but for now we have to judge what we have.The characters do grow in this series (mostly Futaba) and the interactions are on point. I just wish we saw more of the diving aspect in action instead of being told about it.Animation: 8.5/10Honestly breathtaking in some moments. For its time Aria had some of the best water animations in anime and in Amanchu it is so amazingly well done. The light reflections that beam off the water is impressive. The character models are drop dead gorgeous (as Digibro would say it's a new slice-of-life genre that focuses on super attractive women). The backdrops are so amazing they could be paintings on their own; just everything about the anime looks fantastic. I am however going to dock a couple of points for some scenes that did look lazy and simple. There were not a lot of them but some of the static dialogue scenes do look bad.Sound: 9/10Just like with Aria the music for this show is simply amazing. It fits in with the very laid back tone of the story which is super important to get right in a slice-of-life show. The music that plays in the diving scene in the last episode is probably the best piece of music I have heard in an anime in the past 10 or so years. Voice Actors were top notch all the way through this season.Characters: 8/10Again the chemistry is here; this cast provided a lot of great and fun scenes. Hikari in particular provided so many memorable moments that I will find hard to forget any time soon. It's just like I stated up above since the whole point of the show (diving) takes such a back seat I had a hard time enjoying this show like I did with Aria and you have to compare it to Aria due to the feeling of the show. This is a great cast; I just hope that in future seasons they mix in actual diving with character interactions.Overall: 7.3/10I snuck this point into the character section of the review but it has to be hammered home; you have to compare this show to Aria. They try to invoke the same feelings, use very similar music styles, background shots, and character quirks. Because of this I feel that Amanchu is watered down (no pun intended) when compared to Aria. It improves the visual presentation 10 fold but everything else is either on par or lacking. You should totally watch this show but watch Aria first.Enjoyment: 8.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer"", '-- sorry for bad english --Watching Amanchu was a weird experiment, and after watching Aria, from the same author, i understand more where the creations of the author are a problem with me.In both case the art and music was gorgeous, and in both case the character are a great creations. We encounter the same type of character but well, they are very good. All have been said about this in others review and i am 100% OK with this so i don\'t write more about this.The main problem of this anime (and other creations of the same author) are that the autjhor just...don\'t understant what is an Iyakishei in Nature environement. Which is a huge problem for an anime of this type.Take a classic ""mushishi"" for example, the anime is somehow a criticism of our society and present a nature environement, relaxing, that show that life is way more slow and relaxing in this environement. (I make this short with my bad english, but you understand what i mean), same thing for a classic nature iyakishei like ""non non biyori"" or for a ""Barakamon"".Aria and Amanchu fails totally on this aspect. Ont the begenning of the two anime, the author show to us a new environment (the sea in both anime) that are going to change the relation of the main character with herself and the other. At this point it\'s cool ! But after that point it is less cool ...After that point, the author fail to manage the speech of its animes. In amanchu for example, the author just ""forget"" everything about the sea after 4/5 episodes and the action move to a classic aseptic college. To compensate that the author introduce two new characters that are not very interesting in comparaison to the main relation between the two main character which was a key point at the begenning. So the author lost the two main good point of the begenning ot Amanchu : the relation with a novel environnement and the ""fusional"" relationship with the second main protagonist.This fact push back the progression to the relation between sea and characters and we meet this again at the end of the anime whheeeeennn ... the character will make a descent in the sea for the first time and ... when we will see the magnificient bottom of the sea with more diver than fish that all make photo and selfie ~_~ .At this point i just feel discouraged by this waste of good material.So ->Master of the main subject and rythme of the Anime : 3/10Big failure ...Art and music : 10/10Really gorgeous !Characters : 10/10Like a mix between the main character of Aria for the first main and the  main character of Kimi ni Todoke for the second one, a real success.Relation between characters : 5/10Very very good at the begenning and not so good in the main part of the anime. Not enough Yuri :pStory : 8/10 -> classic Iyakishei, not really a ""story"" .Overall : 7.5/10 -> I am not to nasty with the anime, but if you are a great fan of the nature/environmental aspect of anime like non non biyori, mushishi or Barakamon, you can substract two more point... don\'t understant what is an Iyakishei in Nature environement. Which is a huge problem for an anime of this type.Take a classic ""mushishi"" for example, the anime is somehow a criticism of our society and present a nature environement, relaxing, that show that life is way more slow and relaxing in this environement. (I make this short with my bad english, but you understand what i mean), same thing for a classic nature iyakishei like ""non non biyori"" or for a ""Barakamon"".Aria and Amanchu fails totally on this aspect. Ont the begenning of the two anime, the author show to us a new environment (the sea in both anime) that are going to change the relation of the main character with herself and the other. At this point it\'s cool ! But after that point it is less cool ...After that point, the author fail to manage the speech of its animes. In amanchu for example, the author just ""forget"" everything about the sea after 4/5 episodes and the action move to a classic aseptic college. To compensate that the author introduce two new characters that are not very interesting in comparaison to the main relation between the two main character which was a key point at the begenning. So the author lost the two main good point of the begenning ot Amanchu : the relation with a novel environnement and the ""fusional"" relationship with the second main protagonist.This fact push back the progression to the relation between sea and characters and we meet this again at the end of the anime whheeeeennn ... the character will make a descent in the sea for the first time and ... when we will see the magnificient bottom of the sea with more diver than fish that all make photo and selfie ~_~ .At this point i just feel discouraged by this waste of good material.So ->Master of the main subject and rythme of the Anime : 3/10Big failure ...Art and music : 10/10Really gorgeous !Characters : 10/10Like a mix between the main character of Aria for the first main and the  main character of Kimi ni Todoke for the second one, a real success.Relation between characters : 5/10Very very good at the begenning and not so good in the main part of the anime. Not enough Yuri :pStory : 8/10 -> classic Iyakishei, not really a ""story"" .Overall : 7.5/10 -> I am not to nasty with the anime, but if you are a great fan of the nature/environmental aspect of anime like non non biyori, mushishi or Barakamon, you can substract two more point...', 'I try my best not to make comparisons of shows before I even watch them, but a certain show couldn\'t help but immediately spring to mind when I first saw Amanchu!.This is far from J.C.Staff\'s first ride with a slice-of-life series. However, in just the previous season, J.C.Staff had done another slice-of-life series featuring primarily cute girls entitled Flying Witch. This show was widely praised by anime fans as being everything a slice-of-life should be (a consensus I agreed with), while Amanchu! seemed to fall under the radar.Maybe it\'s because Amanchu!\'s premise doesn\'t seem immediately as inviting as Flying Witch\'s did. An anime about witches...is a much easier sell then an anime about a diving club...if you can even really call Amanchu! about a diving club. (More on that later.)If you were immediately sold on the diving premise, you might be a little disappointed by what Amanchu! turns out to be. If you\'re more forgiving, or simply adore cute characters, you\'ll be pleased with this change.Yes, Amanchu! doesn\'t really spend a lot of time in the water. Don\'t get me wrong; it\'s still focused upon in some episodes, and the show does a good job making you root for Futaba in the hopes she becomes an Open Water Diver.However, the true charm from Amanchu! comes from how its two main characters interact with each other - Futaba and Hikari. While Hikari has a very bubbly, hyperactive personality, Futaba struggles with finding friends and being too hard on herself. Watching Hikari slowly bring Futaba out of her bubble and become closer and closer to her throughout the course of the anime is overall the most charming part of the story.(Yes, there is yuribait. It\'s sanitized, family-friendly yuribait, but it\'s undoubtably present.)On the polar opposite side, there is one character in Amanchu! that kind of brought the show down for me that I feel the need to talk about. That character is Ai. She drops in on episode 3, and immediately establishes her personality: she likes to abuse her kind-hearted brother for no apparent reason. If he says anything, her foot\'s on his head or kicking him in the side. In reality, this wouldn\'t be funny at all and would likely eventually lead to long-term damage both physically and of their relationship, so I\'m not sure why it\'s supposed to be funny/cute here.The animation and sound in Amanchu! are both pretty good. The show uses chibi faces a lot, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn\'t. The best animation is saved for when the characters are underwater, giving us beautiful scenery of the ocean and wallpaper-worthy images of Futaba and Hikari together.Amanchu! also has a lot of use of Engrish and verbal tics (""Whoop!"" ""Let\'s a-go!"") that were particularly charming and pleasant to my ears for whatever reason.Overall, is Amanchu! as solid as Flying Witch? No, but it\'s very rare that a slice-of-life series can be. Does that make it a waste of time? Absolutely not. If you\'re looking for something that will fill the cute girl-shaped hole in your heart and you\'ve blown through all the obvious choices, Amanchu! might be the show for you. is a much easier sell then an anime about a diving club...if you can even really call Amanchu! about a diving club.

Here are my thoughts:For those unaware, this anime's source manga has the same mangaka as the more well-known Aria series.The anime is (superficially) focused on diving but I feel that the activity is just a suitable allegory for the true character-driven story. Superficially it's a SoL show, but it is steeped heavily in romance. I was not expecting yuri romance going into this but I welcome it with open arms.Romantic. So romantic. The two main characters have great chemistry. Romance is probably the strongest aspect of this anime. There are so many elegantly crafted romantic scenes.Very nice...character designs, especially the faces. I like the school outfits -- they're unique (although apparently an homage to Aria?). Actually all of the outfits in the series are really cute.Good character animation sometimes. Not consistent but it is good when it counts like during close-up scenes. Some episodes are more sloppy than others in this regard. The cinematography during some scenes can be quite nice.Nice setting. Nice atmosphere. Very relaxing. Soft and sweet. I can practically smell the salty ocean air as I watch this anime. Setting and atmosphere are definitely strong aspects of this show. Very immersive. The setting is the classic coastal Japan that you've probably seen before, but nevertheless it is executed very well.The OST is decent, depending on your tastes. It mainly consists of acoustic string instruments. It fits the setting well. All the OP and ED songs are good too. Generally speaking, I liked the voice acting of the two main characters, although sometimes Hikari has some mildly annoying quirks. The script can be surprisingly thoughtful sometimes, particularly during more-emotional scenes.The two redhead sibling characters are kind of weak and drag down a lot of scenes they're in. They are somewhat unlikable and often used for unfunny humour. I found myself dreading their appearance on screen. These two characters are probably the most significant flaw of the anime. That said, they don't really soak up that much screentime, so this is a fairly minor criticism. Generally speaking, Amanchu is at its best when it is focused exclusively on the two main characters.Overall the romantic aspects of the anime are terrific but strictly as a SoL it is comparatively weaker (although still good in this respect too). The diving scenes are pretty nice, as are the various activities around town, but many scenes are steeped in some kind of underlying character-related drama, so it often doesn't really function as a typical comfy SoL. This is more than fine with me and I really enjoyed the anime, but it's important for the viewer to set their expectations accordingly.One 'complaint' I have about the anime is that it introduced a few new characters during the latter half of season 2. These characters seemed really promising to me and it was somewhat disappointing that there wasn't enough time to give them more attention. This is a perennial issue with manga adaptations though. Things are rarely tied up neatly -- Amanchu is no exception to this. The introduction of these promising new characters late in season 2 impeded the feeling of finality I might have felt at the end of the anime. On the other hand, this has also amplified my desire to read the manga. This kind of thing comes with the manga-adaptation territory. It would be more of an issue for an anime that is more plot-heavy than Amanchu. It's also worth noting that the ending of season 1 was handled really well and left me feeling very satisfied.My overall rating: 8/10Some of the best girl-girl romance I've seen in a while, and it's wrapped up in a nice soft and relaxing atmosphere. Very pleasant.This show seems to be underappreciated/underviewed by fans of shoujo ai. If you like yuri romance then I strongly recommend watching this. On the other hand, someone who doesn't enjoy yuri romance would probably find this anime slightly boring, which might explain the show's lukewarm reception.I should mention that, at the time of writing this, I have not yet seen or read Aria. I expect that I'd enjoy it though.I haven't been able to find the specials for this anywhere so unfortunately I have not seen them yet.ADDENDUM: I was not aware of the yuri/hetero controversy when I wrote this. I have since been informed. Doesn't change my opinion of the anime though. character designs, especially the faces.

I haven't watched the second season yet, so I will only comment on the first one.From the beginning, we have a character who is basically a blank canvas or a phone with empty storage. An empty person, without ideas for the future, without desires, unable to understand what happiness is. Teko reminds me a lot of Miki from Houkago Saikoro Club, but in Amanchu, Teko discovers happiness when she meets...Pikari, her friend, and she introduces her to the fantastic underwater world. It's even interesting to think that we can draw a parallel between the character Teko and the ocean itself, which from afar is vast and gigantic and brings a huge sense of emptiness and loneliness(like Teko), but within it, there is a lot of life and beautiful things to appreciate.Teko changes when she understands that above all, we should have fun, and she finds her future and her desire in diving alongside Pikari. And so her blank canvas begins to be painted, and her phone with empty memory starts to fill up with one, two, and infinite photos that will be cherished in Teko's heart forever.I enjoyed the first season, and let's see where the second season will lead us.---------------Pt/BrDar risada, comer comidas gostosas, fazer algo divertido, planejar o futuro, ser feliz, viver, mas principalmente SE DIVERTIR.Acredito que foi essa a mensagem que a primeira temporada de Amanchu! quis nos proporcionar. Ainda não assisti a segunda temporada então vou comentar apenas a primeira.Desde o início temos uma personagem que é basicamente um quadro em branco, ou um celular com armazenamento vazio. Uma pessoa vazia, sem ideias para o futuro, sem desejos, sem conseguir entender o que é a felicidade. A Teko me lembra muito a Miki de Houkago Saikoro Club, mas em Amanchu, Teko descobre a felicidade ao se encontrar com Pikari sua amiga e ela lhe apresentar o fantastico mundo subaquático. É até interessante pensar que podemos fazer uma relação com a personagem Teko e o próprio oceano, que de visto de longe é vasto e gigantesco e traz uma sensação enorme de vazio e solidão, mas dentro dele temos muita vida e coisas belas para se apreciar.Teko muda ao entender que devemos nos divertir acima de tudo, e encontra seu futuro e seu desejo no mergulho ao lado de Pikari. E assim seu quadro em branco começa a ser pintado e seu celular com memória vazia, começa a se encher, com uma, duas, e infinitas fotos que serão guardadas dentro do coração de Teko para sempre.Gostei da primeira temporada e vamos ver qual o caminho que a segunda temporada nos levara.

Doraemon Movie 22: Nobita to Tsubasa no Yuusha-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2654/Doraemon_Movie_22__Nobita_to_Tsubasa_no_Yuusha-tachi,"['My overall take: A fun movie that unfortunately has an unpolished feel to its plot.In this movie, Nobita and his friends stumble across a portal leading to a land inhabited by bird people. This is unquestionably an exciting film to watch, with the race sequence partway through and the final struggle against the main threat being particular highlights. The concept of a bird civilization is also of special interest to me, as a paleontologist who studies birds. However, I\'ve long thought that the story lacks a sense of coherence in following the plot threads that it introduces.One of the most obvious examples of this is...that the primary villain becomes a non-entity as soon as his plan goes sideways and a greater threat appears. He is not even given a cameo appearance or a passing mention when all is said and done. Does he still retain his leadership position in the bird military? Has his perspective changed at all as a result of this incident? The movie does not say.Then there\'s the character of Icarus the eagle-man, who is built up as a legendary figure in bird society. When he finally enters the story in the flesh, he proceeds to spend his screentime accomplishing... not very much. Nearly all of his contributions probably could have been written out of the film with little difficulty. Even the reveal that he\'s the biological father of the protagonists\' new friend, Gusuke, amounts to almost no narrative importance (and is never disclosed to the main characters or to Gusuke himself).I also felt that there were many missed opportunities with the portrayal of the bird civilization. To be fair, it\'s more fleshed out than the animal society from Nobita and the Animal Planet (1990), but not by a whole lot. Even a few more relatively basic references to real-world bird biology could have enhanced the worldbuilding-why not have the owl professor be nocturnal? (One scene shows him working at night, but in an ""academic doing late-night research"" kind of way.) There\'s no shortage of interesting elements in bird physiology and behavior to draw from that could have made the bird people much more than simply ""flying humans that hatch from eggs"". (Why yes, I am a degreed bird biologist overthinking a children\'s anime...)In addition, it would have been nice to see the main characters display quirks and abilities based on the Bird Hats that they wear to blend into bird society. At one point, Gian is shown to require a running take-off because he is wearing an albatross hat. I would have liked to see more moments like that. (Ironically, this is something that Nobita and the Animal Planet did better.) that the primary villain becomes a non-entity as soon as his plan goes sideways and a greater threat appears.

Clannad Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1723/Clannad_Movie,"['I realize this came out before the series, but I highly suggest that if you are going to watch the series/are watching the series, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. The storyline was all over the place and non of the characters are developed well. The animation is mediocre at best and all it really does is spoil the plot of an amazing series.I highly recommend watching both the Clannad series, and the Clannad After Story series. If you still feel the urge to watch this movie, at least wait until you get to about ep 18 in After Story. ', '*An alternate interpretation of the Clannad story centered around the Nagisa x Tomoya couple.*Did you get confused with the ending in Clannad After Story? Did you wish for a more realistic ending? Did you know that Clannad The Motion Picture might just be what you are looking for? Or perhaps you have heard of Clannad and Clannad After Story from all your friends, but you have yet to try it out? Clannad The Motion Picture (TMP for short) provides a great summary of all the major events that took place in the ~46 episodes (excluding OVA/recap) series between the two main protagonists. Please be mindful...that the movie is retelling a story in ~90 minutes that its TV counterpart took ~1100 minutes to tell! Thus some events may seem to occur at an unreasonable pace. But nonetheless Clannad TMP is still a movie that a true Clannad fan should not miss out on.While the story is still being told from Tomoya’s perspective, many aspects of the show depart from the TV series. Assuming you have the background from the TV series (if you have no background what-so-ever please skip the rest of this paragraph) then you should be warned that first of all, this is purely a Tomoya x Nagisa scenario with all other heroines playing a minor role, or in some cases did not even have a role. This means that Tomoya never develop any kind of deep friendship with the others and consequently did not help them when they were troubled. This in turn means no light orbs … hence a more realistic ending.Although Clannad is a slice of life/romance anime, its similarities end there with other show of the same genre. Clannad is like a milking machine. Its whole purpose is to milk out all your emotions that you often don’t have toward anime. While the movie did not do very well in this department compared to the TV series (largely due to the lack of character development and coverage), the overall story in the movie did manage to create a similar atmosphere for viewers. This means that we still get the usual comedic side of a delinquent high schooler lifestyle. It also means a confused protagonist at a loss after being challenged by the hardships in life.There was this “illusionary” world in Clannad TV series where they featured, with great CG animation, a girl and a robot built from scrap metal. Mirroring this concept, Clannad TMP also has an illusionary world. But instead of the girl and robot, we have a “clown”. The symbology in the two illusionary worlds is slightly different but both fit perfectly fine in their respective show. These illusions generally give the viewers more background on the characters and the way they think/feel about certain things.Like previously stated, the characters in Clannad TMP consist of Tomoya and Nagisa. Their role did not get amplified compare to the TV series, instead the other characters just never get enough screen time. One strong point about the characters in the movie is that there is no ambiguous character relationships developed between Tomoya and various heroines. This allows us to truly enjoy Tomoya and Nagisa’s journey through life instead of wasting our time rooting for other females who will never end up with Tomoya.One glaring eye poison of the movie is the character design of the lovable Nagisa and her equally adorable mother, Sanae. They look like characters drawn from a low budget production in the 90s (actually the looks are straight ripped out from the manga, but Toei Animation should have improved on it). Thankfully there does not appear to have much character “deformation” in the other characters, they all look similar to their TV counterpart which is definite a welcome for most fans. And thankfully (again) there does not appear to have any ear poison either. Although nothing sounds too spectacular from the movie (especially when compared to the TV series) there is no serious window shattering horrid nightmarish music/soundtracks. Lastly I recommend you not to make any comparison between the TV series and the movie since:1.\tThe movie was made before Clannad season one so technically there was nothing to compare to back then.2.\tThe movie was made by a different animation studio (Toei Animation) compare to the TV series (Kyoto Animation). that the movie is retelling a story in ~90 minutes that its TV counterpart took ~1100 minutes to tell!

Before that, I would like to note that I will be comparing the movie with some outside facts and other points of view to prove my arguments.Story:People say I shouldn’t compare to the series because the series was release after the movie. So I didn’t, but instead I compared it with the visual novel. Before that, I think Kyoto Animation did a fantastic job in porting the story from the visual novel to the series with many of the original content still...remaining except the story was alter in order to make all the character’s story operate in one single universe instead of the multiple parallel universe that the visual novel runs in. So basically, in some degree comparing the series is also comparing back to the visual novel into some extend. [Sorry for any terms that might alienate non fans] While the movie only focus on Nagisa’s arc and only half way through the After story arc. I think it’s unfair to judge the series with the movie like that, simply because that it have 48 episodes to explain nearly 7 character arcs (if I’m not wrong) and a complete and lengthy After Story arc. Plus, if we were to compare the movie with the series, the movie only summarise approximately 10-12 episode worth of story from the series out of the 48.But I say won’t compare to the series, so here’s my other point of view on the movie.The problem with the movie is how much referencing I should be making with the vn. The movie is written to be able to stand on its own. Many other studios also do this by taking and redoing the story of other VNs to suit the timeframe and demands of the market. So why was Clannad such an exception to the modification make in the movie? Reason is simply because of the story and how it captures the heart of its audience. While I agree that one and half hours is way too short to truly and deeply capture the heart against a minimum of 90 hours gameplay or 48 episode series but then again I find Toei Animation isn’t even trying (too much business too less romance if you ask me). Ask yourself if you watched both the series and the movie, how memorable or funny moments can you remember from both of them. So the movie very feels like a summary but summary of what? I not allow to compare it with the series and it has totally different storytelling from the VN. So, I would say it like a summary of the plot or the key events of Nagisa’s arc and first half of After Story arc.tl/dr: Same plot but different way of storytellingArtwork:Absolutely horrible. This is the part where the movie failed the most. I’m not comparing it to the series which was the total opposite of it. (FYI, the movie’s first public announcement was around March 2006 and premier on September 2007 while the series was in March 2007 and October 2008. There was only around a year of differences between both the series and the movie’s announcement date and airing dates. So the point where people are comparing the movie’s artwork with the series is quite reasonable and valid unlike the case with Kanon02 and Kanon06 where they have 4 years difference)But I would like to also point out that my main reason of rating the artwork so low was because it was a 2007 movie and that it did not meet up standards of its time. There are just too many animation inconsistencies and the character just look too flat at some moments for me.tl/dr: Seriously, it was a 2007 movie? I thought it was made in 1997.Sound:Another let down of the movie was its soundtrack. I find the soundtrack to simple and just work. Why? Because VisualArt’s/Key and Jun Meada did a great job in the visual novel with soundtrack that’s totally authentic to Clannad franchise itself. (FYI, the series reused almost all of the soundtrack from the VN which give gamers a right at home feel). So the reason wasn’t that the soundtrack was bad, it was generic but good enough and matched the scenes properly. The real problem was that the visual novel already set  a very high bar for the movie which it also fail to reach expected level of quality that the visual novel have. Maybe that’s the reason why kyoani didn’t bother reinventing the wheel on the series.td/dr: Visual novel(2004) have great soundtrack so why the movie(2007) only has ok level soundtrack?Characters:Except Tomoya, Nagisa, Sunohara, Akio and Sanae, almost all the characters have their characters and personality changed which is a good thing as I can’t very predict was going to happen next since I can’t rely on my known knowledge about the characters. While I have no real complains as they are changed to adapt to the current storyline, but the character were less lovable (not just because of artwork but also their dialogue and choice of actions) than in the VN and series. Plus, where is FUKO????p/s: I have no problems with the voice actors even Tomoya’s since he has no voice in the vn.Enjoyment:I can’t say I enjoyed fully it but it served me another way to love the series even more instead.  The movie also serves a simple straight to the point ending for people that can’t fully understand what’s going on in the true After Story ending.But the real problem for me was that the movie doesn’t have any elements that scored well for me to clinch to. It was simply because either the visual novel or the series outperformed it in every aspect that it outshined the movie and make it look bad. So, I also believe this is the biggest reason why many people didn’t like the movie.tl/dr: Nothing to like about the movie.Conclusion:Should you watch it?YES if you are a fan of the series.or else NO, watch and love the series than come back or don’t bother. Cause there’s better movies.tl/dr:Messy straight to the point story, horrible artwork, ok soundtrack but could be better, plain simple character, no love for it cause the series took them all remaining except the story was alter in order to make all the character’s story operate in one single universe instead of the multiple parallel universe that the visual novel runs in. So basically, in some degree comparing the series is also comparing back to the visual novel into some extend. [Sorry for any terms that might alienate non fans] While the movie only focus on Nagisa’s arc and only half way through the After story arc.

However, when my wife and I bought the series on DVD, the movie was included, so we thought, ""Why not?"" I watched it, prepared to strongly dislike it, and I did . . . until the last half hour. I am not going to waste...time discussing the individual parts of the score I gave. Instead, I want to share why I was so heartbroken by the end of this movie.Before you even watch this movie, consider that the movie will attempt to do what took the anime 10+ hours and the visual novel around 100 hours in . . . 90 minutes. Yep, this is the biggest flaw of the whole movie; I told my wife after watching this that if this had been about three times as long, I probably would\'ve liked it more than the anime. Let me explain why.The first hour was a botched mess. It was basically a summary of the school arc, and a bad one at that. It just seemed like a really lame romance where boy hates school, girl loves school, boy helps girl in school, girl helps boy to love school. Sure, that is arguably the way the school arc happened in other media, but the difference was execution. The school arc here felt very shallow, whereas there was depth and purpose for it otherwise.The characters were alright, I guess, but they didn\'t have the time they needed to develop. Important characters like Kotomi, Kyou, and to a lesser extent Tomoyo were basically cameos in here, and it honestly didn\'t make sense to even include them (though Tomoyo is somewhat justified, the movie really didn\'t need her either).The whole Illusion World concept was also wrecked; they bothered to introduce it, but they never explained its true significance. True, they kind of made their own definition of it, which actually worked okay, but I wish they just never introduced it. It would\'ve saved them time, and I picture the audience being left confused on the whole thing.So, that\'s the first hour. What about the last 30 minutes? Let me tell you something; in my opinion, if the last half-hour was given more time to work with, it would have rivaled After Story.The last half-hour primarily focuses on the aftermath of Nagisa\'s death, and unlike After Story, it felt much more dramatic and tragic. Don\'t get me wrong; After Story made me cry when both Nagisa and Ushio died. But there was a level of hopelessness in this movie that was not reached by the anime, and I think this is where the movie excelled.The environment is very dark, Tomoya expresses a shockingly dark level of anguish. Tomoya doesn\'t work, doesn\'t cook for himself, refuses to talk to anybody . . . it was heart-rending just to watch. The emotion I felt when they portrayed Nagisa\'s death and Tomoya\'s descent into depression was similar to that of After Story.Eventually, the gang (Tomoyo, Sunohara, Kyou, and Nagisa\'s parents are the ones I remember off-hand) take Tomoya to a train station to finally meet Ushio. There were about 5 minutes left in the movie at this point, and I wondered how they were gonna do everything post-Ushio in that timeframe. Tomoya and Ushio have a tearful, beautiful reunion as Tomoya accepts her as his daughter.Tomoya also mentions his interpretation of the Illusion World at the end which, albeit not quite as good as the real deal, was a fitting conclusion to his experiences. . . .Then the credits roll.I was shocked to see the movie end that way; no raising Ushio, no Nagisa coming back from the dead . . . none of that.As I thought on it, I saw the brilliance in it. Unlike After Story, which gets a little more into the fantasy side (which isn\'t a bad thing; I gave AS 10/10), this movie was very realistic. It was a very fitting ending, and I wanted more. I wanted to see Tomoya\'s journey to Ushio in greater detail, and I wanted to see more of that alternate universe where Nagisa DIDN\'T come back. The last half-hour was done superbly. It was such a shame that it never got the love it deserved.My final verdict: 7/10I wouldn\'t recommend this as a stand-alone movie nor an introduction to the Clannad universe, but I would recommend it to Clannad fans, so long as they clearly understood its flaws (not every character you like is in there, and it is way too short), as this movie gave me a very moving alternate setting. The anime still outshines the movie in every single aspect, but I strongly believe that the movie would\'ve been just as great if it had more time. I enjoyed it, and I was entranced while thinking what could have been had Nagisa never come back. time discussing the individual parts of the score I gave.

I've played the game, and I'm currently watching the series of KyoAni. If you played or watched that you will probably dislike the movie.The only thing I found good was the story and the character development, but then again that was key's work and not TOEI. I didn't give it a better score on story because hilarious parts like most of Sunohara are gone, the movie does not explain any of how the relationship is made between the main characters and the side characters...About the OST what can I say... I have over 400 songs (all clannad OST),...the one used here was just pure deception. Probably the only good part was the festival part. The dubs are horrible as well, I wonder why they couldn't just use the same as the game or the series (maybe budget?, who knows).The animation was almost unwatchable. Maybe my eyes got used to KyoAni's eyecandy animation, but the animation oddly reminded me to dragon ball in almost every minute. There's also here and there trying to highlight an scene and they just go repeat the scene over and over with a drum over it, &quot;Pathetic&quot; is the word for that.In a nutshell: I wish this move didn't exist, I wish I didn't watch this movie. Think it twice before watching this, if you liked the series, or the game you probably won't like this. the one used here was just pure deception. Probably the only good part was the festival part.

After about 30 minutes into it, I started to look around the room. The movie gave me plenty of reasons to turn it off.Story: 8Even though the movie was not all that good, it still sorta went along with the story of the game and the TV series. I'm well aware that, because it's a movie, it couldn't put the other characters in like they should have been put in, so it's understandable that they only focused on Nagisa's story. The story was...done okay, so I'm rating it 8.Art: 3I can't say very much about the art besides it was awful. At first all that came to mind was the animations from the AiR movie, which I thought was good. Because of that, I had high hopes for Clannad. Unfortunately, I was let down, like a lot of people have been. The art is undescribable, and it's not up to par with the anime being released today. It brought me back to the mid-80's at a few parts. Nostalgia won't get you anywhere when it comes to suddenly changed art style, sorry. Be consistent, or not make it at all.Sound: 2The sound didn't match the plot or what was at the time going on. The Dango song came on a few times as well, with the characters singing it. I mean really, is this movie targeted for kids or something? I thought this movie would have been made for older audiences, instead the music made me think I was watching some kid's show. The BGM made no sense to me at all, so that's why it's got 2.Character: 6It's obvious that they couldn't put all the characters into the movie, and that's okay. The problem starts when the characters act out of character. I won't spoil anything for anyone, but to make an example would be when Nagisa's posters were being either taken down or painted with red marks. Why they put Fuuko's sister and fiance in it, but not Fuuko herself is beyond me. Changing a bit of Sunohara's character ticked me off too. He's supposed to be a kicking-around character. Because of badly changed personalities of the characters, I rate 6.Enjoyment: 4The Dango song by itself almost made me turn the movie off. The movie was horrible up until a point about 2/3's of the way through, then it got good. So that's why it's not getting a 1 rating, but 4.Overall: 5It can only be called average and forgettable. The TV series went into the story accurately, while the movie went and threw it all asunder. To me it looked very amateurish and sloppily done.

In general, it was great.I don't think that the movie will spoil the series, because its alternative to it, but who knows. By the time I'm writing this review, I'veseen only 20 episodes, so I don't know how the anime ends.Anyway, I'll start the actual review.Art / Animation:to tell the truth, it was horrible. There was time where I wondered if I'm watching a movie from the end of 2007, or a moviefrom the early 80`s. Though the backgrounds scenery was pretty good, the characters looked awful, with a lack of proportion and made some...weird moves. I just couldn't ignore it, and I think that it was the only thing that spoiled my enjoyment of the movie.Sound:Nothing special, really. It was fine, and I haven't noticed it for most of the time. The ending theme was nice, but that's all. The new version of Dango Daikazoku was cute and feet with the style of the movie.Story:The story was great. There were even some scenes that almost made me cry, and some that made me laugh. As far as I saw from the series, the story in the movie was better. I haven't played the game,but I think that the meaning behind CLANNAD was transferred better in the movie. A lot of the changed scenes fet just right in the movie. The fact that they've 'jumped' from the past to the present kept me interested, and the change of mood of each scene made a lot of Impact on me, and it was a great idea. Just KEY's style, and there was no disappointment here for me.Character:The characters personality was kind of different from the anime. Kyou's (really minor role) personality was completely different from the anime, and Tomoya was kind of strange to me. But hey, that may be just my imagination. But besides that, the characters were great. Each of the main characters has gone through development, especially Tomoya. The scene with his father and the lat scene were just great, and almost made me cry.Enjoyment + Overall:I think that the only bad thing here was the art, the rest ware really good. The implementation of this movie was wonderful, and I've enjoyed every minute of it.

As for After Story, I absolutely adore the show but let\'s be real here: the first eight episodes were HORRIBLE and the way it all ended made it lose a LOT of points in my book and the books of many others. At the behest of one of my friends, I decided to give Clannad: The Motion Picture a try and it managed to do EVERYTHING that the TV series failed...to do for me. Is it perfect? Not at all, but you know what? It\'s a million leagues better than the first season of the TV series and it\'s certainly something that should be watched by all, especially people who went into the first season and came out completely and totally underwhelmed.Clannad: The Motion Picture is actually the first adaptation of the Clannad visual novel. It was made by Toei Animation in 2007 but it was promptly overshadowed by the TV series produced by Kyoto Animation a year later. Despite my rather low opinion of Toei Animation in general, I must say that they really did a great job with the adaptation. If you\'re one of those people who believe film adaptations will always be inferior to their televised counterparts, hear me out: making a film adaptation of something (especially visual novels, given that they have so many nuances that just don\'t translate into another medium) is one of the most thankless jobs anyone can ever do. Whereas a TV show has the benefit of more time to tell a story, movies have to deal with a fixed time slot that isn\'t broken down into smaller segments so the audience has to watch the entire thing in one sitting.In a perfect world, every film adaptation in the world would be 100% faithful to the source material and we wouldn\'t have so many people complaining how the source material is infinitely superior to the adaptation. Alack, this is reality and not every irrelevant detail from the source material you happened to like can be included in the finished product. Things have to be cut out for the sake of both time and narrative consistency. From this standpoint, Toei Animation really did a great job as they took everything that they could work with from the visual novel and scrapped whatever didn\'t work within the context of the movie. They also made some alterations wherever possible so that the entire work would be a self-contained story and didn\'t force you to take up the source material or another adaptation just for a sense of solution. If you read all of this and you\'re STILL fretting over the small details, keep in mind that this is an entirely separate work from the TV series and the visual novel. Just think of this movie as an alternate universe version of Clannad and go from there.With all of that nastiness out of the way, let\'s talk about how events actually play out in Clannad: The Motion Picture. Simply put, this movie\'s the more direct adaptation of the Nagisa route from the Clannad visual novel. Instead of having Tomoya bounce around from girl to girl until he settles down with Nagisa, the focus of the narrative stays with Tomoya and Nagisa throughout the entire movie. We get to see how that fateful encounter with Nagisa at the bottom of the hill all those years ago went on to affect Tomoya\'s life in ways he never thought possible as well as his growth as an individual. That actually brings me to what I like most about Clannad in general: Tomoya himself.I don\'t like Clannad because of the romance. Hell, I\'d fucking HATE this series if I focused solely on the romance. What really made me take a liking to Clannad in the first place was Tomoya and how relatable he actually is (well, for me at least). At face value, Tomoya is your standard visual novel adaptation lead: he\'s a fairly good-looking teenager with a snarky demeanour. However, Clannad goes above and beyond when it came down to how he was written. He\'s more than just a standard visual novel lead, he\'s like an actual person. He has goals, has struggles of his own, he\'s got emotions and all that stuff. Think of it like this: as much as I adored White Album 2, Haruki was no better than a self-insert protagonist and I couldn\'t find myself wanting to care about him one way or the other. Tomoya on the other hand is a far cry from a self-insert protagonist and what\'s more is that I actually find myself wanting him to succeed in his endeavours and I actually want things to end up happy for him in the end.On a slightly different note, Nagisa was also quite a delightful character. Whilst the TV series in general portrayed her as a moeblob/idealised girlfriend character that I couldn\'t find myself caring about one way or the other, Clannad: The Motion Picture gave her an identity of her own. She still has that weak constitution, don\'t get me wrong. However, she isn\'t written in such a manner that\'s meant to evoke an emotional response out of you. She\'s strong-willed, endearing (and this time, endearing like a human and not like a beagle puppy), and I actually found myself caring about Nagisa as an individual. That\'s something the TV series completely failed to do for me, by the way.On another note, the other characters were also quite lovely to say the least. For one thing, I don\'t find myself feeling visceral hatred toward Sunohara since he\'s not an insufferable moron. Sure, Sunohara is still a headstrong oaf, but he\'s actually an oaf that makes me laugh rather than scowl in frustration. Speaking of which, Nagisa\'s parents are back and Akio never ceases to make me laugh in earnest. He\'s just as entertaining and likeable as he was in the TV series. Speaking of which, Sanae\'s here too and I don\'t find myself wanting her to be crucified by Shion anymore (probably because she\'s not making shitty bread and dating high school students behind her husband\'s back anymore)! So that\'s always nice.Going off on a tangent, this movie managed to make me laugh... a lot, actually. The comedy throughout the entire movie was spot-on and didn\'t get annoying after a while. Tomoya\'s still snarking away at everything and Sunohara\'s antics actually make me laugh raucously instead of making me want him to die a gruesome death because he was annoying. This movie also knows when to cut the crap and take itself seriously whereas the first season suffered from extensive cases of mood whiplash. Yeah... you can tell that I don\'t hold the first season in that high of a regard, right?From a production standpoint, Clannad: The Motion Picture is an odd case to talk about. The watercolour stills used throughout the movie were beautifully designed as were the backgrounds and decorations and such, but the character models were rather lacklustre. The animation itself is more of the same, and that\'s actually kind of disappointing since Toei Animation tends to give their films more budget than they give their TV shows. Everything still looks great, don\'t get me wrong but from an aesthetic standpoint, Kyoto Animation spoiled Clannad in ways that Toei Animation never did.Sound-wise, the OST is quite lovely. It\'s mostly remixed tracks from the visual novel and it does lack certain tear-jerking themes like ""Yuki Nohara"" from After Story but it\'s the way the OST is used that really makes it stand a cut above the first season. On that note, the English dub is also quite lovely (take THAT, you mouth-breathing weeaboo dub haters!). Whereas the first season was quite hit/miss given that Steven Foster was the ADR director there was no shortage of moments that sounded awkward or whatever, the movie shares its ADR director with After Story\'s. Everything sounded natural to say the least, the voice actors did an amazing job as always, and all that stuff. Really, what more could I want?Would I say I enjoyed this movie? Well... yeah, I enjoyed it a lot. Whilst I still prefer the TV series (mostly because of After Story, but that\'s beside the point), the movie managed to do what the TV series failed to do for me. It gets to the point quicker, there\'s less meandering, Nagisa actually has a personality, and so on and so forth. If you\'re someone who has never watched Clannad before, I\'d actually go so far as to recommend you watch this movie in lieu of the first season and then pick up After Story from Episode 9 onward. I really don\'t understand why this movie gets so much hate. It does what it does incredibly well. Who cares if the other girls don\'t get their arcs adapted? If you want Kotomi, Tomoyo, Fuko, or Kyou, go play the goddamn VN or something. I swear, the shit some people end up doing confuses me to no end. Anyway, that\'s all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I\'m out. Peace :) to do for me. Is it perfect? Not at all, but you know what? It\'s a million leagues better than the first season of the TV series and it\'s certainly something that should be watched by all, especially people who went into the first season and came out completely and totally underwhelmed.Clannad: The Motion Picture is actually the first adaptation of the Clannad visual novel. It was made by Toei Animation in 2007 but it was promptly overshadowed by the TV series produced by Kyoto Animation a year later. Despite my rather low opinion of Toei Animation in general, I must say that they really did a great job with the adaptation. If you\'re one of those people who believe film adaptations will always be inferior to their televised counterparts, hear me out: making a film adaptation of something (especially visual novels, given that they have so many nuances that just don\'t translate into another medium) is one of the most thankless jobs anyone can ever do. Whereas a TV show has the benefit of more time to tell a story, movies have to deal with a fixed time slot that isn\'t broken down into smaller segments so the audience has to watch the entire thing in one sitting.In a perfect world, every film adaptation in the world would be 100% faithful to the source material and we wouldn\'t have so many people complaining how the source material is infinitely superior to the adaptation. Alack, this is reality and not every irrelevant detail from the source material you happened to like can be included in the finished product. Things have to be cut out for the sake of both time and narrative consistency. From this standpoint, Toei Animation really did a great job as they took everything that they could work with from the visual novel and scrapped whatever didn\'t work within the context of the movie. They also made some alterations wherever possible so that the entire work would be a self-contained story and didn\'t force you to take up the source material or another adaptation just for a sense of solution. If you read all of this and you\'re STILL fretting over the small details, keep in mind that this is an entirely separate work from the TV series and the visual novel. Just think of this movie as an alternate universe version of Clannad and go from there.With all of that nastiness out of the way, let\'s talk about how events actually play out in Clannad: The Motion Picture. Simply put, this movie\'s the more direct adaptation of the Nagisa route from the Clannad visual novel. Instead of having Tomoya bounce around from girl to girl until he settles down with Nagisa, the focus of the narrative stays with Tomoya and Nagisa throughout the entire movie. We get to see how that fateful encounter with Nagisa at the bottom of the hill all those years ago went on to affect Tomoya\'s life in ways he never thought possible as well as his growth as an individual.

Feedback is always welcome and with that, I\'m out. Peace :)', ""After watching the whole collection of Clannad (both Clannad and Clannad After Story) I am very disappointed at this movie. This movie is a very big let down from one the best anime I have ever watched (yes, I cried -.-). The voice actors are different, the art is a bit 'off', the characters seem to act slightly different than to their attitude in the actual anime, and overall it just sucks. It is so bad that I had to delete it off my hard drive, which is something I don't like to do to my anime collection, but this movie is THAT HORRIBLE. So...if you haven't watched the movie I highly suggest that you DON'T WATCH IT, because you are just wasting your time. It is better off to go to the next anime/manga/visual novel/light novel/hentai planned in your list instead. if you haven't watched the movie I highly suggest that you DON'T WATCH IT, because you are just wasting your time. It is better off to go to the next anime/manga/visual novel/light novel/hentai planned in your list instead."", '""Сlannad"" begins from the visual novel released by Key studio in the 2004th year. After, based on the story, was published 4 manga series, animated film and two anime series.So, if you\'re wondering whether to watch a movie after watching the 2-seasons of the series, this review will be helpful to you.The story begins as the original, Tomoya Okazaki studying in senior year of high school. As he been a child, his mother died, because of this, his father had started drinking. Later, in a fight with a drunken father Okazaki injured his shoulder and was forced to give up basketball, relations between the two...soured. In school, he meets a strange Nagisa, who wants to restore the drama club.Of course the first thing that catches the eye is Art, he is different from the TV series, as the in animation involved Toei Animation (in the TV series, the animation is engaged Kyoto animation)So let\'s focus on the differences between the film and the TV series:One of the main differences is the number of characters. Many characters not at all in the film. In Movie we have: Kyou, Sakagami Tomoyo, Sunohara, Ibuki-sensei (but her daughter not featured in the film), Yoshino Yusuke, Sanae, Akio, Okazaki Father, and of the actual protagonists.Don\'t have: Miyazawa, Ryou (sister Kyou), Misae, Mei (Sunohara sister), what is quite strange, all of these characters are interesting, in the novel (and in the TV show) they have a lot of time, but there should be consider the following facts: the film was released before the series and the film lasts only 94 minutes, and the budget, as we see, are not allowed to use more time.As for the characters, they also have differences. For example the character of the main characters, in my opinion, is different from the series. Okazaki, throughout the film seems not at its best, both at the beginning and at the end, serves as a not very successful and cheerful teenager apparently here present share Shounen genre that shows the formation of male personality. If in the TV show, he never allows himself to be rude to other people, even though we know about his dim past, here in the very first scene is noticeable that he is building in itself is not the best person for dialogue.Furukawa Nagisa also slightly different character here, In the TV series,  she is not self-confident personality, very shy of other people, here a little bit wrong, it appears as a character, who have a clear objective,  restore the drama club and nothing can stop this. ""I\'ll draw and 100 of the same, how much will need to draw and hung everywhere, ""she says. She still polite to people, is in poor health and appears to us as a very gentle man. Also, before the performance, While reading a monologue, she is absolutely not worried, moment of maintaining her morale , alas, is мissing.So throughout the show, Okazaki has a dream, a nightmare from which he wakes up in a sweat, it is known is the illusory world that is shown in the TV series and  in novel, as you can see, these two worlds are linked. In the series, in an illusory world, we see a girl and a robot, in the movie, we are see the robot clown, later he approaches the ""Tree of Hope"", which supposedly symbolizes Okazaki meeting with Nagisa in the real world, but in the TV series, we don\'t know from whence Okazaki knows the story and the script for the scenes, as soon as he notices that Nagisa shows on Scene it is his dream, he realizes that they see the same dream throughout his life, touched by monologue, assuming that this is the fate, on the emotions he tells about his love to NagisaFurther, the story continues of the words of Okazaki, after the so-called ""White Darkness"" (After the death of Nagisa and Ushio birth). He starts talk about how little time they spent together. He tells how he worked with Yoshino, (In the movie Sunohara also worked with Yoshino, while in school), he tells, how they had fun together, they even called themselves and their friends ""Great Dango Family"" (Nagisa loved this).Toward the end of movie father Okazaki comes to him and said: ""You\'re just like me"". This words bring Okazaki rage, though the father is right, Okazaki refuses to listen to him and drives out of the house, which leads to the end of the dialogue.The end of the movie is average, not the worst, but Ushio does not take part in any way in story. As in the series, after Nagisa\'s death, Okazaki refuses to communicate with anyone, his father, asking friends son, so to speak the whole ""Great Dango Family"", help him (son), not to repeat the story of father exactly the same as him. Okazaki was forcibly are taken on a journey.Whatever it was, thanks to friends, Okazaki meets Ushio and when she runs to him, he notices that she stumbles and then it wake up his father\'s feelings and love for child, He catches her and understands that he loved her with all his heart.And yet, even though a lot of things missing in the movie, it is necessary to understand that he went out before TV series, although it was filmed on the novel, and the novel has all these characters (Fuuko, Ryou etc.). Even knowing the whole story of Clannad original and novel, watch this film interesting every minute as if slowly hypnotizes you and you already can not come back from the screen.Clannad Movie shows how good can be an original story, though shortened in some places. soured.

I paused it for a second and ended up...watching the Suzumiya Haruhi no Gekisou concert, and completely forgot I was watching this movie for a good 30 min until I remembered I hadn't finished it. The animation quality wasn't really up to par on this one. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. I think the worst aspect of this movie was that the music didn't fit with the movie AT ALL, unlike the Clannad TV series in which the music flows perfectly. The music wasn't bad, but put together with the Clannad atmosphere, it was horrible....and then came the last 30 minutes of the movie. Holy shit that was amazing. The ending of this movie is the closest i've ever been to crying during an anime or a movie. I'm trying not to spoil too much, but the ending was breathtaking.I'm giving this an 8/10, even though it disagrees with my individual ratings on this review. (They end up to be something like 6.8). I would've rated this a 6 or a 7 like my review numbers said, but along with Sunohara being so damn funny the entire movie, the amazing ending bumped it up to an 8.Thanks for reading,Max/Pokedude97 watching the Suzumiya Haruhi no Gekisou concert, and completely forgot I was watching this movie for a good 30 min until I remembered I hadn't finished it.

There are so many things wrong with those movie I don't even know where to start, so I'll do each category sequentially.STORY:Meandering, directionless, and totally boring until the last half hour or so. Except for the last thirty seconds or so(which were actually pretty heartwarming) the ending was the lamest attempt at a feel-good ending I've ever seen. It's hard to say more without spoiling anything, but let's just say if I were Okazaki I would have been really pissed off at what my friends did to &quot;cheer me up&quot;.ART:Okay, it's...pretty damn hideous.SOUND:Didn't even notice it.

It has a small part of the story that is near the serie but when you watch it you will se that they focus more on nagisa and okazaki then the series did.Story: in short, I loved the story. It was alot better then the one in the serie, why? Because they focus more on the Nagisa &amp; okazaki relationship and they dont focus on the other characters so much like the series did. And because of that the movie...surpasses the series with horse lengths. And the movie continues more after were the series stopped and you will get surprised what happens (No spoiler here)Art: I completley loved the art, the thing with the animetion is that you got that little old school feeling when you watched it and that is completly my taste. It was thought some scenes were they did some weird moves that looked terribly awful. But there wasnt so many of those so that gives the art a high score. They also made a really nice work with the coloring. The color looked good and they were good with the shadowing so it almost feelt like it was a real movie.Sound: nothing special really, it feelt little weird in the start, because some characters had the same voice actors as the serie but some didn&acute;t. and that lowers the score just because that. But they managed good with the side sounds, trains, cars, music etc and thats a big plus (+).Character: okazaki and nagisa was alot better character wise in the movie then in the serie, but they dont focus so much on the other side characters. But I was expecting that from a movie that is 1.5 hour. The serie was alot longer and could there for focus more on them. But I loved that they didnt show exactly everything with the side characters in the movie and focused more on the Mains.Enjoyment: Was outstanding I got completley lost when I watched it and I can not stop thinking about how good it was. I think it was because it was alot shorter then the serie. The serie just made you loose intress in some parts. But if you want to completley enjoy this you should watch the series first thought, Because they jumped alot in some sceenes in the movie. And you might wonder &quot;wtf happened between those scenes?&quot; if you havent watched the series.Overall: It was amasing, it was the sound that draged the score down, but if you can forget about the voice actor thing, you will completley love this movie. surpasses the series with horse lengths.

The story is watered down into a cheap soap opera.Such a nuanced and complex drama like Clannad does not work as a movie at all. Please play the VN or watch the KyoAni TV anime adaptation. It completely misses all the important nuances of such a beautiful, spiritual, and magical story. The themes of identity, growing up, and family are mostly bungled up (although, to be absolutely fair, it is probably the best they can do as a movie).The characters are shells of their former selves. All...the banter and wit which made the original work so special has been completely watered down. They don’t seem to have any character flaws whatsoever - Tomoya and Sunohara (who are boring students now - not the flawed, cynical delinquents we grew to love), Tomoya’s father, and ESPECIALLY Nagisa! Oh boy, they did her completely dirty…Did the guys at Toei ever play the actual VN?!! NAGISA IS NOT AN CONFIDENT AND HAPPY CHARACTER; this is the very antithesis of Nagisa! The themes of Clannad are completely missed with most of the characters’ vulnerability and tragedies erased.Also, the original soundtrack is barely used. One of the most memorable and magical parts of the original VN is the soundtrack which adds so much to the emotion and the essence of the story.Clannad: After Story only makes up the last 20 minutes. It’s more like ‘Clannad: After Thought’ haha.I’m giving this a light 4 out of 10. It’s probably too kind but, admittedly, I can’t stay mad at Clannad, no matter what form it’s in. I still got emotional and I’m actually impressed that a film adaptation could be possible.I didn’t mind the stuff with the ‘dreams’ - no matter how cheesy it was. And whilst ‘After Thought’ did go in a different direction to actual ‘After Story’, I actually didn’t mind it. I think it was acceptable for a 90-minute film adaptation. The ending was pretty decent.And perhaps I was too harsh on the film not exploring the original themes. It does touch on them very slightly and I can commend them for that, at least.

It thought it would be pretty cool. However, it turns out to be a bit of disappointment.I though it would focus on a specific point and make me feel something again. But no, it didn't. This movie is like a 90 mins summary of the Clannad series, season 1 and season 2. It follows the similar pattern. But they are not the same.  It seems to be a Clannad world upside down. Everything is slightly different.  Also the solution is each problem is different .This is...like telling Clannad series in a different way. Besides from this, it moves in a very very fast pace. I felt nothing except boredom when I watch this one. Everything is unclear. It lacks of information, and really confusing if I didn't watch Clannad series. For example, Kyou and Tomoyo who seems to be the villains in the beginner, all of the sudden, becomes good friends with Okazaki, (and Nagisa). Really confusing!!!The art is fine. It's nice but it's not the same as what it used to be. That is the design of character's facial, at some point, they are different. Sometimes, they look like two different person. Other than that it's great as usual.Sounds are different from the original one. The new dango theme song is pretty nice as well. Really enjoy the new one. The sound effects is okay though they're a bit unattractive.Character is another thing which disappoints me. The character is really strange. Nagisa, who's quite shy, began the conversations many times, and ask Okasaki for different things. She's braver than usual. Character suddenly has their characteristic changed. Some becomes more violent, more rude, and more responsible. This causes a bit of misunderstanding.I didn't enjoy this movie at all. Too much information to absorb in one pace. And while watching it, it really brought neither emotion nor fun, unlike original series. If you already watched Clannad series, I suggest not to watch this one. It would mess up your mind. If you haven't watched Clannad, I still suggest you not to watch this movie. Because after watching it, I don't think you will watch original Clannad. Not only that but also, it will spoil the ending and many other thing. So, ignore Clannad movie, and just watch the anime series. like telling Clannad series in a different way.

It\'s actually quite nieve to believe it would.Clannad as a TV series with two seasons over 1000 hours of information, the show lets you grow with the characters, while this movie makes it very difficult to grow that attachment to the characters, which really hinders the emotional effect it has on us viewers.It very vaguely explains the story although the flow is average, which isn\'t the best but better then a flow that is terrible.If you did watch the series watching this movie would be pointless. You\'ll be left thinking...to yourself: ""How is it possible for someone to know how powerful this story really is if they just watched the movie?""I do understand Clannad is from a visual novel, but comparing to the TV series, I am very upset. I decided that I do NOT recommend watching this if you have seen the series.The characters have a different feel to them as well. When I say this I mean it\'s almost as their personalities are different. And when the show takes a time leap, their attitudes grow in relation to the series, which is confusing when watching the movie, not knowing how they got there.In the end I give this movie a 5/10.I love Clannad, but this movie just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. to yourself: ""How is it possible for someone to know how powerful this story really is if they just watched the movie?""I do understand Clannad is from a visual novel, but comparing to the TV series, I am very upset.

It wasn't a waste of time, in my opinion, but it could have been better.StoryBasically, the story is about the sole relationship of Tomoya and Nagisa. It stars just as in the CLANNAD anime, with them meeting on the hill towards the school. The main thing I liked about the story was that it changed the lines and the events. The secondary characters didn't get too much time to actually have a story but that's normal in a movie (take a look at AIR the movie) and...I'm honestly not bothered by it, the story about Nagisa and Tomoya was enough for me. Even though I was expecting a bit more drama and touching moments, I think it was pretty much great, not to mention the last scene was very touching for me.ArtWell, the art was fair, they kept the original movie drawing they got from AIR the movie and it's not that I don't like it, but it's a bit bland. Could have been better, if you ask me, and I wish they put a little more effort in the backgrounds and scenery. Well, maybe I'm just used to the KyoAni awesome animation, who knows.SoundNot much to say here, it was good but nothing more. The one thing I enjoyed at full was the ending song (1st one) that's a different version of the CLANNAD Tv ending &quot;Dango Daikazoku&quot;, sung by Eufonius, and I love that band. The one thing that really bothered me was the change of the Tomoya seyuu, I would of liked it to remain the same since it took a good 15 minutes to get used to it.CharacterIt kind of lacked. I'm honestly giving it a 7 out of good will. Let's just say that I was expecting a bit more character development from the others but that's just the way it is. They kept the original personalities for most of 'em except for Sakagami Tomoyo. She seemed a bit different, and being a Tomoyo fan it was a bit of an eye-twitcher. At least they changed Sunohara to the real punk he is in the game (haven't played it but I know he was tons tougher than the Tv anime).EnjoymentI enjoyed it. It has it's bad parts but I can't say it wasn't good. I was expecting a bit more coming from CLANNAD but I think I'm too much of a Key/KyoAni sucker.

I had a free time so decided to see the movie, don't know why. I don't know why the serie is more popular than the movie and why this movie is so underrated. Personally I think this movie is much better than the anime. The anime  is kinda slow and boring with lots of nonsense elements not to mention very childish. The movie on the other hand is more realistic and the story is amazing and emotional. I mean I was crying like nuts...the last half hour and even started to like Nagisa. So give this movie a chance, it's not that lame as people say, it's a lot better and deserves a chance. the last half hour and even started to like Nagisa.

It\'s just horrible how they picked an awesome anime and made a movie of it but it ends up one of the worst thing I have ever seen.While watching the movie my only thoughts were ""this is not how it happen"", and some people may think ""oh it\'s just a movie, of course there would be some cut scene but that doesn\'t mean the movie is bad"", let me answer that really quick... YES I DOES, Clannad is an anime that tell us the story of those 2 teens and their friends, the whole sequel of the anime was made in a way that we could understand each and everyone of the characteres, it was thanks to that that we were able to love the anime, to love their story and in the movie you just can\'t find that.If you are a huge fan of Clannad like me then please follow my advice and don\'t ruin your idea of Clannad by watching this moive.Now I apologize for any writing mistake that I may have done while writing this review but hey, nobody is perfect right? :D something like this to Clannad??

I must say that I was disappointed ... The designs are ugly and way below compared to drawings of Kyoto Animation.The film format is also ill-chosen to fit a VN and there is a lot of change that does not comply with the VN (like Dango music that was where the nightmare of change Tomoya which I think is not present in the VN).Moreover, the film is sloppy it does not release the emotions we had with Clannad (especially After Story and is increasingly the most part intérresante was the most...sloppy part). In short I would not recommend this version. sloppy part). In short I would not recommend this version.', 'Actually i watched clannad movie after anime, anyway in my opinion it was horrible, simply""fast forward"" type, there was no such an expression of feelings or excitment like in anime series that i felt, I also did not like the story line. if i had to rate it independently and saw it before anime i think there was no such a big difference.I was very dissapointed from the movie of Clannad, i expected much more.(sorry for my grammar) ', 'I always felt this movie was so underrated because of the series. I think the main reason why is because the movie is basically a summary of the entire series, but the movie is so well paced and doesn\'t feel rushed at all unlike most other anime summary movies. The ending is even more realistic. Well let\'s get this review going!Story: Like the series this movie revolves around a high school boy named Tomoya who meets this young girl named Nagisa at a hill on the way to school underneath cherry blossom trees. He decides to talk to her and from then on their relationship...blossoms. The romance is sweet and focuses more on the dreams that Nagisa had for acting and how Tomoya grew to realize his feelings for her in a heartwarming way. It\'s something that I myself could relate too. There are many feels in this so beware of crying unless you\'ve seen the series although since it\'s more real to life so you might want to get a tissue box.Animation: The art is good, but not as good as the series. It has the same character designs, but the lighting and beauty of it is more outdated compared to the main series. It\'s not terrible or even bad. It\'s mostly just good.Sound: The music was beautiful like in the series. The voice acting was quite good too and if you enjoy dubs then this one is pretty good, not the greatest dub ever, but I still think it\'s good. The music is what I really enjoyed about it though. It truly matched the mood of the story so well.Characters: Tomoya is the main male protagonist. The main girl protaginist is Nagisa as earlier mentioned. Tomoya has a sad past that causes him to act like a delinquent although he\'s truly a kind and caring person who helps Nagisa to accomplish her dreams of performing on stage. Nagisa however is a very sweet girl who can be shy  and sometimes she even says the name of one of her favorite foods out loud to herself so that way she\'ll work up the courage to do something like go to the drama club She loves to sing that cute and adorable song, Dango, Dango, Dango, Dango, Dango.There\'s also Sonohara who is Tomoya\'s best friend and is mostly there for comedic relief.Then eventually you get to see Ushio. She\'s so adorable. All she says is ""Daddy,"" but she\'s the cutest. By the time you her you\'ll literally cry from your heart.Enjoyment: I honestly loved this movie and yes I saw it before the series. I\'m still deciding which I like better. The series or movie. No matter what I think this movie was how a summary anime movie should be made... Just so well paced and beautiful on every level for me. I enjoyed this because of how much the characters made me love them. Nagisa and Tomoya are still my favorite couple to this day and the movie is no exception. I also loved the true to life ending and it made me cry out from my heart ans soul. I just love this masterpiece without a doubt.Overall: If you love romance drama anime then it\'s worth the watch if you don\'t feel like watching the entire series and it might get you interested in the main series like it did for me. I hope you check out this awesome anime movie! At least do it to see Ushio or hear the adorable Dango song. Tomoya is my personal favorite though Nagisa and Tomoya are like ying and yang.Ending quote:    ""But the one thing I will never forget is that smiling face.""*Bursts in tears* blossoms.

And as impressive as those individual elements may be, you can\'t carry an entire series on them alone for the same reason you can\'t carry it on just animation. That may work in a video game where the excellent interactivity can carry you through some semi-major plot failings (the Tomb Raider reboot comes to mind), but in an anime, it\'s fucking...jarring and it gets old real fast. Oh, and they\'re never funny. So if anybody wants to know why I don\'t like Zvezda, Classroom Crisis, Charlotte, and whatever the fuck that Plastic Memories thing was, that\'s why.Basically, I like plot and story to go hand-in-hand. And in most visual novel anime (and most anime for that matter), plot and story seem to be taking turns in a game of Monopoly with ""story"" being lousy at playing the game. Whilst there may be one or two other exceptions to the rule, Toei\'s Key films are probably the only visual novel adaptations I\'ve watched in where it feels like stuff is actually happening on a constant basis, which is part of the reason why I have a certain fondness for them. Other reasons include decent characterization that drives the story, having some fucking closure to something major without any chance of a sequel, and (most of all) the drama actually being kinda good. But then again, it\'s Osamu Dezaki. Saying his drama is good at this point in time is like saying Ikuhara anime are delightfully quirky.So the film shares the same plot beats you know from the Clannad story - Tomoya meeting Nagisa on a hill, him having a bum shoulder, having a kid with Nagisa, Nagisa going to heaven, etc. etc. - and we see everything through Tomoya\'s eyes, but they\'re executed very differently here in the same way Majora\'s Mask is different from Ocarina of Time despite having so much in common. The story actually takes place during the After Story portion where Tomoya is going through a rainy depression, causing him to flashback to the school stuff as he narrates about the girl who would become his wife and how the two got to know each other over time and how they meet other characters along the way and all the other expected beats you\'d expect from a shoujo romance.Through the use of this narrative trick, Clannad maintains a large amount of focus as we follow a guy through his self-defeating journey towards adulthood with the relationship as a central focus not unlike 5 Cm/s. But there\'s more to this narrative trick than summarizing the story in ninety minutes or resembling the most critically acclaimed romance anime of all-time. Said change to how to tell the Clannad story actually evolves into a magnifying glass that really sheds a whole new light on that ""dating sim"" style of storytelling that was popular around the early-to-mid 00s and that Clannad happened to bring to an inexplicably popular level even before it became an anime. In that sense, it\'s basically Monogatari if Monogatari wasn\'t fucking boring, padded, meme-grabbing, hypocritical trash.Let\'s face it, there\'s nothing inherently wrong with the whole ""boy saving girl"" thing and the reverse is true as well as long as they don\'t make the characters to be cocky bitches whilst doing so. Wish-fulfillment like that is present in some of the most epic and well-revered of classic dramas and just because they tend to have better characterization shouldn\'t excuse that fact. I\'m still calling bullshit on Ushio and Tora\'s flimsy justification on why the characters at the center of most of the episodic conflicts happen to be young females who have a tendency to not keep their clothes safe whenever a monster appears in their vicinity. Yes, it came from a different time than stuff like Green Green or Da Capo, but that doesn\'t exempt it from criticism when it gets adapted in present-day, especially given the other changes the creators are doing in order to cram over thirty volumes worth of material into 39 episodes.By directing Clannad like one of his 80s classics with all the split-screens and sakura petals and tributes to other 80s-90s anime romance dramas and such, Dezaki is saying that in theory, the source material\'s premise is no less stupid than say Aim for the Ace. I mean let\'s face the truth: all dramas are emotionally manipulative in the same manner that all skunks smell bad or all Uwe Boll movies are godawful. But as Jean-Luc Godard once said, ""It\'s not where you take things from — it\'s where you take them to."" No, there\'s nothing wrong with Nagisa existing just to be an emotional support whose main role is to die in order to have a baby. Lara\'s crew in the Tomb Raider reboot pretty much exist to die in order to be a part of her character development. Do we complain about that? Well okay, some do, but I very much doubt most people who like the game are fans of Maeda.But at the same time, this movie is aware of how fucking stupid the VN adaptation boom was, and still is to a degree, and whilst it doesn\'t hate it (why else would Kotomi get a two-second cameo as a band conductor in this film?), it can\'t help but poke fun at it by vastly changing the character roles. In this interpretation, Tomoya is basically the Key girl that needs help because he\'s an entirely reactionary character who mostly just gets lead around by Nagisa, Sunohara, and whoever else managed to make it into this film, and most of the crying aspects fall on him. Oh and he\'s voiced Kenji Nojima, which can be a bit off-putting if you\'re used to Yuuichi Nakamura\'s pimp voice - but given he also voiced Tatsuya from Mahouka, I think a fair amount of people won\'t mind at all.There\'s more gender diversity in this iteration since a bunch of the girls got excluded whilst all the important male characters get to stay, and they all have lives separate from Tomoya regardless of their sex. Most of them show up because someone Tomoya knows is closely associated with \'em, rather than being close with Tomoya personally. But at the same time, they\'re still the most important aspect of the story. Just in a different way that acknowledges the visual novel story\'s love for quirky supporting cast members to make our hero feel more important whilst being a middle-finger to the power-fantasy/sexist elements that said medium is most famous for. Without wishing to spoil anything, the ending of this film is drastically different from the series in that it ends with the cast reuniting to take the story in their hands one last time in a way that really got to me. My love of Saturday Night Fever\'s ending is all but well-documented at this point, and I think this film plays what I like about said ending with a take on the power of friendship/family formula that works.With all that said, even if you don\'t appreciate or believe the whole meta-narrative thing I think this film goes for, the Clannad movie still functions well as a standard romance drama about a boy meeting a girl, falling in love with her over a shared dream that is admittedly woven into the narrative as elegantly as a crocodile is woven into Swan Lake, realizing he hasn\'t grown up once he loses her, and taking the first step towards being an adult when he\'s forced to confront his hypocrisy head-on. As I said earlier, Toei\'s version automatically has the advantage over every other visual novel anime ever by having the characters make stuff happen on a regular basis and not having said stuff consist of nothing more than a bunch of disjointed setpieces and character types. Two automatic gold stars in this accursed genre, amirite? It also helps that Nagisa stays dead in this version and all the characters take themselves seriously for the most part, rarely pausing the story for a minute to show off some stupid quirk.Sunohara definitely comes off a lot better in this version of the story, that\'s for sure. In the more popular iterations of Clannad, he was an obnoxious idiot who kept challenging girls to fights and abandoning his sister over a misunderstanding whose very concept was so retarded I\'m not even sure how it made it past the editing stage. But in this iteration, he\'s a lot more mature - as well as a bit more monkey-like, but he got a few laughs out of me so I let it slide. From getting a job in order to support his family to beating up a bunch of students who were invalidating Nagisa\'s posters, this is the kind of friend you want by your side, even though he commits acts of public urination from time-to-time. And the other characters are fine for the most part. Tomoyo and Kyou could have been extradited without changing the story in any significant way and I can\'t say I\'m a big fan of Nagisa\'s childishness even though she\'s a more proactive character here, but some things just never change.I\'ve heard a lot of people dismiss this thing as a summary film - which wouldn\'t make sense considering it came out a few weeks before the series did - but there\'s way more going on in this adaptation than just adapting all the Nagisa parts whilst everyone else\'s story can all get run over by a lawnmower. But labels aside, this particularly summary film does what many people consider to not be possible and make Clannad good. I say it makes it great. With a tightened narrative, well-rounded characters, a very 80s soundtrack that I admit to liking way more than I should, and changes to the source that show its love for the VN boom whilst criticizing its more unsavory aspects through the vein of an 80s drama, Clannad: The Motion Picture is not only the only good Key anime, but the only good VN-related anime I\'ve ever seen (unless you count Psycho-Pass, which I don\'t), and nothing that\'s come out before or since has been able to change my mind on that. The animation is garbage, but apparently I\'m the only one who doesn\'t let that bother me. I like this film and I\'m saddened that Dezaki had to leave us before giving us a version of Little Busters that wasn\'t like having your head shoved into an oven. jarring and it gets old real fast. Oh, and they\'re never funny. So if anybody wants to know why I don\'t like Zvezda, Classroom Crisis, Charlotte, and whatever the fuck that Plastic Memories thing was, that\'s why.Basically, I like plot and story to go hand-in-hand. And in most visual novel anime (and most anime for that matter), plot and story seem to be taking turns in a game of Monopoly with ""story"" being lousy at playing the game. Whilst there may be one or two other exceptions to the rule, Toei\'s Key films are probably the only visual novel adaptations I\'ve watched in where it feels like stuff is actually happening on a constant basis, which is part of the reason why I have a certain fondness for them. Other reasons include decent characterization that drives the story, having some fucking closure to something major without any chance of a sequel, and (most of all) the drama actually being kinda good. But then again, it\'s Osamu Dezaki. Saying his drama is good at this point in time is like saying Ikuhara anime are delightfully quirky.So the film shares the same plot beats you know from the Clannad story - Tomoya meeting Nagisa on a hill, him having a bum shoulder, having a kid with Nagisa, Nagisa going to heaven, etc. etc. - and we see everything through Tomoya\'s eyes, but they\'re executed very differently here in the same way Majora\'s Mask is different from Ocarina of Time despite having so much in common. The story actually takes place during the After Story portion where Tomoya is going through a rainy depression, causing him to flashback to the school stuff as he narrates about the girl who would become his wife and how the two got to know each other over time and how they meet other characters along the way and all the other expected beats you\'d expect from a shoujo romance.Through the use of this narrative trick, Clannad maintains a large amount of focus as we follow a guy through his self-defeating journey towards adulthood with the relationship as a central focus not unlike 5 Cm/s. But there\'s more to this narrative trick than summarizing the story in ninety minutes or resembling the most critically acclaimed romance anime of all-time. Said change to how to tell the Clannad story actually evolves into a magnifying glass that really sheds a whole new light on that ""dating sim"" style of storytelling that was popular around the early-to-mid 00s and that Clannad happened to bring to an inexplicably popular level even before it became an anime. In that sense, it\'s basically Monogatari if Monogatari wasn\'t fucking boring, padded, meme-grabbing, hypocritical trash.Let\'s face it, there\'s nothing inherently wrong with the whole ""boy saving girl"" thing and the reverse is true as well as long as they don\'t make the characters to be cocky bitches whilst doing so. Wish-fulfillment like that is present in some of the most epic and well-revered of classic dramas and just because they tend to have better characterization shouldn\'t excuse that fact. I\'m still calling bullshit on Ushio and Tora\'s flimsy justification on why the characters at the center of most of the episodic conflicts happen to be young females who have a tendency to not keep their clothes safe whenever a monster appears in their vicinity. Yes, it came from a different time than stuff like Green Green or Da Capo, but that doesn\'t exempt it from criticism when it gets adapted in present-day, especially given the other changes the creators are doing in order to cram over thirty volumes worth of material into 39 episodes.By directing Clannad like one of his 80s classics with all the split-screens and sakura petals and tributes to other 80s-90s anime romance dramas and such, Dezaki is saying that in theory, the source material\'s premise is no less stupid than say Aim for the Ace. I mean let\'s face the truth: all dramas are emotionally manipulative in the same manner that all skunks smell bad or all Uwe Boll movies are godawful. But as Jean-Luc Godard once said, ""It\'s not where you take things from — it\'s where you take them to."" No, there\'s nothing wrong with Nagisa existing just to be an emotional support whose main role is to die in order to have a baby. Lara\'s crew in the Tomb Raider reboot pretty much exist to die in order to be a part of her character development. Do we complain about that? Well okay, some do, but I very much doubt most people who like the game are fans of Maeda.But at the same time, this movie is aware of how fucking stupid the VN adaptation boom was, and still is to a degree, and whilst it doesn\'t hate it (why else would Kotomi get a two-second cameo as a band conductor in this film?), it can\'t help but poke fun at it by vastly changing the character roles. In this interpretation, Tomoya is basically the Key girl that needs help because he\'s an entirely reactionary character who mostly just gets lead around by Nagisa, Sunohara, and whoever else managed to make it into this film, and most of the crying aspects fall on him. Oh and he\'s voiced Kenji Nojima, which can be a bit off-putting if you\'re used to Yuuichi Nakamura\'s pimp voice - but given he also voiced Tatsuya from Mahouka, I think a fair amount of people won\'t mind at all.There\'s more gender diversity in this iteration since a bunch of the girls got excluded whilst all the important male characters get to stay, and they all have lives separate from Tomoya regardless of their sex. Most of them show up because someone Tomoya knows is closely associated with \'em, rather than being close with Tomoya personally. But at the same time, they\'re still the most important aspect of the story. Just in a different way that acknowledges the visual novel story\'s love for quirky supporting cast members to make our hero feel more important whilst being a middle-finger to the power-fantasy/sexist elements that said medium is most famous for. Without wishing to spoil anything, the ending of this film is drastically different from the series in that it ends with the cast reuniting to take the story in their hands one last time in a way that really got to me. My love of Saturday Night Fever\'s ending is all but well-documented at this point, and I think this film plays what I like about said ending with a take on the power of friendship/family formula that works.With all that said, even if you don\'t appreciate or believe the whole meta-narrative thing I think this film goes for, the Clannad movie still functions well as a standard romance drama about a boy meeting a girl, falling in love with her over a shared dream that is admittedly woven into the narrative as elegantly as a crocodile is woven into Swan Lake, realizing he hasn\'t grown up once he loses her, and taking the first step towards being an adult when he\'s forced to confront his hypocrisy head-on. As I said earlier, Toei\'s version automatically has the advantage over every other visual novel anime ever by having the characters make stuff happen on a regular basis and not having said stuff consist of nothing more than a bunch of disjointed setpieces and character types. Two automatic gold stars in this accursed genre, amirite? It also helps that Nagisa stays dead in this version and all the characters take themselves seriously for the most part, rarely pausing the story for a minute to show off some stupid quirk.Sunohara definitely comes off a lot better in this version of the story, that\'s for sure. In the more popular iterations of Clannad, he was an obnoxious idiot who kept challenging girls to fights and abandoning his sister over a misunderstanding whose very concept was so retarded I\'m not even sure how it made it past the editing stage. But in this iteration, he\'s a lot more mature - as well as a bit more monkey-like, but he got a few laughs out of me so I let it slide. From getting a job in order to support his family to beating up a bunch of students who were invalidating Nagisa\'s posters, this is the kind of friend you want by your side, even though he commits acts of public urination from time-to-time. And the other characters are fine for the most part. Tomoyo and Kyou could have been extradited without changing the story in any significant way and I can\'t say I\'m a big fan of Nagisa\'s childishness even though she\'s a more proactive character here, but some things just never change.I\'ve heard a lot of people dismiss this thing as a summary film - which wouldn\'t make sense considering it came out a few weeks before the series did - but there\'s way more going on in this adaptation than just adapting all the Nagisa parts whilst everyone else\'s story can all get run over by a lawnmower.

I always wanted to see how the creators could make an equally good retelling in 1:30 minutes.  This is it.  There may be minor spoilers but I don't think it will ruin the enjoyment of the show.  WARNING: This story is a tearjerker.Story:  The story is quite different than it was in the anime.  Given this, do NOT compare the two.  The characters are the same, Nagisa and Tomoya are the main characters, Sunohara, Sanae, Akio, etc....are the supporting characters.  I found the story very interesting and informative (it filled in gaps in the anime) and the scene where Nagisa performed on stage was excellent.  I really enjoyed Tomoya's reaction to the play and to the little confrontation with his father.  The story messes with your emotions because it starts off happy and cheerful, but midway through the story takes a turn for the worst.  The plot development is good, it keeps the viewers interest.  It starts off slow and eventually picks up speedwise.  Soon enough, you'll be eager to click the fast forward button to see the ending.  It is that good.  Even though we knew something bad was going to happen, we wouldn't know what it would be until we saw it.  The only problem i found was that the transitions were quite fastpaced.  Some i found quite confusing, that i had to resort to rewinding and rewatching.Art:  The art is decent as usual, i really liked the character's appearances.  The scenery and blowing sakura blossoms were quite nice.  Nothing wrong here.Sound:  Nothing out of the ordinary.  I liked the sound effects during the play.  Dango song got kind of annoying though.Character:  Given the time restraints, i think they did a good job, however i would have liked the creators to stretch the climax a little bit more.  For me, it was quite rushed and it didn't leave as huge impact as I had expected.  There were some missing characters that I had wanted to see, Kotomi, Fuko etc from the anime.  But their absence isn't a huge problem; the movie was mainly Tomoya &amp; Nagisa.  Tomoya was the most developed character and very few times have i seen a character suffer through so much hardship and emotional trauma.  His character was what made me give the movie an 8, being a main character he has to have his ups and his downs otherwise the movie ends up being a borefest.  I also enjoyed seeing more of Yoshino, he had more air time then the anime.  Same with Sanae and Akio.Enjoyment:  I enjoyed this movie, except for the fact I had to go back and rewatch a part because it didn't make sense.  Then again, it was at 11 pm and i was tired.  It could've been the subbers, but i watched it again and it made more sense than before.  It was quite quickpaced, as previously mentioned, but that is expected due to the time restraints.  If you are a fan of the Clannad TV series, you definetely don't want to miss this movie.  The ending is very emotional and will most likely cause you to shed a tear.  I know i had my moments.Overall:  Overall, this movie is very good, I highly recommend it, it has alot, if not everything a Clannad fan would want from a movie based on it.  The story basically fills in the gaps that the anime had left behind. To fully experience Clannad, one should see both the movie and the anime.

It's Clannad but without the harem anime influence and it also provides a glance at some of the mysteries of Clannad and the story as a whole. It even sheds a little light on anpan (just watch it lol). Personally, I never liked Nagisa that much and I always wondered why Tomoya chose her over the others, but this movie shows why they are so compatible and goes deeper into Nagisa's character. The show didn't leave me with the impression that Tomoya or Suhei were delinquents but the movie brings that out...in their character as well. Also, the alternate world that you see in the show is given more meaning and background.

Which makes some of it hard to follow. The story is pretty interesting at first but tries to hard (or not hard enough) to draw in the audience. Tomoya's personality is conflicting  and inconsistent which makes things a bit confusing and make him out to be too sensitive.The story stops being realistic at some point and drops you into the future where it seems events SHOULD have explained the situation, leaving most of it to your own imagination. It's not too well written and definitely leaves a lot of questions to be answered.If...you've got nothing else to do or are just curious, watch it and see what you make of it yourself. But it doesn't get my recommendation. you've got nothing else to do or are just curious, watch it and see what you make of it yourself.

I mean it sort of follows the main heroine route but its so rushed because of the fact its only like a little over a hour and a half and this lead to no development in the characters.In my opinion there wasn't enough tear jerking moment in this movie, because of the fact it was only about a hour and half.The art for this movie is... Horrible compared to the anime series. The art in the movie for example is like 480p while the anime...series is like 1080p, a huge gap in the art.

Tomoya is more a jerk in the movie to Nagisa, who in the anime is very timid however is more outgoing in the movie which is a totally opposite.Overall as a Clannad lover, it was just barley manageable but still enjoyed it. series is like 1080p, a huge gap in the art.

Now, when there are movies based off of some anime, it is usually some mediocre filler movie just to make some extra money. This is not the case with the Clannad movie, at least fully. This movie is pretty much just an adaptation of the whole Clannad series. In one movie.

Sound is decent, some visual novel / anime music, some new, and the new dango dango dango, that somehow it sounded weird at first, but now i love it.Character: well i say 9,...but not every character, some characters don't&acute;t appear and some have different rols, but the main line characters are what they are supposed to be. Also same Nagisa voice helps a lot.Enjoyment: i enjoyed so much this movie, cuz it is important to add some after story to the animation, and Nagisa is my favorite character. Also if you watched the anime, you can think the second part of the movie as the continuation, the ending is something you must see.

Having differences between the two adaptations can help as you can get a different perspective on the original material that you might not have gotten had they not of deviated. I haven't played the visual novel, which happens to be the original source material , so I couldn't tell you which adaptation is more faithful, as this is a movie though, im going to guess that the movie is the less accurate of the two, with them having to condense most of the story within a 90 minute runtime.So before I continue any further with the analysis of the movie, I think it would be good to have a look at the story of the movie for those of you that are only interested in that, this will not include any spoilers though, so don't worry. The story of Clannad is a sad one, in which I mean you Will cry at some point while watching this, you might even cry for the happy bits. The story takes place in a small town somewhere in Japan and more precisely a school that is situated at the top of a hill in that town, where Tomoya, one of the main characters goes to school. On one morning where he is late for school he runs into Nagisa, our second main character. After this encounter, this is where the third and final main character Sunohara comes in, he's the best friend of Tomoya, and both of them seem to be more or less delinquents or the slackers at there school. Over time Tomoya and Nagisa bump into each other every now and again, with there friendship being cemented with each encounter. While the days go on Tomoya seems to have the same nightmare most nights, which plays into more of the story and is a big spoiler so we'll be leaving that out, After a period of time in the story has past, Tomoya and Sunohara are roped into helping Nagisa re-form the drama club and that for them means that they will have to become part of the club and start helping out.Past this the story goes into spoiler territory and I think its better if you experience it for yourself rather than read a review about it, however I think that this story, although different from the source material a little bit, is still a story that is beautiful and well crafted, and is really made to play with your emotions. However if you like slice of life, romance and Moe anime, your sure to love this one as a great edition to the genre.The animation and the art style of the movie, where good, the art style followed along with the visual novels art direction and the style does help you to watch is you have watched the anime before or are going too, with a lot of the characters looking the same and locations not differing too much from what they did look like, and if it wasn't for the fact that both the anime and the film adapted from the visual novel with the story being the same..ish, I could see that both the film and the anime could follow along with each other. I know what your saying 'well the style and animation would of course be the same cause its the same series' and yes I agree with that and im not saying they are exactly the same because the movie does look a little different to the series, but that is because both adaptations were produced by different companies, with the movie being produced by Kyoto Animation along with a few more studios that you can look at in the information section of the movies page.The animation felt fluid and held to a good standard, I watched it at 720p but for some reason, this film looked like it had a pre – computer graphics filter on it, as the film looked like it could have been aired in the 90's with other anime like dragon ball, Naruto and one piece,.the look of the anime could have just been cause of the resolution I was watching the film at, or it could be that they wanted to go for a stylisation like that. Whatever it was though, the anime was nice to look at and at no point did I feel like the quality dropped “cough dragon ball super episode 5 cough cough”, so yes the anime was good and I liked it.The voice actors from what I could tell, are the same as the actors for the series, I couldn't say the same for the dubbed version as I didn't watch the film dubbed. The voice actors will as good as always, as they are in most anime, and the music, while being similar if not sometimes the same as the music for the anime series, was great, with a lot of sad themed music to try and make you cry like a little child who just had his candy taken from him.Overall I think this is a good movie, it pales in comparison to anime series however this did come out before and its a good way to get a small glimpse at the full clannad story. If you have seen the series I recommend to watch this to get a different perspective however its not vital to watch it.So considering all of that I give this Anime a 7/10So if anybody made it to then end of the review, I thank you for taking your time to read this, I know my review was probably a little disjointed but I hope that improves as time goes on, see you next time guys :) have a non biased view of the movie as a whole though, just so you can get a Clear idea of what the movie is like without my personal views interfering.As you could probably tell from what I just said, the movie did come out first, before the anime series did, just by a couple of months though, as the film aired in September 2007 and the anime aired just one month later in October 2007, with the release of both adaptations so close together, I think it is a given that there would be differences between the both of them, which, depending on where you stand of the whole thing, the differences in the adaptations can either be a good thing or a not so good thing...yeah.

While the days go on Tomoya seems to have the same nightmare most nights, which plays into more of the story and is a big spoiler so we'll be leaving that out, After a period of time in the story has past, Tomoya and Sunohara are roped into helping Nagisa re-form the drama club and that for them means that they will have to become part of the club and start helping out.Past this the story goes into spoiler territory and I think its better if you experience it for yourself rather than read a review about it, however I think that this story, although different from the source material a little bit, is still a story that is beautiful and well crafted, and is really made to play with your emotions. However if you like slice of life, romance and Moe anime, your sure to love this one as a great edition to the genre.The animation and the art style of the movie, where good, the art style followed along with the visual novels art direction and the style does help you to watch is you have watched the anime before or are going too, with a lot of the characters looking the same and locations not differing too much from what they did look like, and if it wasn't for the fact that both the anime and the film adapted from the visual novel with the story being the same..ish, I could see that both the film and the anime could follow along with each other. I know what your saying 'well the style and animation would of course be the same cause its the same series' and yes I agree with that and im not saying they are exactly the same because the movie does look a little different to the series, but that is because both adaptations were produced by different companies, with the movie being produced by Kyoto Animation along with a few more studios that you can look at in the information section of the movies page.The animation felt fluid and held to a good standard, I watched it at 720p but for some reason, this film looked like it had a pre – computer graphics filter on it, as the film looked like it could have been aired in the 90's with other anime like dragon ball, Naruto and one piece,.the look of the anime could have just been cause of the resolution I was watching the film at, or it could be that they wanted to go for a stylisation like that. Whatever it was though, the anime was nice to look at and at no point did I feel like the quality dropped “cough dragon ball super episode 5 cough cough”, so yes the anime was good and I liked it.The voice actors from what I could tell, are the same as the actors for the series, I couldn't say the same for the dubbed version as I didn't watch the film dubbed. The voice actors will as good as always, as they are in most anime, and the music, while being similar if not sometimes the same as the music for the anime series, was great, with a lot of sad themed music to try and make you cry like a little child who just had his candy taken from him.Overall I think this is a good movie, it pales in comparison to anime series however this did come out before and its a good way to get a small glimpse at the full clannad story. If you have seen the series I recommend to watch this to get a different perspective however its not vital to watch it.So considering all of that I give this Anime a 7/10So if anybody made it to then end of the review, I thank you for taking your time to read this, I know my review was probably a little disjointed but I hope that improves as time goes on, see you next time guys :)"", ""Clannad: The Movie is a film I can watch any time, any place and still feel enthralled as if it were the first time.As the precursor to the popular 2007 Clannad anime, the movie depicts moments and a perspective uniquely different from the anime. It's a fresh and original take on the story and covers the most important events well in a 90 minute runtime.To someone who has only seen the 2007 anime, this movie will be jarring to you. The tone is very dramatic in contrast to the anime and a lot of the characters you may have loved in Clannad take...a back seat in the movie. Some characters don't make an appearance at all which may or may not displease you based on how you felt about them before.To someone who's seen neither Clannad 2007 or this movie, the story may confuse you because of the order they decided to place events. If you're watching the English dub, the pronunciation of some names may bother you as well. Good note that the same voice actors in the movie went on to voice the same characters in the anime. It's something I appreciated since I watched both in dub.Some of the angles in this movie are righteously jarring. The director is audacious in his attempt to make scenes interesting and unsettling but after three times, the bubble lens effect gets annoying. Some scenes give the impression of a hallucination with the resampling effect they use but I just thought it was my media player acting up.I think Clannad: The Movie is a bittersweet retelling of Clannad's Visual Novel story and for someone who just wants to put their foot in the water, it's a good place to start. None of the characters are overbearing or intolerable in the movie and the colors and music collaborate well to illustrate the feelings inside Tomoya Okazaki.To someone who's never seen Clannad; good luck. But if you're looking for the real emotional experience to feel something really pull at your heart, I suggest watching the 2007 anime first. a back seat in the movie.

It is worth seeing to appreciate the work as a whole and see one of its endings.Clannad gameAnime based on a Visual Novel of the same...name, where you have the option to choose which path you will follow and which girl you will try your luck and conquer, each with a personality as in a typical Slice of Life, as you cover the story of the person who tries to conquer you advances in memories,trauma and drama. name, where you have the option to choose which path you will follow and which girl you will try your luck and conquer, each with a personality as in a typical Slice of Life, as you cover the story of the person who tries to conquer you advances in memories,trauma and drama."", 'Straight off, ""Clannad The Motion Picture"" follows a similar yet different story than the Clannad and After Story anime. Do not compare the two as the movie has its entire story stuffed into 1,5 hours, had less producers and therefore most likely a lower budget, and takes a different path compared to the anime. Also, it has been released before the anime, and is therefore unrelated to the series as it\'s neither a sequel or a prequel.With that said, Clannad The Motion Picture is what you would call an average movie. It isn\'t special, the characters aren\'t that well developed, and the art and the...music makes it feel like you\'re watching a 90s flick, and shares the same traits as anime released back then, for example Sailor Moon.The story involves a school delinquent named Tomoya, who doesn\'t care about school or socialising in the slightest until he meets Nagisa, a silly and clumsy girl who has no friends due to her repeating her last year. From there on, it\'s mostly about building character and progressing the story. Some side characters are added, but most of them don\'t leave enough of an impact to really care about, as the story focuses more on Tomoya and Nagisa. Given the time span the movie has, this is for the better, but leaves you with an incomplete picture, which is all in all quite a shame. Nevertheless, the overall story is enjoyable, and compared to the anime will still give you a punch in the feels.The art is, well, I wouldn\'t say bad, but severely outdated. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it to an extent that I wasn\'t bothered by it, but I can understand why others would be. For a movie released in 2007, having an art style that resembles a 90s anime, it simply doesn\'t work well compared to what\'s out there. Even watching the DVD version, it felt like the quality was more like a VHS tape in 16:9. The animation wasn\'t that great either, but it was enjoyable and a change of pace.The music has the same issue the art has, as it seems to have ignored the fact that we\'re no longer stuck in the DBZ and Vanilla Ice area. It\'s simply too outdated, and at some points I wished I could turn the music off as it tended to kill the mood from time to time. The credits song was nice, though.The character development is overall rather poor as well. Other than the two main characters and perhaps Youhei, Tomoya\'s delinquent friend, the other characters are treated as plot development devices, and don\'t really add in much to the story other than progressing it, and aren\'t very memorable. Even the main couple doesn\'t leave enough of an impact if you haven\'t watched the anime, which (even though I said I wouldn\'t compare) built a proper base and therefore giving the punches in the feels much more of an impact. I can\'t blame them for trying to fit it all in a 1,5 hour time frame, but if you decide to make a movie based on a visual novel, you have to face the consequences if you can\'t manage to fit the entire story in.In conclusion, I bet fans of the original visual novel might enjoy this to an extent, but the anime fans probably won\'t. It is however something you can watch without knowing anything about Clannad, but with the 2 anime seasons, it isn\'t recommended watching this first. The stories are similar but in the end completely different, the art style is outdated, the characters are too bland to leave enough of an impact, and there\'s simply better stuff out there. If you\'re curious, give it a watch, it\'s not like it\'s a complete waste of time. But watch the anime first, otherwise you might get confused if you decide to watch the series after the movie. It was a nice attempt, but unfortunately it didn\'t work out well enough to be considered on par with Clannad. My advice: Stick to the anime, and watch the movie when you feel like it. It\'s worth the effort giving it a try, but don\'t expect anything fantastic. music makes it feel like you\'re watching a 90s flick, and shares the same traits as anime released back then, for example Sailor Moon.The story involves a school delinquent named Tomoya, who doesn\'t care about school or socialising in the slightest until he meets Nagisa, a silly and clumsy girl who has no friends due to her repeating her last year.

I am a huge clannad fan and i was mortified when l found out that there was a movie that l hadn\'t seen but that feeling didn\'t even compare to how l felt when l was done with this, and heres why...-I should also note here that I will be writing this assuming you\'ve seen the tv series or the vn, if you have not, you will encounter spoilers here--Also, I will be referring to an ""original"" story in this review often in regards to the anime, but it is also the story for the...visual novel which came before the movie, so don\'t start throwing dates at me saying that the movie came before the anime, because the vn still came first, hence the original-The Story: ugh, this was nowhere near as good as the anime or the vn for that matter. they messed with the story in this to the extent that it didn\'t even seem like the same thing, in fact l am almost insulted that this is allowed to hold the name of Clannad! The alternate world that is a good half of the story is just removed completely, and as we all know, without that alternate world, Nagisa cannot be brought back to life, and that is really big to the original story.I know that some people like this because its a bit more realistic... but that idealism and impossibility was an integral part of the success that the show and vn had! They just hammed it up sooo much in the anime that it was damn near impossible not to enjoy everything that was going on.The Art: I was a huge fan of the art in the show because it was so crisp, clear, clean, cute, (any more ""c"" words i can use?), but this was just complete crap. The art was shoddy at best and some of my largest annoyances were the mouths when characters were talking, they had two shapes: open and closed, but nothing else and it really began to piss me off. Aside from that, the art just wasn\'t all that clean and i feel like the studio that put this out wasn\'t even trying.The sound: I rarely talk about the sound, and if I do, it is because it is bad enough that i feel obligated to. Based off of that last sentence, you can probably guess that the sound quality isn\'t that good in this, and that\'s really all the more I should say.The Characters: The characters are all the same at least, well, maybe not. What I mean is that some of the characters have their roles in the series completely changed, or their personalities are different, or they are just taken out entirely! The only ones that are about the same as in the show are: Tomoya, Nagisa, Akio, and Sanae, everybody else is changed somehow. kouko is still a teacher, yosuke is more involved with tomoya, tomoyas dad actually has some screen time, sunohara is actually semi-responsible(which is just wrong) and tomoyo doesnt beat his ass all the time. kyou is tomoyos best buddy and we only ever see the back of kotomi\'s head as she directs the choir(...). You can just assume that anyone i didnt just mention is just not in the movie, and holds no role what-so-ever.Enjoyment: If banging my head against a wall as I wait for this to end is considered enjoyment, then I enjoyed this more than i should\'ve... Seriously, I had to fight myself not to just stop watching because it wasn\'t good and i was having the crap bored out of me.They did do a few things right( in my opinion) like actually giving tomyas dad an actual purpose, and making the relationship with Nagisa the center of the story by reducing the roles of the other girls to friends rather than prospective interests. However this doesn\'t even begin to dig this movie out of the grave it dug for itself. I was going to try to avoid comparing this to the show and vn, but just differed to greatly and it just doesn\'t work.It kinda scares me that this is what the show couldve been if it hadn\'t been done so well.As far as i\'m concerned, this doesn\'t exist, and the only people who should watch this are the true Clannad fans who want to be able to appreciate how good the show with the true ending really is. visual novel which came before the movie, so don\'t start throwing dates at me saying that the movie came before the anime, because the vn still came first, hence the original-The Story: ugh, this was nowhere near as good as the anime or the vn for that matter. they messed with the story in this to the extent that it didn\'t even seem like the same thing, in fact l am almost insulted that this is allowed to hold the name of Clannad!

Why? Because the movie is just well, how do i put this? The story is very simple, very rushed and little character development. The animation isn't as good as the series. Tomoya seemed strange compared to the series and don't really fit well. The music seems inappropriate at times. After hearing dango song from the series, the song in the movie is weird. But i got use to it and found it catchy even.The strange thing is, despites all those points, i enjoyed the movie, alot. The simplicity of the story...and the way the merge the plots though abit rushed is really able to tug heartstrings. Maybe is because the movie is so normal, everything happens realistically(except the comedy parts) and Tomoya faced a normal problem, not the common &quot;flirt with all the girls and don't know who to choose&quot; problem. The showing of friendship when Tomoya was in depression was also great.The last scene was truly heartwarming. A must watch, even if it seems boring at first, preservere and watch till the endFrom this movie, i realize, the ending does make a good show. You can have crappy animation, rushed storyline, possibly weak plot or plot development and lousy BGM.

"", ""The movie took a different turn than the original anime, but it's still worth watching. Sunohara, the main character's best friend, plays a bigger part in the movie, and pretty much makes up for the lack of all the female friends Nagisa and Tomoya shared in the series. The ending is more expected. All in all, great movie. "", 'I cried my heart out watching the Clannad Season 1 & 2 series. I loved it a lot. Going into the movie, I had to keep myself from expecting too much because afterall, it\'s going to be heavily condensed.The movie seemed to have a lot of potential for what it\'s worth. It\'s a different interpretation of the story so it keeps things fresh for veteran followers. I like the fact that most of the characters retain their personalities, except Nagisa. Nagisa is a bit more assertive in the movie. She has a stronger will compared to her series counterpart therefore did not require much...advice from Tomoya. I didn\'t have a problem with this, it helps speed things up a lot.However, the movie took it\'s sweet time to build up the meeting between Tomoya and Nagisa for the first half of the movie. Then comes the second half, the story spiraled down the hill faster than the speed of light. The pacing shift so suddenly that you\'re just gonna be like ""Well... that was a huge time skip...."" It\'s like it was trying to sum up more than 60% of the story in the last 45 minutes while utilizing tiny flashbacks to patch the gaps.The movie tried to be slick by revealing a glimpse of the future in the beginning of the movie, but it didn\'t work as well as it intended because it just felt so out of place and nothing else in the movie helped support it other than the obvious eventual happenings of the events.Lastly, I know I\'m being too nit-picky but I was too bothered by the different voice actor for Okazaki. I know this movie came out first and all, but hearing Okazaki\'s voice for 46 eps and then watching the movie threw me off a lot of the times. All the characters were voiced by their respective VAs except Tomoya. Harsh truth, but it was kinda hard to enjoy because of that.

The film aimed to address the main events and brought with it a different end to the after as a result of having been made by a different studio with artists with different traits artistic and that was sensationalIn...fact everything happens very fast, maybe it would have been more appropriate to have made a film with two parts (as in hunger games or hp) where part 1 dealt with events until Nagisa\'s death (where the development of dango daikazoku would also have) and part 2 focused entirely on Tomoya, Ushio and friends wanting to ""resurrect"" Tomisa after Nagisa\'s death. I wouldn\'t mind if each part was smaller (with 1 hr) but I think it would have made everything more fluid and complex which could bring the film closer to the anime or the game.Although I think it should have been 2 films, I recognize that what they did in this film was a great job. They brought new characteristics to the characters without changing his essence and that made me excited throughout the film.A good positive point of the film compared to the anime is the way they approached tomoya\'s depression, although briefly it was very well done and that impressed me (even though I still think I should have had more) and the way that friends from high school stayed united, which was undoubtedly sensational.There were people complaining that many characters did not appear but this film is independent of the anime so it would not be mandatory for everyone to participate, example is Kotomi that was not highlighted but the real reason for this is that her parents probably did not die in her childhood ( since the world of illusions did not exist in the universe of the film). Another thing that touched me was the fact that Youhei wasn’t forgotten, the guy was Tomoya’s best friend and in the aftermath he didn’t even show up to substantially console his friend (traveling whenever he could to spend time with tomoya) and nagisa\'s friends. There were also people who thought that Tomoyo was forced to appear together with him and everything, however, was something that happened in the anime several times, I do not understand the anger of these people.The ending also brought a wonderful idea of \u200b\u200btogetherness because in this version tomoya was not alone, even at the bottom of the well his friends and family (akio, Sanae and his father) were also by his side and it was perfect for the film to end on a beach (since the nagisa wanted to go with him and ushio there is a beach after delivery) but, again, everything happened very fast, it should have had a greater depth. I thought the premise of the ending was perfect because it was the most realistic ending in the series (since the lights that worked miracles or the illusory world existed) and that undoubtedly brought a superior conclusion to the film since his friends had a clearer conclusion, no they just stopped showing up after graduation like in the anime.Final conclusion: the film went very well, it sins in certain points but nothing is perfect. The version of the story without the illusory world turned the film into something unforgettable for me. I loved the different trait that the film had to some characteristics (like Ryou does not like tomoya, Youhei being brave but aggressive towards those who do wrong and how Ibuki was stressed since either her sister never suffered the accident and formed the died). The soundtrack was not so deep and the theme song of the dango is different from the anime but it fit perfectly with the concept of the group of friends that Nagisa and Tomoya formed around each other, literally as a big family that would go out, play, play and always had fun together and happy. A great work without a doubt and I recommend it to everyone who has finished the after cuz if you see the movie before the anime you would take many important spoilers from the story. I believe that only those who did not understand that the work is independent, that the world of illusions never existed and because it was a ""different route"", certain characters ended up not becoming friends or had no problems (example of Mei that for the personality do youhei to be more confident she was never left out or tomoya\'s father was not arrested because he was probably very upset because he tasted his son\'s tendon rupture). I think it\'s pretty obvious that I liked the movie, my rating of it would be 10 / 8.5 and if the movie was bigger or if it had 2 parts without a doubt I would have received 10/10. I hope that I have helped whoever is reading even this review being done 13 years after the release of the movie lol. Open your hearts and watch this work with the idea that this is not a Clannad After Story film and that it IS NOT THE SAME STORY WITH CHARACTERS THAT WERE FORGOTTEN BEFORE AND IN THIS NEW UNIVERSE BECOME IMPORTANT. Sorry for the subject matter and forgiveness for writing so much, thanks for reading this and have a good life.VERSÂO PTVou falar a minha opinião sobre o filme e ela sem duvidas vai ser controvérsia a maioriaO filme é totalmente desconexo com o anime logo não é justo os comparar no quesito tanho e tudo.O filme visava abordar os principais acontecimentos e trazia consigo um fim diferente do after em decorrência de ter sido feito por um estúdio diferente com artistas com diferentes traços artístico e isso foi sensacionalDe fato tudo ocorre muito rápido, talvez teria sido mais apropriado ter se feito 1 filme com duas partes (como em jogos vorazes ou hp) onde a parte 1 tratava acontecimentos até a morte de Nagisa (onde se teria o desenvolvimento da dango daikazoku também) e a parte 2 focasse inteiramente no Tomoya, na Ushio e nos amigos querendo ""ressucitar"" o Tomoya pós morte da Nagisa. Não me importaria se cada parte fosse menor (com 1 hr) mas creio que teria tornado tudo mais fluido e complexo o que poderia deixar o filme mais próximo do anime ou do jogo.Embora eu ache que deveriam ter sido 2 filmes eu reconheço que o que fizeram nesse filme foi um ótimo trabalho. Eles trouceram novas características pros personagens sem alterar a essencia dele e isso me deixou exitado durante todo o filme.Um bom ponto positivo do filme comparado ao anime é a forma que abordaram a depressão do tomoya, embora breve foi muito bem feita e isso me impressionou (mesmo ainda achando que deveria ter tido mais) e a forma que os amigos do Ensino Médio se mantiveram unidos o que sem duvidas foi sensacional.Teve gente reclamando que muitos personagens não apareceram porém esse filme é um independente do anime então não seria obrigatória a participação de todos, exemplo é a Kotomi que não teve destaque mas o real motivo disso é que provavelmente os pais dela não morreram em sua infância (visto que o mundo das ilusões não existia no universo do filme). Outra coisa que me deixou emocionado foi o fato d Youhei não ter sido esquecido, o cara era o melhor amigo do Tomoya e no after nem se quer apareceu para ir consolar o amigo de forma substancial (viajando sempre que podia para ficar um tempo com o tomoya) e nem as amigas da nagisa. Teve gente também que achiu forçado a Tomoyo aparecer conzinhando para ele e tudo porem isso foi algo que ocorreu no anime diversas vezes, não entendo a zanga dessa galera.O final também trouxe uma ideia maravilhosa de união pois nessa versão o tomoya não estava sozinho, mesmo no fundo do poço os seus amigos e família (akio, Sanae e seu pai) também estiveram ao seu lado e foi perfeito o filme acabar em uma praia (já que a nagisa queria ir com ele e a ushio há praia após o parto) porem, denovo, tudo ocorreu muito rápido, deveria ter tido um aprofundamento maior. Achei perfeito a premissa do final pois foi o final mais realista da serie (visto que as luzes que faziam milagres nem o mundo ilusório existia) e isso sem duvidas trouxe uma conclusão superior ao filme já que os amigos dele tiveram uma conclusão mais clara, não apenas deixaram de aparecer após a formatura que nem no anime.Conclusão final: o filme foi muito bem, ele peca em dados pontos mas nada é perfeito. A versão da historia sem o mundo ilusório transformou o filme em algo inesquecível para mim. Adorei o traço diferente que o filme teve a algumas características (como a Ryou não gostar do tomoya, Youhei ser corajoso porem agressivo com quem faz coisa errada e como a Ibuki estava forta já que ou a irmã dela nunca sofreu o acidente e se formou o morreu). A trilha sonora não foi tão aprofundada e a musica tema dos dangos é diferente da do anime porem isso se encaixou perfeitamente com o conceito do grupo de amigos que Nagisa e Tomoya formaram ao se redor, literalmente como um grande família que saia, jogava, brincava e se divertia sempre juntos e alegres.  Uma ótima obra sem duvidas e a recomendo para todos que já terminaram o after pq se ver o filme antes do anime você tomaria muitos spoilers importantes da historia. Creio que só não gostou do filme quem não entendeu que a obra é independente, que o mundo das ilusões nunca existiu e por ser uma ""rota diferente"" determinados personagens acabaram por não se tornarem amigos ou não tinham problemas (exemplo da Mei que pela personalidade do youhei ser mais confiante ela nunca foi deixada de lado ou o pai do tomoya não foi preso pq provavelmente ficou muito abalado por ter provado o rompimento do tendão do filho). Acho que ta bem obvio que eu gostei do filme, minha  avaliação dele seria 10/8,5 e se caso fosse maior o filme ou se tivesse 2 partes sem duvidas teria recebido 10/10. Espero que eu tenha ajudado quem quer que esteja lendo mesmo esse review sendo feito 13 anos após o lançamento do filme rsrsrs. Abram o seus corações e assistam essa obra com a ideia de que isso não é um filme de Clannad After Story e de que NÃO É A MESMA HISTÓRIA COM PERSONAGENS QUE ANTES ERAM BEM ESQUECIDOS E NESSE NOVO UNIVERSO SE TORNARAM IMPORTANTES. Desculpa os rodeios de assunto e perdão por escrever tanto, obrigado por ler isso e tenha uma boa vida. fact everything happens very fast, maybe it would have been more appropriate to have made a film with two parts (as in hunger games or hp) where part 1 dealt with events until Nagisa\'s death (where the development of dango daikazoku would also have) and part 2 focused entirely on Tomoya, Ushio and friends wanting to ""resurrect"" Tomisa after Nagisa\'s death. I wouldn\'t mind if each part was smaller (with 1 hr) but I think it would have made everything more fluid and complex which could bring the film closer to the anime or the game.Although I think it should have been 2 films, I recognize that what they did in this film was a great job. They brought new characteristics to the characters without changing his essence and that made me excited throughout the film.A good positive point of the film compared to the anime is the way they approached tomoya\'s depression, although briefly it was very well done and that impressed me (even though I still think I should have had more) and the way that friends from high school stayed united, which was undoubtedly sensational.There were people complaining that many characters did not appear but this film is independent of the anime so it would not be mandatory for everyone to participate, example is Kotomi that was not highlighted but the real reason for this is that her parents probably did not die in her childhood ( since the world of illusions did not exist in the universe of the film). Another thing that touched me was the fact that Youhei wasn’t forgotten, the guy was Tomoya’s best friend and in the aftermath he didn’t even show up to substantially console his friend (traveling whenever he could to spend time with tomoya) and nagisa\'s friends. There were also people who thought that Tomoyo was forced to appear together with him and everything, however, was something that happened in the anime several times, I do not understand the anger of these people.The ending also brought a wonderful idea of \u200b\u200btogetherness because in this version tomoya was not alone, even at the bottom of the well his friends and family (akio, Sanae and his father) were also by his side and it was perfect for the film to end on a beach (since the nagisa wanted to go with him and ushio there is a beach after delivery) but, again, everything happened very fast, it should have had a greater depth. I thought the premise of the ending was perfect because it was the most realistic ending in the series (since the lights that worked miracles or the illusory world existed) and that undoubtedly brought a superior conclusion to the film since his friends had a clearer conclusion, no they just stopped showing up after graduation like in the anime.Final conclusion: the film went very well, it sins in certain points but nothing is perfect. The version of the story without the illusory world turned the film into something unforgettable for me. I loved the different trait that the film had to some characteristics (like Ryou does not like tomoya, Youhei being brave but aggressive towards those who do wrong and how Ibuki was stressed since either her sister never suffered the accident and formed the died). The soundtrack was not so deep and the theme song of the dango is different from the anime but it fit perfectly with the concept of the group of friends that Nagisa and Tomoya formed around each other, literally as a big family that would go out, play, play and always had fun together and happy. A great work without a doubt and I recommend it to everyone who has finished the after cuz if you see the movie before the anime you would take many important spoilers from the story. I believe that only those who did not understand that the work is independent, that the world of illusions never existed and because it was a ""different route"", certain characters ended up not becoming friends or had no problems (example of Mei that for the personality do youhei to be more confident she was never left out or tomoya\'s father was not arrested because he was probably very upset because he tasted his son\'s tendon rupture). I think it\'s pretty obvious that I liked the movie, my rating of it would be 10 / 8.5 and if the movie was bigger or if it had 2 parts without a doubt I would have received 10/10. I hope that I have helped whoever is reading even this review being done 13 years after the release of the movie lol.

Well… it is too short. There is NO WAY in which a two-hour movie can express the same emotion as 47 episodes worth of story, in my opinion. I didn't quite enjoy it, since most of the dramatic tension is elliminated, but it was well-done for what it is, except for the fact that it fells a bit rushed.Another thing that I do not agree with would be that of removing and/or changing the main symbol of the story, which was used to tell  an important...lesson. Through the lost girl, there was a lesson taught, that of being able to find your own happiness in a world that makes you feel dead and meaningless. By replacing it and cutting the part of the TV show which showed the two main routes of the story, the emotional impact is not the same, and neither is the lesson told. The movie feels a bit… incomplete.EVEN SO, the movie is good for someone who doesn't have time to watch the whole series. It shows the focus points of the base material's story, removing the useless arcs (routes from the original visual novel), for example the Fuuko Arc, which didn't affect the final story whatsoever. By doing this, the studio managed to cover the entire series in two hours. lesson.

The first half follows the events of Clannad and I assume the second fallows the after story. Though several aspects were changed in the anime I feel that, in combination, they each fill holes in the other’s story, leaving the viewer with a greater understanding of the characters as well as adding depth to them.Despite how much I loved the movie, I must say, although it DID come before the anime, my advice is to watch the anime first. I don’t think I would’ve sat...through very much of the movie had I not already had an understanding of the characters. The movie is more of a serious drama then the anime with most, if not all, of the slapstick removed. This brings me to what I feel was the hugest change between the anime and the movie; the anime, usually, was lighthearted and care free with only a mild serious undertone that only engulfed the show in a few episodes, but the movie, on the other hand, seem to have a bit of a dark cloud following it the whole time.Over all, I just love this series in its entirety and am soon to begin watching the after story.  I truly only recommend the movie to fans of the series and people looking for an anime movie with a chick flick-esk feel to it. Those are the people I think’ll get the most out of this movie. To fans of the anime series, I say to you that you will find this movie completely endearing as it adds greater depth to some characters, especially Tomoya’s father, but I also would like to warn you to look through the differences and take the in stride, remembering that the movie DID in fact come first and it‘s differences are not a load of bull poopie. To people just hoping to get into the series, I suggest to you to start with the anime instead just because of how dark this movie is in contrast. And to those with no real interest in the series, I suggest this movie only if you’re in the mood to cry because I seriously got to the point, a whole THREE TIMES, near the end, where I had to take off my glasses and/or pause the video because I was crying. through very much of the movie had I not already had an understanding of the characters.

It didn't drag on, and there were moments that placed me on the verge of tears. I obviously can't compare it to the game or anime but in a nutshell it's: simple but thought-provoking; heart-warming and heart-wrenching; perfectly...paced and effective.If you want to find out what it was about, turn to Wiki! =PArt/animation:The art is, to tell the truth, hard to rate. The majority of the time, I thought it beautiful; some of it breath-taking. Some interesting techniques were used to great effect; a good example would be when the screen was divided in the middle, allowing two clips to play simultaneously, as this helped show the two perspectives as they happened synchronously. But I cannot ignore some of the slightly irritating flaws.Firstly, I didn't like it when short parts of the animation were repeated; one of the techniques used - on several occasions - for emphasis (at least, that's what it felt like it was used for). Not only did this appear lazy, it made the animation static. (I even thought the video was acting up until I realised it was actually MEANT to happen!)Secondly, while many of them were beautifully drawn, there were a few too many stills. This wouldn't have been too bad had they not tried to make the stills a little more... &quot;exciting&quot; by adding effects - such as blurs and overlays - and over-dramatic shadows! This is forgivable though, as it wasn't done all the time.Sound:I have little to say about the voice acting, to be honest. It was in Japanese, so I can't really comment on whether the tone was suitable, but I felt it was, and the voices suited their characters well (which is more than I can say for other animes such as Fushigi Yugi!).The soundtrack was very good, each track perfectly suited to its corresponding scene. The song &quot;Dango&quot; was, at first, a little embarrassing to listen to (it was so childish &gt;_&lt;), but it soon grew on me and I found it perfectly suited to the story and Nagisa's character. It could be said - although I didn't personally find this - that it was overplayed, as they managed to include several instrumental versions, but this helped to sustain Nagisa's presence, and actually made it all the more heart-wrenching and bittersweet.One thing was laughable though: Nagisa's giggle! It made me laugh AT her, which is never good.Character:I haven't seen the anime - yet - and so can't really compare (a few people have complained about the omission of their favourite character). But perhaps that is a good thing as I can treat this movie as an independent piece of work, and can approach this section without any bias.I thought that the characters were very good; the main two developed steadily. In fact, I felt there was little to critique.Nagisa: Surprisingly, I truly loved her character; her sweet, upbeat and warm personality left little to be disliked. And the more the plot revealed, the more I came to appreciate her. Despite the fact she's friendless, due to taking a year out of school (reasons for this are explained), she's hopeful; her ambition, determination and assurance in the face of adversity is something I ended up aspiring to. I didn't even mind her slightly childish side. In fact, I found it endearing - it wasn't a BAD childish side. It added to her character, helping to make this movie the masterpiece it is. Had her character been less innocent and bright (cheerful!), its end would not have been so tragic. Her character is central!Tomoya: While I didn't like Tomoya as much as Nagisa, I can't flaw his character. I don't agree with what synopsises generally say about him - that he's a delinquent - but he does have a cold side to him, appearing to despise his father, and only relying on his violent - but very comical! - friend for company. However, after he meets Nagisa, this changes; his character - almost - totally changes until the fateful incident (which I shall not mention) that results in him becoming even more introverted in the future, as we are shown. But now I fear ruining the plot...so I'll leave it at that!The minor characters all had their perks, each endearing in their own way but none of them really appeared enough for me to give them each an individual section.In conclusion:Despite my doubts, this is quite possibly my favourite anime movie! There is little left to say that I haven't already but if you're looking for something that's both fun and moving - or just a film that's easy to watch while still remaining meaningful - I'd recommend this!

This movie has a fairly similar art style and some of the voice actors are different from the Anime version. I think this should be watched after you complete the main series. Even though this predates Clannad and Clannad After Story, they have a much better ending and go into way more detail and the plot is way better in my mind. This movie the plot is almost the same but different in that I only cried once. Sound odd when I say it but the Tv version of this show that ran...for 46 episodes (again combined clannad and afterstory.)  gives you more of a plot and more emotions.

"", '(MAJOR SPOILERS FOR CLANNAD MOVIE, ANIME AND GAME)Alright, unpopular opinion time. I think the Clannad movie is better than the anime. But, before you chew me out, at least read why I am saying this.Okay, so I have known Clannad for a fairly long time now. I know that even the anime gets criticized for not following the game as faithfully as it could. I understand there is now way in hell a movie could do it better. However, the movie deviating from the plot of the game is exactly why I favor it over the anime. Allow me to explain.The movie knows it won\'t...be able to fit everyone into the scenario, so instead of jamming everybody in with a bunch of side stories that will go absolutely nowhere, it prioritizes Nagisa. Now, this does mean that Tomoya pretty much marries her on the spot, since they only have the length of a standard film to work with. Understandable. Before I jump into my favorite parts, though, I am actually going to start with criticisms, because as you know, my score is really high for this, so I have less negatives to say about it.The pacing is still abrupt. The beginning is very similar to the anime, where something feels off about Tomoya just seeing Nagisa walking around and the whole composition of this scene, the movie, anime and game, this scene just generally feels off to me and the movie only reminded me why. But, the movie does it the worst out of these three, since it rushes it. From my understanding, their first communication is supposed to be long in a sense of ""atmosphere"" or whatever, so the movie rushing it ruins the one thing it has going for it. Though, the animation in this scene is actually the best in the movie than the anime because of the scene choreography, featuring nice, fluid hair, beautiful colorization (which is sad to be unable to appreciate when you can not really find the movie in HD) and nice choice of BGM. However, that aside, the scene is very awkward.Rushing in general. For the girls who did make it into the movie, they were immediately pushed aside to later become minor characters near the end, since well, they are still Tomoya\'s friends. They just did not have any screen time. Hell, Kyou has a single speaking line in the whole movie. Tomoyo has the most attention, since she is the one leading the charge to take down Nagisa\'s posters and is a lot more antagonizing here than in the game. As I said, everyone not being in the movie is sad, but understandable. They did not want it to look like a complete mess. Sunohara also went bonkers a bit too much in this movie than he should have, most notably during the sequence where he was taking upset about the posters.Great Dango Family being butchered was unforgivable. It is the only reason why I did not score this movie a nine.Now, the part where you are shaking your head at, why am I saying this is a great movie? Well, because I am doing what everyone else is not doing, that being appreciating it as a standalone product. In that sense, yes, I know it still has scene pacing problems, but for the scenes it did good in, they were pretty great. The movie deciding to retell the events of the game was actually intelligent, since it allows scene choreography to flow more naturally and it does help the scenes that did not look rushed. I liked that certain comedy was handled pretty great, most notably Sunohara having the most Sakuga moments out of anyone else in the movie with how bizarre he is here.Now, praising the most controversial parts. Tomoya\'s original voice? I like it better! Tomoya is a depressed person, so it was weird he did not sound this melancholic in the anime. Scenes where he grieved, got angry and just talked in general fit the personality of his character way better. And he even does feel like a real delinquent with the minimal social interaction at the beginning. It complements his character very well. I am sad he was the only one who got a new voice for the anime, because I would have loved to see how this person did him with a full-length anime to work with.As I also said before, this movie opted to have original scenes in place of being faithful to the game and that is where it shines. Since I absorbed this film after the anime and game, I already know the story and so watching more of it in a rushed format would have greatly effected my score of the movie as a whole. Instead, I am being treated to a unique take on Clannad that is pretty enjoyable. In fact, I prefer how certain characters were in this movie than the game. Most notably, Sunohara.For starters, we see that they beat him up on the soccer field, which I believe the game mentioned that the fight was not started by him. Seeing it in action here, you can actually pity Sunohara. You feel bad that he was quite literally beaten up on the soccer field during a game and his anger was justified. He feels like he is really taking on the sadder aspects of his character way better and, due to how mistreated he was in the game, I feel happy seeing other characters pity him in the anime. Very notably, Sakagami, who listened to him during his grieving of Tomoya. Sunohara was also the most upset during the vandalizing of Nagisa\'s posters, which made him seem very commendable as a person, since instead of the anger he got from the mistreatment on the soccer team degrading him as an individual, he instead feels pity for other people who go through the same stress. It\'s more admirable and I wish this trait was in the game version of his character.And for that earlier matter, the friendship of Tomoya and Sunohara. I understand the game does portray this better, since they established their friendship came over something pretty minor and they both disliked certain aspects of each other, so they naturally weren\'t very close and Tomoya messing around with him a lot makes sense. But, in the movie, Tomoya has a legitimate bonding moment with Sunohara which I appreciate a lot and I like the retelling of their friendship having holes, but they are trying to be close, rather than them just being distant and kind of having bonding moments. I want to say the game portrayed a more unique friendship, but I am still pondering if I prefer the nature of their bond in the movie or game better. They are both still good in their own ways.Then there are the serious moments. This may be very controversial, but I believe the movie conveyed one particular scene significantly better to me than the anime. Nagisa in the hospital room just had a lot of love put into it. Nagisa slowly muttering her last words in her dying breath, acted very well, made me tear up more than I expected. The anime just has this weird montage sequence that made the whole death feel a bit weird, well the movie instead conveyed it in a much better manner. You could feel for both Nagisa dying and Tomoya crying. The entire composition of this scene is just beautiful and the BGM was chosen perfectly. I have a harder time watching this without feeling sad than any other scene in the entire anime. The anime did Nagisa\'s death scene too ""epic"" as comical of a word as that is to use. What I mean by this is that there is an intense track in the background, but it is not particularly sad sounding, but more like a buildup track of some kind. I\'m not particularly good at describing this, but it just did not feel nearly as good as the track in the movie for Nagisa\'s death. If I remember right, the game does her death scene comparable to the movie, not using a weird atmosphere around her with bright lights, but rather a real, very sad death with appropriate music. The way the movie did Nagisa\'s death will always be my favorite.So that leaves the more minor things. I actually think Nagisa looks more attractive in the movie than in the game as well, subtle as the design differences are. I have read that people said Toei did a very bad job with the animation, but I feel like those opinions are entirely out of hatred, because I like to analyze animation a lot in anime and I did not see anything wrong with the frame pacing, detail or anything else. I suppose the anime does look slightly better, generally, but when I say I prefer the design of a character, that is different. Objectively, I am aware the anime does have a lot more detail, but subjectively, I like Nagisa better in the movie. The movie does not come close to the Illusionary World sequences at all in the anime, which are still better than the majority of anime to this day. I can fully agree with anyone on that. The anime does make great use of the talent on staff. Those people will be missed. Their effort on the anime is unforgettable. The soundtrack was also nicer in the movie in regard to unique flavor, but I prefer that the anime used the raw game OST.I recommend this movie a lot, but only if you are willing to absorb it without a hateful mind of Toei and a bias toward the game. You are allowed to prefer the game, but please try to watch the movie as a standalone product. It will make it much more enjoyable. be able to fit everyone into the scenario, so instead of jamming everybody in with a bunch of side stories that will go absolutely nowhere, it prioritizes Nagisa.

It will make it much more enjoyable.', '[As originally posted on AnimeNfo.com][Watched and Reviewed before Viewing TV series]-via kyzorynA few days ago I witnessed the animation called Clannad, an epic story that focuses around the progression of a boy that who suffers from depression and a girl who never loses hope. It is a “good slice of life” movie that centralizes around the themes of strong friendship and family.One major weakness is the underdevelopment of the climax and ending. They reach the climax and then proceed to give and show no detail, but rather rush towards the ending. I’m not going to give any spoilers, but the ending, though great in depth...should have been more developed.I have not watched Clannad the television series, and I am currently watching the after story, but as far as I can tell the after story developes Nagisa and Tomoya in a much better fashion as well as the other characters. Speaking of Nagisa, her character lacks depth as you only see the cheerful side to her, never sadness or grief. Thus the strong point is obviously Tomoya, as you witness the ups and down and growing strength. From this I will say that you should watch Clannad the television series rather than the movie.I liked the movie and would say that its strong point is the development of Tomoya and its weak points are the story and the development of most feminine characters including Nagisa.[7/10] should have been more developed.I have not watched Clannad the television series, and I am currently watching the after story, but as far as I can tell the after story developes Nagisa and Tomoya in a much better fashion as well as the other characters.

I\'m astounded how they apparently could rescue the characters and story in the series after they released the movie only one or two months before the series.StoryAs already mentioned, it seemed forced to me. They tried it to appear tragic and all but the way they executed it I just didn\'t care at all.The story doesn\'t flow well and looks crammed together.ArtTrying to be artistic with glittery still images and animations and all kinds of unnecessary different ""camera"" perspectives. It annoyed me and didn\'t make the movie better. In fact it made it worse for me.SoundFine, I guess....I liked the dango song in the series much better and the one in this movie rather annoyed me.Okazaki had a different voice than in the series, which I didn\'t really like. But he also behaved somewhat differently, so it wasn\'t too tragic.CharacterSome of the characters are really annoying, like Sunohara & Nagisa\'s father. Also they\'re very unrealistic and not funny. Fujibayashi Ryou is missing and Kyou & Tomoyo are best friends in this movie. I didn\'t particularly miss Ryou, but the relationship between the two mentioned is weird, likely because it seems very superficial and one can\'t see how they might\'ve become friends. So it looks forced, just like other relationships, too, for example between Okazaki & Nagisa.Also the characters behave differently than in the series, have different characters and act overall more unrealistic.EnjoymentThe movie felt rather ridiculous and forced to me, so I didn\'t enjoy watching it.I kept watching because another review said the ending would be more realistic than in the series (which I didn\'t see that way).OverallOverall I find it to be a rather bad and annoying movie : / I liked the dango song in the series much better and the one in this movie rather annoyed me.Okazaki had a different voice than in the series, which I didn\'t really like.

So I just finished the movie and actually made an informed decision of whether I liked the movie at all or not. I still didn't enjoy it as much as the series, the series sticking to the VN and all. A fair warning, there will be spoilers, but if you want a good idea of what I thought of it, I thought it was decent.Starting off with the bad. The adaptation was pretty bad, it payed more attention to the first part of the VN but somehow became void of any character/relationship development. Though the background animations were pretty, and I don't mean the...scenes with the bubbles replacing any major structures such as say a bridge, the character animations were lacking and often too over exaggerated. Another thing they did was ruin my favorite character Akio Furukawa with a thing called Flanderization, they took his worst aspect, with is his love of pulling pranks and often overreacting to small details when they related to his daughter, what they took out were the fatherly speeches that he would give to Okazaki, which is the reason that he was one of my favorite anime characters to began with. Because they took away the relationship development between Nagisa and Tomoya, making Tomoya look like an emo whiner all the time and Nagisa really being devoid of all character at all except the cute girl who wants to put on a play and give birth. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of both Kotomi and Fuko, both of them were important, Fuko maybe being a bit more important as she shows up again in After Story as a main character, and both of them having their own arcs in both the VN and tv series. It was also way too rushed when you take after story into consideration, the deaths just weren't sad. Unlike the series, I never got a lump in my throat. I was happy at the end, but nothing more. So everything is downplayed.The good. I liked the play scene and the fact that Greg Ayres was still sunohara, and Andrew Love is still Akio. That's about it. The backgrounds were also beautifully animated and I did like the dream sequences.Final Verdict: It was fine. I would suggest watching it if you have the free half an hour and no other anime to watch, and I have definitely seen worse.6/10 scenes with the bubbles replacing any major structures such as say a bridge, the character animations were lacking and often too over exaggerated.

Allow me to explain why I gave these ratings.  For the most important aspect, story, I feel that it is justified because even though a lot of the heart-breaking events occur in the movie, the...build-up is either paced way too quickly or is not there at all.  I understand that for a movie, things have to move quickly, but the director did not use his time to establish a connection to the characters, which is very important for the emotional gravity of the story.  Unlike in the VN or the anime series, for the Clannad movie, when someone dies, it doesn't feel like someone you cared about passed away.  The emotions feel cursory.  It seems like, when someone really lovable and endearing from the TV anime has their moment, be it happy or sad, when it happens in the movie, you just feel like someone telling you about their friend.  You can feel sympathetic or empathetic but that's not the same as actually reacting with joy or pain.I urge anyone reading this review to just watch the series instead.  It's out, and it has been out for quite a while now, so I see no reason to watch the movie first.  All that watching the movie will do is tell you what happens in the TV anime but without the emotional quality.  The movie, however, is good for watching after the TV anime so that you can revisit it and buffer out that post-clannad afterglow.The other scores don't matter so much and are more cursory opinions.  I gave the art a 7 because the style is something some people have to get past, what with the buggy eyes and stuff.  I gave the sound a 6 because a lot of the soundtrack was recycled and you'd notice one song play twice in a 15 minute span and the transitions for the music weren't all that smooth.  I gave the Character area a 6 because while the characters are sweet and endearing, all with their awesome and unique qualities, you don't get to know them in the movie.  You only see Ryou and Kyou a little bit, and Tomoya just kinda appears alongside Sunohara.  There is no Fuuko, and I don't remember Ichinose having any role either.Again, I urge anyone reading to just watch the anime. build-up is either paced way too quickly or is not there at all.

It\'s full of emotions but isn\'t cheesy at all...Clannad\'s movie (a summary of Clannad part 1) shows that happyness is never complete... No matter how much a person deserves it, nobody is going to be entirely happy ever. So, the main character (Tomoya) is moved from the happiest scenaries to the most suffering situations.The story will catch you... you\'ll see characters facing unfair situations because story is as cruel as real life is.Its main message must be: ""Only those who decide to chase happiness will get...a piece of it."" a piece of it.""', ""the clannad was a masterpiece set aside from its TV counterpart.  the TV counterpart focuses mainly on the arcs of the game and the side characters whereas the movie cuts out a large portion of the cast(mei, fuko, ryou, sunoharas dorm keeper).  this however does not ruin the movie even the slightest bit.  the movie focuses on the mysterious dream that carries so much weight but is barely touched upon in the TV version.  also it shows you the majority of the acting performance at the founders festival(a thing i was overjoyed about because it is skipped in the TVanime) it...also focuses on the after story of the nagisa arc(which isnt illustrated at all in the TV version) and the fate of Ushio, nagisa and okazaki's child.that said it is unfair to judge the movie against the TV version because they tell 2 different parts of the same story. if you watched the anime you should watch the movie. if you watched the movie first then youll still enjoy the anime because it isnt spoiled by the movie.i recommend everybody watch the clannad movie. also focuses on the after story of the nagisa arc(which isnt illustrated at all in the TV version) and the fate of Ushio, nagisa and okazaki's child.that said it is unfair to judge the movie against the TV version because they tell 2 different parts of the same story. if you watched the anime you should watch the movie. if you watched the movie first then youll still enjoy the anime because it isnt spoiled by the movie.i recommend everybody watch the clannad movie."", ""How could they ruin the amazingly heart-gripping story that is Clannad with this atrocity? Well they didn't.The movie version of Clannad is an original take on the visual novel. The movie is actually not that bad when you judge it on its own merits.

The character's emotions are well portrayed and the soundtrack plays like a dream to...the mood.The characters of the movie version are probably the movie version's biggest flaw.

This is the part that i kinda missed in the Series and i think they could have...putted like one episode to it, how his friends would try to help him to recover. Cuz if u think about, thats what friends do, they try to support u on bad days, not leave you for full 5 years. putted like one episode to it, how his friends would try to help him to recover.

Ii later realized it was made before the actual series, which would mean that the movie is a first gathering up of ideas for the series.When i compare both, of course there is lots of different things like the songs or the animation itself, as it was created by another Studios (Toei Animation instead of Kyoto Animation), but the main story and the characters are the same.Only when i stop comparing, i can truly enjoy the wonderful experience that is seeing this movie.Although it was created before, i...suggest seeing the series first and the film afterwards, as i believe the series is much richer and has, of course, more time for character and story development. Seeing the movie afterwards makes me understand the movie more (as i already know the plot).As in the series, i love the story and the characters and i like the animation in the film and the music as well. It has the emotional dramatical side of the Clannad story, as well as its funny cheerful moments.  Overall, the film for me was worth seeing, i enjoyed it and recommend every Clannad fan to watch it! suggest seeing the series first and the film afterwards, as i believe the series is much richer and has, of course, more time for character and story development.

(I haven\'t read the VN, so I can\'t comment on that.) I thought both were kind of average. They were fairly entertaining, but I didn\'t find them to be very special. I gave both seasons a 7, as well as the specials.Art and Animation: 7The background animation is pretty good. The characters not so much. The original Clannad artstyle was already hard to get used to, but by the second season I had already accepted it. However, the movie style is awful.Soundtrack: 7Nothing noticeable really, but it does it\'s job. Of paticular note is the...Dango song, which sounds different. While the original was like a lullaby, the movie version sounds more like a happy children\'s song. Is this good or bad? Well, since I watched the anime first, I\'m more used to that version, but the movie version isn\'t excatly bad. As for the voice actors, they are mostly the same for both Japanese and English.Plot: 7The plot differs slightly from the original, as the plot centers solely on Tomoya and Nagisa.The plot is also faster, since it is a movie and it doesn\'t have a lot of time compared to the anime.I noticed that the movie had a lighter and more comedy feel compared to the anime. Two reasons: a) The movie has quite a bit of comedic scenes, adn these stand out more compared to the anime since the movie is a lot shorter; b) There are less sad scenes, as there is no focus on the other characters of Clannad, with the only sad part being the After Story segment.Another thing that\'s different is the ending of the movie. (I\'ll try not to spoil anything.) For one thing, the ending is more straightforward compaed to the anime, which ws slightly harder to understandThe movie does not have an ""Illusionary World"". Instead, the film has the concept of a recurring nightmare that Tomoya has. Of course, the lack of the Illusionary World makes the ending quite different...The exceution of the plot was quite average. I felt that the film had slight pacing issues, adn I would ahve preferred more ofcus on the After Sory part. The differeces with the plot did not bother me as much though. I actually preferred the ending of the movie.Characters: 7The movie focuses primarily on Tomoya and Nagisa, again due to the short time. Unfortunately, this leaves very little time for the side characters.Tomoya is mostly the same as the original. Nagisa, on the other hand, is kind of different. She seems more bold and outgoing in the movie. In the beginnig, after meeting Tomoya, she actively attempts to become friends with him. She\'s also more actve in terms of the Drama Club. Even before she met Tomoya and Sunohara, she was working hard on making posters for the Drama Club. She is also very certain of excatly what she wants to do with the Drama Club, and excatly what kind of performance she wants to put on. Overall, I like the movie version of Nagisa because she\'s bolder.Sunohara is also mostly the same, playing the role of comic relief while having some serious moments. Tomoyo is still running for student council president, and she seems less aggressive. Kyou seems to have the position of Tomoyo\'s best friend, and helps Tomoyo with her election campaign. Kotomi makes a few cameos as the conductor of a choir. Ryou, Fuko, Mei, Yukine, and Misae are some other prominent supporting characters that do not appear in the movie verse.Akio and Sanae are also mostly the same. Kouko is an expert in martial arts, and was also the advisor to the previous Drama Club. Yoshino has a different personality which I find similar to Akio\'s at times. Lastly, Tomoya\'s dad plays an important part in the After Story segment, but personality wise is still mostly the same.Enjoyment: 7The movie was entertaining, but nothing special.Overall: 7I found the anime to be better than the movie, but the movie is not bad by any measns.. I would recommend it only to fans of Clannad, since it presents a different take on the Clannad universe. If you disliked Clannad, don\'t expect the movie to be better, because it is inferior to the anime.

One might say a beautiful drama!I've cried as his daughter Tomoya USHIO has seen at the end!I commend all the romance anime fan to see this movie! It goes straight to the heart! "", ""To start it off, I'm gonna say that I have watched the anime series (it was a long time ago though, like four years ago? But I digress) and am currently playing the VN recently which pulled me to watch this. I know that I'm almost 12 years late into the party but I'm going to give my thoughts on this one anyway. Just a discretion though, I may be making comparisons so please bear with me.First off, the story. I know that his father cleared up that he neglected Tomoya as a child but for him to treat his father like trash just because...he's having nightmares? I don't know man, quite an asshole move, it is also the one that lead to the fight that broke his shoulder anyway so I think he only has himself to blame for that one. Not that his father is blameless in this situation.I also find this version of Clannad quite cringey, it's like they just took the character archetype they belonged in and turned it up on extreme. For example Sunohara, who is at least acting like a human being in the original, in this version though, he straight up became an animal, going as far as to jump on his people and bite them all over, other scenes include him jumping over tables and climbs on wire fences like a spider. I don't know, it just freaked me out. And Tomoya's brooding is also over the top, I mean, who walks with their back hunched THAT low all the damn time? And Nagisa's unnatural smiling face is also ugh, and her excuse for not climbing the hill and following a complete stranger... ha, I'll just stop picking on everything. I'll at least say that in the vn and anime her reactions are more natural. I think it's obvious that I'm not a fan of how they did the characterizations.Another thing that ticked me is that they changed up the backstories of the characters in general. I don't think Mei, Ryou, and Fuko existed in this movie. Kotomi who is the weird genius bookworm who is always shut in the library became a conductor of a choir. What. And also Kyou was reduced into being Tomoyo's lackey. I guess the only change up that I kind of enjoyed is Ibuki Kouko's character who became more proactive in the movie.Regarding the art, I know that it is understandable as it was produced back in 2007, however, I'm not a big fan of it. There are some parts where the art looks nice though, but generally, not my tea. The background is also to dark-ish even though it's daytime, which I find weird. Another peeve of mine is Akio's hair, they made it neck length, but it's only a small peeve however, moving on. The sound is okay, didn't really stand out, I liked the new dango song though but I'm more biased toward the original one.Overall, this is a bit tiring to watch and is only enjoyable in some parts. Even if I don't compare it to the original, it still seems dull. A solid 4/10. he's having nightmares?

There are a lot of parts that would've left me confused if I hadn't seen the anime first.ART:The art was horrible. KyoAni is on of my favourite animation studios, on of the reasons being the art. However, the are in the Clannad movie left me feeling...like I was watching something really old. I assumed that KyoAni also did the movie, but the second I saw the art I realized it was somebody else.SOUND:Not much to say about the sound, it didn't really strike me as good or bad. The only thing is I don't like this version of the Dango song, but I'm going to let this slide since it was written first.CHARACTER:The characters were generally the same, though I found Sanae-san and Akio had a different relationship in the anime, one I found annoying. I really hated Okazaki, his depression got on my nerves and he wasn't the same sarcastic guy that I fan-girled over.ENJOYMENT:I gave this a 1 as there wasn't anything to keep me watching and I just felt like Okazaki's greaving was a big turnoff.OVERALL:A few other people who gave bad ratings mentioned liking the last half hour.

But, instead of being a horrible because of that, it is actually pretty good. The essence of the original story is still there -Things that must be sayed are sayed-.Some characters are missing, like Fushibayashi Kyou little sister, and the characters that appear have different relationships with each other. But their personalities are almost untouched, maybe a little overdo it.The worst of the film are character designs. Their...faces are a little different.Sound is fine.

I want to keep this review short really and give you a little list with what I think this movie does...better and (even more important) worse than the show:1. (-) Some characters are completely different to a point where you can\'t even recognise them anymore from the show; for example Nagisa is WAY too confident in her theatre skit.2. (-) The content of Season 1 is being dealt with in 1h 10min in the movie, content of Season 2 only takes up about 20min which is quite sad since the most emotional moments were in Season 2.3. (-) Cruicual moments were left out which yes, is obvious in a movie of this length but they were so important for the story in the series and the topics it dealt with that it just shows that Clannad\'s story can simply not be packed into a 1h 30min movie.4. (-) Toei ""animation"" moments, including repeating the same animated sequences again and again after each other for no reason (who directed this lmao) and adding as many pointless blur effects as possible without any reason to do so (you wanna get me dizzy watching this? xD)5. (-) Soundtrack is worse, the version of the dango song in the movie made me mad, I need the one from the show, it\'s much cuter.1. (+) It\'s still Clannad, so I had to shed a tear but only because of memories from the series coming up.Thanks for reading this, I am going to bed. better and (even more important) worse than the show:1.

This sort of made me feel bored with the movie because i new what was coming...But most importantly the characters looked so different! Compared to the series they looked nothing a like but only with a few similarities. This totally though me off when I was watching it.

Yet, much more realistic as it lacks the supernatural aspects of Nagisa being brought back to life.Is it better than the anime? well, it depends. The anime obviously has much more screen time to be able to take its time to develop arcs and get into much more details. The anime has a more light, fun and positive approach to the same events. The anime gives you that satisfaction of Tomoya and Nagisa coming full...circle while learning everything they had to, in order to become their better selves.If you watch the anime first and then the movie, then you are going to dislike it even more because you will notice how characters' personalities are much different and how they all are not friends (its basically Nagisa, Tomoya and Sunohara as opposed to them being friends with the other girls).

The breathing room wasn\'t really there for me to fully establish an emotional connection with the protagonist, but I\'ll admit it was still a heartwarming ending. I give it a 6/10, not bad not great.', ""Clannad is one of those anime that just hit at the right place at the right time. Not only was it adapted from a famous, beloved visual novel, a fairly new production company at the time, Kyoto Animation, really made an effort to do it justice by adapting it into an anime series that bordered on having 50 episodes. Then again, by that time, KyoAni already had experience adapting the works of Visual Arts/Key into animation previously, though they actually weren't the only ones doing so. For some reason, Toei got in on it as well, though their direction was to adapt them into movies...(In the case of Kanon, they made that into a 13-episode series). KyoAni stopped adapting Key's visual novels into animation after Clannad, something that didn't sit well with their fans at the time (Man, remember when JC Staff was first revealed to be making the Little Busters anime? I remember the backlash being sooooo overblown). But Toei's adaptations of Key's work had their merits, mainly making them into more bite-sized for anyone who didn't want to watch 20-50 something episodes of KyoAni's TV versions. Having seen both the Clannad TV anime and the movie, I do feel that the movie is the inferior version, but I also don't feel it should be completely overlooked.Fans of Visual Arts/Key will already know the story, but for the uninitiated, here's a general synopsis: Tomoya Okazaki is a delinquent who goes through life in a daze, with no ambitions in life, detached from everything, and weighed down by his own personal demons. Every night, he has a strange dream that he can't explain. When he meets a young woman, Nagisa Furukawa, who asks for his help, Tomoya is at first reluctant, but humors her, as he doesn't have much to do. But the two find themselves interacting more and more, and through a series of encounters and events, they gradually become friends. Nagisa wants to start up the drama club to put on an original play, and Tomoya, along with his slacker friend Youhei Sunohara, decide to join and help her out. But Tomoya's decision to help her out becomes something far more than even he and Nagisa could have ever imagined, enriching his life.If you're hoping the movie will be exactly like both the visual novel or the anime, you're in the wrong place. Being a movie, it can't possibly adapt the entire source material, so changes do have to be made in order to adapt it to a different medium. For one, the focus is entirely on both Tomoya and Nagisa, with characters like Kyo and Tomoyo reduced to just friends. Kotomi only gets a cameo in one scene, and characters such as Fuuko and Ryo are left out entirely. But other characters get their roles expanded, such as Kouko, who becomes the drama club adviser instead of the elderly man who does so in the game and the anime...though as much as I like Kouko being more of a stern badass than she was in the anime, did they really have to pull the whole making her move so fast that she disappears into lines like she's in some Dragonball Z show? That just felt lazy to me. Also, whose idea was it to throw in a really random scene where Sunohara urinates on-screen? That was just unnecessary. Plus, with the movie's length, it doesn't have time to flesh out any character that's not Tomoya or Nagisa. But I'll give the movie credit for knowing what to focus on and what to keep limited, as it kept the focus on what was important, leaving out subplots that would have made the movie feel bloated. It helps that the major side characters, such as Tomoyo, Sunohara, Kyo, and Nagisa's parents, do get plenty of screen time on their own, and they get just enough time devoted to them that they don't feel like one-dimensional cardboard cut outs, even taking into account their different roles and execution compared to the TV anime. Basically, the side characters do a great job supporting the main storyline without overtaking it.As far as animation goes, the Clannad movie is obviously inferior to KyoAni's take on it, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. For one, the character designs are true to the game, and while the animation isn't as dynamic or fluid as that of the TV series, it still gets the job done. Plus, there's something else to consider: This would be the final film directed by one of anime's most famous revolutionaries, Osamu Dezaki, who made a lot of great things during his heyday. He directed famous anime like Rose of Versailles, Treasure Island, Nobody's Boy Remi, Ashita no Joe, Oniisama e, and various Lupin III specials, among many other things. He even did some animation work for, of all things, Rainbow Brite. He started up and refined a lot of cost-cutting animation techniques, such as split screens (And the Clannad movie has A LOT of them), filters, repetition of scenes—stretching them out for dramatic effect, and, one that Dezaki fans will definitely recognize, stark, heavily lined watercolor paintings to close out scenes, or enhance them for further dramatic effect. His directing style definitely won't be for everyone, and his character designs are very much unlike most anime you see nowadays. I don't have as much to say on the soundtrack, as half of it is original stuff that I barely paid attention to, and half of it is music reused from the visual novel. Both are good and fit the tone of the story very well, but that's really about it.Going back to the characters, Tomoya and Nagisa's roles are very much reversed in the movie. Nagisa is much more assertive and confident than she is in the show, and while the change in personality does make her feel a lot less overly cutesy and moe, I felt like the movie version stripped away the more realistic character flaws that made her more three-dimensional and dynamic in the TV anime. Tomoya suffered the most, as he's a lot more angsty and brooding, often staying that way for 90% of his screentime, even those his reasons for being so are valid (Mostly, barring the dream sequences which are nothing like the anime or visual novel). Because the movie took away some of his other personality traits in favor of ramping up his angst, he loses a lot of depth and character that he had in both the visual novel and the anime, which is a shame because he's the main character!So yeah, don't go into this expecting it to be slavishly faithful to the original source. Clannad The Movie is very much its own entity trying to stand on its own and it needed to make do with what it had in order to tell the story it needed to within its limitations. For what it is though, I like to think of it as a bite-sized version of Clannad that's perfect for people who don't want to or are unable to commit to watching the 50-episode anime. It's not the absolute best adaptation of Clannad there is, but it does have its merits, so I would recommend it as a nice little time killer for if you want a bite-sized, quiet romance to watch. (In the case of Kanon, they made that into a 13-episode series).

I had to see how it compares to the series.Sadly, this project is the worst possible adaptation of this story. That was obvious: when you know the original story is 70 hours long, of course it would be impossible to sum it up in less than 2 hours! There was no point in even trying... But I tried it anyway.STORYClannad Movie follows Tomoya and Nagisa\'s relationship as they fall in love and grow up. Just like the anime and the main route of...the original VN.While the original story (and the anime version) is a pearl, this version is pure crap. Not only does it focus much more on the School part instead of After Story, they also changed the dialogues way too much, erasing most of the depth of this story.But the worst of it all... IT CUTS HALF OF AFTER SERIES! I had heard it changed the end compared to the anime, but no, they did not change it, they just CUT IT OUT, erasing the most important and powerful part of the whole show (Ushio).ARTI knew this would be shit as soon as I heard it was from Toei. But it was even worse than I expected! Bad animation, ugly chara-design, random light effects without any artistic purpose that just blind the viewer...The anime is from 2008, but feels like it\'s from 2015.This movie, on the other hand, is from 2007 but feels like it\'s from the \'90s!!!SOUNDThey kept the original seiyuus (except from Tomoya, who had no voice in the VN), that is good. BUT... the OST is so lame.""Traditional"" would be an overstatement. I hardly heard music that much forgettable. Not only that, it doesn\'t fit the scenes very well.And let\'s not forget that techno version of the opening, which is just unappropriate and completely ruins the very first scene.CHARACTERCan this get even worse? Well, yes! Most characters are transformed into something else, because of all the changes of the story and the dialogues. And of course, most characters stories are cut or rushed (there\'s no time to develop these characters!).Sunohara is retarded. While he was already quite dumb in the original version, this is way worse here.Tomoya is edgy. You may like it or hate it, the fact remains that it doesn\'t fit the original version of the character at all. Tomoya is not supposed to be edgy, just a bit rebellious.As for the rest... many characters don\'t appear or are just useless as the movie focuses on Nagisa and Tomoya. None of the secondary characters are well developed anyway.ENJOYMENTI didn\'t expect to have a good time watching this, but it was even worse than expected. NOTHING is well done.In the end, you have a choice: either you watch the anime series, with its wonderful art, wonderful music and well more developed story and characters ; or you go with this short, uncomplete, ugly version of the same story.Frankly, if you want to know Clannad, watch the anime series.

And there is simply too much to put into a relative small time frame for a movie.Characters are being shown like cameos in their own story, characters have no motivations, nothing lead up to the ending, for what reason is Tomoya emotional at the ending? etc. etc.""For what reason is Tomoya emotional at the ending?"" is a...good question especially because, remember how long it took Tomoya and Ushio to accept and understand each other in the anime?. The two seconds it took for Ushio to see Tomoya as her father is baffling. And in my opinion shows perfectly why the movie tried to do too much in too little time.And if Tomoya has no reason to be emotional, why should we be emotional with him? good question especially because, remember how long it took Tomoya and Ushio to accept and understand each other in the anime?.

The reason that I understand is that they were made by completely different producers and you can get art differences and the story takes differently when produced by different people. The biggest reason I don't agree is due to the fact that the series had the same material that the movie had but the movie took the material and changed it so much that you can't even tell...who some characters are with how much they changed their personalities. I understand the series had time to flesh out characters and do character arcs but as a movie, they should have considered that the people watching it have at some point gone and played the visual novel and we the watchers know who the characters are so they didn't need to rewrite characters. They pandered too much to the audience that would go see it that hadn't played the visual novel. They also went extremely too fast they should have aimed for a second movie more so than trying to cram everything they can into one movie. I am extremely grateful I did not watch this before watching the series and playing the game. If I had I probably would not have watched the series or even bought 2 copies of the game! who some characters are with how much they changed their personalities.

The story of how Tomoya and Nagisa fell in love has changed, Ibuku the teacher wasn't supposed to be there at that period of time, Ibuku and her husband are close friends with Tomoya so close its like the relationship of Nagisa's parents, instead of the robot world shown it showed Tomoya and Nagisa's dream.The Tv series of Clannad is outstanding!I was hooked on it. Both the first season and after story are very good and I suggest you watch those first...before you watch the movie. The story was brilliant, art was great, enjoyment was good too.I thought the movie was going to show what happened before Nagisa..But its confusing I can't tell if it was before or based on the series. All the events are messed up (I can't tell you). But the main thing is that is irritating is that Nagisa is extremely confident in this. She still may have the same characteristics but she talks to anyone. In the series Tomoya finds her but this time Nagisa finds him. In the Tv series the whole point of achieving Nagisa's dream is also to make her confident but in the movie she already is. Its all pointless nowI also have a concern about the characters like Kyou, Tomoyo, Kotomi, Ro and Fuko (basically all of Tomoya's and Nagisa's friends) they weren't shown much. And in the movie it only shows that Kou, Tomoyo and of course Tomya's best friend in the movie. No Kotomi which is Tomoya's childhood friend. She is supposed to be shy and socially awkward and on her own in the library but here she is the leader of the Choir club.You may want me to answer the main question about this movie. Is the movie like the summary story of what happened? and the answer is..Kind of. If you are worried you might see the events all over again. you won't. The story is the same just events different.Overall this movie is very rushed and looks like they wanted to get over with making it. This movie is quite depressing and I wished the ending was like the Tv series but unfortunately no it wasn't. Nagisa is the main character .she whole point of the show and the whole point of Clannad and you will see what happens when you watch the movie which is cruel.This movie could be showing 'another world' in the TV series it would always say and show there is another world like ours and our lives are linked to the other world. Maybe thats why it is different. in the tv series the ending was happy because of the light that gave you wishes. but nothing like that happened in the movie. before you watch the movie.

The main bulk of the story is fun, balances the lighter parts with the more serious root of the story nicely, and keeps the focus nicely on the two protagonists. It's funny, properly funny, and the romance aspect works really nicely for the most part, pacing itself decently.At least... until it gets to the end of the main story. I was wondering why, as it came along, the romantic end felt weirdly rushed, almost brushed over. I was concerned about how they'd...ended the film. And then it carries on for another half an hour. At which point the pacing sort of falls of a cliff. The rest of the film, adapting roughly half of the notorious 'after story' I've heard so much about, has a really rough switchover, rushing through both the ending of the 'main' story and the introduction to the after story, meaning that both of them lose a lot of their impact; I was so distracted by the jarring transition that I forgot to care a little bit. I didn't entirely not care, there was SOME reaction, but the emotions definitely didn't hit at the level I think they were expecting to.Thankfully, by the time the after story settles down, it manages to pull itself back admirably. While the pacing definitely had its struggles, it manages to calm down, let the story actually play out, and while I was still a little distracted by the crossover to have an entirely emotional reaction to the ending, I definitely enjoyed that ending.On the broader production side, it's fine. The animation isn't fantastic but isn't terrible, the music isn't awful but isn't particularly memorable, the supporting cast is likeable but not especially deep. It's solid, definitely not something that's going to stick with me into the future, but something I'm definitely glad to have watched and that I enjoyed plenty. At the least, it's given me a reason to maybe even go and watch the series. ended the film. And then it carries on for another half an hour. At which point the pacing sort of falls of a cliff.

Well this might be for you...Animation: 7I honestly can't tell if this movie was made in 2007 or 1977 at times, the directing is so old-school that it harkens back to the days of Tohoscope flicks such as Mystery of Mamo and Golgo 13. Not that I'm complaining.Story: 6/10Delinquent duo Tomoya Okazaki and Youhei Sunohara are two down on their luck poor sods dealt a bad hand at high school until they meet the main heroine of the VN, Nagisa Furukawa. From there we get a sweet movie about...these two helping her perform a solo play at the school festival. What I like most about this movie is Sunohara's character. Somehow he has more depth than in the TV anime and feels like an actual real person.Style: 6More style than whatever zoomer crap is being made today, that's for sure. Though it may feel 30 years older than it actually is.Overall: 7This movie is an okay retelling of Clannad, but no substitute for the original story. I recommend either starting with the TV anime or VN and then watching this movie for the amazing Sunohara and Okazaki bro moments. these two helping her perform a solo play at the school festival.

Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39026/Dumbbell_Nan_Kilo_Moteru,"[""Pretty girls in sports wear that unveil every inch of their sexy bodies with mind-boggling efficiency. Muscle-bros so big you need a rock climbing permit for a piggyback ride. When gym enthusiasm collides with anti-broscience humor, you have Dumbbell, the funniest ecchi comedy since Prison School. However this is not an entirely comedic series (nor is its ecchi pushy in case someone minds), rather it can also be very serious and motivational at times.What the series manages to do with its cast is the impressive part because with simple character traits it manages to deliver smooth and hilarious comedy. We have characters such as...Akemi, who is really into big muscle boys. She has a downright muscle fetish and whenever she sees some awesome gains, her eyes turn into hearts and she starts drooling all over the place. Our real main character (Hibiki) is in bad fit. All she does it eat candy and slowly get fat, but for her, it's time to change and start her adventure towards ideal sexy body! Her role in the comedic narrative is one of the best and most relatable for anyone who has started gym and once been a newbie. Her reactions, learning-curve and muscle pains are both hilarious and accurate. We also have some less significant side characters such as Ayaka who is tanned, petite, and in good fit. She mainly exist there to fill some ecchi quota and also to offer variety, because in this series, it's important that there are gym-goers anywhere from over-weighted newbies to body builder pros. As a whole, the series has many more characters than I listed down and does splendid job offering accurate jokes that are relevant to each gym-archetype you'd see when going to one.Men! No pretty girls without manly men! When bodybuilder pros lift weights, the execution, the determination and the seriousness is so awe that it becomes funny. This is one of those series that can be funny and serious at the same time because even the jokes have relevant substantial value. It's kind of like self-irony. The female casts' reactions and the anti-broscience take on gym is pushed so far and to such extreme that the series reaches a point where it becomes motivational. While the series has not yet overtaken r/fitness, it's easy to say that it is going to change some of its viewers life and make them do sports. I am training my butt as we speak.Does it have a story? Already gave that away. School girls want to train. The story itself is highly slice of life oriented. These girls are each others friends and hang out/have life outside gym as well, so it's pretty based from that part. Production values? The art itself is surprisingly decent. Comedy delivers due to good use of production values that are simple but arguably exactly enough for a series of this sort. Opening song/animation is welcoming and memorable. You can pretty much catch the required mindset by simple watching the OP. Not the highest values in the industry, but good decisions have been made.As far as entertainment value goes, this is the funniest and sexiest show you can watch this season. Pure, simple, genuine entertainment. I pray for the uncensored version and recommend giving this a try. Some people seem to like it ironically and praise it because it's not cool to say that this show is actually legit good, I guess, but it really is. Akemi, who is really into big muscle boys.

Its got a colorful cast of characters who each add their own flair to the show and showcases some really solid comedy. It also provides some actually useful knowledge about the human body and working out. But you know what sets it apart from practically all other anime I’ve watched?It’s motivationalTo me, this is a pretty monumental feat. You’ll be hard pressed to find a show that actually inspires you to do what’s being shown. When I watch sports anime for example, I don’t immediately think to go and become...more athletic so I can look like the hot anime dudes playing the sports. Yet strangely enough, watching a ridiculously jacked almost nude dude giving me training lessons while girls drawn to look as seductive as possible are giving the demonstrations made me get up and train with them. And I did this with every single episode. Better yet, I actually started exercising regularly by using the exercises taught in the show. But I'm not here to talk about me, so let's get into what I like about this anime!The story follows high schooler Sakura Hibiki as she goes on a quest to obtain the ultimate slim sexy body by working out. The girl must be a perfectionist, because she’s already got a super hot bod anyway, but that’s besides the point! The anime doesn’t explore much plot wise outside of the characters working out in different ways in different locations under different circumstances, but that’s absolutely fine for this kind of anime! The best part is that it just never gets boring. Each episode throws the characters into diverse environments ranging from mountain ranges to beaches and has them tackle differing obstacles in life…and in the weight room. As the anime progresses, more girls are added in, and the show just got better and better in terms of content with each girl added. Probably because of how quirky each girl ended up being.To give a brief break down on each of them, Hibiki is just adorable af and likes to eat, Akemi has awesome heart pupils and has a muscle fetish, Zina is an eccentric Russian otaku, Satomi is a cosplaying teacher, and Ayaka’s got some ABS! Character development? Pfft, who cares! All that matters is that they have great personalities, are all single and look great while working out. Of course, I can’t leave out everyone’s favorite muscle bro Machio, who is just so full of knowledge about muscles…and he’s just pretty full of muscles period. The dude also drops some fantastic one liners.This anime throws so much random stuff at you from time to time and it’s just brilliant. Just when I was going to take a break from exercising and watch an idol anime, BOOM! The girls audition as muscle idols. When I was beginning to question this anime being an ecchi, BOOM! The girls get their cloths obliterated Shokugeki style after witnessing Machio’s radiant muscles. And just when I was craving an image of a shirtless Comrade Putin posing with a bear in the icy Russian mountains, BOOM! The anime delivers. This show also has frickin' ARNOLD SCHWARZEN- ah, I mean, BARNOLD SHORTSINATOR! And the references he makes are great, such as the famous “hasta la vista, baby” line from Terminator 2. Arnold, er, Barnold’s inclusion in this show is honestly one of the best references that I’ve seen in an anime. There’s also a multitude of fourth-wall breaking, which is always amusing. The comedy in this show is seriously quite good, and it’s been one of the very few anime in recent memory to actually make me laugh out loud while watching.And honestly, that’s usually enough to make me really appreciate a show. But that aside…sai?…Sai…SAIDO CHESTO!!!!!!!!!!*Ahem* As I was saying, aside from the animated characters and sound comedy, Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru boasts some solid animation and sound. Visually, muscles are drawn with high precision. Machio just looks super macho! The girls are of course designed to be attractive, and I really like the coloring choices used by studio Doga Kobo, especially with the characters’ eyes. Sakura is the best example of their success in my opinion. She’s tan, blonde, has striking green eyes with a hint of pink, has twintails, has a fang, and has a super sexy bod that is slightly thicker than the other girls but still looks fantastic.Yeah, A+ character design right there. And while I may sound a little creepy and sad by expressing my attraction to a 2D anime girl, I’m the target audience and I like what I see, so that’s a success by the studio in my eyes!“HIP RAISE! SIDE BEND! BENT OVER! LAT PULL DOWN!” Wow, just listening to the opening made me discover so many different exercises. Even the damn theme song is educational! The song itself is super catchy and fun. Also, thanks to the motivational shouting of Sakura and Machio, the tune actually becomes a pretty good work out song that weirdly gets me pumped up. Of course, where the sound department truly shines is in the voice acting. The “Uuuuus!” and “Ahhhhhs!” that the girls moan out when they’re exercising in particular are quite nice to listen to. And while they all did an excellent job, the seiyuu that I was most impressed with would  be Ai Fairouz, who makes her voice acting debut as leading lady Sakura Hibiki. And boy, does she deliver! She just sounds so passionate in her role. It really feels like she’s having a fun time doing this, and her excellent delivery really heightened the enjoyment of the show for me. Pretty darn good for a newbie. Let’s hope she can make a successful career in the industry!I don’t like talking about myself in a review, but it’s true that since watching this anime, I’ve improved both physically and socially. Now Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru obviously isn’t the reason why I started going out with people. And it’s clearly not magically making me more fit. But it provided a spark. It motivated me to make some changes in my life. Sure, they were minuscule changes, but they were for the better nonetheless. And because of that, this show has done more for me personally than practically every anime that I’ve seen, including most of my absolute favorites.Of course that’s just me, and I can’t guarantee that you’ll get anything out of Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru. Regardless, this anime is just super entertaining to watch, and hey, if you end up working out and developing super awesome muscles because of it, then that’s a sweet added bonus!

Then there are the Anime that try to do the same, only to fail miserably and fall flat on their faces. This Anime is not exactly the latter, but it comes close to being so, and why is that you ask? Because it tries to do so many things, but it doesn’t quite hit the mark with what it does, and it becomes obvious to the audience that it is trying it’s hardest to stand out, rather than just be a silly ecchi disguised as...a sports Anime. First of all, it tries to be an infomercial about sports, yet it doesn’t quite succeed in doing so since it’s busy trying to be a comedy as well. The comedy is not that funny or bone tickling anyways, since it is the same redundant gag repeated many times during each episode, and the whole gist of this Anime overall is being an ecchi that isn’t really an echhi, and that it is disguised as a gym infomercial or a slice of life about girls training.The comedy lands solidly due to the good production values and the decent delivery, but other than that there really isn’t any other merit to said comedy, since it gets repeated many times over until it turns trite. The production values are decent, from the decent animation, to the welcoming color palette, to the fine soundtrack, and there aren’t any complaints towards them. They are fine as they are and serve the show well enough.As for the characters, they are the typical, run-of-the-mill slice of life characters. They aren’t really anything to write home about, yet they aren’t really one dimensional per say. Hibiki is not really a poorly developed character, she is nice as she is. However, Akemi is the basic rich girl who lacks anything that would make her stand out. Think of any typical and plain rich character you could find elsewhere and you will get her. Characters aren’t really bad, but they border on tame for most of the time, and they feel like they are epitome of slice of life characters.This Anime is a good Anime for the ecchi fans out there. Panty shots, thigh shots, gigantic tatas and everything else an ecchi lover wants, they can find it here. It is hot and it most certainly delivers regarding that aspect. The characters are good looking enough as they are, and that alone will attract ecchi lovers, and the fanservice most certainly delivers as well. The unfunny faces could turn out to be a problem though, and they ruin from the immersion of enjoying the sexiness that this Anime gives off.Overall, this is a fine Anime. What really hinders it from being good is the fact that it tries so hard to be the jack of all trades, yet it only succeeds in one thing, and that is being sexy. It wasn’t a bad watch at the end of the day, it was a fine watch as it is, though I think that ecchi lovers will enjoy this one far more than I did, even when some unfunny bits are to be expected here and there. a sports Anime.

I was unsure about this at first as with the genres that were listed. But they honestly aren't a problem at all when it comes to this anime. It's hardly impacting the show in any bad light at all. Sure it may get repetitive over time. But it's not to the point that it would be annoying.I'd honestly say if you are interested in fitness, or just wanting to get into shape. Then give it a watch. It's not gonna be one of the best animes of course. But still a great watch. The characters are all honestly relatable. A nice anime. "", 'Put the chips down.  Place your sneakers on your feet.  Pull your shorts up…now pull them down again.  Now repeat that last motion…but slower.—WAIT!  These girls are only 17?…….F—K!!!Do you love promotional videos?  How about bench pressing?  What about lat pulldowns?………….Anyhow, “How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?” is an infomercial disguised as an anime — but wait, there’s more.  It features two ordinary girls — Hibiki (a slightly overweight Japanese girl) and Akemi (a girly who creams her pants every time she sees ‘Yuge!’ muscles) — as they visit the gym to strength train, build endurance,...and rip their bathing suit as they stretch (that face, tho!).  The characters, thus far, are nothing special, and are often one-dimensional.  Hibiki is your typical indolent teenager with poor eating habits, and Akemi is your straight-laced, rich girl who lacks a personality.Besides the blatant supraliminal messaging, “Dumbbells” is a silly comedy with a distinct slapstick flare.  A few of the jokes are worthy of a chuckle, but nothing is potent enough to evoke giggling or a laugh-out-loud moment.  It’s not terrible, nor is it worthy of being called ‘good.’“Dumbbells” is also considered Ecchi, but you wouldn’t have guessed it on first glance.  Most of the ‘lustful’ situations are tame by today’s standards.  Which is a good attribute when you consider the sheer volume of fan-service(y) anime in today’s market.  So if you have laundry to fold or homework that needs to be completed, then this is the perfect anime to play in the background to raise your MAL statistics. and rip their bathing suit as they stretch (that face, tho!).

I love Doga Kobo and their work, so I was hyped for this anime and Doga Kobo delivered.Hibiki is your ordinary high school girl who eats tons of food. She gets fat and wants to lose that fat. After failing to work out on her own she starts going to the gym. The rest of the anime we follow her trips to the gym. We get to know how she does the excercises, meet a colorful cast of characters and we get to...see her improve her body as she series move on. It is a very simple story but an enjoyable one that isn't taxing on the brain.So one of the first things you notice about this anime is the overload of information they throw at you on how to excercise. This is because the anime is a form of edutainment. Edutainment is entertainment that you learn lots from. Anime that use this practice are for example Yuru Camp and Sounan Desu ka? Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru is an edutainment anime about excercising (more specifically excercising in gyms). So is the information useful?..... pretty much yes. I started to work out because of this anime, which I think says enough about if it works.The characters are really good. Hibiki is fun and relatable, Akemi's muscle fetish reminds me of Lalatina from Konosuba and I love it, Machio is absolutely hilarious by design alone and the rest of the cast are just as colorful and fun as the main characters.The animation is gorgeous. Doga Kobo went all out with the designs, sakuga, art style, it all so lovely to look at! The OP and ED are also really catchy.And last but not least, the anime is fun. The comedy gave me a few belly laughs. The character interactions are so lovely and fun. The edutainmen parts are incredibly useful and if they aren't useful, entertaining.Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is a great anime. Doga Kobo's has made some quality anime for a year now. Uza Maid, Anima Yell, Watashi ni Tenshi, Senko-san, but despite them Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? rises above all of those anime. Watch this anime. see her improve her body as she series move on.

Watch this anime."", 'Girl do you even lift!?How Heavy Are The Dumbells You Lift or my preferred name up above is the recent edition to a new sub genre of anime that I like to call cute girls doing cool and educational things. This year we’ve had girls singing beautiful songs and girls surviving on a deserted island. This time we have girls working out and getting in shape for our viewing pleasure, and what a pleasure it is.The concept for this anime/manga is genius. How do we get people to start taking care of themselves? How do we get people to hit the gym? The...answer is simple, get some cute anime girls to hit the gym in your place thus inspiring you to do the same. I mean what could be a better motivator then you and your waifu working out side by side.The anime even has a good starting off point for those who are hesitant to the idea of “physical activity”. The show starts off with the main character Hibiki wanting to get in shape for the summer. The kind of goal that just about anyone post New Year’s Eve can relate to. The only difference is Hibiki follows through with her plan by joining Silverman’s Gym which is definitely not based off anything. From there she is introduced to her gym friend and muscle freak “ “ along with the gyms trainer Machio San which if the name is any indication is a completely normal average guy who just happens to have a rare form of gigantism where every part of his body except his head is supersized. Normally that kind of disproportionate body size thing would irk me but this is a comedy, so it just works. The dude is also allergic to clothes if you know what I mean.There isn’t really much of a story aside from every day presents a new workout for the girls to try. There are a few short story arcs with some surprising cameos but most of the time is devoted to flexing and posing. Yes, that’s right. This show is one big Jojo reference. The cats out of the bag. It was just a JoJo anime all along.Getting back on track, I like that the show is actually taking the time to educate me on the different workout techniques that are displayed. Now I know there are going to be some people that say the fanservice distracts from the learning opportunities but in all honesty, for once the fan service is both needed and justified. It’s needed because an anime just about people working out with no fan service is not going to motivate anyone to check out the show let alone attempt any of the workouts. Finally it’s justified because the act of working out is all about improving the body. Making the body look good. It’s a necessary evil.When it comes to getting in a good work out, the right music play list is needed to get you in the mood to train hard. Luckily this anime provides both a good opening song and ending song to listen to the next time you feel like pumping iron. Art and animation is pretty good especially the when it comes to accentuating the finer details of the human body for educational purposes of course. Seriously though, lots of eye candy in this show and you have the art/animation to thank for that.Overall, this is my kind of show. It’s the perfect blend of entertainment and education. Call it edutainment. Might even have to give it the rewatch just so I can workout to it and follow along with the characters. I can confidently give “Girl Do You Even Lift!?” my full recommendation. answer is simple, get some cute anime girls to hit the gym in your place thus inspiring you to do the same.

Comedy and ecchi aren't typically my cup of tea, but much to my surprise, this anime was an exception.Besides all the fan service one can expect from ecchi (which to me the fan service hasn't been super in your face or over pushed), this anime is actually very motivational and informative. I think anyone who wants to start a healthier lifestyle or needs the motivation to hit the gym could benefit from this anime. Basically this anime shows you the proper techniques to work out at the gym and...home while keeping you interested following the story of high school girls trying to improve their bodies. At the end of every episode, they even walk you through a workout you can easily do at home.Overall I gave this anime a 10 because not only have I personally enjoyed it, but the concept of teaching a skill that all of us can only benefit from really pleasantly surprised me. I actually came out of this anime learning things I didn't know about nutrition and working out that I will definitely apply to my own life and future workouts. I recommend this anime to literally anyone who needs some motivation to begin a healthier lifestyle. Nice bulk! home while keeping you interested following the story of high school girls trying to improve their bodies.

Also, there were some info that as usual was typically not discussed like when it come to dieting, and when the one who was giving the tip was a typical stereotype of a bodybuilder like Machio, whose body was the kind where real life bodybuilder inject themselves with steroids.Verdict 3/10ArtPros: A lotta eyecandies, there were some swimsuit services.Cons: Most of the ecchi featured here was all about Machio and his steroid infused body, where his head looks like it was transplanted into a bodybuilders bod, and quite frankly him having to be in his posing briefs for most of the time, were just too annoying.Verdict 3/10SoundPros: Good opening and ending theme.Cons: Nothing to mentioned.Verdict 8/10CharacterPros: Nothing in particular.Cons: The characters here only serves one thin and one thing only and that was to play as host and models, in fact their character roles here were simply just forced comedy the weren't funny at all. To put in in simple terms, the characters roles can be compared to that of any morning exercise show that you can watch on TV. As for Machio's role, well, he basically was nothing more than to add insult to injury to all couch potato otakus out there, in fact a fitness event showing beautiful fit ladies would be much more of a effective motivator to get a couch potato in to shape, than to use someone in likes of Machio.Verdict 2/10EnjoymentPros: Well, it was enjoying to watch them eyecandies, being in their workout attire, but..........................Cons: Just watching this, one would be more focus on them girls than anything else, in fact when I watch this , I just skip out the workout tips that were in Machio's segment and just go with the girls' goal of being fit. Now to me I see no need to take in the fitness tips the were featured here cu'z I'm already engage in to it where, I run and participate in various marathon events, and trust me going to a gym is basically some thing that we do seldom, since we runner need to work out our endurance that to build muscle.Verdict 3/10OverallVerdict 2/10Realistically this anime was a far-cry as to the business of fitness in Japan, you see, only less than a few people there do go to gyms like Golds Gym, where membership is expensive.....Thought there were a lot of private gyms in Japan, most of them were not up to any standards that one would see in other countries, not to mentioned that even if Japs do have the time to go to get in shape, most would go to public gyms where prices were affordable , but still not up to US or European standards, but decent enough to get in shape. Also, neither this anime nor its manga version have any place in the otaku, it basically just doesn't belong around here, so basically studio Doga Kobo and the original creator, MAAM just made a stupid move of making this kind of shit, cu'z what they're doing was selling a Sweater to a Bedouin cu'z Japanese in general already have a healthy lifestyle and most really don't have any time to do such activity.

One day after “Dumbell Nan Kilo Moteru?” is released. You work at a fairly inconspicuous gym, it’s a slow day and all you can think of is going back home to throw back a cold one and pass out. Suddenly, you hear a loud rumbling sound from outside the gym’s front door. You start to panic, New years is still half a year away and you were planning on quitting before the horde consumed you. As the rumblings get louder you hear a faint: “Nice Muscle!” in the distance and you realize what is happening. It’s too...late. As hundreds of weebs fill the gym trampling you underfoot like Mufasa in The Lion King the last thought that goes through your head is “So this is the power of anime… not bad, not bad at all”.Tl;dr I’m going to be 100% real with you guys, back in the year 2017 I started reading this manga because I thought it was going to another generic ecchi anime just with all females. Don’t get me wrong, this show is about 75% ecchi nonsense but underneath all of it, you actually get a pretty comprehensible workout instructional video. The art is really good and while the story is pretty lackluster, does it really need a Shakespearean masterpiece? It’s relatively funny but all in all, it’s definitely not for everyone.Story 5: Comprehensible, reasonable, funny at times, but above all else mediocre.Just to rehash what I said earlier, this show doesn’t NEED to be really complex to be enjoyable. There really isn’t much to say about the story besides the fact that the humor SOMETIMES lands, at least I found it pretty funny, but you can definitely see pretty much all the jokes coming.Art 8: The trojan horse that got millions of weebs into working outYou can make pretty much any weeb do whatever you want by animating a cute anime girl to do it first and this is definitely the case with Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru. I really wish I had statistical evidence to back me up but I’m more than certain that this show has influenced MORE than a few people to get up and start doing a few pushups. And this can be credited to just fantastic art by Doga Kobo. That being said, I gave the art an 8 because the animation just isn't there. It's serviceable, especially during the workout sections but overall there really isn’t too much to write home aboutSound 10: SIDE CHESTOThis is pretty self-explanatory, the opening and ending are basically perfect and hypes everyone within a three-mile radius to jump off their couch and start doing sit-ups or flex in the mirror. Anything that hypes me up this much gets a 10 in my opinionCharacter 7: I can’t think of any jokes to be honestTo be honest I feel like almost everyone in this show can be explained with only one sentence (example: Hibiki likes to eat a lot. And Naruzou is really buff). There really isn’t anything I can say besides that, they aren’t bad and they fit the story perfectly but there really two dimensional.Enjoyment 10: Even with some of the shortcomings I talked about earlier, this show is still an absolute banger and will forever be known as the one show that finally pushed me to try working out for once. Even when I wasn’t pumping iron or running a 20-mile marathon (at least that what it felt like) it still kept my attention from start to finish which is all I can really ask for at this point.Overall 8: It’s a really good show and even if you’re not interested in sports at all I’d still recommend at least trying the show out for a little bit. late.

Now we finally have yet another anime to add that ever-growing collection CGDCT list. It's an anime you didn't know how much you needed before you actually watched it first hand. Basically, Dumbbell is cute girls working out. So first off, we are introduced to our adorable fang gyrau Sakura Hibiki. Who seems to think she is getting a little cubby down the tummy area and decides to hit the gym. But if you ask me, she...looks adorable and as ever and don't need to change one bit in any single way. Hibiki meets all kind of other charming and quirky girls in the gym. Among others, we have a lovely russian with an action-packed personality who loves real competition. A tan boxer girl with a striking personality as well as body undoubtedly. Not to mention, even a soft-spoken teacher who is a real otaku cosplayer on her days off. Lastly, a girl with a mad fetish for the muscles to top it all off.In other words, its non-stop fun with all these lovely girls who's persona bounces off well with the others. Then there's  Machio who is the personal trainer for these girls and the one who teaches them everything. As the girls are learning about how the equipment works, or how you do push-ups or sit-ups as you are meant to. Alongside, we have a small segment where the girls show us their good stuff to the audience and leave us captivated and immersed. All for the right reasons, of course. Basically, we got eyeful of candy which blesses your eyes and soul. As you might've suspected, Dumbbell uses this chance to show us some spicy fanservice, thighs, melons or buttocks, you name it. Not to mention, it's done as the girls are performing a training act, so the juiciness and flavour are incredible. Not but for real, you are learning in the best way possible. It's so educational in more ways than one, and it adds to the charm of Dumbbell.Some who might not be motivated to training or staying healthy might have a sudden change of heart, after or while watching this anime. We even get the details like how much calories and fat you can burn, or things you might not even have known prior. Whatever the case, there is definitely something for anyone in Dumbbell to enjoy. The comedy is also golden and hits the at the right time, and makes you laugh non-stop. It's rightfully timed, and the play with art-style makes it all come together, and really cause an impact. Studio Doga Koba is creative in the way how they utilize and twist and turn the art-style as they see fit. While we are on the topic now, yes, artistically it looks great and makes some anime give it run for its money. It's so pleasing and vibrant, the colours are popping and just looks great. There was not a single time for me personally, where I thought it looked off or noticed any form of derp. Same goes for animation, it's so fluid and complements the art-style for sure.In any case, the production value is solid, and studio Doga Kobo nailed their use throughout this fun and educational journey. But when have they ever failed us? Doga Kobo is still standing strong as the epitome of nailing all art-style when it comes to the works involving cute girls doing cute things. You can see their love and passion in the frames clearly, and just how much fun they had animating Dumbbell. I can't wait to see their next works at all. I am sure it will be another worthwhile and vibrant experience I will really enjoy. Now let's not forget about that. Oh, so catchy opening song which is to this day still stuck in my head. I can the whole song, but I bet I will blow some eardrums if I sang it with my crackpot Japanese. So I will not do that. It's so fun and did I forget to mention an educational song? That's right, you can learn something from the opening song, as you are bopping your head left and right to the catchy tune. The ending song is merely great too, and another catchy tune to add the collection.In the sound department overall tho, it's got a decent amount of tracks which fit the situation at any given time. There is this sinister last boss theme, or a piece of more upbeat training music to mention some. So if I haven't stated it any clearer, than I do in fact highly recommend Dumbbell. Not only if you are CGDCT enthusiast, more or less anyone might enjoy this anime. I can almost guarantee that you'll get a good laugh. As you are learning interesting things about working out while enjoying some savoury fanservice to boot. Now Dumbbell is not a character or especially story-driven anime, it's only meant for entertainment. But boy does it use the aspect of working out in some creative ways, which just never gets old. Since they always throw something new at you, in some shape or form. All in all, Dumbbell was a solid watch for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I am definitely gonna pick up the manga at one point. looks adorable and as ever and don't need to change one bit in any single way.

But when have they ever failed us? Doga Kobo is still standing strong as the epitome of nailing all art-style when it comes to the works involving cute girls doing cute things. You can see their love and passion in the frames clearly, and just how much fun they had animating Dumbbell. I can't wait to see their next works at all. I am sure it will be another worthwhile and vibrant experience I will really enjoy. Now let's not forget about that. Oh, so catchy opening song which is to this day still stuck in my head. I can the whole song, but I bet I will blow some eardrums if I sang it with my crackpot Japanese. So I will not do that. It's so fun and did I forget to mention an educational song? That's right, you can learn something from the opening song, as you are bopping your head left and right to the catchy tune. The ending song is merely great too, and another catchy tune to add the collection.In the sound department overall tho, it's got a decent amount of tracks which fit the situation at any given time. There is this sinister last boss theme, or a piece of more upbeat training music to mention some. So if I haven't stated it any clearer, than I do in fact highly recommend Dumbbell. Not only if you are CGDCT enthusiast, more or less anyone might enjoy this anime. I can almost guarantee that you'll get a good laugh. As you are learning interesting things about working out while enjoying some savoury fanservice to boot. Now Dumbbell is not a character or especially story-driven anime, it's only meant for entertainment. But boy does it use the aspect of working out in some creative ways, which just never gets old. Since they always throw something new at you, in some shape or form. All in all, Dumbbell was a solid watch for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I am definitely gonna pick up the manga at one point."", 'Onegai muscle meccha motetaaaaiOnegai muscle meccha yasetaai yes!Onegai muscle meccha motetaaai karaUuu! (Kireteruyo!) Haa! (Kireteruyo!)Kin niku ni onegaiOk, so another Josei theme anime has just ended, but unlike the usual josei genre anime which was always set in a school setting, this one was set in a gym where it involves a quartet of girls whom decide to become gym members in some gym called ""Silvermans"" which btw was a parody of ""Golds Gym"" in Japan which btw has 38 branches in Japan. So, lets get down to business:Story-Very Good 8:Because it was informative, thought the plot was more on the fitness and working out...side, now , I don\'t about you guys out there when it come to your level of gym and workout IQ, but one thing I can tell you was that the information about the kinds of workout routine was just based on the original creator\'s knowledge about the kinds of workout programs that he or she has......but, that is of course if this Original Creator who calls him or herself ""MAAM"" is also a fitness buff him or herself. But then again, in reality each fitness trainer has his or her program, so what this certain ""MAAM"" has was probably his or her program. Cu\'z for one thing, not every info in this anime or manga were correct, in fact  some of the workouts being featured around here were simply too far fetch or were just made out, one example was working out the calf muscle in order to incense stamina and speed in running was just all wrong, and just relying on protein alone just to have the kind of body that Machio has was also an understatement, cu\'z   realistically speaking bodybuilders pump themselves up with a lotta supplements and steroids. Now what make me rate this an 8 cu\'z it was probably the only info anime that doesn\'t require a plot, cu\'z basically that wasn\'t the original creator\'s plan , his or her intention was to promote fitness and that\'s that.Art-Pathetic 1:Ok, so this anime does have an ecchi genre, but most of it was more like an ecchi for gays and girls with a muscle fetish and yes I\'m referring to Machio Naruzou\'s illustration, were he was illustrated as a stereotypical gym rat, that  otaku\'s and geeks would really love to hate. Also, his head was ridiculously a mismatch for his head were it can also be a metaphor that he\'s all brawn but no brainsSound- Very Good :And that\'s for the opening theme, also, it was a good move for studio Doga Kobo to cast Yui Horie to voice a matured character like Tachibana Satome the girls teacher, since Yui is already in her mid 30\'s and that for her to voice a younger character who happens to be a joshkausei would be pathetic.Character- Dreadful 2:Ok, so we have Hibiki whom at first want\'s to lose weight but ends up being a fitness freak, we have  Souryuuin, Akemi who was the quintessential rich girl with a muscle fetish, we have Uehara, Ayaka, whom at first unknown to Hibiki was already a fitness buff and we have Gina Boyd a Russian expat who simply went to Japan to compete in arm wrestling but decide to stay after being beaten by Hibiki and let\'s not forget the Tachibana Satomi who also at first wants to lose weight and just like Hibiki she to becomes a fitness freak, now just there girls would have been fine , but what\'s annoying was Machio Naruzou, who always flaunts his huge muscle in fact there wasn\'t an episode where you won\'t see him ripping his track suit in order to show off the results of his so called hard work   Basically, he\'s a metaphor for a school jock that bullies the weak. Also, his stereotype basically give a wrong impression were he symbolizes a healthy person who practices a healthy lifestyle , but realistically Bodybuilders weren\'t exactly healthy and their lifestyle were far from healthy, also girls in reality weren\'t very much a fan of guys with huge muscles and there were studies and surveys that shows it, in fact girls were more attracted to ripped guys with six packs and I\'m referring to the abs, So generally speaking the ecchi part here was more like gay ecchi where Machio would serve as every gay\'s sexual fantasy.Enjoyment -Poor 3:Basically, I just see this as more like a chore than something to be enjoyed.Overall-Poor 3.Thought this maybe informative and helpful, IMAO, this anime was just like selling a cooler to an Eskimo, cu\'z in reality, Gyms in Japans like that of Golds Gym were really expensive and also gyms in Japan tend to have a lotta wired house rules and were under equip and let\'s not forget that most Japanese in general don\'t have anytime for such extra curricular activity and they don\'t have to, cu\'z they already were practicing a healthy lifestyle so for them to even give such anime/manga like this any attention was just a waste of time, in fact only those in the 0.05 percent would have the time to engage in such activity. Even if Japanese would have the time to get themselves in such activity, they would go a public gym where prices would be affordable. So Overall, this anime/manga was just a PWT where otakus would rather go bananas with them eye-candies like Hibiki, Gina , Akemi and Ayaka, than to take their tips seriously......Machio on that other hand basically was someone whom them Otakus would love to hate, so basically this anime or it\'s manga really have no place around here.The end. side, now , I don\'t about you guys out there when it come to your level of gym and workout IQ, but one thing I can tell you was that the information about the kinds of workout routine was just based on the original creator\'s knowledge about the kinds of workout programs that he or she has......but, that is of course if this Original Creator who calls him or herself ""MAAM"" is also a fitness buff him or herself.

However, even though the concept is brilliant, the execution however, is somwhat dissapointing. This review is mostly going to be from my perspective as a gym bro, so bear with me.It was oblivious from the first episode that this is an anime writen by someone who has never been to the gym and got most of the advice on it from people...who don\'t really know what their talking about, your generic personal trainers that can be found in most gyms. The advice was sometimes good, but most of the times it was the same bro-science people have been repeting for decades without actually looking at research. The form on exercices is also mostly wrong, it would litteraly take 5 minutes to go on youtube and write ""How to bench"" or ""How to squat"" and see how its actually done and show it that way in an anime. Having said all that, the redeming fact about the show is that it will definitly inspire more people to start living healtier lives and strength train.Anime wise, it was pretty average, but also very fun at moments. The animation was pretty good, however could have been better on some of the exercises, the characters were pretty one-dimensional and had one or two character traits that kept being repeated. Really wanted them to show a lot more exercises in the gym, maybe throw in a few more cultural references, overall spend more time in the gym insead of doing other random things. As I said earlier, the idea is great, and had it been executed better, for example making it a sports/comedy anime about powerlifting or some simular sport. Sound wise, the opening and ending are very catchy and great songs.Overall, I give this a 6/10, as it did have its moments that I enjoyed, but it could have been so much better.

As someone who works out i'm impressed how well they explain things.I usually don't like fanservice when it distracts too much form the story or the camera is awkwardly placed to allow an upskirt but oddly, since this anime has not much of a story, it is not bothersome. And anybody who works out knows how much fanservice there is in a fitness center. Some of it is actually pretty accurate.You can to an extent identify with the mc.

Of course, back then i didn\'t know this stuff was Ecchi! So, yeah... should\'ve probably checked for that.Now onto my review.[ Art & Animation - 7/10 ]Already in just the first episode we get a pretty neat art style change for one of her reactions and though it\'s messy, I totally dig it.Sadly, at times the animation is a bit lazy and lacking....[ Sound - 6-7/10 ]Somehow, Ian Sinclair does not sound nearly as entertaining as he normally does in this show. Pity, he\'s so entertaining in Kaguya-Sama. At times, he does hit that high bar, but usually he doesn\'t quite hit the mark the way he did with the other show. And the commentary is fine, but not as entertaining as it is in other shows with narration.Oh, and... can we talk about how the ending sequence is possible one of the worst ones I\'ve ever seen or heard?Otherwise, the OST is... serviceable. And the opening is okay.That said, the voice actors that voice our three main teen girls perform pretty well.Machio\'s voice just doesn\'t really suit him though.---[ Story - 6-7/10 ]Standard sports anime, but here the motivation is for a teen girl to lose weight. And, while that is technically relatable, it also seems to be the only thing associated with women when it comes to sports. They are either side characters in side teams in sports anime, or they participated in a limited variety of sports... and that\'s even counting western stuff. Here they don\'t just attend the gym - they also participate in track activities and race at the beach... oh and... idol competitions...? Huh??? I mean, I enjoy the variety, but somehow I\'ve grown tired of the way every sports anime has to shoehorn training into EVERYTHING. Especially since this one also mentions that relaxation is a part of training. You can\'t just train ALL the time... that\'d be counter-productive. And it could give more opportunity to see what else these characters like...Oh, yeah and that reminds me of the many cliches in this anime. Sure it\'s twisted into a work out session, but Free!! did that too, so it\'s not anything terribly new. Still an attempt was almost made right until the fanservice scene. (Let\'s not forget these girls are teens...)Sometimes it\'s ruined by this weird muscle fanservice - and regular fanservice - that makes me cringe... but hey, that\'s Ecchi for you, I guess.That being said, promoting exercise among women is hardly a bad thing.---[ Characters - 6/10 ]So, right from the start, we have one glaring issue here. The MC\'s best friend, as is typical for these stories... is a bit of a bitch. By that I mean she has absolutely no qualms about making the main character feel terribly self-conscious about her weight. I should add at this point that 55 kg for a woman who is 160 cm tall is actually within the ideal weight realm? Thus, weight wise, she is perfectly healthy. Sure, she could always use the exercise - it is good for you to physically push yourself a little, regularly, after all, especially for your heart - and sure, a diet should be balanced and nutritious, not just within the calorie limit... but honestly, the ""friend"" did so not have to say it the way she did.I do like how the MC gets totally freaked out by the exercise-obsessed rich girl though... it feels so relatable. Besides, her obsession with muscles is seriously just... no. Too many muscles create too much wait which would actually inconvenience you in some ways in a fight, and, honestly... breeding dogs - along with horses - to be more muscular by nature doesn\'t tend to end well for them, so I\'m sceptical abou the long term effects of body building. In fact, a quick good can tell you that the issue with body building is multi-layered. Firstly, it\'s seen as a men\'s thing that is only attractive at certain ages with certain colours. As a result, discrimination is quite the issue in this community like with many communities. Secondly, the behaviours taken up by bodybuilders, their exercise routines, diets, etc. can cause injury or health problems and a good portion of them - about 1/10th, if the article I found is at all reliable - experience anxiety and/or body dysmorphia because of the obsession surrounding their looks. While thankfully the MC does not seem to fetishise it... her new found ""friend""... does. There is nothing wrong about exercising working on your stamina, strength, or physical appearance, or taking care of your health in any way, but when the obsessing over it actually and ironically results in the opposite, fetishising the kind of lifestyles that tend to promote this... is a dangerous thing to do. (It would be nice if people were, if nothing else, aware of this. That said, like what you like. Just be aware of the issues surroudning what you like.)However, our MC is easily swayed. One look at Mr Vaguely Attractive Looking and suddenly she wants to join for no less shallow a reason than her new friend did.While the characters and narrator do have some solid pieces of advice... I really don\'t get how the track suit guy hides all hat muscle under those clothes. It\'s a bit ridiculous... not really funny.Anyway, among the main stars of the show we have:Machio - who is basically exposition guy with the clothes ripping, secretly muscular despite looking like a regular guy quirk. It reminds me of the old guy in Dr Stone. His whole personality is the helpful bodybuilder. Heck, even when he does something that seems vaguely unrelated, it still somehow manages to involve bodybuilding and he still rips his shirt.Hibiki - the food obsessed, wants to slim down relatable TM girl. She\'s actually fairly entertaining and it\'s nice to see her not being perfect or a total winner even after putting in effort... but she could still have more dimensions to her than that. She obviously has insecurities, motivations - if somewhat skin deep ones - a personality, flaws, etc... but somehow, I feel like there are characers that have more of all of these in other anime. Still, she\'s a better MC than many male MC\'s in shounen if you ask me, so that\'s good. Honestly, she\'s the strongest character in this show...Akemi - she\'s the muscle fetishist. I\'ve seen the likes of her in Free!! and other shows... so honestly, she\'s nothing exceptional. Also, rich, famous, pretty, fit, nice and fanserviced... I totally expect her to be waifu material for some people... but the thing is... she doesn\'t feel like she has struggles, barely has motivations and only veery rarely falls short in anything.Teach is a secret cosplayer... which I could understand, but her cosplay choices are pretty lame, honestly.Gina is the Russian who gets beaten by a Japanese person. Not exactly unique.I wish the sharks got more showtime, honestly.---[ Enjoyment - 7/10 ]I was never bored by this anime per se, even though there were times when I disagreed with the choices they made... and that\'s more or less what\'s most important in an anime. Also, I don\'t mind the infomercial status of this anime. Sports anime are always informercials in one way or another - they all give information you could just google, but anime makes information more palatable and interesting and hypes you up for whatever it is the characters are doing... for some people it might even encourage them to do as the characters do. Obviously not in every scenario and I don\'t think animes which have dubious characters are to blame for a person\'s own terrible life decisions, but they can definitely be a both good and bad influence for anyone who doesn\'t have enough self-control or wisdom not to emulate every aspect of an anime.---[ Overally - 6-7/10 ] [ Sound - 6-7/10 ]Somehow, Ian Sinclair does not sound nearly as entertaining as he normally does in this show.

Secondly, the behaviours taken up by bodybuilders, their exercise routines, diets, etc. can cause injury or health problems and a good portion of them - about 1/10th, if the article I found is at all reliable - experience anxiety and/or body dysmorphia because of the obsession surrounding their looks. While thankfully the MC does not seem to fetishise it... her new found ""friend""... does. There is nothing wrong about exercising working on your stamina, strength, or physical appearance, or taking care of your health in any way, but when the obsessing over it actually and ironically results in the opposite, fetishising the kind of lifestyles that tend to promote this... is a dangerous thing to do. (It would be nice if people were, if nothing else, aware of this. That said, like what you like. Just be aware of the issues surroudning what you like.)However, our MC is easily swayed. One look at Mr Vaguely Attractive Looking and suddenly she wants to join for no less shallow a reason than her new friend did.While the characters and narrator do have some solid pieces of advice... I really don\'t get how the track suit guy hides all hat muscle under those clothes. It\'s a bit ridiculous... not really funny.Anyway, among the main stars of the show we have:Machio - who is basically exposition guy with the clothes ripping, secretly muscular despite looking like a regular guy quirk. It reminds me of the old guy in Dr Stone. His whole personality is the helpful bodybuilder. Heck, even when he does something that seems vaguely unrelated, it still somehow manages to involve bodybuilding and he still rips his shirt.Hibiki - the food obsessed, wants to slim down relatable TM girl. She\'s actually fairly entertaining and it\'s nice to see her not being perfect or a total winner even after putting in effort... but she could still have more dimensions to her than that. She obviously has insecurities, motivations - if somewhat skin deep ones - a personality, flaws, etc... but somehow, I feel like there are characers that have more of all of these in other anime. Still, she\'s a better MC than many male MC\'s in shounen if you ask me, so that\'s good. Honestly, she\'s the strongest character in this show...Akemi - she\'s the muscle fetishist. I\'ve seen the likes of her in Free!! and other shows... so honestly, she\'s nothing exceptional. Also, rich, famous, pretty, fit, nice and fanserviced... I totally expect her to be waifu material for some people... but the thing is... she doesn\'t feel like she has struggles, barely has motivations and only veery rarely falls short in anything.Teach is a secret cosplayer... which I could understand, but her cosplay choices are pretty lame, honestly.Gina is the Russian who gets beaten by a Japanese person. Not exactly unique.I wish the sharks got more showtime, honestly.---[ Enjoyment - 7/10 ]I was never bored by this anime per se, even though there were times when I disagreed with the choices they made... and that\'s more or less what\'s most important in an anime. Also, I don\'t mind the infomercial status of this anime. Sports anime are always informercials in one way or another - they all give information you could just google, but anime makes information more palatable and interesting and hypes you up for whatever it is the characters are doing... for some people it might even encourage them to do as the characters do. Obviously not in every scenario and I don\'t think animes which have dubious characters are to blame for a person\'s own terrible life decisions, but they can definitely be a both good and bad influence for anyone who doesn\'t have enough self-control or wisdom not to emulate every aspect of an anime.---[ Overally - 6-7/10 ]', '""How Heavy Are The Dumbbells You Lift?"" presents a unique blend of fitness, comedy, and motivational elements within the anime landscape.

It's cool if you are, but I am not. I don't come to an anime to view cute/sexy girls. I come for story substance or comedy or... Well a number of factors. For this anime, the humour felt like it really hit the mark for me, with a good deal being relatable for anyone who has ever lived a gym lifestyle or, like the MC, struggled with food portion control. I am...very guilty of this myself in the past and even now.The form on the exercise and the explanation of the purpose of each exercise was superb to the best of my knowledge (amateur level, 2 years of gym for weight loss primarily but also strength building.) The diet advice closely matches advice I received, and followed, 2 years ago from my semi-professional powerlifting friend. I learned a lot of additional information that made a lot of sense, I.E. about the sumo diet which closely matched how I used to eat pre-exercise and diet routine.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It might not be for everyone, but it seems to fit the exercise fanatic, exercise amateur and ecchi fan niches perfectly.psst..

Well, this anime absolutely surprised me. I was on the fence about watching it this season, but, eventually took the plunge. I found myself not only enjoying the girls’ story, but also learning quiet a bit as well. They did a fantastic job of knowing their source material, and translating it into something informative, yet, entertaining.Story: The story is basically, just the following of four highschool girls, and their journey into the realm of weight training. Their adventures generally didn’t carry over into the next episode, as they were normally on a different adventure or struggle with each episode.Art: The art and animation...was fantastic IMO. A lot of eye-candy here, and the characters were all well drawn and generally speaking fairly unique. Also not gonna gripe about the Ecchi and Fan Service in this one.Sound: The OP was absolutely one of the most catchy ones this season. I absolutely loved it. The score for the anime itself, and the inspirational narrator made for an all around fun atmosphere.Characters: What’s not to love? They all had their own quirks, and were all absolutely adorable. They had their own reasons for wanting to get into weight training, and their own circumstances surrounding their joining of the group. So many waifus in one show!Enjoyment: This was one of the anime’s I enjoyed the most this season. I always found myself eager to see what they were up to- and I never found myself thinking an episode felt full. Not to mention it was super informative, like I mentioned earlier.Overall: I give it an 8/10. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys sports anime, and honestly, if it’s not your thing, don’t be turned away by the Ecchi tag, it’s really not too egregious in this show, in comparison to others. was fantastic IMO.

Extreme designs, animation, plots, and so on. But with so many anime out there reaching all kinds of extremes, it can be difficult to break out from the crowd and truly feel original. So why not make something that most would say is the exact opposite of what anime fans are interested in? That idea might just be crazy enough to work; and for ""How Heavy Are The Dumbbells You Lift?"", it certainly does.Creating a show about working out has to be difficult, especially with an audience who has zero interest...in the subject. But throw in cute girls, a great art style, fantastic comedy, well placed ecchi, and genuinely entertaining educational moments, you can\'t help but be sucked in to such a crazy, but hilarious series.The show follows Hibiki and her friends as they dive into the world of weight lifting and exercising. Anime girls exercising is something that piqued my interest simply because of how out there it was, and I quickly found myself loving it every single week. A big reason is because of the characters. Hibiki, our main character, eats a little too much, but wants a beach body for the summer. She joins the gym on a whim thanks in part to her friend Akemi, who is obsessed with muscles. The cast continues to get crazier and more hilarious as the series goes on. This includes the attractive, yet insanely muscly, gym trainer Machio. Which I\'m sure you can already tell just by his name how macho he really is.The characters have a great synergy with one another that was very entertaining. This is thanks to how well written the comedy for this show is. With the hilarious focus on outrageous muscles, the various ways to workout, and the hi-jinks that ensue, every episode was always an enjoyable watch. It embraced its absurdity and used it to only make the show funnier. It never felt too tried hard, nor did this ever take itself seriously.But to my surprise, I found myself really enjoying the educational part of the show too. From lessons about basic workouts, to proper form for each workout, safety precautions, various ways to workout without going to a gym, and more, the educational part never felt like a detriment to the show. Lessons were perfectly weaved into the show based on what was going on in the story.Visually, it was a pleasure to look at. The girls are insanely cute, and the art style is just downright attractive. Characters like Machio with highly defined muscles all looked accurate and detailed. The animation wasn\'t bad and I would say that this was above average in the visual department.Sound was great due to terrific performances by the cast. Stand outs would be Hibiki\'s actress, Ai Fairouz, Machio\'s actor, Kaito Ishikawa, and Gina\'s actress, Nao Touyama. These are just 3 stand outs in an already excellent cast. The Opening and Ending themes are fantastic, both being as equally entertaining to listen to (with many of us adding them to our workout playlists). The soundtrack itself never really stood out to me. I don\'t really remember any specific tracking sticking out to me, save for the super catchy song that played during Machio\'s lessons. The sound design was great, as it utilized comedic sounds to help emphasize jokes.Whether you\'re on the beach, walking down the street, at home with no equipment, or whatever the case may be, How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift shows that you can workout any time and anywhere. It presents it in a clear and easy to understand way that\'s both funny and entertaining. It promotes and encourages a healthy lifestyle, which is a great message for a show to have.The comedy and visual style are excellent as they embrace their absurdity with a barrage of jokes that don\'t let up. The charm of the cast quickly grows on you too, which only amplifies the humor. If you\'re a fan of comedy and something that\'s a little different, I highly recommend checking out this show. I believe in time, it will become a comedy classic.Nice Bulk! in the subject.

Because I want to be popular!""LA didn\'t think LA wanted an ecchi educational anime about hitting the gym with cute girls but DAMN did Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? pull it off!Hibiki Sakura loves to eat, however when her best friend Ayaka Uehara tells her that she\'s gotten a bit of weight, Hibiki enrolls into Silverman Gym thinking she can breeze her way in exercising, until she finds out that it\'s a bodybuilding gym and she dislikes BUFF men, it cements when she encounters Akemi Souryin the student council president of...Hibiki\'s school also enrolls with Hibiki at the same time and Akemi joins not only to be healthy and fit but uhhh...she has a muscle fetish. Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? follows Hibiki through these crazy antics of Silverman Gym as she exercises her way to keep fit and meeting new and old members of the gym and beyond!.LA quickly grew to love Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? to be LA\'s second favourite anime of Summer 2019, yeah who would have thought and really though it\'s a rather formulaic anime where each episode focuses on certain gym exercises, Machio ripping his shirts and Hibiki getting fit as well as eating LOTS to balance things out, but still it\'s the tone and rather mundane craziness in it\'s comedy that Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? brings that had that certain charm to even get LA\'s seocnd favorite anime of Summer 2019 as a result.In terms of characters, the majority of the cast has really good chemistry with one another, especially from Hibiki to Akemi, Machio and Zina to Satomi to the majority of the cast for being the forced straight man of the comedic routine. Hibiki\'s one liner to Akemi, Machio and Zina were all gold and in turn Akemi\'s obsession with muscle, Machio\'s lessons that literally segways the anime and Zina\'s competitive streak to Hibiki all worked with one another. Satomi worked with most of the cast due to her secret hobby of being a cosplayer and she\'s the main cast\'s world history teacher, but her personality is twofold as she is the straight man in most situation, is usually the ""helper"" for Machio\'s training lessons, is generally the butt monkey of the group. She becomes a focus latter on due to her secret cosplaying which comes into play once Zina Voyd arrives voiced by Nao Touyama and LA\'s favourite character...because Nao Touyama. Zina being a Russian arm-wrestling champion (just go with it) and becomes something of a rival to Hibiki due to her match with her but she\'s something of a occidental otaku and her transferring to Hibiki\'s school due to her rivalry with Hibiki thus was a matter of time before she put two and two together. Zina as a character is a nice refreshing take on the funny foreigner and immensely helped due to Nao Touyama\'s cadence as she CAN do the stereotypical Russian cliches but her main gimmick was her overthinking about Hibiki and with her being the ""rival character"" blends well as a result. The ONLY character that LA thought didn\'t really get enough screentime or LA didn\'t really care...was Ayaka, yeah Hibikis\' best friend who incidentally started the plot to Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? in the first place, Ayaka for the majority of the anime becomes a satellite character to Hibiki and since her ""episode"" came early and unfortunately due to circumstances she doesn\'t go into the antics that Hibiki and the rest of the cast goes, she REALLY kept her satellite character status and probably the least developed character in the anime, heck MACHIO got more screentime and development with what development he got!. Machio as a character, he is the expository character as he IS a trainer and knows alot about exercising and he goes into a bit of development from both Akemi as well as HIS teacher latter on, he is nonetheless a great addition to the anime and immensely made the anime funny as hell. LA\'s favourite character was Zina but Satomi grew on LA to be LA\'s second favourite character but overall the main cast had great chemistry with one another, funny comedic moments and some development from them here for more comedic purposes.So yeah, the comedy lies in it\'s character interactions and man is it funny...Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? being a gym/exercising-centric anime, it\'s a given the anime was fanservicey and hell it is! From Machio\'s training lessons as at the end of it they show off rather lewd pic of one of the main cast to the OP itself but that is levied with the BUFFiness of the men of the anime, mainly from Machio but the men of Silverman Gym are BUFF so there are even fanservice for the girls...so people with the same obsession like Akemi gets mileage from this anime\'s fanservice and added to this the anime itself seems aware of the fanservice thanks to the narrator as well as the main cast pointing it out for laughs. Nonetheless the fanservice is great and greatly balanced thanks to the BUFFiness.The animation done by Doga Kobo was good in all honesty, from the character designs from the fanservice to the BUFF to the crazily funny comedic moments which is plentiful and even those reactions were one detailed and two changes styles wildly which helped with those reactions as a result. Doga Kobo knew what it could do with it\'s animation and man it flourished in Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? and it showed. Fanservicey animation sure but the animation nonetheless was consistently great all round.Nao Touyama, Nao Touyama, Nao Touyama...yes if you know LA, LA likes Nao Touyama and her role as Zina Boyd is no exception and hell LA watched or was curious of Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? because she was in this anime and man it was worth it. Sure Zina appeared halfway through the anime but like LA said, the character chemistry was great and the voice cast al the more helped with it, Sora Amamiya as Akemi and her obsession with muscles whilst still keeping her ojou-ness, Kaito Ishikawa\'s Machio ""small nice guy"" but sometimes hidden powerful cadence comes in to Yui Horie\'s straight man one liners as Satomi to the multi-cadences and Russian-seeped in Nao Touyama as Zina and hell even Shizuka Ishigami as Ayaka was a perfect fit. But the most surprising thing is the newcomer seiyuu and her debut role Ai Fairouz as Hibiki, she just had that flair and great one liners just like Nao Touyama and Yui Horie, she held up the anime in many ways not only because Hibiki was the narrative focus of the anime but just how much energy and comedic one liners she had with this anime, Ai was great and showed her potential as a seiyuu in this role and LA would like to see more from her because of it. Oddly enough LA did found out was that Ai Fairouz auditioned for Zina\'s role but the producers thought to cast her as Hibiki instead. Though interesting but Nao Touyama as Zina was perfect and Ai Fairouz was perfect even for a newbie seiyuu at that!LA DOES know that Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is actually in the same universe as Kengan Ashura (an anime LA had yet to watch by the time of writing this review) but LA heard it\'s a much more serious ""muscle getting used to good use"" instead of building that muscle anime and because of Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?, LA is curious as a result and to this end. To this end LA actually picked up the Dumbbell Nan kilo Matteru? manga, which isn\'t something LA usually does, so Dumbbell Nan Kilo Matteru did SOMETHING right for LA to look into this anime deeper...Zina?, the fanservice, the comedy?....Zina...Zina...Zina.Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? somehow had the blend of an ecchi-educational anime about gyms, cute girls going to the gym all the while having buff men on the side and at the end, IT WAS LA\'s SECOND FAVOURITE ANIME of Summer 2019, it did something right with LA and for LA it was both it\'s crazy cast of comedic characters, the voice cast as well as the fanservice as an extra bonus (Hell Zina was LA\'s third favourite waifu of Summer 2019 too!) and this coming from a person who goes to the gym but wanted to and does breeze through it like Hibiki initially did. If there is one strength from Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? besides the outrageous BUFFiness of Machio is it\'s comedy and it\'s characters and no doubt earned LA\'s second favourite anime of Summer 2019and as always...NICE BULK Hibiki\'s school also enrolls with Hibiki at the same time and Akemi joins not only to be healthy and fit but uhhh...she has a muscle fetish.

(ダンベル何キロ持てる？) is an anime featuring a group of school girls (and a teacher) who discover an interest with strength training in the gym. The girls want to either lose fat, or just get in better shape. The Trainer, ""Machio-san"", guides them by teaching them the ""do\'s"" and ""don\'ts"" of training.In terms of the story, I felt it was a little less captivating than your average \'Slice of Life\', as some episodes could have been a hit...or miss. Although this was the case, I still enjoyed it due to the mix between the seriousness and comedic based scenes. E.g. Some scenes would build up the pressure to make the audience anxious, but then Barnold Shortsinator walks in and acts as a comic relief.Not too much to say about the art style. The anime definitely achieved it\'s goal of portraying what it wanted to show. The mood switches, the character types and odd ecchi vibes were all suited.Okay, hands down the best opening and ending songs I\'ve listened to in a long time. For reference: OP - ""Onegai Muscle (お願いマッスル)"" by Hibiki Sakura (Ai Fairuz), & Naruzou Machio (Kaito Ishikawa) and ""Macho a Name? (マッチョアネーム？)"" Naruzou Machio (Kaito Ishikawa)"". They were so catchy that I didn\'t skip the OP/ED once. The voice actors, again did an amazing job of fitting the personalities of these characters. Also, the VA\'s for the American based characters (Barnold Shortsinator especially) fit really well.I felt like majority of the characters were likeable, and they all had completely different traits which were well suited to them. In terms of character development though, this could have been improved a lot more, as the anime focused slightly more on Hibiki\'s life than the rest of the group.A really enjoyable show overall, with it\'s comedic vibes, but it also sends a message to everyone out there about how important exercise is for your body and health. There are also common misconceptions talked about in the show that mention how some characters think that by doing weight training, they\'ll end up looking massively jacked up, which is not true as pointed out. Moments like these are explained well; Machio-san does a decent job of explaining how to train your body with a mix of body weight, machines, and free weight exercises. Also some of the comments about dieting and some of the techniques explained I wouldn\'t say are always true/correct, such as ""Drinking protein within 30 minutes of your workout"" as this is a debatable topic. None the less, a really good \'Slice of Life\' show that\'s good for a laugh, and teaches some valuable lessons about trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle.Rating: 8/10 or miss.

Forty kilograms worth of hilarious.Since the pilot episode, one could easily tell that Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is playing with exaggerated campiness and over-the-top outrageousness. A bunch of high school girls\' journey in achieving the prime body strength (and ecchi-level sexiness) is bound to be both head-scratching and downright relatable. However, thanks to its mascot character Machio-san and the exemplary straight-man Tachibana-sensei, every minute of these twelve episodes is spent with such productive ways that are both indulging one\'s muscles and churning the audience\'s stomach. Nonetheless, what truly brings this anime to a weight class of its own is...when Kutaro Deire the Director is introduced. As if being the personification of the actual real world, this odd-man-out supporting character always finds himself in loop of confusion over ""how come strength training is interesting? especially for young girls and women?"" and boy, do the Silverman Girls always give him the craziest answers! (a hint: the answer contains a deadlift exercise and wrestler\'s bridge)Ultimately, Summer 2019 has been truly packed with some of the most interesting anime-- ranging from the enthralling Dr. Stone to the jaw-dropping Araburu Kisetsu. Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? may not be the Number One Anime of this season but boy, one cannot help but try twenty seconds of pushups every morning once Fall 2019 kicks off.#felixlovesanime when Kutaro Deire the Director is introduced.

So of course, you\'d expect that I have a pretty low opinion of a show titled ""How Heavy are the Dumbbells You Lift?""Well, assuming you first looked at the overall score I gave this show, I\'m sure you\'re a tad surprised. Yes, Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru (for the sake of brevity I will refer to it as ""Dumbbells"") is a good anime that I had a lot of fun watching, but how did a...show with such a dumb title keep me hooked and hoping for another season?Story 7/10Dumbbells plays out more like an extended Infomercial, utilizing the characters by having them give out tips and tricks for working out at the gym and at home. Every episode dedicates itself to a specific part of the body and different ways to workout said part. This may sound a little cheesy, but the writers execute these short workout tutorials quite well. My only gripe is that they have a tendency to overly sexualize our main characters (most of which are high school girls all around 17-ish), so for some, this may be a relatively uncomfortable watch, and understandably so.In terms of an actual plot, it\'s very simple. The main character, Hibiki Sakura, decides to start hitting the gym after her best friend points out that she\'s gained weight over their holiday. That\'s really all there is to it, as the rest of the show is dedicated to her trying (and somewhat failing due to her awful diet) to lose that weight with the rest of her friends. I\'d say that the story is certainly the weakest part of this show, but it is by no means bad.Art 8/10One of the areas Dumbbells succeeds in is changing up the backgrounds for specific purposes. The show takes full advantage of the Infomercial style setting and changes things up quite often depending on the type of advice they\'re giving and which character is actually giving said advice. The character designs are also quite good, with each character having a body type that is representative of the type of workouts they do. For example, Ayaka is more lean and muscular because of the fact that she trains as a fighter, while Hibiki is thicker, but still very strong due to her focusing on muscle training and having a not so healthy diet. Subtle details like this certainly add to the enjoyment of this show, especially people who frequent the gym.Dumbbells also likes to change up the art style every now and then, usually for comedic effect, and more often than not, it works well.Sound 7/10The first thing that caught my attention upon my first viewing was how catchy the OP and ED are. They fit the theme of the show perfectly, and I\'d be lying if I said I skipped either at any point. The soundtrack overall is very solid. Nothing particularly special, but it works. They use jingles to indicate the tutorials which are all quite catchy, and they never feel overused or annoying.Characters 9/10The characters are what put Dumbbells so high in my rating. There aren\'t any bad characters to be found in this show. With a relatively large cast, it doesn\'t feel as if any are being underutilized, nor does it feel as if certain characters are hogging too much screen time. They all have their moments, and the chemistry among them is perfect. The only character that is kind of out of place is Gina Boyd, a Russian transfer student who enters the scene in the second half of the show. She\'s not a bad character, but she is easily the most generic of the bunch (ignorant, anime-obsessed transfer student who thinks Japan is all idols and shounen). Her use is limited though, so she never gets unbearable at any point.Enjoyment 9/10Dumbbells is a blast to watch, and being someone that has worked out religiously for the past few years, I will say that it is very helpful and accurate in the advice that it gives its viewers. Honestly, by the end of most episodes, I was ready to go and workout even more. If an anime has me in the mood to hop out of bed and hit the gym after having hit the gym, it\'s likely done something right. The comedy is mostly on point, and most of the jokes had me cracking up like a child.As I stated earlier, the only real gripe I have with this show is the somewhat excessive fanservice. It\'s nowhere near as bad as most anime, but it\'s there and it prevents me from recommending this to everyone. If you\'re not big on characters being sexualized, this probably isn\'t for you.Overall 7/10I\'d recommend this to most people. If you\'re okay with a little fanservice, this is certainly worth the watch. The writing is on point, the characters are all likable, the information is solid and well incorporated, and the comedy works extremely well. I\'m hoping we get to see more of Machio-san and the gang in the future, because this was the hidden gem of this season.

What you have are school girls going to a gym, exercising, getting into contrived situations,  with how to exercise tips thrown in a few times per episode. There's a little comedy but not much. There's scratch your head moments and there's a few WTF Japan moments but not funny ones.Failures: There are no plot points, there's no character development, matter of fact I watched...the series out of order and it wasn't noticeable. What's more for an anime focused on physical fitness, the characters don't even demonstrate physical change from getting into shape.

It is not only a pleasant series, but it also provides people with fresh or unconscious insight into fitness. With little expectation, I went into this series, but I was pleasantly amazed at how much I liked it. This show has brief little extracts explaining how to do several exercises, these are provided in a fun and humorous manner, but they also describe the exercises well and are a nice place for spectators to get some fitness and weight lifting understanding.

Another girl from her same school who’s the bell of the ball AKA the best at everything and loved by all also goes to this gym semi-regularly and has a muscle fetish. Together they start working out with one another and other people they know including their teacher are also enticed to join up mostly due to the initial look of the instructor at the gym cause they all are single and ready to mingle, and that’s about it for the plot.What makes this show standout from other anime ESPECIALLY ones involving exercise is that tag i mentioned at the beginning of the above paragraph, ""Educational"". That\'s right folks this isn\'t just girls in very limited outfits ""working out"", the show actually tries to teach you through a segment that happens every episode called ""Machios Lesson of the day"" (that’s accompanied by a catchy jingle) how to do various workouts and what not to do to avoid causing yourself pain while doing them. People who have looked over this show and those who do exercise regularly have said that some of what the show says isn\'t 100% accurate because of the studies they mention are experimental but for the most part they also have said these exercise tips are mostly spot on so this is a show that can actually impact your life in a meaningful way should you want to get into excusing or need tips for your regular workout.To note during the Machio lessons of the day there is female fan service but its anime and if you see the cover of the show you should expect there to be some fan service involved and ultimately its nothing all that riske to begin with. There is also male fan service mostly in the means of Mr. Machio and his overly ridiculous muscular figure and if your into that cool, if you’re not the outro is full of muscular generic guys to give heads up.The slice of life elements of the show would be nothing without the comedy that uses art style changes, not as generic dialogue, pop culture references and appearances like Arnold Schwarzenegger and interesting personalities of the characters overall but it is highly focused on exercise and semi-fan service over those 2 elements so keep that in mind as you view (though i suspect most people who read these reviews are those who have already seen the show and are looking for alternate opinions but whatever. Also hello people who already watched this), now let\'s move on to the MAL rating categories of which i\'ve edited via this table here.I don\'t like MALs take on ratings and how it doesn\'t have .5 ratings so here my take on it.10:Masterpiece9.5:Incredible9:Awesome8.5:Great8:Very Good7.5:Good7:Alright6.5:Fine6:Ok5.5:Average5:Medicure4.5:Boring4:Bad3.5:Very Bad3:Terrible2.5:Horrible2:Appealing1.5:Painful1:TrashStory: Like i said before there\'s not much in terms of a story but it\'s also not trying to have much in terms of a story so the rating now reflects on how believable the circumstances were to get to the place the story takes priority in AKA Silverman Gym and i say it\'s believable enough but due to their body shape before and after the end of the show not changing much i wouldn\'t call it to believable but i at least can respect the last scene of the show having our main character going back on the scale and feeling accomplished by what she sees, so 6.5/10 or 6/10 for MALs rating system.Art: The art was not some basic average art style that didn\'t work well like From Common Place to Worlds Strongest was but it also wasn\'t amazingly spectacular either, but you could clearly see the art team behind it had fun playing with changing a characters art style to enhance the comedic elements when it would work well for the scene, so with that said i give art a 6.5/10 or rounded for MAL a 6/10.Sound: There was a lot of music i noticed during this show albeit not much of the true background music but sound is sound and that also encompasses the voice acting of which i watched the dub and i feel it did well there AND with its opening and little jingle each time there was a lesson of the day, thus i award this category a 7/10.Characters: There wasn\'t much to the characters i hadn\'t seen somewhere else before and some of the characters got kinda stale after a while list Mr. Machio who constantly did the same thing over and over again, HOWEVER they were given interesting personalities that made them stand out from other character i\'ve seen in other series and ESPECIALLY this season of seasonal anime so they get a 6/10.Enjoyment and Overall: There were times i must admit i felt like doing something other than watching the show while an episode was going because it got predictable after watching for half way through and i\'m not sure if this is a show i\'d be willing to rerun anytime in the near future because i myself am not into exercise and most of this show IS exercise. HOWEVER it’s not a show i would throw away and forget about either.

Up there, close to my personal fave, Asobi Asobase.Story & Chars:DNKM is a comedy show. And for a comedy show, its story is pretty good. It follows Sakura Hibiki on her journey to losing weight, while she meets fellow gym mates and does various macho activities. But since this is a Comedy, it\'s unfair to judge it on what you\'d critically judge an anime for, as it\'s main purpose is to comedically entertain, not to tell a story.The comedy hits VERY well (Although subjective). I haven\'t read the manga, but every punchline is delivered very well both in...voice acting and especially in animation. Each joke is, honestly, just very funny. The characters each have small character arcs, and more importantly, interact very well with each other. Their different personalities\' dynamics are written well and as such scenes with multiple characters have pretty realistic dialogue as well as the comedy between them lands well.One of the pillars of this show is it\'s real, informational workout tips. Although it\'s in a comedic light, every workout in the show is explained in detail and you can pick up a thing or 2 by watching it. It also covers nutrition. Everything is rooted in our world and as such, you can legitimately follow their instructions. I find this to be great.Art & Sound:A great aspect of the show is just how well executed the punchlines are. The studio did an amazing job animating & drawing those scenes. From Machio\'s godly muscle scenes (literally) to the hilarious Jojos art changes, it\'s just great.Not only that, the girl\'s """"""""""""""""scenes"""""""""""""" are nicely drawn. There are never any glaring mistakes in the animation and it sometimes looks nice and smooth.Sound is fine, not an amazing soundtrack, not a bad one. But the OP and ED? They\'re amazing. Great flow, melody, feel, bla bla bla. It\'s great.Enjoyment:This show is impossible not to enjoy. From the Comedy to the Instructional segments, to the characters, to the music. Every part of this show is great.While this show isn\'t spectacular in a way like Vinland Saga, Made in Abyss, Mob Psycho II, any critically acclaimed show, it\'s hilarious. For a comedy show, it\'s just so well done. I love this series with all my heart.I know I may not be a great reviewer. Maybe my points are just weak or whatever, but I really just think this show is great and decided to say something about it lol voice acting and especially in animation.

He is obsessed with muscles, just like akemi.

Hibiki with her amazing body yet eats all the time (Totally feel her), Akemi our cool, smart beauty that has an intense muscle fetish, Gina our Russian girl with funny concepts of Japan, Satomi the secret cosplayer teacher and Ayaka the most ripped of the pack with great ideals.Everyone is developed as much as needed to make the show enjoyable.

You get the idea.

Guilty pleasure as all hell. It\'s pretty much exactly what it looks like on the cover - an anime about cute girls going to the gym and working out. A lot of the gags were pretty solid, and I thoroughly enjoyed the tie-ins to Kengan Ashura, an anime which has quickly become one of my favorites. I would steer clear from the English dub, though, as I found it insufferable in comparison to the original - tries too hard to add cringe-worthy ""American-isms"" to the dialogue, and the narrator\'s snarky attitude is...grating. My criticisms come from the exercise demonstrations themselves, and I wish they covered things more than basic exercises (for the most part, things like the ""Dragon Flags"" were exercises I\'ve never heard of).

To me it felt as if this show was trying to go in too many directions at once but near the final...few episodes definitely straightened itself out a bit and showed why I enjoyed this show.

Things like ""the golden hour,"" have been debunked by recent studies, and the demonstrations they show to teach proper barbell form are somewhat lacking (depending on the type of training you\'re aiming for). Anyone inspired by this manga/anime to start working out should seek the help of a trained professional, ideally...from one that\'s specialized in the style of fitness you\'re after.I\'m a total sucker for slice-of-life comedies, and this checks the boxes for me. I\'ve had to reach for the pause button so many times just because of the gags, and I can\'t wait to see more of this show. from one that\'s specialized in the style of fitness you\'re after.I\'m a total sucker for slice-of-life comedies, and this checks the boxes for me.

I have a dear friend who told me once that she didn’t like anime because the majority of it perpetrated a certain type of body stereotype. I never forced my love of anime on her, because she felt personally bullied by shows telling her to be waif thin. As much as I enjoyed this show, it’s still a typical body stereotype underneath the infotainment. I feel that it could have been so much better if the studio could afford better animation/art (ie. Pay the animators better, give them more time to work, etc.) if we see real physical changes and...development in show about those things. Heck, I would’ve been happy if they gave the characters better workout clothes instead of another plain block color shirt and shorts combo.Hibiki, for example, starts off “fat.” What that means is that she is a teensy bit curvy. In episode 2 she weighed herself and griped that she gained weight omg. She weighed the equivalent of 123 lbs. Now, I understand that a typical Japanese woman is much smaller than a typical American woman. I know that from personal experience, looking at their XL sizes and largest possible shoe sizes to fit me. Oh, me? I’m 130 lbs, 5’8”, and fitter than I was as a cheerleader in high school eons ago (yup, I’m an Anime Obachan). So for Hibiki to be griping about her weight at 123 lbs seemed awful to me; like telling women this weight was unacceptable. At another point in the same episode, Hibiki is standing next to the character she decides is the “dream girl” figure. They looked EXACTLY ALIKE in body type. This is not healthy. I feel like had they spent more time on the physical designs of the characters this obsession with body types would have meant more.Rant over! There were so many great things about this anime too. The teacher with the cosplay hobby she doesn’t want her students to know about, the macho personal trainer with the adorable face, and all the information.

Au début quand je me suis dit ""Quoi? un anime sur la muscu?...Ouais à voir"" Au final, chaque semaine, j\'attendais avec impatience l\'épisode suivant, j\'ai eu des rires sincères. Les conseils de musculations sont clairs et de qualité. Je pense que n\'importe qui regardant cet anime aura envie de refaire un minimum de sport ou au moins d\'essayer un exercice présenté dans un épisode. Je suis amateur de fan service et là, ben il était comme il faut et parfois tourné à la dérision. Merci pour ce moment.

One of its most superficially obvious effects has been the deterioration of physical well-being among the urbanite. Divorced from the necessity of hard physical labor, previously an inseparable part of the human experience for millions of years, the body and mind both degenerate and decay, resulting in a vast myriad of issues on both personal as well as societal level.Weightlifting, when not taken to an unhealthy extreme, can serve as an ersatz to that physical labor most of us lack, and in turn, remedy some of the problems stemming from the...urban lifestyle. The befits strength training yields for both physical and mental well-being, especially for men, cannot be overstated.That is why I look past the overall mediocrity of ""Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?"" and appreciate it deeply for its core objective: getting nerds to lift. Even if it got a few hundred weebs to pick up a dumbbell, and 95% of them quit lifting soon after because of high time preference, there will still be a handful of people who in a few years will have a nice physique and no depression because of this one anime that aired in the summer of 2019. These people will enjoy an objectively better life than they would have had if ""Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?"" wasn\'t a thing. That\'s a solid 10 on the societal impact rating in my book.

YES MUSCLE!', 'Dumbbell is one of the best comedies I\'ve ever watched in anime with a perfect mix of teaching and laughing.Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru? is the only anime to date to actually motivate me to do the thing they were advertising, in this case exercising. I haven\'t exercised in over 4 years and when I saw the first episode to this anime I immediately went out for a jog which I now do on a weekly basis thanks to this anime. It has such a powerful way of making exercise fun and enjoyable and the anime perfectly teaches you so many ways to exercise in its...Machio lessons throughout the episodes. They even have exercises you can take part in after the episodes which I plan to go back through and do them all.The explanations on all the exercise techniques are really well presented and easy to understand. They tell you what not to do as well which avoids any confusion or misunderstandings. During one scene they talk about Saunas and the first thing I thought was ""Oh cant you lose weight there"" then the anime immediately corrected my misunderstanding. The scenes also have some nice fan service mixed in to keep you ""engaged"" if you\'re not as interested in the exercise itself.  This anime is the perfect workout video that became anime slice of life to give the package perfection.The comedy in the series is some of the best in anime. Its exactly my kind of comedy with the over the top reactions and amazingly crafted expressions which have produced so many hilarious images to be saved. The decision to make this anime a fully fledged slice of life comedy instead of just a training anime was the best one. The perfect balance between slice of life and exercise lessons is perfect. Seeing the girls talk about gym life and switching between typical anime tropes of beach episodes and turning it into training is hilarious. It really uses its setting to make normally clichés in anime unique.The characters are all lovable and there isn\'t a single character in this series that I don\'t like. Hibiki has her own funny charm of always eating even though she wants a good body which leads to some funny scenes where someone points this out to her on multiple occasions. Akemi is that muscle Otaku that gets super excited at seeing muscles which gives some amazingly hilarious reactions when she sees anything to do with training or muscles. My personal favourites Ayaka, Gina and Satomi were so lovable throughout the entire series. I couldn\'t decide who was my favourite I loved all three of them that much. Gina is absolutely hilarious with her evil grins and occasionally speaking in Russian. She really gives that vibe of a stereotypical Russian and it works so well. I cant help but grin along when Gina does her evil smile or is plotting something only for it to be ruined and give us more hilarious reactions. Satomi is such waifu material with her clumsy personality and secret Otaku/cosplay hobby which gives us her some great outfits that really look nice on her. She also acts as the straight woman most of the time to the hyper high school girls she\'s always with. Her being shy and reserved which contrasts on her Otaku hobby as like everyone else creates beautiful comedic moments when people are near or do find out about it. Gap moi as you will. Ayaka is definitely one of the highest in terms of like for me. I used to do boxing so when I saw they introduced a boxer character I was already hooked. But when I saw her I was like ""daaaaam those packs"". Ayaka has now got me into girls with muscles lol. She has that energetic personality and friendly demeanour that you cant help but like her.  Finally Machio who provides us with most the exercise tutorials is very funny with his constant flexing of his muscles and his infamous ""SIDE CHESTO!"" that I love seeing him do. Its basically the signature phrase of the series at this point. Its funny to see his misleading appearance at the beginning and quickly see as he otherwise would be.The music throughout the anime is also just as good as the rest of the series with very catchy tunes and beats for all the training lessons. The OP is something I play every time I go for a jog its so catchy and motivating to listen to while training. The visuals of the OP as well are great, showing the girls working out along with what\'s being said in the song. I will never get sick of listening to that catchy OP and always feel the need to dance along to it when played. Definitely the best OP of the season by far.The art is beautiful as you\'ll quickly see with all the character designs looking great. They also put a lot of attention to making the muscles shiny and appealing which does make sense and perfectly adds to the muscles jokes Machio makes when she rips his clothes.Honestly haven\'t enjoyed an anime this much in a while in the way it hyped me up to exercise and move my body. I HUGELY recommend this anime to anyone who wants a slice of life, a comedy, a motivator or is interested in learning about exercising. I can guarantee there\'s something here for most who like this type of genre. Even if you\'re not into exercising I\'m sure you\'ll enjoy this anime with its hilarious comedy.Overall absolutely loved Dumbbell and will definitely re-watch it in the near future as well as go through all its exercises.9/10 highly recommend. We need a season 2 of this beautiful creation.And one last comment to end the review.   SIDE CHESTO !!!!!!! Machio lessons throughout the episodes.

There's a russian girl who occasionally made me laugh cause I'm a slavaboo and the pretty boy body builder, Machio.He was a character I liked so much that I saved images of him on my phone. But then my girlfriend saw them ...Any way the exercises are fairly basic but it's still helpful to know or relearn the basics. It may even motivate you work but mostly it'll give you good laugh here and there. If they covered more exercises or eating habits that would've helped the main character...loose weight, this anime could be more useful but I doubt anyone's watching this to learn about getting into shape.If you want a good quick laugh, it's worth watching. If you want some basic knowledge on getting into shape, it can be helpful as a very bare minimum. I would've liked to see some progression in weight loss for the main character or one of the side characters cause it might of motivated some viewers to start a routine. loose weight, this anime could be more useful but I doubt anyone's watching this to learn about getting into shape.If you want a good quick laugh, it's worth watching.

This show was probably the first show that I actually kept up with every episode. Simply put, Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru was about a group of cute highschool girls trying to get into shape. With the great selection of characters I was really inspired to try everything myself and stay in shape.Although the story didn\'t seem like the most entertaining thing ever I still enjoyed it a lot. Throughout the story there were many twists and events filled with lots of funny moments. For sure the comedy of the show helped out the...story, and it never was too cliche or cringey. Throughout the story there were lots of educational info about muscles, to be honest I felt that I learned more watching this anime than from any health class that I have ever taken. The art style was never old and whenever there was a new ""Machio\'s Muscle Lesson"" there was always some nice fanservice which even gave me for motivation to pay attention to the lessons. The soundtrack was great for this anime, this was one of the shows where I actually watched the whole opening. The other sound tracks that were put on throughout the anime were also great as well.The strongest part of the anime for me was the enjoyment and the inter activeness of the show. At the end of each episode there were mini exercises that the characters did with you, along with lots of alternatives if for some reason you couldn\'t do the exercise then. The characters were a big part in the enjoyment of the show as well. Most of them were very relate-able and enjoyable to watch. Not just the main characters in the show were fun also, there were tons of side characters that had big personalities also. The art also went well with the characters and was almost soothing to my eyes because it felt so smooth.So, if you are wondering if this show is for, well if your looking for a fun and enjoyable show and you don\'t mind all the muscle this is for sure the show for you. Along with that if you do any sport it may inspire you to try harder in it and keep on improving your body, this show gave me lots of motivation to keep on trying harder in cross country, but still having a fun time doing it.

Legit, the inspiration is real. after watching the first few episodes, I was sooo hyped up to lose weight. Last few episodes focus a bit more on the characters and story, but never was it not inspirational.The whole thing is mad funny too. Not rolling around on the floor funny, but like, seriously solid. Every episode made me feel happy because of the witty humour. Later episodes got lazier and had meta humour, but those still worked as well.

Really good characters, their voices were expressive af, and were really ear-candy.This show is just surprising with how solid of a comedy it is.My favorite part OF ALL tho, is Machio.

His classic move never got tiring for me, because every time the reaction was slightly different, with a great reason and punchline every time.Bruh, you know how it be. Cute anime girls. Inspiration.

While this type of anime isn\'t necessarily for everyone,  you can still find yourself enjoying the humor and fanservice in the show.Story:Due to the fact the show has no real plot, the anime is incredibly lacking from a narrative perspective. While there is a chronological order to the series, the closest thing to plot in the series would be the introduction to new characters and their ""fitness stories"".Art:Once again, Studio Doga Kobo did an excellent job with art...direction, which perfectly encapsulates the cuteness and humor portrayed by each character. Each character\'s design is incredibly well drawn and animated (and thankfully without CG).Sound:By far one of the most appealing and memorable aspects of Dumbbell, would be the banger OP and ED.

More notably though, through the use of cutesy high school anime girls, and scenes that are practically softcore porn (in an exercise manner), it comes off as a fun and humorous approach to share...the ideas of fitness and exercise to those who just might benefit from it.

Sometimes I pick up an anime because of its history and general positive reception amongst the fanbase. And sometimes I pick up an anime for literally no other reason than ""the opening theme song slaps."" This is one where the last reason influenced my anime decisions. I\'m just going to put it up front, as emphatically as I please: the opening theme song is amazing and I hum it to myself constantly. With that little bit of silliness out of the way, here is the rest of the review.How Heavy Are the Dumbbells...you Lift (hereby shortened to Dumbbells, because I\'m not a masochist) is a show that combines light-hearted character interactions, good humor and informative segments about proper weight lifting technique. Did I mention the show\'s central theme is weight training? It\'s an odd duck. The oddness of this duck is the show\'s central appeal. You really get the impression that the writers cared about fitness and strength training, and that sort of passion becomes very infectious, even to someone like me who only has a passing acquaintance with athleticism. Additionally, Dumbbells has a light sense of humor that *should* have been annoying, but actually managed to make me laugh quite a few times. It\'s all based around catty teenagers and people making a big deal about basic weight lifting moves. Maybe it was because I was watching the dub, which had the dual advantage of good voice actors and good localization. Maybe I was just in too good of a mood because of the theme song.The characters are pretty good. *Pretty* good. They are good in the sense that their defining character quirks generally don\'t overpower their character, and are busted out for a laugh just enough times to avoid becoming stale and overdone. I think the one exception is Gina, who is a Russian actively trying to be Russian stereotypes because... comedy, I suppose. And then there were the tortured references to classic action movie stars that just started in the pit of ""not funny"" and sort of stayed there. And then there are the petty niggles, like how Hibiki went into weight training to lose weight, even though she literally has a fresh off the line generic anime lady body like every anime lady who\'s ever animed... a... lady... I don\'t know where I was going with that line.Overall, whether Dumbbells is an objectively good show or one that just won me enough good will to want to be super charitable is irrelevant. I enjoyed it. I had fun watching this show. I would watch it again just for the weight lifting tutorials. Sometimes it\'s nice to turn off the critical thinking brain and just watch a thing that\'s fun, and this show absolutely provided. you Lift (hereby shortened to Dumbbells, because I\'m not a masochist) is a show that combines light-hearted character interactions, good humor and informative segments about proper weight lifting technique.

He immediately commented on the unhealthy standards that a show like this would be perpetuating, and had a lot of fun commenting on the body fat percentages that each of the characters are presented as having. My partner mostly said that every man was his body goals, and that akemi was craaazy horny. Very funny to watch his reactions. Before I insert his review, I have some sparing thoughts. Like most anime, this show includes fan-service that includes the US definition of...a minor (under the age of 18) but seeing as I am not attracted to minors, I just ignored it. It’s easy to get used to this kind of portrayal when you watch as much anime as I watch. I am in no way condoning this however. This does change my review a bit. I’m giving the show a 7 (Good).Partner’s Review: “I unironically loved this show. Being someone who is very into exercise and going to the gym, I thought that this anime was a tremendous way to inform people who may not go to the gym, on simple and easy ways to exercise at home. Being someone who is in college for exercise science, the information that was provided in this show was predominantly correct and very helpful. I thought that the characters were silly and it was overall a funny anime that kept me engaged (which is hard to do) and overall is a very unique way to educate someone in the workout industry. I think that the only way to watch this show, in terms of the nutritional side, is from a satirical standpoint. I think that if someone were to watch it seriously (I don’t know why you would take nutritional advice from a 12 episode anime) it was very judgemental and could condone disordered eating. But, that’s only if you took it seriously. Overall, I loved the show. There was no story, but I didn’t feel it needed to be. I was confused by the ‘fanservice,’ after each of the instructional sidebars on working out. I thought that was… an interesting choice. But overall, a very good anime.

It was hilarious and so random and made me actually try out the workout after each episode lol... I will say, that\'s when you know you got your message across.I honestly expected this to be one of those anime I watch knowing it\'s trash and just enjoy it for the trash content but it\'s actually freaking entertaining as ever!

Ok while I by no means consider this show to be a ""masterpiece"" to the same degree I\'d consider FMAB to be one, it\'s still easily one of my favorite shows of all time. Why\'s that you ask? Well, I\'ll tell you why.This show initially piqued my interest as I\'m aspiring to be a personal trainer, and this is one of the only (probably THE only) show whose entire premise is based around exercising, and oh BOY does it...deliver on that front. I can still hear the ""Machio no kinniku kouzaaaaaa"" jingle in my head, and to my surprise, the tips that our turbochad teacher Machio-san gives are for the most part, accurate. Admittedly there was an excessive amount of fanservice-y camera angles throughout the show, but that\'s a just plus in my book. I completely understand if you disagree with me, but this show isn\'t listed under the ""ecchi"" category for nothing, and since the fanservice didn\'t detract from the show in the same way it would in a plot-heavy show, I didn\'t mind it at all.The story of the show is nothing to write home about--it\'s just about what you\'d expect, a group of cute girls getting in shape, with a ton of gags scattered throughout. That\'s literally all there is to it. The main character, Hibiki, is the gluttonous genki girl (who somehow already looks amazing despite her eating habits). Then you\'ve got Akemi, who at a glance, seems like the ideal girl: rich, smart, and beautiful. This is all a facade to mask her true self however, who is a muscle-obsessed horndog. And then we have Ayaka, probably my least favorite of the group, who I only know for having those glorious abs. Next we have Satomi, the onee-chan of the show who secretly is a famous cosplayer, and Gina, the foreigner of the group.I feel that Machio deserves his own section because I absolutely LOVE him. Look no further boys, Machio is the peak male, and each and every one of you should strive to be like him. Machio strikes poses whenever and wherever he pleases, and every time he does, he physically expands with the force of 1000 suns, tearing every article of clothing off of his body. Machio\'s entire personality is being gym-addicted muscle freak, and his obsession with making muscle puns and posing every five seconds makes him the most entertaining character in the show.The show\'s music is amazing, especially the opening ""Onegai Muscle"". This song has meandered its way into my prestigious spotify gym playlist, and for good reason. There\'s nothing better than hearing Hibiki and Machio singing about exercising in a super upbeat soundtrack. The animation is nothing special, but there\'s really nothing I can complain about either--it\'s perfectly fine. The girls are very cute, and I love Machio\'s design both in his tracksuit and in his muscle beast form.I really enjoyed this show overall, and would recommend it to anyone who would want to watch something with a unique premise for a change, rather than the 7th isekai of the season. I had many good laughs with my friends while watching this show, and I honestly can\'t think of many funnier shows off the top of my head besides Saiki and Grand Blue.Are you new to the gym and want to watch a show filled with useful tips on a variety of exercises? This is the show for you. Have you just watched Berserk and need something to cleanse your brain and reset your mental with happy thoughts? This is the show for you. Are you a horny bastard who either A) loves seeing well-endowed cute girls in compromising positions or B) loves seeing hunky man chads flexing constantly? This is the show for you. I think by now you\'re starting to see my point. Regardless of who you are, I\'d recommend giving this show a chance. It\'ll either be enjoyable gym fun or absolute dumpster fire to you, but I\'m inclined to believe it\'ll be the former for most people. deliver on that front.

You get the stereotypical settings and cute girls do cute things (however they accomplished that).The practical information how to exercise are ok but nothing you could get from a 30min instruction video on youtube.What does make this anime good then?The Art and Sound are really good but the character have a good chemistry which works really well to make this enjoyable.This is a solid show which does nothing special but you can watch without any worry to be totally disappointed if you...are slightly into the genre. are slightly into the genre.', ""This anime is both educational, fun and good amount of ecchi. What's not to love? OP and ED are amazing, OST is great, and the characters and their interactions with each other are hilarious. I'm sure Kengan Ashura fans will also love the references. There are plenty of workout moves which are explained very accurately and in a detailed way. Other than this, it also goes out to give some tips about nutrition and off-gym exercises. This show definitely lives up to it's premise and it was a great SOL/Sports experience. I can't find a reason to not give to less than 10. Highly recommend. "", 'Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru\xa0is an anime from last year. It\'s a Doga Kobo series based off of a Web Manga. You know, the studio behind New Game & Yuru Yuri. I have yet to review a bad anime from them. So, let\'s dive in with a little cautious optimism.Story:Sakura Hibiki is worried about her weight and her inability to attract a hunky boy. So, she decides to hit the gym. Little realising that her unattractiveness stems from being dumb as a brick and not her appearance. She tries the newly opened Silverman gym and winds up collaborating with a group of classmates on a light-hearted...journey to physical fitness.There are two fundamental flaws with this series. The first is that it spends a huge amount of time on fitness and nutrition tutorials. You know, the kind of stuff you can learn about much better and more efficiently elsewhere and don\'t need to watch an anime for. I thought Tsuritama spent too much time with its fishing tutorials but this series easily has twice the tutorials with none of the charm.That\'s the second big problem here. This series is not funny. It tries to be, but its idea of ""comedy"" is exceptionally stupid. Hibiki tries to hit on a boy, finds out he has a bodybuilder\'s physique and looks disgusting to her. The girls try to do exercises at home using chairs for support, accidentally break chairs because they weren\'t sturdy enough. Their teacher cosplays and doesn\'t want them to know. These are the kinds of jokes you can anticipate. Half the time you only know they\'re trying to be funny because they use some hideous, exaggerated face one one of the main girls.Characters:I\'ve said in the past that a comedy doesn\'t need characters who are deep or complex and I fully stand behind that statement. What a comedy does need are characters who have strong interactions and mesh well for comedic moments. The characters in this range from being bland and unfunny to just being a bit obnoxious.It\'s like Sandrovich Yabako wanted his characters to be different, noticed that other comedies tried to make characters who were funny and endearing and decided that he was going to go in the opposite direction. Jokes on him, Seth MacFarlane did that first.Art:The character designs are pretty much the standard ""cute girls doing cute things"" type. But with obnoxious amounts of fan-service and changes to ugly faces as a signal to the audience that it\'s time to laugh. Because otherwise you would never know which parts you were supposed to find funny.On the subject of the fan-service, this anime is downright sleazy with it. Most of the main characters are in their early high school years. And the fact that they frequently mix the fan-service with exercise tutorials makes it seem like Sandrovich specifically made this series to appeal to the types of guys who perv on women at the gym. With some overly muscled dudes thrown in just in case there\'s someone with a bodybuilder fetish who finds this all tolerable.Sound:The acting isn\'t bad. Not the best I\'ve heard from Amamiya Sora, Touyama Nao or several others. But it\'s basically passable performances with occasional bad direction leading to exaggerated delivery. Although, in fairness to the director Yamazaki Mitsue, exaggerated performances are often a hallmark of bad comedies. It\'s like there\'s this idea that if the actors just go full ham on their lines, they might get a pity laugh for trying so hard.The music is mostly bland. The ending theme tune is really annoying. The opening theme tune is almost decent but ten it throws in the characters shouting the names of exercises and that just sounds terrible. It kind of reminds me of the American cartoon C.O.P.S, where the theme tune had a nice beat but when you throw in all the random ""Cops"" throughout it just makes you want to hear the tune without lyrics.Ho-yay:There\'s very little. There\'s one scene where Gina seems almost interested in her female teacher. Then all the characters go back to chasing that elusive boyfriend who finds them charming and not imbecilic and annoying.Areas of Improvement:1. You don\'t need tutorials in an anime. Seriously, anyone who wants to learn about strength training and nutrition has much better sources available. All your audience is going to do is get up and get some crisps, kinder eggs or other junk food while there\'s a lull. Or fapping to the images of under-aged girls exercising because they can\'t do that at a real gym any more.2. If complex characters are beyond you, which they clearly are. At least make characters with endearing qualities who can work well for comedy.3. If you want to go all in on the fan-service, at least make your main cast grown women. Honestly, there\'d have been no real difference if the main cast had been made up of young ladies in University and their teachers. Except that the adults in the fan base wouldn\'t be under observation by law enforcement. And it would be significantly less skeevy.Final Thoughts:This comedy is pretty bad. It\'s unfunny, downright obnoxious at times, spends far too much time on boring fitness tutorials and sleazy. That being said, I have seen much worse comedies. I\'ve seen ones with much more annoying characters. I\'ve seen ones with much more wretchedly bad humour, this one is mostly just stupid. And I\'ve seen ones that are much worse with their fan-service. It\'s still bad, but I\'d hesitate to call it terrible. My rating is going to be a 3/10. As for people who might enjoy it, fitness nuts who really want to watch media that tells them how to do the exercises they\'re already doing might get a kick out of it. Guys who want to gawk at women exercising but either don\'t want to enter a gym, can\'t because they got kicked out already or just don\'t want to act pervy in public will certainly find an outlet here. I can\'t really suggest it to anyone else. journey to physical fitness.There are two fundamental flaws with this series.

At least make characters with endearing qualities who can work well for comedy.3. If you want to go all in on the fan-service, at least make your main cast grown women. Honestly, there\'d have been no real difference if the main cast had been made up of young ladies in University and their teachers. Except that the adults in the fan base wouldn\'t be under observation by law enforcement. And it would be significantly less skeevy.Final Thoughts:This comedy is pretty bad. It\'s unfunny, downright obnoxious at times, spends far too much time on boring fitness tutorials and sleazy. That being said, I have seen much worse comedies. I\'ve seen ones with much more annoying characters. I\'ve seen ones with much more wretchedly bad humour, this one is mostly just stupid. And I\'ve seen ones that are much worse with their fan-service. It\'s still bad, but I\'d hesitate to call it terrible. My rating is going to be a 3/10. As for people who might enjoy it, fitness nuts who really want to watch media that tells them how to do the exercises they\'re already doing might get a kick out of it. Guys who want to gawk at women exercising but either don\'t want to enter a gym, can\'t because they got kicked out already or just don\'t want to act pervy in public will certainly find an outlet here. I can\'t really suggest it to anyone else.']"

Reflections, as in reflecting on something, and please note that the “s” is for pluralization. I'm going to be as straightforward as that title or else this might turn into a grammar lesson. This 55 minutes long OVA goes through various characters (Edward, Scare, Roy...), each thinking back on what happened, bringing back all of those big impacting moments of the show, and let's be clear here, it's all contained in the events of the original Anime adaptation, “Fullmetal Alchemist” (not the Brotherhood remake). Sounds as generic as any recap right? But way...higher in quality than most of those. And this is why.For once, storytelling was changed massively, but still had the vanilla feel of Fullmetal Alchemist despite there being rushy jump-in-between several plot points all the way through. We got to see all of the stories again from the eyes of various conflicted characters.Animation wise, this had me drop my jaw in favor of giving appreciation for the fantastic dedication that was put into this project, the image quality was still bad, but the content had a special care to it. And to think that Fullmetal Alchemist had this kind of quality going on even in the old-school days is just mind-blowing (I've watched both adaptations, and it seems that the updated version had fooled me long enough).I've been waiting to address this, the musical scores were spectacular. Phenomenally and smoothly blend into the scenarios and with such a perfect transition that you couldn't' notice them kicking off. I was never a huge fan of the subbed of Fullmetal Alchemist, but this can be either a hit or miss for some people. Switching focus on different characters and their perspectives was truly genius, it made me relive the days when I used to theorize my crazy speculations on the show. The lore was very overwhelming and crazily draws you in to even go as far as rewatching the Anime adaptation all over again. I would most differently recommend this for the fans that want to have a quick refreshing recap, it's both informative and fun to watch. I wouldn't recommend watching this over the Anime adaptation as it still skips through so much stuff, and only serves as a nostalgic reminder for the fans of the series. higher in quality than most of those.

Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37347/Dungeon_ni_Deai_wo_Motomeru_no_wa_Machigatteiru_Darou_ka_II,"['I’ll be honest here; I sort of enjoyed the first season of DanMachi. It wasn’t great in terms of storytelling or characters, yet it managed to keep me entertained for the length of its run. And I was genuinely expecting season 2 to deliver a similar sort of experience; not overly original but fun to watch. However, what we got with Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II (Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a Dungeon? II) is just tons of the former and not a hint of the latter. This season is an assortment of overused...anime tropes with dreadfully poor execution.  And seriously Japanese LN authors, learn to be a bit better at naming your shit. Please.So, in which aspects does DanMachi season 2 fail? Honestly, it sensationally fails in pretty much every aspect that made season 1 a fairly enjoyable watch. The story arcs are all repeated from other anime which has the concepts of adventurers and whatnot and the conflicts feel extremely lackluster. It’s easy to predict how these arcs would conclude. There’s no sense of danger in them and the comedy is totally out of place. The characters’ decisions and actions are mindless and unrelatable. So much so that even a 10-year old’s judgement would be more sensible. The culmination of all of this simply leads to a dull and unenjoyable experience.The story continues where it left off in season 1 with Bell Cranel and his goddess Hestia wanting to make the Hestia Familia the best in Orario. In this quest, they recruit adventurers for their Familia, saving some of their old and new friends along the way. There’s not much else to the plot of this season. When the entire story can be summed up in two sentences, it’s not difficult to imagine that it’s lacking.This season tried to be entertaining by the use of excessive fanservice but falls flat on its face in the execution. They’re so cringy and out of place that even most people who enjoy fanservice would be annoyed by them. Oh, and there’s tons of scenes in this season in which Bell is pseudo-raped. Some people might even count these scenes as part of the fanservice, but it’s pretty repulsive to watch someone being licked off by a hideous monster of a rapist (yes, that fat girl is a rapist in my eyes) which contributes absolutely nothing to the story at all.Conflicts start for the most stupid of reasons like one of the underlings of some other Familia taking a dislike to Bell because of his attitude or another Familia leader wanting Bell as her own. These lead to War games, episodes of hide and seek and monotonous battles which themselves are predictable and dull. There were opportunities to develop these arcs into something that had real meaning and impact on the story at large, but instead, barely anything drastic changes after these battles.The first 3 or so episodes were kinda okay even though they were packed with the issues I’ve already mentioned. I’d hoped that the development we’d had in these opening episodes would add up to something meaningful in the following episodes, but not only did DanMachi S2 fail to do that, it just kept falling in terms of quality each episode. I barely managed to keep up until episode 8 but I’d had enough by that point and finished this simply for the sake of completion.The characters that were entertaining in the first season are intolerable in the second. Every episode made me cringe. Bell, who was kinda fun to watch, is reduced to a generic MC; kind, soft-spoken and one who’ll go to any lengths to protect his friends. He stumbles upon characters with a dark past and resolves himself to save them at any cost. Not that he was much different in season 1, but I’d hoped that the things he’d gone through would culminate to some sort of character development for him. Unfortunately, though, I soon realized that I’d hiked my expectations too much and all I’d get from Bell in the entire season was just constant “Fire Bolt!”.Hestia, who was just about bearable last season, is a bundle of exasperation in this one. I’ve come to hate almost everything about her character; from her goofiness to her fixation on Bell. I’m sorry but waggling your boobs around and then pushing them in the face of the protagonist doesn’t make a character funny.The story delves a little in Liliruca’s past, however, all of it is rushed and it seems that the only reason her past was even brought up was just for the sake of it. There’s no real revelation, just bits of it which are vaguely explained. I wonder if there is actually more to her past or if this was all. As for Welf, the reason for his existence in this entire series is because the author doesn’t want to make it seem like Bell is gathering a harem. He’ll say the odd motivating thing and assist the others in battle, but his presence doesn’t have any significance. The other characters are also meh, and I’ve got nothing much to say about them at all. Because there isn’t much to them in the first place.I’ve really gotten tired of criticizing JC staff recently, but they keep producing crap these days. I don’t even know if it’s their fault or the fault of the source they’re adapting. Most of the anime they’ve brought out in the past 2-3 years have been failures, and on the surface, it certainly seems that they’re the ones at fault. I don’t know how the monetary side of things have been for these series, but certainly quality wise, they’ve produced some absolute shitshows in this time. Whether it be because of abysmal art and animation, substandard management, lack of resources, bite off more than they can chew, or a consequence of all of these combined, it has been a staggering fall for JC staff as a whole. DanMachi Season 2 falls into the same trap. Choppy animation especially in the battles, and repeated panels are aplenty. The overall animation quality is okay at best. I found myself enjoying the opening though, which was probably the only good thing to come out of this series. The soundtrack in general was unoriginal but partly decent.A shit ton of bouncing boobs, unwanted intimate situations to fill the episodes with fanservice as well as to show us how Bell is embarrassed every time he ends up in them and boring ass characters lead DanMachi into a shit hole which is, frankly, unrecoverable from. At least, for me. I’d honestly looked forward to watching this season but I doubt I’d get myself into the next season of DanMachi.

I was looking forward to this anime for so long, but when it came it was such a let down. [Spoilers]The War Games was bad:• Apollo was like a generic rapist straight out of SAO• Apollo family chasing Hestia’s family throughout the city in broad daylight. The problem with this is it shows is there’s no government officials to prevent something like this happening between other families. It makes Orario being a peaceful city and not a warzone make no sense.• The War Games was too short. We had 3 episodes of build up only for the event...to end in one episode.• Hestia’s family beating Apollo’s was too easy. It was unbelievable that 5 people would be able to breeze through 200 without any serious injuries. Bell’s power boost was so poorly written that I questioned if this was fanfic. He went from getting his ass kicked by a lvl 3, going off to train for a few days and winning the rematch. Why? Because Ainz showed him how to dodge 1 or 2 hits. The problem i have with this is they don’t SHOW us Bell’s training, we’re only given a few lazy panels and are meant to be okay with this.I liked the darker tone in the Prostitute arc, too bad it was mainly prostitutes chasing Bell to take his virginity and adding 1 girl more to the harem. We got some backstory on Samurai girl which made me care a bit about her. Fox girl was pretty much a damsel in distress. I hated the reveal in the end that she didn’t actually sleep with anyone considering what made her interesting was that she did ‘taint her body’ and didn’t feel she deserved being saved by a hero. She may not know, but it completely undermines her development for the viewer.I don’t know what to call the next arc because it was pretty much a mess. Pacing was eradic e.g. ep. 11 we left of with Bell and Hestia falling from a cliff, the next we’re at a village and everyone’s fine. The only good thing about it was the focus on Bell’s love for his kami sama. However, I wish Bell addressed Hestia’s feelings like he was told so she could move on but instead he does the opposite and said he loved her... That’s going completely against what the story has been built around which is Bell’s love for Ains. Speaking of Ains, I don’t know what role she played this arc besides being a third wheel robot in a love triangle. The glimpse of her showing some emotions over the Black Dragon scales was the first time i think I’ve been interested to seeing where her character goes. I don’t see the point of Ares considering he just disappeared from the story.Bell’s development was awful this season. It’s like the same ‘pushover coward to confident hero’ character arc he went through last season, which is why he hasn’t really changed. I don’t like his ridiculous power boosts e.g. other characters take years to level up once, Bell went up from lvl 2 to lvl 4 in like 1 month...There was a few decent-good fights/animation e.g. Bell Vs Prostitute onee-san, but the fights and pacing wasn’t consistent enough.Overall, Danmachi S2 wasn’t good as the first season. to end in one episode.• Hestia’s family beating Apollo’s was too easy.

While the franchise hasn’t been a stellar masterpiece, it certainly has caught enough attention to secure a sequel. Even if it took nearly 5 years, this show obviously has a fan base, one that made this franchise popular for what it is today. That being said, I can’t declare this season as any better than the first season and as a matter of fact, it took several steps backwards. It doesn’t mean this season is unwatchable but certainly not enough to be considered great.For starters, you should do...yourself a favor and watch the recap episode 0 unless you’ve recently finished the first season. Season 2 isn’t here to spoonfeed you and assumes the viewer is familiar with this franchise. Watching the first few episodes made me realize that the anime itself retains the familiar setting, charisma, and personalities of the previous season. Hanging on to the premise, DanMachi hasn’t been really about picking up girls from dungeons. Rather, it’s more of an anime to explore character relationships in this fantasy world of uncertainty. As some ideas may seem absurd, I do have to applaud the creator in making DanMachi into more than mindless popcorn entertainment. There’s plenty of characters to fill the story and while the previous season had already established its principal cast, we are also introduced to new ones this season.With the way this sequel started, it elicit some levels of entertainment from its first episode. We are reintroduced to Bell who continues to improve himself as an adventurer. Now being part of a guild and having a formidable party, Bell also catches the eyes of adversaries. This begins from a party that he and Hestia attends where he gets challenged to a war game. It doesn’t take long for Bell to accept because it’s a chance to prove himself. In that one moment, Bell shows his change from the previous season. If you remember from season 1’s first episode, he was weak and couldn’t defend himself. If it wasn’t for Ais Wallenstein, he’d be a dead man. Now, we have a young man wanting to prove to the whole world that he is capable adventurer. If he and his party wins this war game, it would definitely earn himself the respect he’s been fighting hard for. That being said, the war game arc itself is relatively short and unfortunately, both the buildup and execution is rushed. There’s a lack of emotional impact felt by both the fighting itself and endgame. Plus, I do believe the plot execution lacked excitement and in general, very predictable. On the other hand, I am somewhat glad the anime was generous enough to feature characters besides just Bell. These include characters from the first season such as Liliruca, Ryuu, and Yamato Mikoto. While the sequel doesn’t commit time to develop them, I’m certainly glad they weren’t left in the dust. Of course, Bell earns his spot for being able to keep his promise. While I’ve never been a big fan of his character, it’s certainly a better outcome than seeing an obnoxious individual such as Apollo taking the glory.It’s easy to understand why DanMachi Season 2 decided to dedicate its time to focus on volume 6 for the first half. It wanted to establish Bell’s guild as a respectful organization and that its adventurers are no pushovers. By doing so, we can trust the characters this season won’t be weak. Even Bell, who was initially portrayed as an underdog, is now a capable adventurer who others have taken notice. From here, we get the second half of the anime that dedicates its time on exploring new elements of its fictional world. While the Danmachi universe has its world fiction contents, it never seemed to step outside of the box to be something unique. It continuously borrows fantasy elements and even isekai ideas with the RPG-like world. The dungeons, town, and landscapes is what you would expect out of any fantasy adventure. From the second half, we are introduced to a distinctive district that takes the show to a more mature side. This would be known as the “City of Night”, a place of adult entertainment. The plot also builds tension to its overall suspense and even elicits a feeling of conspiracy. While this anime is usually filled with lighthearted jokes, the second half of the show adapts more of an emotional angle. While this seems like an exciting tone at first, it quickly wears out as the main girl involved is a timid prostitute. You heard that right. It seems the anime also applies its usually quirky humor by inserting virgin jokes. On the plus side, it did give a chance for Mikoto to shine. She stands out as the breakout character this season from Hestia Familia. Although she isn't able to carry the season, I do find Mikoto’s character to be much more appealing than Hestia herself. I mean, how many times are we going to have that Loli Big-Boobs shoved down our throat?I won’t spoil the plot so you’ll have to see how they planned out volume 7’s adaptation. From an anime perspective, let’s just say it contains more emotional impact than the first half. Yet, it isn’t going to be a tearjerker. That’s probably an unfair statement to say. DanMachi has never been really much of a series about emotional drama. It unites a variety of gimmick together with its character relationships that tries to each be unique on its own. From the previous season, we had Bell develop bonds with Hestia, Ais, and Liliuca. From this season, he builds a bond with Haruhime and members of the Hestia Familia. The latter is a step backwards as I didn’t feel compelled enough to get attached to these relationships. This isn’t really Bell’s fault as a character but overall with the plot direction. Haruhime and Bell’s character bond is nonetheless important for this arc but doesn’t capitalize on showing emotional effect. And in a world of creative writing, that’s not a great sign.J.C. Staff returns with its talent and I have to wonder how far they planned ahead. Likewise, I don’t think there’s any problem with the overall animation quality. Character designs returns in their original forms with a familiar style of combat cinematography similar to previous season. The extended world setting of City of Night adds more adult fan service. Trust me, you’ll understand what I mean once you reach the second half of the show. On most parts, this anime didn’t suffer from production issues. There were no episodes that had drops in quality. In terms of technical merits, you do have to give some credit where it’s due.This wasn’t really a season about picking up girls from dungeons. Instead, it’s an extended story on what the previous season had established with its character and ideas. Unfortunately, watching DanMachi Season 2 was a mediocre experience that truly didn’t make a big impact on my enjoyment. It’s feels like playing a video game with a long expansion DLC pack added to the main questline. With the franchise confirmed getting another season in 2020, this is going to be a big season pass. yourself a favor and watch the recap episode 0 unless you’ve recently finished the first season. Season 2 isn’t here to spoonfeed you and assumes the viewer is familiar with this franchise. Watching the first few episodes made me realize that the anime itself retains the familiar setting, charisma, and personalities of the previous season. Hanging on to the premise, DanMachi hasn’t been really about picking up girls from dungeons. Rather, it’s more of an anime to explore character relationships in this fantasy world of uncertainty. As some ideas may seem absurd, I do have to applaud the creator in making DanMachi into more than mindless popcorn entertainment. There’s plenty of characters to fill the story and while the previous season had already established its principal cast, we are also introduced to new ones this season.With the way this sequel started, it elicit some levels of entertainment from its first episode. We are reintroduced to Bell who continues to improve himself as an adventurer. Now being part of a guild and having a formidable party, Bell also catches the eyes of adversaries. This begins from a party that he and Hestia attends where he gets challenged to a war game. It doesn’t take long for Bell to accept because it’s a chance to prove himself. In that one moment, Bell shows his change from the previous season. If you remember from season 1’s first episode, he was weak and couldn’t defend himself. If it wasn’t for Ais Wallenstein, he’d be a dead man. Now, we have a young man wanting to prove to the whole world that he is capable adventurer. If he and his party wins this war game, it would definitely earn himself the respect he’s been fighting hard for. That being said, the war game arc itself is relatively short and unfortunately, both the buildup and execution is rushed. There’s a lack of emotional impact felt by both the fighting itself and endgame. Plus, I do believe the plot execution lacked excitement and in general, very predictable. On the other hand, I am somewhat glad the anime was generous enough to feature characters besides just Bell. These include characters from the first season such as Liliruca, Ryuu, and Yamato Mikoto. While the sequel doesn’t commit time to develop them, I’m certainly glad they weren’t left in the dust. Of course, Bell earns his spot for being able to keep his promise. While I’ve never been a big fan of his character, it’s certainly a better outcome than seeing an obnoxious individual such as Apollo taking the glory.It’s easy to understand why DanMachi Season 2 decided to dedicate its time to focus on volume 6 for the first half. It wanted to establish Bell’s guild as a respectful organization and that its adventurers are no pushovers. By doing so, we can trust the characters this season won’t be weak. Even Bell, who was initially portrayed as an underdog, is now a capable adventurer who others have taken notice. From here, we get the second half of the anime that dedicates its time on exploring new elements of its fictional world. While the Danmachi universe has its world fiction contents, it never seemed to step outside of the box to be something unique. It continuously borrows fantasy elements and even isekai ideas with the RPG-like world. The dungeons, town, and landscapes is what you would expect out of any fantasy adventure. From the second half, we are introduced to a distinctive district that takes the show to a more mature side. This would be known as the “City of Night”, a place of adult entertainment. The plot also builds tension to its overall suspense and even elicits a feeling of conspiracy. While this anime is usually filled with lighthearted jokes, the second half of the show adapts more of an emotional angle. While this seems like an exciting tone at first, it quickly wears out as the main girl involved is a timid prostitute. You heard that right. It seems the anime also applies its usually quirky humor by inserting virgin jokes. On the plus side, it did give a chance for Mikoto to shine. She stands out as the breakout character this season from Hestia Familia. Although she isn't able to carry the season, I do find Mikoto’s character to be much more appealing than Hestia herself. I mean, how many times are we going to have that Loli Big-Boobs shoved down our throat?I won’t spoil the plot so you’ll have to see how they planned out volume 7’s adaptation. From an anime perspective, let’s just say it contains more emotional impact than the first half. Yet, it isn’t going to be a tearjerker. That’s probably an unfair statement to say. DanMachi has never been really much of a series about emotional drama. It unites a variety of gimmick together with its character relationships that tries to each be unique on its own. From the previous season, we had Bell develop bonds with Hestia, Ais, and Liliuca. From this season, he builds a bond with Haruhime and members of the Hestia Familia. The latter is a step backwards as I didn’t feel compelled enough to get attached to these relationships. This isn’t really Bell’s fault as a character but overall with the plot direction. Haruhime and Bell’s character bond is nonetheless important for this arc but doesn’t capitalize on showing emotional effect. And in a world of creative writing, that’s not a great sign.J.C. Staff returns with its talent and I have to wonder how far they planned ahead. Likewise, I don’t think there’s any problem with the overall animation quality. Character designs returns in their original forms with a familiar style of combat cinematography similar to previous season. The extended world setting of City of Night adds more adult fan service. Trust me, you’ll understand what I mean once you reach the second half of the show. On most parts, this anime didn’t suffer from production issues. There were no episodes that had drops in quality. In terms of technical merits, you do have to give some credit where it’s due.This wasn’t really a season about picking up girls from dungeons.

With the franchise confirmed getting another season in 2020, this is going to be a big season pass."", 'Less Dungeoneering, more Familia Wars...Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II was pretty much what LA expected of a sequel from Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka. World building and character development be it new or old and even if the plot structure of this season are essentially 2 and a half arcs mainly focused on selfish gods and goddesses with similar plot beats with them but the best strengths between both of these arcs are the solid character developments from new and old characters and growing the world building more because of it.Well to start off...with the Apollo Familia and Apollo himself, sure the entire war between Hestia and Apollo started off what is quite literally a waifu war only intensified into all out war, dragging Liliruca with her current familia Soma (which was slightly delved at in the first season) and Apollo wanting Bell as he\'s already become a name in Orario. Apollo\'s arc dragged in Liliruca in which she got ALOT of screentime in this arc and we more or less get character development and resolution from Soma, this being said as the Soma familia technically kicked her out but due to a Soma advisor having more control over the familia itself and the god Soma caring more about making more alcohol, the Soma advisor goes crazy with power and siding with Apollo to gain that power from him and get their way as a result. Liliruca either way from this Familia War gains ALOT of character development and ties loose plotlines from the first season. From this however, Yamato Mikoto viced by Chinatsu Akasaki that had a bit of screentime in the first season got a bit more focus as she wanted her debt repaid thus helps Hestia familia from this and at the end of the Apollo and Hestia Familia War, makes a great decision that only makes her better in te next arc...The Ishtar arc, which focuses on Sanjuno Haruhime voiced by Haruka Chigusa and Bell stumbling upon her, the thing is Haruhieme is a prostutite in the Red Light District helmed by the Ishtar Familia, striving off black market and the more sleazy end of businesses,  Haruhime either way helps Bell getting out of the Red Light Distrct but Ishtar has other plans for Bell and latter on once the Hestia Familia and Bell finds out...they need to save her. Haruhime as a character is interesting as she like Bell loves hero stories but since she was tricked into becoming a prostitute she just let it happen, BUT she doesn\'t want any help from heroes as since she\'s a prostitute, she\'s the symbol of destruction for a hero thus doesn\'t want the help, so Bell being the ""always wanting t protect everyone"" not only wants to save Haruhime from Ishtar\'s plans but to shatter Haruhime\'s beliefs of a prostitute and hero dynamic. So how does Mikoto come into all this, well her familia the Takemakeuchi Familia were childhood friends with Haruhime when she was a princess so Mikoto wanting to find her as well as like Bell get her out of there, she in turn gains ALOT of screentime even in this arc and heck Mikoto came a LONG way from the nuisance minor character with little to no screentime to the point she became LA\'s favourite character in this second season (Ryu Lion is still LA\'s favorite character of the series overall). With all this being said, why does Ishtar want Haruhime let alone her plan?, well one that\'s spoilers so LA won\'t talk much about that, but Ishtar\'s plan, well has to do with Bell AND Freya, YEAH she\'s invovled and much like Apollo is vain and selfish using her familia as tools than...you know adventurers and human and Apollo may have been just plain crazy narcissistic, but Ishtar was a plain awfully detestable goddesses, even to the point of her reasoning of her plans and her fate was more than enough (let alone Bell wasn\'t really involved in that...*cough* Freya *cough*).But do you see something with Apollo and Ishtar compared to Hestia\'s familia?. Well for one thing Apollo and Ishtar\'s familia are powerful and rich as hell, compared to Hestia onnly hvaing Bell at the start and poor, but going further, Apollo and Ishtar doesn\'t really care about their members and again using them as tools more than anything else, hell because both Apollo and Ishatr one way or another eyes Bell, makes their members jealous of Bell instead. Wherein Hestia LOVES Bell and deeply cares for him in the worst cases and when Hestia\'s familia grows even though Hestia is a bit iffy with any advances with other girls with Bell, but aside from that, Hestia cares for her members of the familia, Apollo and Ishtar drunk on power and vain...do not care about their members and like the new best face or even more power than anything else....Ares ehhhh he\'s a comedic footnote if anything...The animation done once again by JC Staff are on form again with slicker, more polished and great battle scenes in the anime and with how intense it gets with Familia Wars and the such the strategy and choregraphy used in the anime was out in out fluid and great for the most part. The aesthetic of this season was the same as the first season but with a crisper tone to it as well. Not much to really say besides that JC Staff updated the animation to be more polished and consistent animation all round this season.The voice cast was great and thanks to the expanded cast added in some great voice actors from Haruka Chigusa as Haruhime, Akeno Watanabe as Aisha, Takako Honda who voiced Ishtar and Ryouta Osaka as Apollo. from the main cast, Yoshitsugu Matsukoa did great as Bell, Maaya Uchida as Liliruca and the big underdog Mikoto Yamato voiced by Chinatsu Akasaki did great as well. due to the majority of the anime focused on the other more poweful gods, Hestia\'s screentime was lessen dramatically this season thus Inori Minase but nonetheless she did her usual comedic scthick this season for the most part. ALl in all the voice cast was great all round.The only flaws LA saw was that once Haruhime\'s and Ishtar\'s arc finished, Haruhime became like the rest of the harem vying for Bell\'s attention and her backstory though full developed..had nowhere else to go which was a shame as she was a great and fully developed and realized character and she became wasted potential (but that\'s not to knock the events of Ishtar\'s arc it\'s just something LA noticed), the other would be that yes because Bell is the expected hero of this story, he essentially wins the entire time but not without hard work and training but he wins all the time, yes there is that but at least this season, he wasn\'t the only one set on stage as other characters had their time to shine, from Liliruca from Apollo\'s arc to Mikoto from both Apollo and Ishtar\'s arc and let\'s not forget Haruhime.Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka II was a HUGE step up from the first season and the bland-retelling side story of Sword Oratoria, sure the dungeoneering was slimmed down in favour of world building of Orario and character development from the old and new characters of the cast BUT...yeah isn\'t that actually a good thing due to this second season focusing on Orario and it\'s familia\'s and thus giving us much more in-depth world building with the various familia\'s and them having their eye on Bell and in turn drags major and minor characters into all this and drastically changes ALOT be it plot-wise or character-wise. LA VERY much enjoyed this second season for this, let alone giving LA some great characters like Mikoto Yamato, Haruhime and heck even Liliruca gets heavily redeemed in this second season. With the Apollo and Ishtar familia\'s craziness dust settling...what DOES Freya want with Bell, either way this second season was great and is an absolute must for those fans who liked the first season, was a palette cleanser from the disappointment of  Sword Oratoria and then some for the Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka world..and since it was announced there will be a third season, LA wouldn\'t mind them trying to blend both the dungeoneering aspect of the firsts season and the Familia Wars of this season together making this world building fleshed out even more and let\'s not forget the major plot twist with Bell and what this has to do with Freya.Hestia may be Bestia but she\'s getting competition...from Haruhime and Freya... with the Apollo Familia and Apollo himself, sure the entire war between Hestia and Apollo started off what is quite literally a waifu war only intensified into all out war, dragging Liliruca with her current familia Soma (which was slightly delved at in the first season) and Apollo wanting Bell as he\'s already become a name in Orario.

Danmachi sits at an interesting crossroads for a lot of people, it seems. On the one hand, it’s mired in so many narrative inconsistencies that the veritable onslaught of criticisms lobbed its way effectively chip at its armor. But on the other, it is...often lauded as a treasure trove for guilty pleasure enthusiasts. However, I can’t say my loyalties exactly align with either camp to a T. It’s difficult to frame a review around this series in particular, because it’s the source of an ongoing headache of conflicting feelings for me.My biggest problem with Danmachi is the identity crisis presented by its content. Is this a stupid show that’s well aware of its faults yet wants to be taken seriously? Or is this a flawed show that wants to be viewed as dumb fun? I can’t parse with that level of minutiae. It’s infuriating. And if these first 4 episodes are any indication of what’s to come, Danmachi has mostly stayed consistent in its ability to somehow comfortably inhabit this middle ground. This is the same old Danmachi, and if that’s exactly what you want, more power to you.This season is not looking to impress an audience that wasn’t there to begin with, this is quite literally the same old Danmachi. However, in its insistence to give the audience what they want (which is more of the same), the conflict feels safe at best and the pacing of its plot progression has screeched to an ironic halt. The pacing of these first 4 episodes is break-neck, however, because the overarching plot is so stagnated, it feels like watching an elongated B-story in place of receiving any form of significant plot or character progression. The set-up for the conflict between Hestia and Apollo’s factions could have made for an intriguing story arc, but that potential is disappointingly squandered by the second episode.The first red flag came in the form of a D-tier clairvoyant character essentially spelling out how this arc is going to end with about as much subtlety as a hammer to the face. Even if I tempered my expectations of the heroes proudly bearing their victory scars, it doesn’t exactly mitigate the fact that even the bystander characters have become self-aware to the predictability of the conflict unfolding before them. I can budge on the predictability of Danmachi being a non-criticism, with these kinds of shows, you get what you pay for. Therein lies the issue, despite it almost being self-aware in its predictability, heavy use of tropes, and unnecessary fan-service, Danmachi tries way too hard to play it with a straight face.I’d like to coin this phenomenon “Fairy Tail syndrome”, wherein which a show with needlessly campy assets attempts to inject seriousness into its narrative, making for a final product that feels tonally dissonant. There’s a particularly egregious moment in the second episode between Bell and Hestia in a sewer. I’ll keep it vague for the sake of people interested in this second season, to provide some context, before this scene occurs, there is a relatively “tense” action sequence, but to cut at the tension, there is an amorous comedic bit between Bell and Hestia that thoroughly undercuts the tension. Not only that, but there is a serious lack of needed tension in the forced romantic relationship between the two that any interaction between them feels like an utter waste of screentime. Any time this show tries to get serious about the romantic interaction between any of the love interests and Bell, it comes off as tasteless harem antics with indulgent and predictable fan-service situations. And it’s never funny.I enjoy this series to an extent, and I can come to terms with its mass appeal. I have a soft spot for shows about underdog dorks slowly inching their way to momentary success, even if it requires some suspension of disbelief when those small victories feel heavily contrived. Even if it is a predictable formula to pace into, it’s hard to not raise an eyebrow when characters manage to best annoyingly pompous antagonists. Hestia is indeed “Bestia”, or at least her extremely iconic design and charming personality facilitates enough anime-tiddy Twitter-feed fodder to convince me otherwise. Her rapport with Bell almost occasionally convinces me that I’m not watching a show about a woman who’s fallen madly in love with a dungeon diving slice of Wonder Bread slathered in Miracle Whip.Speaking of characters, Danmachi has a pretty colorful cast of them. I can’t speak much for Bell Cranel, as protagonists go he’s pushed so far into the corner of typical harem anime protagonists that he just sort of bleeds into the mix with the rest of them. There’s nothing engaging about his backstory to latch onto and his disingenuous underdog act produces many an eye-roll worthy moment when he “miraculously” comes out on top. Hestia is the mascot, rightfully so because she’s just that charming of a character. Inori Minase is THE cute anime girl voice and provides a needed dose of energy in the sluggish pace of this show’s story. Some people find her annoying but her character reminds me that this show’s concept could’ve worked had they played to the comedic aspect a little more. Think Urusei Yatsura except with a Dungeons and Dragons type setting. Her design also bothers some people for the excessive sexualizing of her character but fan-service has never bothered me TOO much especially if it’s in a show that’s fully committed to exploiting it to a satirical degree. However, Danmachi doesn’t seem fully committed to that tone so whenever there are egregious body/POV shots of her character model, it can take away from the seriousness of the tone of a scene or distract from the dialogue.Besides the main protagonists, the secondary and tertiary characters have distinct enough personalities and designs to at least stick with you on a shallow level, so it doesn’t just feel like they’re there to populate the world. However, the story never lingers on any one character long enough for them to feel fully realized. Lily’s backstory is further explored in this season and it should be noted that she’s probably the only character in the previous season (besides Bell) that got significant attention. However, after her storyline felt mostly tied up in the previous season, it didn’t seem to me like there was much else to do with her character, so when the story eventually did shift its attention to her it just felt like extraneous BS.With tonal dissonance, shallow characters, forced comedy, predictability, and a stagnated plot taking the forefront can Danmachi Season 2 at least bring up the rear on a technical level in its first 4 episodes? Despite pretty standard direction, Danmachi is at least consistent in its animation. There are no set-pieces that stand out to me as far as key animation, and even the change in director didn’t exactly do so much as to change the shot composition slightly, but on average the show is passable enough to distract from its pretty inert direction. I also think Danmachi sports some pretty good character designs despite the overall look of the characters being relatively simple.Danmachi can’t seem to compromise with its tone. It’s still not quite at the point of no return however as it continues to march to the beat of its own drum, it seems perfectly content in staying in its lane. There are aspects of this show that I like and at some point, I’m sure it will be able to actually rise to the challenge of weaving together a subversive or effectual story arc, but as of this first handful of episodes, that still might be far off on the horizon. There’s a part of my subconscious that just wants to press its finger against my lips and silently whisper, “shut up, don’t think about it too much”, but that’s asking too much. often lauded as a treasure trove for guilty pleasure enthusiasts.

Her design also bothers some people for the excessive sexualizing of her character but fan-service has never bothered me TOO much especially if it’s in a show that’s fully committed to exploiting it to a satirical degree. However, Danmachi doesn’t seem fully committed to that tone so whenever there are egregious body/POV shots of her character model, it can take away from the seriousness of the tone of a scene or distract from the dialogue.Besides the main protagonists, the secondary and tertiary characters have distinct enough personalities and designs to at least stick with you on a shallow level, so it doesn’t just feel like they’re there to populate the world. However, the story never lingers on any one character long enough for them to feel fully realized. Lily’s backstory is further explored in this season and it should be noted that she’s probably the only character in the previous season (besides Bell) that got significant attention. However, after her storyline felt mostly tied up in the previous season, it didn’t seem to me like there was much else to do with her character, so when the story eventually did shift its attention to her it just felt like extraneous BS.With tonal dissonance, shallow characters, forced comedy, predictability, and a stagnated plot taking the forefront can Danmachi Season 2 at least bring up the rear on a technical level in its first 4 episodes? Despite pretty standard direction, Danmachi is at least consistent in its animation. There are no set-pieces that stand out to me as far as key animation, and even the change in director didn’t exactly do so much as to change the shot composition slightly, but on average the show is passable enough to distract from its pretty inert direction. I also think Danmachi sports some pretty good character designs despite the overall look of the characters being relatively simple.Danmachi can’t seem to compromise with its tone. It’s still not quite at the point of no return however as it continues to march to the beat of its own drum, it seems perfectly content in staying in its lane. There are aspects of this show that I like and at some point, I’m sure it will be able to actually rise to the challenge of weaving together a subversive or effectual story arc, but as of this first handful of episodes, that still might be far off on the horizon. There’s a part of my subconscious that just wants to press its finger against my lips and silently whisper, “shut up, don’t think about it too much”, but that’s asking too much.', '2015 was certainly an interesting year. The SCOTUS legalized gay marriage, Subway\'s Jared got exposed for being a pedophile, and DanMachi was about dungeons. Now, in 2019, DanMachi is not about dungeons. DanMachi is now about fanservice and whatever happened in the first four episodes.The first arc of this season is unbelievably bad. The main antagonist of the arc decides that he wants Bell for himself and challenges our protagonists to a War Game. Ignoring the comically stupid motivations of the main antagonist, this almost sounds cool, doesn\'t it? Except there are three episodes of setup and one episode of War Game. Fantastic!In reality, however,...the terrible pacing is a blessing in disguise, as episode four is far worse than the first three episodes. In the War Game, Hestia\'s familia has 5 combatants, while Apollo has like 100+. But hey, who cares! Everyone in Hestia\'s familia can take on dozens of Apollo\'s fighters singlehandedly. This might make sense for Ryu, who is a much higher level adventurer than everyone else. What doesn\'t make sense is Welf and Mikoto being able to beat dozens of adventurers of the same level as them with literally one attack. ""Oh, but Mikoto has an OP spell! Oh, but Welf has an OP magic sword!"" One of the worst things a show can do is contradict its own world-building. Why were we told so much about adventurer levels only for them to get defenestrated in this episode?That\'s not even the worst part of what is certainly one of the worst anime episodes ever created. The worst part comes in when Bell fights Apollo\'s commander. That guy beat Bell to a pulp with his bare hands a couple of episodes ago, but now, Bell can beat him easily. Why? He trained pretty much offscreen for a couple of episodes! That makes him comically OP! So comically OP, in fact, that he literally beat the guy with a kick and a punch. This juvenile writing should be insulting to any fan of the first season.After those four atrocious episodes, we get two fanservice eps in a row. Unlike the creators of KonoSuba, however, the people responsible expect you to take this season seriously. Episode 5 is slice of life with a bath scene. Episode 6 is Bell hanging out with a bunch of prostitutes. Fun! I don\'t have a problem with fanservice in itself; but when there is no substance whatsoever behind the fanservice, that\'s annoying. I remember when Bell was fighting a minotaur in season one. Can we bring that back? That was pretty cool.From protagonists becoming comically OP despite doing nothing to deserve it, to the absurd ratio of ""plot"" to plot, this season feels like some 12-year-old\'s power trip. If you want to see female anime characters get objectified, go watch HDxD or something. There are plenty of way better fanservice shows. If you want good fight scenes, you won\'t find them here, because the animators seem to give up on animating every other fight scene. As such, there is literally nothing redeeming here, unless you like bad fight scenes and mediocre fanservice. J.C.Staff already ruined DAL and Index, and here\'s the latest victim of their never-ending spree of destroying beloved franchises. the terrible pacing is a blessing in disguise, as episode four is far worse than the first three episodes.

And when I say that, I mean REALLY rushed. Take the first arc of the series for example: The Apollo/War-Game Arc. The starting episodes were fine and all but it eventually delved down into lazy writing, awkward plotting and everything just being rushed to the point that the whole of the War-Game only took up one episode.Not to mention, the B.S power boost Bell received within that short amount of time, it\'s not even funny anymore. You expect us to believe that just within a couple of days. He was already curb-stomping over the...same guy who beat the ever living shit out of him the days prior? This is what I like to call: ""A Toriyama Hand-Job"". It\'s where just because the plot oh-so demands it. The protagonist gets so strong to the point where the word bullshit is literally written into the script itself.If i were to compare Bell\'s increase in power level, it\'s like how Goku during the Namek Saga went from a power level of: 90,000 to fucking 3,000,000 just because he got a ""Zenkai Boost"". But hey, at least there\'s an explanation to how Goku got this strong, even though it\'s extremely vague.For Bell in season 2, they don\'t fucking explain anything at all! They just expect us to accept the amount of shit they pull out of their ass and consider it as ""Simply a power boost"" or ""The character worked hard for it."" It would have been much more believable if they showed us an actual TRAINING segment instead of a few frames of maybe him dodging one or two hits from Wallenstein. The whole thing is fucking wonky.This series was one of my favorites when it first came out with it\'s first season. It was a great newbie turning pro story and I was always excited for what to come next but now it\'s like the producers are taking the piss. same guy who beat the ever living shit out of him the days prior?

It was nothing entirely original and the familia premise was nice but what made the first season so enjoyable because it was a well executed underdog story of Bell Cranel getting stronger with a few passable ecchi scenes.However, season two does not capture that same enjoyment simply because it's execution and direction was not on par...with the first season.Story: 5/10The story continues on from the first season about Bell trying to get stronger and find more girls in dungeons and without spoiling, he does get into trouble. However, it is not the sort of trouble that gets the watchers tense or explores a theme of the show it is simply a poorly executed conflict that had barely any interesting qualities. From the minotaur scene and early dungeon scenes from the first season, this season does not capture the same heart. It feels like a slice of life fantasy like Konnosuba rather than an action adventure series.Art: 7/10One of the best qualities of DanMachi was that it always had nice art and animation. While it isn't anything top tier, it is still enjoyable to look at.Sound: 7/10The opening and endings are good again nothing special but they do their jobs the same as the OSTs.Characters: 5/10The characters in this anime are so average. One of the bigger themes of this anime is Bell gaining more experience and strength. He moves from his humble beginnings as the Little Rookie into a more accomplished adventurer however there is literally nothing interesting about him. He is plain and average and he along with the rest of the anime are completely filled with tropes. No other character in this anime feels even remotely interesting. Lili-kun is probably the only one with the interesting story but they executed in such a boring manner that all of her intrigue quickly dissipated.Enjoyment: 5/10This season is completely average and missable It does not capture the same charm as the first season did and feels more like a parody of itself and the genre similarly to Konosuba except DanMachi attempts to take itself seriously.Overall: 5/10Again, I do not recommend watching this show. It is average with very little redeeming qualities. If you want to watch something in a similar type of world then I suggest watching Konosuba.

Then this one is my recommendation.The only thing people think that this anime has game mechanism is about the level concept, while in my opinion level concept is exist in real world such as having work skills license. So it\'s not really a game mechanism.Story: 9/10I always love this anime. A heroic tale with many conflict, building up power to be stronger, a naive mindset of the MC. If you love the first season, then you\'ll love this too.This anime also has a really good battle scene, unlike some ""isekai""...genere anime, the battle scene was executed so good that moves me.

God, i really love this show.Art: 9/10This is purely based on my opinion, everyone has different taste. But, i think this anime has really good art compared to another anime. The art is consistent, i just find it really beautiful, especially about Haruhime.Sound: 8/10Good enough, no stupid bgm. The BGM fits with the scene.Character: 9/10I really like Belt character.

Staff has proven itself to not learn from their mistakes and destroy yet another great show.Story - 2Danmacci season 2 has 2 story arcs so far. One involves the war game with the Apollo family and the other is about saving Haruhime (and i guess all of Orario) from the Ishtar family. Now personally, I don\'t mind the fact that there are 2 separate arcs in a 12 episode season, however I do mind the fact that they are both executed extremely poorly. The story is that the Apollo family wants...to take Bell away from Hestia and declare a war game to do so (after creating havoc in the city). From what the setting tells us about the characters is that they are all fairly intelligent under a capitalistic economic structure and governed by appropriate laws. So when the Apollo family decides to attack the Hestia family and disrupt the peace of the city, how are they not convicted of any crimes? This is a major plot hole that completely disregards any meaning to the setting and its characters. On top of that, Apollo\'s reason for wanting Bell in the first place was by no means worth sacrificing all his property and money. This is the prime example of plot convenience.As of episode 8 in the Ishtar arc, the story is just downright an eyesore. Haruhime is a princess from the far east that got taken into custody by the Ishtar family and forced to work as a prostitute, however, she holds a secret ability that makes her extremely useful in aiding in battle. Bell and the familia want to save Haruhime from being abused constantly by the Ishtars so they decide to buy her when they have enough money. Now you\'d think the story is just a rescue mission, when reality it\'s just a horrorful reverse rape fetish. In one scene, Bell gets his genitals grabbed by an ugly woman which shows how a decent show went from being a fantasy genre anime into a tragic hentai. I will go into more detailed criticism about the Istar familia in the characters portion.Sound and Art - 6Nothing much to tell here. The animations and aesthetics are fairly decent.Characters - 1One of the reasons I liked Danmacci season 1 was because of how the characters develop throughout the show. For example, Lilith overcame her fear of her previous family after sucking up to them for most her life. In Danmacci season 2, there has been absolutely no character development whatsover so far in the show and every single character is unengaging.One of the reasons season 1 is good is because of Hestia\'s child-like personality. In season 2 however, there is a complete lack of Hestia and it\'s almost as if she\'s a side character especially in the Ishtar arc.For the members of the Apollo family, each and every one of them only say lines like ""come with me Bell, or suffer."" It is honestly just painful to hear every time and they have no development at all for the main antagonists of the arc.As for each and every member of the Ishtar clan, they are all a complete eyesore to look at as Iv\'e mentioned before. One of the main problems i noticed early on with these characters is that they\'re all prostitutes yet they want the lay with Bell for free. This is a complete contradiction to what these characters should really be. As for the fat and ugly Ishtar specifically, she went from being a funny character that jokes about how she ""gets all the guys"" to being a psychotic rape dungeon torture maniac in the blink of an eye.Now Bell in this season is a pea brain who doesn\'t understand half of what is happening around him which completely contradicts his character from the first season.Enjoyment - 3There is no denying that the aesthetics and battle in the war game were good to look at so i\'ll give it a 3 for that one episode.Overall- 2Now it may seem like I just sound butt-hurt and immature about all the Ishtar family scenes, however, that is not so as this is supposed to be a fantasy genre anime about a group of people who explore a dungeon and kill monsters. The turn of events make absolutely no sense towards the setting.Now that that\'s out of the way, Danmacci doesn\'t succeed because they fail to make the characters engaging by provide 0 character development and dreadful story arcs. to take Bell away from Hestia and declare a war game to do so (after creating havoc in the city).

The scene very apparent is a lovely introduction.The War Game occurs fairly quickly but the episodes are well done and well thought out.The Renard section is also very good and you get a great new character that ticks many of...my boxes.The final segment again is really well done and you get to know people on a bit of a deep level going forwards for a new season.ArtThis is done to the same standard as before and is really good to watch. The use of CGI for the enemies does work really well when needed.SoundWe have a great OP and ED. The general sounds are perfectly fitting.

They seem to have dated her and it shows bitterness about. Trouble follows her.Bell gains more development than ever right down to heartfelt moments towards the end. We get his beliefs that can be overpowering, his desires and worries. He is expanded so much more. It does leave conflict to his love interest as it isn't clear if it is Haruhime, Hestia or Ais.Haruhime gets a really nice backstory and revelations she doesn't know about herself come to light.Mikoto gets a nice story background and she is developed into the cast as a main stay.Ais we do not get to see as much as I would have hoped. Her absence does make sense during the show completely. She when around however is developed greatly. The first episode shows how little she has done towards normal life.

This is a story of a boy who becomes a hero from zero. The first season was amazing. The plot told us that there was a goddess who targeted the protagonist and was helping him grow strong. We didn\'t know what was the real target of that goddess. The plot of Gods and Goddess coming to earth to live with humans by abandoning all their powers was also not that good but I accepted it somehow. The fighting with plot was the thing that everyone loved and so was...me. So after all that, it made me want to wait and watch the second season.The second season made gods and goddess seem like nothing more than humans. Yes, HUMANS! ""Why would Gods fight among themselves?"", I wondered. It seems Gods in this anime is nothing more than trash humans. Then the skills are also trash now. Our protagonist has emotion freezing ability but what about it? His emotion still exist like others and ""Fire Bolt"" seems more like a low-level attack unlike the first season. All the adventurer seems like otakus with no power but high-level attitude. Then there\'s the main antagonist of this season and her ""Familia"". The main antagonist is a ""SLUT GOD"". Funny, right? Well, it is. The strongest warrior in her Familia is a fat old lady. The whole familia owns a ""Slut Town"" and for some unknown reason, they are the second strongest familia. That\'s what our author decided. There are no ACTUAL FIGHTS here. I believe writer was trying to come up with a hentai plot like Rance 01 but with no actual hentai scenes.The sound is kind of annoying. Specially when a explosion or ""Fire Bolt"" releases. The Sound is like a ""EAR-RAPE"" Version of grenade explosion. There is no side character stories. Even if there is, it\'s all meaningless ones. The art is all that\'s good in this anime.I suggest that you do not watch this anime AT ALL. You can watch the first season but not this one. Don\'t make yourself waste time on this anime. Watch something better. Watch even Fairy Tail, but not this one. That\'s how I feel after watching this anime. me.

I believe writer was trying to come up with a hentai plot like Rance 01 but with no actual hentai scenes.The sound is kind of annoying. Specially when a explosion or ""Fire Bolt"" releases. The Sound is like a ""EAR-RAPE"" Version of grenade explosion. There is no side character stories. Even if there is, it\'s all meaningless ones. The art is all that\'s good in this anime.I suggest that you do not watch this anime AT ALL. You can watch the first season but not this one. Don\'t make yourself waste time on this anime. Watch something better. Watch even Fairy Tail, but not this one. That\'s how I feel after watching this anime.', ""I don't know about the others but since I've read the light novel of it, I think they did decent in DanMachi season 2. Been waiting for Haruhime for a long time and now that it's here, I am looking forward to this Ishtar Familia incident. The execution left out some details from the light novel which probably the reason why Bell became too strong for Apollo Familia. After he underwent training with Ais and Tione, Bell's status became all SS aside from his agility. When Hestia was asked by Hermes why and what is the status of Bell's agility, she just replied with a...smirk on her face telling him that it is beyond SS and that is thanks to his skill. And now as we are on the way to the end of the arc, we are introduced to many new good characters like Aisha and Haruhime. To avoid further spoiling the fun, these two characters did have a lot of impact on Bell Cranel's character development. Does a prostitute deserves the help of a hero in the making as it is known that in heroic tales, prostitutes are some of the reasons for the hero's downfall. Is Bell Cranel willing to do and break through his walls just to save Haruhime in the hands of the Ishtar Familia?Best Characters still in the series is Hermes and Aisha, that's for sure. smirk on her face telling him that it is beyond SS and that is thanks to his skill.

But I was expecting something that is possible to my eyes and brain to watch, at least. What the actual f**k is this anime?I simply cannot stand watching this anymoreIt\'s unbeliavable how people spent money to animate and direct this.The story built is actually nice and fun if you think about it, the little rookie has something unique in him, that can make him stronger and level up easily, specially in hard times that he is forced to push himself to his limits...in order to protect the ones he loves, quite the cliché, but these kinds of plot usually don\'t fail to draw attention from any public. The animation is quite smooth, but it\'s hardly shown on this sequel, they really show how their budget was low, it comes to the point where action scenes are presented with just a slide of still images, there\'s also scenes which some of the side-characters stay still while there is movement going on. The thing is, there are animes with lower budgets that are better animated than this.The characters ? Easily replaceableThe protagonist is just a common ""nut size brain"" that can\'t think by himself and it\'s a completely moron around womens. (This last part is very common, and it\'s what piss me the most) Like, why does this characters have to be so empty ? I\'m tired of this protagonist format, weak on the beggining, gets stronger, but is still idiot like he doesn\'t have a brain, and even dumber around women.This echi anime type it\'s just a cancer, I really think you get dumber as you watchThe sound effects of this is just appaling, there are lots of time where they didn\'t even bother to add the characters steps soundsSorry if you were looking for something more technical, but this anime is not worthy of such thingAaand, the story is soooooooooooooo fking rushed in order to protect the ones he loves, quite the cliché, but these kinds of plot usually don\'t fail to draw attention from any public.

Instead of focusing on the (supposedly) main theme of the series, which is Bell and his adventures in the dungeon, while he levels up and becomes stronger, they chose to put everything along those lines in 3rd plan and focus on the story. It's not bad in my opinion, however, I was expecting more badass dungeon fighting scenes. Just to clarify, among all the 12 episodes, if I'm not mistaken, there were only 3 or 4 dungeon fight scenes, and none was even...close to specially enjoyable or emotional in any way. Still a good anime though. close to specially enjoyable or emotional in any way. Still a good anime though."", 'It is fair to say that I am one of those critics that had no big problem with DanMachi when it first aired in 2015. It was flawed, no doubt, but it was a harmless, fun adventure show that brought about one of the greatest waifu-bait cuties ever to grace the medium; and I will hear no denying that sentiment from here on out!After nearly five years, we finally get more of DanMachi to continue the story of our two favorite lovable companions going on more adventures and meeting new characters on the way. If you remember my review of the previous season, you\'d...see that I gave it a solid score considering the type of anime: Harem anime with a dim-witted protagonist. However, Bell is a dim-witted protagonist that at least has some heart to him and especially with his interactions with the boob goddess herself, Hestia. That made DanMachi a lot better than most of its similar contemporaries. My one big wish for the sequel was to expand their relationship more and have it be a more significant focus on the narrative.What I did get was more of that, but not enough. I wanted more of it because everyone outside of Hestia and Bell\'s relationship is merely decent to just downright dull. None of the other female characters have anything to them that makes them stand out or memorable. Lili is the only one other than Hestia with any semblance of charisma only because she does become more integral to Bell\'s story. She does have her fair share of funny moments sprinkled throughout the show. For every other character, I could not put my finger on what I was supposed to latch to. Their personal story arcs aren\'t exactly anything special or become downright dramatic to the point where it gets nauseating the more I try to think about it. From a moral or writing standpoint, I would not classify them as terrible characters. It\'s just that the sequel did not do much to carry me through whatever struggle or situation they happened to be in.I have noticed that Hestia does draw some ire among the anime community. A lot will point out how annoying she can be whenever she tries her best to cling to Bell whenever she has the opportunity to do so. Other characters like Hestia did strike me as annoying to the point where I didn\'t want to sit through whatever tedious antics they conjured up. With Hestia, I find that her special was her eye-catching design and her bright personality that shines through Minase Inori\'s fantastic performance. Would I say that Inori could only play Hestia? Probably not. But, I think she sells this character with her much-needed charisma that makes Hestia\'s advances more charming than anything else.I\'ve said before that DanMachi\'s plot is nothing special. I would say it\'s not very good in many aspects. I often forget what the main overarching story is supposed to be other than, ""Main character and companion go on RPG adventures A, B, and C."" There isn\'t much to it other than that. The sequel tries its best to give us plot arcs that jump up the melodrama to tug at your heartstrings a little. I don\'t think it was very successful as it felt a bit contrived once I thought about it. I will give credit for the 2nd half of the season because it gave us a familia that bikini-clothed girls mainly populate. So if you weren\'t already turned off by the boob goddess sulking up the screen by her gelatinous milk jugs, you would not be swayed by this season by a long shot. I appreciated the gesture, even if the plot itself wasn\'t very memorable.The animation quality is about the same as season one. Thankfully. We have been getting a lot of lousy studio changes in other anime that switch up the animation or character designs that make it jarring to go back and forth. The J.C. Staff usually never disappoints by consistently giving quality art and animation direction, even if it isn\'t spellbinding like most other big-budget anime studios.DanMachi is one anime that I always stick up for regardless of its many detractors. However, it is one of those situations where I can not argue why those people have their issues. It is dumb in its execution to be a standout RPG/Fantasy anime in a time when there are already enough of those to the point of suffocation. Honestly, without the relationship between Bell and Hestia, I do think I would be on that side of the camp. Regardless, anyone who says anything about Hestia is just wrong in every word. Just stop.

Please? Thank you.Grade: B+', ""A somewhat promising show that took its potential and threw it into the fire like SAO did. A disappointment, to say the least.When I first watched Danmachi's first season, despite its clichés and overly used character archetypes and plot, I enjoyed every bit of it, watching every episode with joy and excitement. Watching a young boy grow stronger and chase after the woman he loved sparked lots of nostalgia in me. When second season was announced, I was excited beyond belief, even watching the premiere at AX.So where in this second season did things go wrong?If we look at a show like One Punch Man...and it's second season, we can get a good grasp at just what happened that caused the second season to be unable to live up to the expectations of the first. One trait that OPM had in its first season was this feeling of exhilaration in every action scene. This feeling would excite the viewers, bringing watchers closer into the action and movements of the characters and just how epic the show was. Danmachi 1 was similar in many ways as there were many scenes in which I and many others watched in awe as Bell Cranel fought with great passion to overcome many obstacles. But sadly, second season didn't have that.One of the main issues why I couldn't properly watch this show and savor feelings of exhilaration was due to the quick pacing. Often times scenes could have been lengthened out, giving them more meaning and purpose. Like the tortoise and the hare, it is often much better to take your time than to speed through, and that's exactly what Danmachi 2 failed at. Everything felt rushed and unnatural, nothing like an adventure. One moment Bell got caught in a fight against the Apollo familia, and the next moment, victory against the Apollo familia in the war game. A fight scene that could have been lengthened out and given great detail such as the Minotaur fight in season 1 ended before you could even think about it. There was just no feelings put into the show.Season 2 was also supposed to be a break from the dungeoning aspect of season 1 and focus more on the relationships between the gods and familias of Orario, but instead we got nothing but 2 gods who were nuts over Bell. Little to no details about the gods were given, and in an attempt to create a show that squeezed in two highly anticipated arcs we ended up with a confusing plot with nothing but creepy Apollo faces and a sprinkle of fan service because why not, it'll get you some views. For a show that stresses the importance of relationships between gods and the mortals of the world, it felt like nothing but a tournament to see who could take Bell's virginity first. Once the 2 major arcs were completed, the whole story took a downfall, and decided to end the series with 2 filler episodes that failed to do anything but worsen the reputation of the show, as I couldn't help but watch them feeling as if the studio had just completely given up on the project after they noticed it was paced way too fast and failed to achieve it's expectations of a epic and exhilarating show.The overall sound stayed consistent throughout the show, which was one of season 1's strong points. However, the art took a serious hit towards the end of the second arc, with many scenes feeling very rushed and, not surprisingly, bad CGI. This only worsened the feeling that the studio had given up on the second season due to how poorly it was paced.Of course, the show had some of it's strong points that kept the whole show from being a complete disaster. As aforementioned, it was nice to take a break from the dungeoning aspect of Bell's life and more towards the relationships and rivalries between the gods of Tenkai. Danmachi was introduced as a show of dungeons and gods, not just of the dungeons, so changing the subject of the show was definitely a positive towards the overall plot.Despite the possible positives to this show, it comes to no surprise that Danmachi 2 was unable to outdo or even match the prowess of the first season. Its unnatural pace and skipping of details that could have added more depth into the show caused the entire story and characters to fall apart. The overall show felt very flat and boring, as I could no longer feel this sense of motivation and energy that the first season initially had. To top it all off, the failure of the art to match the quality of its first couple episodes and the first season made it worse, as it became painful to watch a show that no longer seemed to have any effort put into it. With how poorly the show ended I was surprised to see that a 3rd season was announced, and despite having had great expectations to the 2nd season that was to cover 2 very exciting arc from the light novel series, I no longer feel a sense of excitement for the 3rd season, despite knowing just how amazing the following story arc are in the actual light novel series. Danmahi 1 set up a high level of potential which the second season managed to throw away by pacing the show too quickly and therefore making a very bland show. I am hoping that the 3rd season that will air in the future will fix the mistakes created in the 2nd season and bring back the sense of exhilaration and excitement that the first season gave in order to capture its audience.Story:5 Art:6 Sound:7 Character:5 Enjoyment:4 Overall:5.6 and it's second season, we can get a good grasp at just what happened that caused the second season to be unable to live up to the expectations of the first.

First, having reasonable conflicts with the other gods, which introduced many more characters within the realm or danmachiverse. It's also great to see that the main familia of our story had expanded even a little. Second, is the physical and mental development of the protagonists. Some leveled up, and most of them became more courageous in fighting with those who do evil...things and in standing up for their comrades. Third, there was a big chance that the main villain was revealed and there is now something to look forward to in the next seasons, unlike in the first season, it's just like adventures and nothing to look forward to. Lastly, we know that we all want ships and the ships are sailing little by little. Surprisingly, the ships are multiplying!The downside, however, is that every arc is seemed to be a bit rushed. That is understandable because there are only 12 episodes given to us for this season. Even though it turned out like that, the story was understandable with a good animation to portray every scene wonderfully - that's what's important.All in all, it was very good! A simple anime, that is not that hyped and not that displeasing, gave a splendid continuation to the adventures of Bell Cranel and Hestia together with the whole familia.

It featured a good story in a good world and it was about a protagonist that we eventually knew that was the special kid with special powers, but damn right he had to start with the beginning, while the supporting cast wasn\'t something listed in the negatives either.Some time after that we got an other season, which told the events of the first season. While this wasn\'t what many of us wanted, it developed...something the first season established already, but couldn\'t develop on, due to the lack of episodes. Season one gave us this underlined feeling of something happening in the world, something irregular that we must find out. The parallel season was pretty much entirely focused on developing this, albeit not with out favorite characters we got to know in season one. Still, since the parallel season developed this element, I wouldn\'t call it a failure, and it\'s essential to the world building of the Danmachi universe.While the movie was just a side gig, I genuinely enjoyed most of it. Other than that there isn\'t any relevance to this review, so let\'s just carry onAnd then, we got this... I\'m struggling to find a word that would fit this season and not breaching the guidelines...Season two has many, many problems. Where to begin?I would like to start with the character design. I would be the first to admit that many anime fall in this trap, but I really hate the way how Danmachi portrays some of their villains, mainly because they look horrendous in any way. It\'s like the animators thought that their audience isn\'t capable to differentiate between good and evil. I\'m talking about two particular characters here, and anyone who watched the anime know exactly who am I talking about. One is making faces that would land him in a psychiatric ward, the other one is a 7 foot tall toad who\'s only missing a bandanna which reads: ""I am evil! Hate me!""Speaking of villains. I also have a problems with their motivations. Nope, scratch that, I have problems with everyone\'s motivations.Villain number one has literally no motivations, except pissing off Hestia, and of course he wants Bell, because everyone want\'s Bell, am I right? I guess the only reason he had his arch (which I will touch later on) is because the animators told the story writer: ""Hey, we got bored of drawing this ruined castle, can\'t they live in a mansion or something?"" and the writer was like: ""Sure, let me come up with something, I\'ll be back in 5 mins"".Villain number two (and I\'m talking about the goddess, not the toad) had a slightly better motivation. I mean... Okay, I admit it I was exaggerating when I said nobody had a good motivation in this season. Villain number two had an actually good one. The only thing about it that how she acted out was awful.But let\'s stop talking about the villains, shall we? Bell, is a freaking, mother loving,knife juggling Gary Sue. The first season had this problem to a degree, but season two arch two was plagued by the good deeds and ever victorious power of love and sunshine of the hero who\'s smearing about unjust. This almost made me drop S2 a couple of times.Gary sues can\'t be without their damsels in distress, can\'t they? The whole trope is a lazy way to give something for the protagonist to act upon as quickly as possible and be heroic and all that good stuff... Damsels are bad as they are, but this one is adding a good layer of being flat out stupid. She would rather die, so that her existence doesn\'t taint the picture of oh holy thou than ever Protagonist and lady killer Bell sama, being an, uhm, night-time social worker, knowing full well the loss of her own life would empower the party which sought and still is actively chasing down said protag. That\'s really nice of her, isn\'t it?Enough of the characters though, lets move on to the other parts of the anime... The animation is worse than anything yet. Do you remember that fight with the Minotaur in season one? How it ended, where Bell stabbed it, how it exploded. Yeah, I bet you do. Because it was awesome and got your blood boiling and shouting ""FIRRBOLTO"" along with the struggling albino boy who was pushed into a situation he never should had been in. The animation was a key why did that fight got 422k (19/09/2019) views on YT. Will there be a scene so memorable in season two? Absolutely not.However, one thing that I liked about season two is how it kept their cool sounding explosions, to which I tip my hat to and give maximum score in the sound category. Yeah, some good sounding orgasmic explosions is all that makes me biased. No, I don\'t have a Megumin body pillow hidden in my wardrobe.I also mentioned that I would touch on the two arcs of the anime.Arc one is like OPM S2 but thankfully in 4 episodes: we build a problem for 3 episodes and end it in a half. The end fight literally took 10 minutes. Even worse there were some cool characters the story could had used after this arc but nope, 10 or so new characters were washed down the drain without every seeing them again.Arc two be like: I save you! No Don\'t save me! But I want to save you! But I wanna die because I\'m impure! But look how much I fought for you already! Nooo you hurting yourself for me! Ah shii I\'m almost dead. OK you can save me... GARY SUE POWA ACTIVATE! The only saving grace about this arc is Freya and her badassness in the last 4 minutes of the arc.Is It Wrong That I Want to Meet You in a Dungeon was one of the first anime\'s that my sister recommended me after I told her that I got the weeb. There may be a factor of nostalgia that makes me biased about S1 since that was one of the first anime I watched right after Elfen Lied and Log Horizon. To this day I\'m an avid fan of fantasy an Danmachi is a good anime. I had waited 3 years of this season and many of you had been waiting for the continuation of this masterpiece of four years. But lets be honest here. Danmachi season 2 is garbage (oh look I found a good word for this season) If you don\'t feel the same nostalgia about season one, I wouldn\'t recommend wasting your time on this season. With that I would thank you for reading my review and see ya next time. something the first season established already, but couldn\'t develop on, due to the lack of episodes.

Nope, scratch that, I have problems with everyone\'s motivations.Villain number one has literally no motivations, except pissing off Hestia, and of course he wants Bell, because everyone want\'s Bell, am I right? I guess the only reason he had his arch (which I will touch later on) is because the animators told the story writer: ""Hey, we got bored of drawing this ruined castle, can\'t they live in a mansion or something?"" and the writer was like: ""Sure, let me come up with something, I\'ll be back in 5 mins"".Villain number two (and I\'m talking about the goddess, not the toad) had a slightly better motivation. I mean... Okay, I admit it I was exaggerating when I said nobody had a good motivation in this season. Villain number two had an actually good one. The only thing about it that how she acted out was awful.But let\'s stop talking about the villains, shall we? Bell, is a freaking, mother loving,knife juggling Gary Sue. The first season had this problem to a degree, but season two arch two was plagued by the good deeds and ever victorious power of love and sunshine of the hero who\'s smearing about unjust. This almost made me drop S2 a couple of times.Gary sues can\'t be without their damsels in distress, can\'t they? The whole trope is a lazy way to give something for the protagonist to act upon as quickly as possible and be heroic and all that good stuff... Damsels are bad as they are, but this one is adding a good layer of being flat out stupid. She would rather die, so that her existence doesn\'t taint the picture of oh holy thou than ever Protagonist and lady killer Bell sama, being an, uhm, night-time social worker, knowing full well the loss of her own life would empower the party which sought and still is actively chasing down said protag. That\'s really nice of her, isn\'t it?Enough of the characters though, lets move on to the other parts of the anime... The animation is worse than anything yet. Do you remember that fight with the Minotaur in season one? How it ended, where Bell stabbed it, how it exploded. Yeah, I bet you do. Because it was awesome and got your blood boiling and shouting ""FIRRBOLTO"" along with the struggling albino boy who was pushed into a situation he never should had been in. The animation was a key why did that fight got 422k (19/09/2019) views on YT. Will there be a scene so memorable in season two? Absolutely not.However, one thing that I liked about season two is how it kept their cool sounding explosions, to which I tip my hat to and give maximum score in the sound category. Yeah, some good sounding orgasmic explosions is all that makes me biased. No, I don\'t have a Megumin body pillow hidden in my wardrobe.I also mentioned that I would touch on the two arcs of the anime.Arc one is like OPM S2 but thankfully in 4 episodes: we build a problem for 3 episodes and end it in a half. The end fight literally took 10 minutes. Even worse there were some cool characters the story could had used after this arc but nope, 10 or so new characters were washed down the drain without every seeing them again.Arc two be like: I save you! No Don\'t save me! But I want to save you! But I wanna die because I\'m impure! But look how much I fought for you already! Nooo you hurting yourself for me! Ah shii I\'m almost dead. OK you can save me... GARY SUE POWA ACTIVATE! The only saving grace about this arc is Freya and her badassness in the last 4 minutes of the arc.Is It Wrong That I Want to Meet You in a Dungeon was one of the first anime\'s that my sister recommended me after I told her that I got the weeb. There may be a factor of nostalgia that makes me biased about S1 since that was one of the first anime I watched right after Elfen Lied and Log Horizon. To this day I\'m an avid fan of fantasy an Danmachi is a good anime. I had waited 3 years of this season and many of you had been waiting for the continuation of this masterpiece of four years. But lets be honest here. Danmachi season 2 is garbage (oh look I found a good word for this season) If you don\'t feel the same nostalgia about season one, I wouldn\'t recommend wasting your time on this season. With that I would thank you for reading my review and see ya next time.', ""(Updated review after completing the anime)~Spoiler Free Review~DanMachi, the anime that took the world by storm in 2015, is back again to pick up where we last left off in season 1. There has been a lot of hype for season 2, and everyone has been excited to join Bell and his adventures again... or so we thought. This anime so far has been very lackluster in living up to its name that was presented back in 2015. It's disappointing how far this anime has fallen from its position, but by no means is this anime bad. There are quite big problems with this season,...and when it messes up, it messes up big time. Thankfully, there aren't that many problems.Story: 3/10Rushed. That is all I can say, it ruins the story arcs. The first arc started good, and when we got to the meat of the story, the anime took off in a full olympic sprint. Literally no time was spend to develop the characters or the story, its a shame because this arc was a good starting point for S2. Even without reading the source material I know that content is being skipped and cut out by large amounts, and that's a bad sign.The second arc is dark, and I mean really dark. It deals with topics like prostitution, kidnapping, rape, drugging, and torture (specifically episode 8). I don't understand why the writers chose to put these topics into a PG-13 anime, because these are the kinds of stuff you find in those really messed up doujins that people warn you about. To be fair, it is watered down and we don't actually see anything or go into specifics, but its still really bad to put these kinds of things into a story like DanMachi. Prostitution alone was already pushing it. It really makes me question what the writers were doing after they finished writing the events of S1, because the story there was pretty good and very enjoyable.Oh and one plot hole that drives me crazy is how the second story arc takes place in a huge district in Orario that literally came out of thin air. Quite a few times we have seen overhead, semi-panoramic shots of the city of Orario, NO WHERE IN THESE SHOTS CAN I FIND THE PLEASURE QUARTER. They even provide us with an overhead shot of what the Pleasure Quarter looks like, and nothing matches. They literally did not think the city through when they created the overhead scenes of Orario back in S1. The damn district appears to be half the size of Orario for god's sake. Where did this place come from?!?!Art: 6/10Its good, but nothing amazing. Mainly because we have almost no action scenes compared to S1. It's a nice anime to look at, but its mostly still shots with animated characters. 70% of the time we are looking at buildings, which isn't exactly hard to animate.Sound: 7/10Its nice, there's lots of ambiance in this season and I like it. Nothing short of S1 honestly, in the small amount of action scenes we get, the music is fitting. In each different atmosphere as we progress through the story, the music is very fitting and helps you jump into the scene.Character: 3/10Character development is a tad bit better than the story, but also suffers from the same problem. We are running through the arcs so fast we don't get to watch the characters grow. Things are just happening and we have to move on because the next sequence started. Compared to S1, there's almost no character development, though there is a fair amount of character interaction which I like.Enjoyment: 4/10I was so hyped for this anime, and I was so disappointed after episode 2. It started off great, and is progressing pretty badly. I lost almost all my excitement for this anime as of episode 8, the dark undertones finished it for me. I'm still going to keep watching, after all I like DanMachi for what it is, even if S2 has been beaten to a pulp. I still want to see Bell grow and the main storyline progress, even if i'm getting my hopes up since there is only 4/5 more episodes left.(Updated section after completing all episodes)Final thoughts: Season 2 was surely a disappointment compared to season 1. Did I like DanMachi in the end? Yes. Am I conflicted on this season? Yeah. DanMachi took a full 180 turn with this season, it became very mellow and almost trying to be a drama yet failing at being so. There's a lot of parts lacking in this season that we saw and loved in S1, it's a shame that this adaptation came out as poorly as it did. This season is very inconsistent, almost not even feeling like a sequel to S1 at all. Character dynamics are off, the story telling is strange, and most importantly the characters feel empty.As many people are also saying, the two major story arcs were apparently very very badly adapted from their source material. The first arc was supposed to be a huge turning point in the DanMachi story and was also much longer than they put screen time to, its a shame to hear that honestly. A lot of people praise the first arc of S2 in the LN and I heard many good things about it, and yet it came out so poorly in the anime, its a shame really. I will be going off to read the LN to not only relive the story but to also prepare myself for S3.I liked the anime regardless, its not terrible, but this season definitely did not live up to its reputation. I have high hopes for S3, as we are going to see what everyone is saying is the best story arc of DanMachi. Off to the LN~ and when it messes up, it messes up big time.

Off to the LN~"", ""Please be advised that this review is only intended to be read by those that have finished watching the series and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.Based off a popular light novel of the same name Is it wrong to pick up girls in a Dungeon which is better known as Danmachi for convenience sake is an action, adventure, romance and adventure genre anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a rookie adventurer that has both a good heart and a desire to...explore mysterious and dangerous labyrinths were to arrive one day in a land that featured not just challenging dungeons that featured not just challenging monsters but also many adventurers and civilians that needed his aid. Aid that few adventurers would have neither the time nor inclination to provide without sufficient reward being offered such is the nature of adventuring within the land of Orario where fame and prestige take priority over kindness and a desire to support others. In this beautiful but harsh city where an adventurers skills, intelligence and street smarts are what determines how far they get within both the city and their careers and whether or not they can gain the notice of the many gods that live among the adventurers just how far can Bell an adventurer that despite having the skills that allow him to keep himself and his familia above debt go in a land where not all threats are as obvious as a Minotaur trying to smash your face in with a massive club.Adventure themed animes within the anime industry as a whole can be said to be one of the most popular genres’ due largely to the sheer number of world’s and stories that can be visualised into an anime with many notable greats in the past being from this genre. Notable examples include Sword Art Online, Naruto, Fairy Tail, Overlord, Log Horizon and Gate. While each of these series were all excellent ones that created many compelling worlds and scenarios that took great advantage of the settings to create many well designed and developed characters all of these series had one thing that ultimately drove them forward to success which is that of a hero that could lead the casts advance against the stiff odds that the story presents them. The hero can be said to be ultimate driving force behind adventure genre anime as it is by their might and their development as individuals that allow them to succeed in their struggles and allow us as the viewers to see the fruits of their labor's. Within this series our hero is Bell Cranel an adventurer that despite only starting his career months ago has as a result of both his determination, skills and personality have managed to not only increase his prowess as an adventurer but also in the process forming many lasting friendships and bonds with his fellow adventurers that allowed him to not only gain them as fellow familia members but also many allies that he can call upon when he needs it. While the concept of having an adventurer who starts at zero and gradually claws his way to the top through hard work is a common theme among animes what served to draw me to this series was the fact that this journey of Bells was not one that he was embarking on alone for unlike most adventure themed animes that feature strong solo interaction within this series Bell is doing so with the aid of his allies within his familia organisations that mimic what will be called guilds in other series but feature stronger bonds within its confines that are as strong as those of actual families. This sense of seeing Bell not only embarking on a adventure to not only find and conquer challenges within the dungeon and form bonds with like-minded adventurers in the midst of fierce battles while doing so supported by his familia members that he can count on as both backup and emotional support can be said to be the one thing that drew me to this series. The series’ first episode I felt was an excellent one that served to not only reintroduce Bell and his familia allies to the audience after so long but also expand upon the world by showing the kind of powers that gods and their familia’s have on the adventurers that have caught their eye through their actions on the field.The overall story of Is it Wrong to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon follows the life of Bell Cranell a young upcoming adventurer and a member of a small but growing familia called the Hestia Familia that was formed around his goddess and saviour Hestia a god that had come down from the heavens to live within the confines of Orario. Orario a mysterious walled city that is located within the world while a thriving city is one that is rather unremarkable when compared to the many countries that lie outside of it apart from two notable things with the first being that alone among the vast world Orario is the sole location that houses the Dungeon a mysterious labyrinth that is located at the very heart of the city that is occupied by not just powerful monsters but also countless treasures that can change the fortunes of any adventurers that find them should they survive the dungeon first. While the dungeon and its riches can be said to be the first of Orario’s notable traits it is the second trait that can be said to be the clincher that enabled the city to be recognised internationally with this being the sole fact that apart from the dungeon the city also was home to countless goddesses and gods that have descended the heavens in order to collect and raise adventurers to fame and in the process enabling them to have some semblance of fun within the city. This combination of having many brave and enthusiastic adventurers who flock to the city to explore the dungeon hoping to find both treasure and fame and in the process being forced to dance to the whim of the gods that inhabit the city I felt served well to create an excellent maelstrom for Bell and his friends as they sought to carve out an existence within the city of the Dungeon. But one things for certain their journey will be anything but boring.BellBell Cranel portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of The Quintessential Quintuplets and Campione fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A young adventurer that had come to the city of Orario to set about fulfilling his dream of becoming an adventurer that would allow him to fight challenging monsters while meeting and befriending many beautiful woman Bell on initial impressions was shown to be a positive, cheerful and friendly person by nature that unlike the rank of the file of the adventurers that plied the city never hesitated in helping others. While a quiet person that preferred to avoid trouble which within Orario tended to escalate rather quickly Bell was someone that can be said to follow his heart and as a result he is someone that can never turn down the plight of others and indeed will try his utmost to help them even if said quest requires him to go up against steep odds. While this itself can be said to be a flaw that can prove fatal within the life of an adventurer to both his friends and allies and to myself it is the opposite that is rather true for this does well in upholding Bell’s core personality traits of being a kind, understanding and polite person that would approach his assigned quests with both tenacity and a steely determination to succeed at the task which within the series is shown well in his attempt to protect his friends and goddess from the attentions of Apollo familia and his attempt to rescue Haruhime a person that had due to a cruel twist of fate had been prepared to depart this world at an age far too young. While the life of an adventurer can indeed be a hard one depending on the skill set that one chooses it can be said that for Bell his transition from a civilian into a hardworking but nonetheless naive adventurer was anything but a smooth ride thanks to his needs to keep both himself and his own familia afloat while also trying to make a name for himself within the crowded confines of Orario. This itself while certainly a tough issue was also made more daunting by Bell’s tendency to place his trust in others too easily which is a result of Bell’s desire to believe in the goodness of others. While this served to cause Bell to experience many unnecessary trials within Orario it also allowed Bell to learn many valuable life lessons while at the same time allow him to discover and befriend many powerful allies within the city that would prove most useful as Bell’s career took off.As the series progresses and Bell and his allies improve not only their skills as adventurers but also their bonds with each other as well Bell’s personality gradually changes as he gets to both appreciate both the level of fighting prowess that he and his friends have attained after much hard work but also how much their teamwork has allowed them to improve not only the familia itself but also their knowledge of the world around them. While largely retaining his hardworking, friendly and positive nature Bell as a result of both hard-earned knowledge and desperate fights within both the city and the dungeon had learned to be more wary of things that are too good to be true and indeed is more willing to put the needs of the familia in front of his own desires a development that I felt was most appropriate. While still using his cherished grandfathers stories as his main source of motivation to a degree it can be seen that within Bell this has been boasted by the introduction of two more sources of motivation which is to improve his skills so as to allow him to meet and match his idol Aiz Wallenstein  Loki Familia’s top tier adventurer that has the nickname of Kenki which translates into Sword Princess a title that is a testament to both her beauty and her skill with her sword in terms of combat ability and being strong enough to protect each of his friends from harm. While these ideas of his may seem to be ones that are far too difficult to achieve considering the difference in strength this difficulty can be said to be the perfect fuel for Bell’s ambition as to Bell only by learning to surpass his existing skills and learning to improve them will he be able to both achieve his goal and protect his friends from harm a motivation that is shown in full grander within the fierce battles that Bell takes part in within this series. Due largely to both his childhood and his first days within the city Bell was someone that can be said to have an intimate knowledge of how hard life can be when you’re alone and have no friends that can be relied upon to assist you. As a result of this its perhaps unsurprising that Bell is someone that cares greatly about his friends and indeed is shown to be immensely loyal to them and willing to fight hard to protect them on the field. While loyal to his friends Bell was also shown to be somewhat surprisingly perceptive to the mental problems that plague them and is quite capable of narrowing down the issues that are bothering them as shown in his attempts to save Lily from his former guild and Haruhime from her fate.HestiaHestia portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Bell’s allies within the series. A goddess from the heavens that serves as the head of Hestia familia to which Bell belongs to Hestia on initial impressions is shown to be a positive, cheerful and understanding person by nature that while having the terrifying mood swings that characterised the major goddesses was also shown to be a kind, caring and friendly person that cared deeply about her charges. Due largely to both her stature and of the fact that among her fellows her familia was by far the smallest within Orario Hestia was someone that was shown to be easily triggered at times especially with regards to her fellow goddess Loki the head of the famed Loki familia Orario’s most combat-oriented famila. While often used as comic relief within the series it can be seen that this aspect of hers can be seen as a protective measure of sorts as beneath this Hestia is shown to be fiercely protective of her charges and is ever conscious of them being snatched away by others as shown in the previous season and in Apollo’s arc. While a goddess Hestia as both the patron and the overall leader of the familia is expected to guide it in a desired direction while ensuring that her charges are doing their best for both themselves and for the familia it can be seen that unlike familia’s like Apollo’s Hestia is someone that takes the safety of her charges seriously and while nominally a goddess would be proud of seeing her charges defend her honor it can be seen here that rather the opposite is true for Hestia while grateful to them dislikes seeing them get hurt and indeed is more than willing to simply let the insults fly despite her right to retaliate. While showing how determined she is to keep her charges safe this also shows Hestia’s desire to maintain peace between familia’s and her own desire for peaceful cooperation with others within Orario and thus ensuring that her charges faith and trust in her remain strong.While for the most part, Hestia’s personality traits remain constant throughout the series as the series progresses Hestia’s personality gradually begins to change as she is confronted with new situations that threaten the safety of both her familia and her charges. While normally shown as a relaxed person that avoids interfering with the life of her charges Hestia is shown to be quite capable of being both serious and perceptive to the needs of her charges and is shown to be able to give both wise advice to them while at the same time being able to come up with some surprisingly bold strategies that can serve to both turn the tables on the odds arrayed against her while also lessening the burdens that are affecting her charges. A notable example of this within the series is within the first arc in which Hestia in an effort to aid Bell and Lily took center stage and actively participated in the familia’s efforts to assist Bell during the arc and in the process demonstrating both leadership qualities as well the ability to stay calm and come up with the appropriate strategy to deal with a complex situation without escalating it by making effective use of existing assets.LilyLiliruca Lilusuke Arde portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Goblin Slayer and Charlotte fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Bell’s main allies within the series being a member of his familia. A member of the prum race a near human-like race that have the ability to make use of unique abilities in lieu of their short stature Liliruca who prefers to be simply called Lily from initial appearances is shown to be a quiet, calm and cautious person by nature that prefers to show patience and cunning in situations rather than hot-headed bravado as others would have. Unlike the rank of file of Orario’s inhabitants who are either adventurers that can actively fight on the frontlines or civilians who are able to provide support through the use of shops that sell items that are needed within the dungeon Lily is unique in that she’s somewhere in between for Lily is a supporter. While certainly capable of operating on the field within a party supporters like Lily are seen to lack the high-level combat ability of average adventurers and as a result within the world while they are still treated as members of the party, they are rarely deployed into areas that feature extreme danger. However while Lily may not have the high combat abilities of the likes of Bell or Mikoto Lily makes up for it by being able to not just identify subtle changes in the environment but also be able to determine the best course of action at a given time showing not just excellent perception but also leadership quality that takes great advantage of her calm nature. While a quiet person by nature and even more so in the past when Lily was first introduced to the familia Lily was someone that was kind, caring and loyal and while not one to openly show her feelings to those that she does not trust she is positive and friendly towards those that have genuinely earned her trust through their actions.While shown to be someone that was both mentally strong and able to bond well with others easily via skilful use of friendly banter as well as her own sense of confidence as the series goes on it can be seen that this aspect of Lily’s is something that’s akin to a mask that she uses to protect her heart that’s more fragile than she lets on. Due largely to the painful past that she had with adventurers in the past as well as the time that she had spent as part of other familia’s Lily contrary to her positivity and confidence was someone that can be said to have a complex of sorts as she saw herself as being worthless to others despite the many skills that she can bring to the table. As a result while outwardly trying hard to bond with her friends and to support them the best she can Lily, in the beginning, tried to maintain a set distance between her and her comrades in an effort to stop her misfortune from affecting them despite the fact that it can be seen that she genuinely enjoyed interacting with and fighting alongside them. While this can be seen as an attempt by her to merely protect herself from further pain it can also be interpreted as the opposite as Lily due to the despair and pain that she had experienced in the past with the likes of Soma familia does not wish to see this same aspect being visited upon her comrades in which she places her trust in. However as the series goes on and Lily was forced to not only reveal but also confront this hidden complex that had laid inside her Lily’s personality gradually began to change for the better. Despite the pain that she felt at being forced to go back to her former familia and later seeing the very friends that she had fought so hard to protect from her pain come and attempt to rescue her it can be said that the witnessing of this act can be said to be a strong revelation for her as this showed that despite her attempts to shield herself from them and despite her attempts to deceive them Bell and his friends not only trusted her as a dear comrade but also viewed her as both a valuable friend and ally that was an integral part of their familia.As a result of such a revelation Lily was forced to realise that despite all of her attempts to deceive them that in actuality Bell and his comrades had only known of her pain and just as she had sought to protect them they in turn had also sought to do the same by giving her the time that she needed in order to find the right moment to tell them the truth a revelation that while strong also turned out to be the perfect key that would unlock the locks that Lily had installed around her heart and allow her to not only realise her own foolishness but also open her eyes to the fact that genuine friendship that is formed around strong bonds of trust, care and consideration of others do exist in this world and that rather than try to avoid it like she had in the past she should instead learn to embrace it. An attitude that not only allowed Lily to make peace with her own pain but also allow her to open up the next chapter in her life and allow her to embrace her new role as a member of Hestia Familia and her role as the familia’s strategist where her now trademarked calmness and her desire to protect her friends and familia will be of best use.HaruhimeHaruhime Sanjouno portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Chisuga of Asterisk War and Alderamin of the sky fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Bell’s allies within the series. A member of the renard race a race that resembles human-like foxes that are native to the eastern lands Haruhime on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, kind and curious person by nature that despite her role as a prostitute is shown to be an attentive, polite and pleasant person that works hard at her given role despite the stigma that such a role applies within society. However while a prostitute Haruhime was shown to be someone that was also perceptive both on a personal level and a city level an aspect that I felt matched well with the image that woman of her role would know of what the true realities of their operating area are like. However despite being a member of that trade Haruhime unlike her sisters was shown to be someone that did not quite embrace her role and indeed can be said to maintain an aura of innocence in that she still clung to a fondness for children’s fairy tales that she had possessed as children. This love of and indeed fascination of such tales while serving well as the spiritual foundation that enables her to live her life freely without feeling pressured into changing it can also be seen as a double-edged sword of sorts however as within the same tales that she adores the role of prostitutes can also be seen as a harbinger of disaster to the hero’s of such tales. As a result this within her created a sense of complex in which while she desires freedom from her role she is also hesitant in calling upon others to help her achieve this as to her she is a tainted individual that will only serve to bring ruin to the hero’s that will try to save her which is shown in her extreme reluctance to have Bell help her.However, as the series goes on and Haruhime gets to see both the effects that her fate has on both Bell and her long-lost friend Mikoto Haruhime’s personality gradually begins to change. In the beginning of the series as a result of her status within her familiar and the shame that she felt that came from it Haruhime while certainly attentive and accommodating to all she encountered was someone that was noted to have very low self esteem and as a result was shown to be someone that had few friends within the familiar with the notable exceptions being Aisha and her closest advisers. She was also noted to not have a very clear idea on the path that she should take in life. Indeed at this point of her life Haruhime can be said to wish for nothing more than a clear purpose be given for her fate one that she hopes will somehow release her from it. However even when set on such a path it can be seen that Haruhime actually sees this decision of hers to be her’s alone and that no one but her should suffer the fate that she had chosen as evidenced by her desperate attempts to stop Bell and Mikoto from trying to save her by fighting her familia comrades. This attitude of wanting to find a purpose in life that will allow her to both serve her familia in a large capacity while also granting her the release from her fate that she had desired for so long while serving as her main source of motivation with her arc begins to gradually unravel as a result of her encounter with a lone adventurer that she had met by chance that of Bell Cranel. Unlike most adventurers who only ever visited her for pleasure Bell Cranel was different in that he was only here to seek sanctuary and not pleasure. At first though only seeing Bell as just another customer as Haruhime got to interact with him she saw to her surprise that unlike other adventurers who were boastful and did not take the time to understand the plight of others Bell was different in that he was not only attentive and willing to listen to her thoughts but also have an interest that he shared with her which is the love of fairy tales. For Haruhime the meeting of Bell can be said to be of something akin to a miracle for her as for the first time she was able to find someone from the outside that was not only sympathetic to her plight but also willing to help her break out of fate by for the first time in her life introduce the shining rays of hope that she had until now thought was impossible for her to see. As a result Haruhime while still retaining her quiet nature and a determination to protect the lives of others also starts to change becoming visibly braver and determined both to let go of her fixation on her role as a prostitute and also for the first time in her life try and select the path that she wants to take in her life.The character of Haruhime I thought was a well designed and developed character with her evolution from a quiet young woman who had resigned herself to her fate to someone that not only realised just how much having friends that she can count on for advice was but also on the kind of warmth, direction and purpose that they can introduce into one’s life and her resulting change in attitude as she sought to change her fate being especially well done.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series while remaining faithful to source material also did well in showing the development that each member of the familia has been through as a result of their success back in the first season. Environment wise while it was nice to see the streets of Orario again after so long I felt that the series also did well in creating unique environments for the series two story arcs that were both impressive in conception as well as giving the impression that in each case the stakes for Bell and his friends are higher than before with the castle that served as the opposing stronghold  for Apollo’s war game arc and the pleasure district that served as the main operating area for Ishtar Familia being notable examples. In terms of combat animations I felt that while each of the battles in which Bell takes part in were well designed and animated and featured excellent blends of action, tension and determination that the series also took great care to show that while Bell’s ability has rapidly improved as a result of the hard work that he had put in this was something that he didn’t do alone and indeed no matter how strong he is Bell is unable to take on upper-level adventurers easily a fact that is painfully reminded upon Bell by the countless adversaries that he faces in this season. However this in turn is offset by the fact that Bell is not fighting alone anymore and indeed Bell is now fighting alongside allies and friends that decided to join his family because they like countless other inhabitants of Orario was impressed and inspired by actions of an adventurer who despite having no need to have over the cause of his early days fought hard to protect countless innocents from harm and show to the world that no matter your origins and motivations as long as one fights hard they will be able to help protect others. While doing well in showing the strong unique skills and abilities that each member of the familia possessed this act of fighting alongside Bell to help him achieve his quest I felt also served to underpin one of the series main themes of each familia being more of a close-knit family that was connected by genuine bonds of friendship, trust, and mutual respect rather than the more conventional bonds that are found in standard guilds.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme respectively which was Hello to Dream that was performed by veteran seiyuu singer Yuka Iguchi and Sasayakana Shukusai that was performed by Sora Tob Sakana a newly formed idol group. These two songs I felt while both impressive in their own right conveyed within me different types of feelings that I felt matched the series tone with the former being a positive and upbeat song that gave the impression that while being an adventurer within Orario was hard and that each new foray into the dungeon will be a hard one each new day while bringing the potential for doom also brings with it an opportunity to not only improve your skills but also improve the bonds that you share with your familia members as well as the inhabitants of Orario that you interact within your daily lives for no matter your standing in Orario the connections that you forge also affects the lives of countless others that have met you. The ending theme in contrast, however, was different in that to me it conveyed a more relaxing feel due to its tone that gave the impression that after a day of adventuring within the dungeon that it’s time to unwind and enjoy your time with your friends in the nearest café. While the two songs were markedly different in the emotions that they conveyed I felt that the two songs contrasting effects worked well in this case as they showed that while an adventurers life within the walled city of Orario will be a tough one’s life will be easier if you were to seek and form bonds with like-minded allies and learn to fight together within the dungeons effectively while endeavouring to learn more about them in the safe confines of your home base after you return from a hard days foray into the dungeon. In terms of voice acting I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular I feel that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Inori Minase, Maaya Uchida and Haruka Chisuga all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Bell Cranel, Hestia, Lily, and Haruhime respectively with Haruka Chisuga’s portrayal of Haruhime deserving of special praise as I felt that her performance was spectacular. While the characters of Freya, Eina and Mikoto weren’t given as much expansion in the series as the main cast was I also felt that their assigned seiyuu’s of Yoko Hikasa, Haruka Tomatsu, and Chinatsu Akasaki all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters who within the series provided Bell and his allies with some excellent if sometimes uncalled for support.Overall conclusionOverall I felt that Is It wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon’s second season was an excellent series that had among its strong points in my opinion being its unique premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting and its unique take on the kinds of actions and environments that can exist in within seemingly stable locations like Orario. As with most animes that have additional seasons the second season of Damachi owes a portion of its success in my eyes to the foundations that were established by the first season of the series that aired back in Spring 2015 and while the first season itself was one that I really enjoyed it was not one that was not completely flawless in its execution. However it can be said that without these flaws the second season cannot be as much of a success as it is now had it not taken the opportunity to build upon these flaws and transform them into effective foundations that were both logical and adhered to the story and setting via the use of gradual expansion that emphasised on well-rounded explanation rather than on speed. The overall story for Danmachi can be said to be one of the series main strong points due to both the expansion that it provided to the main cast both physically and mentally and the expansion that it provided to the city of Orario via its use of its two core story arcs. While the first season of the series served well to introduce the series main setting, role and the members of the main cast it for the most part focused on showing how tough the role of being an adventurer within the city of Orario was and how hard it was to make yourself known in a profession that was filled to the brim with talent. However while it succeeded in both showing the challenges that Bell was to face in his quest to get stronger as well as in giving him the opportunity to make his name by taking on and vanquishing an abnormal hostile via his determination and hard-earned abilities this, for the most part, was focused only on the singular journey that Bell went through to get there. As a result of this while we got to see how much Bell had grown both as an adventurer and person we still knew very little of how the rest of the world worked such as how did Familia’s work in practice , how did familia’s interact with each other, what did non-combat staff of such familia’s do and more importantly what effects can they have on the city of Orario.In this I felt that the second season of the series did an excellent job of not just showing the kind of relationships that can exist between familia’s in the form of the extreme levels of arrogance that the likes of Apollo familia show to others under the direction of the infamous god but also of the levels of friendships that can also exist between familia’s due to the shared bonds that can exist between both its members and its gods as shown in the intervention by Micah and Takemikazuuchi’s familia’s as they leaped to the defence of their friend Hestia. While showing the strong bonds that can exist between gods the first arc also did well in showing the level of trust and bonds of friendship and respect that can form between adventurers ones that can serve to persuade them to take the fearful and unusual step of leaving one’s own familia in order to assist a friend that in their eyes have proven themselves as someone that they can depend on and someone that they should do all they can to assist when the time comes as shown in Welf and Mikoto’s actions within the series. With regards to the second question, I felt that while the series did well in showing the kind of roles that noncombatants have within familia’s it also did well in showing the darker side of society that existed within the city of Orario in the form of the pleasure district and the sex industry. This particular arc was one that I really enjoyed as it not only served to introduce this side of society to the viewers but also serve to use this as a foundation from which to introduce the character of Haruhime whose life and struggle to escape her tragic fate and live a life of happiness with friends that she can count on which when combined with Bell and his allies attempts to save her made her arc that much more compelling. Overall in terms of final score I believe that it easily deserves a final score of 8/10 on account of its unique premise, story, character development and its much-needed expansion of its main setting of Orario via its skilful expansion of both the familia system and the kind of things that can lurk beneath the shadows of the city. explore mysterious and dangerous labyrinths were to arrive one day in a land that featured not just challenging dungeons that featured not just challenging monsters but also many adventurers and civilians that needed his aid. Aid that few adventurers would have neither the time nor inclination to provide without sufficient reward being offered such is the nature of adventuring within the land of Orario where fame and prestige take priority over kindness and a desire to support others. In this beautiful but harsh city where an adventurers skills, intelligence and street smarts are what determines how far they get within both the city and their careers and whether or not they can gain the notice of the many gods that live among the adventurers just how far can Bell an adventurer that despite having the skills that allow him to keep himself and his familia above debt go in a land where not all threats are as obvious as a Minotaur trying to smash your face in with a massive club.Adventure themed animes within the anime industry as a whole can be said to be one of the most popular genres’ due largely to the sheer number of world’s and stories that can be visualised into an anime with many notable greats in the past being from this genre. Notable examples include Sword Art Online, Naruto, Fairy Tail, Overlord, Log Horizon and Gate. While each of these series were all excellent ones that created many compelling worlds and scenarios that took great advantage of the settings to create many well designed and developed characters all of these series had one thing that ultimately drove them forward to success which is that of a hero that could lead the casts advance against the stiff odds that the story presents them. The hero can be said to be ultimate driving force behind adventure genre anime as it is by their might and their development as individuals that allow them to succeed in their struggles and allow us as the viewers to see the fruits of their labor's. Within this series our hero is Bell Cranel an adventurer that despite only starting his career months ago has as a result of both his determination, skills and personality have managed to not only increase his prowess as an adventurer but also in the process forming many lasting friendships and bonds with his fellow adventurers that allowed him to not only gain them as fellow familia members but also many allies that he can call upon when he needs it. While the concept of having an adventurer who starts at zero and gradually claws his way to the top through hard work is a common theme among animes what served to draw me to this series was the fact that this journey of Bells was not one that he was embarking on alone for unlike most adventure themed animes that feature strong solo interaction within this series Bell is doing so with the aid of his allies within his familia organisations that mimic what will be called guilds in other series but feature stronger bonds within its confines that are as strong as those of actual families. This sense of seeing Bell not only embarking on a adventure to not only find and conquer challenges within the dungeon and form bonds with like-minded adventurers in the midst of fierce battles while doing so supported by his familia members that he can count on as both backup and emotional support can be said to be the one thing that drew me to this series. The series’ first episode I felt was an excellent one that served to not only reintroduce Bell and his familia allies to the audience after so long but also expand upon the world by showing the kind of powers that gods and their familia’s have on the adventurers that have caught their eye through their actions on the field.The overall story of Is it Wrong to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon follows the life of Bell Cranell a young upcoming adventurer and a member of a small but growing familia called the Hestia Familia that was formed around his goddess and saviour Hestia a god that had come down from the heavens to live within the confines of Orario. Orario a mysterious walled city that is located within the world while a thriving city is one that is rather unremarkable when compared to the many countries that lie outside of it apart from two notable things with the first being that alone among the vast world Orario is the sole location that houses the Dungeon a mysterious labyrinth that is located at the very heart of the city that is occupied by not just powerful monsters but also countless treasures that can change the fortunes of any adventurers that find them should they survive the dungeon first. While the dungeon and its riches can be said to be the first of Orario’s notable traits it is the second trait that can be said to be the clincher that enabled the city to be recognised internationally with this being the sole fact that apart from the dungeon the city also was home to countless goddesses and gods that have descended the heavens in order to collect and raise adventurers to fame and in the process enabling them to have some semblance of fun within the city. This combination of having many brave and enthusiastic adventurers who flock to the city to explore the dungeon hoping to find both treasure and fame and in the process being forced to dance to the whim of the gods that inhabit the city I felt served well to create an excellent maelstrom for Bell and his friends as they sought to carve out an existence within the city of the Dungeon. But one things for certain their journey will be anything but boring.BellBell Cranel portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of The Quintessential Quintuplets and Campione fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A young adventurer that had come to the city of Orario to set about fulfilling his dream of becoming an adventurer that would allow him to fight challenging monsters while meeting and befriending many beautiful woman Bell on initial impressions was shown to be a positive, cheerful and friendly person by nature that unlike the rank of the file of the adventurers that plied the city never hesitated in helping others. While a quiet person that preferred to avoid trouble which within Orario tended to escalate rather quickly Bell was someone that can be said to follow his heart and as a result he is someone that can never turn down the plight of others and indeed will try his utmost to help them even if said quest requires him to go up against steep odds. While this itself can be said to be a flaw that can prove fatal within the life of an adventurer to both his friends and allies and to myself it is the opposite that is rather true for this does well in upholding Bell’s core personality traits of being a kind, understanding and polite person that would approach his assigned quests with both tenacity and a steely determination to succeed at the task which within the series is shown well in his attempt to protect his friends and goddess from the attentions of Apollo familia and his attempt to rescue Haruhime a person that had due to a cruel twist of fate had been prepared to depart this world at an age far too young. While the life of an adventurer can indeed be a hard one depending on the skill set that one chooses it can be said that for Bell his transition from a civilian into a hardworking but nonetheless naive adventurer was anything but a smooth ride thanks to his needs to keep both himself and his own familia afloat while also trying to make a name for himself within the crowded confines of Orario. This itself while certainly a tough issue was also made more daunting by Bell’s tendency to place his trust in others too easily which is a result of Bell’s desire to believe in the goodness of others. While this served to cause Bell to experience many unnecessary trials within Orario it also allowed Bell to learn many valuable life lessons while at the same time allow him to discover and befriend many powerful allies within the city that would prove most useful as Bell’s career took off.As the series progresses and Bell and his allies improve not only their skills as adventurers but also their bonds with each other as well Bell’s personality gradually changes as he gets to both appreciate both the level of fighting prowess that he and his friends have attained after much hard work but also how much their teamwork has allowed them to improve not only the familia itself but also their knowledge of the world around them. While largely retaining his hardworking, friendly and positive nature Bell as a result of both hard-earned knowledge and desperate fights within both the city and the dungeon had learned to be more wary of things that are too good to be true and indeed is more willing to put the needs of the familia in front of his own desires a development that I felt was most appropriate. While still using his cherished grandfathers stories as his main source of motivation to a degree it can be seen that within Bell this has been boasted by the introduction of two more sources of motivation which is to improve his skills so as to allow him to meet and match his idol Aiz Wallenstein  Loki Familia’s top tier adventurer that has the nickname of Kenki which translates into Sword Princess a title that is a testament to both her beauty and her skill with her sword in terms of combat ability and being strong enough to protect each of his friends from harm. While these ideas of his may seem to be ones that are far too difficult to achieve considering the difference in strength this difficulty can be said to be the perfect fuel for Bell’s ambition as to Bell only by learning to surpass his existing skills and learning to improve them will he be able to both achieve his goal and protect his friends from harm a motivation that is shown in full grander within the fierce battles that Bell takes part in within this series. Due largely to both his childhood and his first days within the city Bell was someone that can be said to have an intimate knowledge of how hard life can be when you’re alone and have no friends that can be relied upon to assist you. As a result of this its perhaps unsurprising that Bell is someone that cares greatly about his friends and indeed is shown to be immensely loyal to them and willing to fight hard to protect them on the field. While loyal to his friends Bell was also shown to be somewhat surprisingly perceptive to the mental problems that plague them and is quite capable of narrowing down the issues that are bothering them as shown in his attempts to save Lily from his former guild and Haruhime from her fate.HestiaHestia portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Re Creators fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Bell’s allies within the series. A goddess from the heavens that serves as the head of Hestia familia to which Bell belongs to Hestia on initial impressions is shown to be a positive, cheerful and understanding person by nature that while having the terrifying mood swings that characterised the major goddesses was also shown to be a kind, caring and friendly person that cared deeply about her charges. Due largely to both her stature and of the fact that among her fellows her familia was by far the smallest within Orario Hestia was someone that was shown to be easily triggered at times especially with regards to her fellow goddess Loki the head of the famed Loki familia Orario’s most combat-oriented famila. While often used as comic relief within the series it can be seen that this aspect of hers can be seen as a protective measure of sorts as beneath this Hestia is shown to be fiercely protective of her charges and is ever conscious of them being snatched away by others as shown in the previous season and in Apollo’s arc. While a goddess Hestia as both the patron and the overall leader of the familia is expected to guide it in a desired direction while ensuring that her charges are doing their best for both themselves and for the familia it can be seen that unlike familia’s like Apollo’s Hestia is someone that takes the safety of her charges seriously and while nominally a goddess would be proud of seeing her charges defend her honor it can be seen here that rather the opposite is true for Hestia while grateful to them dislikes seeing them get hurt and indeed is more than willing to simply let the insults fly despite her right to retaliate. While showing how determined she is to keep her charges safe this also shows Hestia’s desire to maintain peace between familia’s and her own desire for peaceful cooperation with others within Orario and thus ensuring that her charges faith and trust in her remain strong.While for the most part, Hestia’s personality traits remain constant throughout the series as the series progresses Hestia’s personality gradually begins to change as she is confronted with new situations that threaten the safety of both her familia and her charges. While normally shown as a relaxed person that avoids interfering with the life of her charges Hestia is shown to be quite capable of being both serious and perceptive to the needs of her charges and is shown to be able to give both wise advice to them while at the same time being able to come up with some surprisingly bold strategies that can serve to both turn the tables on the odds arrayed against her while also lessening the burdens that are affecting her charges. A notable example of this within the series is within the first arc in which Hestia in an effort to aid Bell and Lily took center stage and actively participated in the familia’s efforts to assist Bell during the arc and in the process demonstrating both leadership qualities as well the ability to stay calm and come up with the appropriate strategy to deal with a complex situation without escalating it by making effective use of existing assets.LilyLiliruca Lilusuke Arde portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Maaya Uchida of Goblin Slayer and Charlotte fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Bell’s main allies within the series being a member of his familia. A member of the prum race a near human-like race that have the ability to make use of unique abilities in lieu of their short stature Liliruca who prefers to be simply called Lily from initial appearances is shown to be a quiet, calm and cautious person by nature that prefers to show patience and cunning in situations rather than hot-headed bravado as others would have. Unlike the rank of file of Orario’s inhabitants who are either adventurers that can actively fight on the frontlines or civilians who are able to provide support through the use of shops that sell items that are needed within the dungeon Lily is unique in that she’s somewhere in between for Lily is a supporter. While certainly capable of operating on the field within a party supporters like Lily are seen to lack the high-level combat ability of average adventurers and as a result within the world while they are still treated as members of the party, they are rarely deployed into areas that feature extreme danger. However while Lily may not have the high combat abilities of the likes of Bell or Mikoto Lily makes up for it by being able to not just identify subtle changes in the environment but also be able to determine the best course of action at a given time showing not just excellent perception but also leadership quality that takes great advantage of her calm nature. While a quiet person by nature and even more so in the past when Lily was first introduced to the familia Lily was someone that was kind, caring and loyal and while not one to openly show her feelings to those that she does not trust she is positive and friendly towards those that have genuinely earned her trust through their actions.While shown to be someone that was both mentally strong and able to bond well with others easily via skilful use of friendly banter as well as her own sense of confidence as the series goes on it can be seen that this aspect of Lily’s is something that’s akin to a mask that she uses to protect her heart that’s more fragile than she lets on. Due largely to the painful past that she had with adventurers in the past as well as the time that she had spent as part of other familia’s Lily contrary to her positivity and confidence was someone that can be said to have a complex of sorts as she saw herself as being worthless to others despite the many skills that she can bring to the table. As a result while outwardly trying hard to bond with her friends and to support them the best she can Lily, in the beginning, tried to maintain a set distance between her and her comrades in an effort to stop her misfortune from affecting them despite the fact that it can be seen that she genuinely enjoyed interacting with and fighting alongside them. While this can be seen as an attempt by her to merely protect herself from further pain it can also be interpreted as the opposite as Lily due to the despair and pain that she had experienced in the past with the likes of Soma familia does not wish to see this same aspect being visited upon her comrades in which she places her trust in. However as the series goes on and Lily was forced to not only reveal but also confront this hidden complex that had laid inside her Lily’s personality gradually began to change for the better. Despite the pain that she felt at being forced to go back to her former familia and later seeing the very friends that she had fought so hard to protect from her pain come and attempt to rescue her it can be said that the witnessing of this act can be said to be a strong revelation for her as this showed that despite her attempts to shield herself from them and despite her attempts to deceive them Bell and his friends not only trusted her as a dear comrade but also viewed her as both a valuable friend and ally that was an integral part of their familia.As a result of such a revelation Lily was forced to realise that despite all of her attempts to deceive them that in actuality Bell and his comrades had only known of her pain and just as she had sought to protect them they in turn had also sought to do the same by giving her the time that she needed in order to find the right moment to tell them the truth a revelation that while strong also turned out to be the perfect key that would unlock the locks that Lily had installed around her heart and allow her to not only realise her own foolishness but also open her eyes to the fact that genuine friendship that is formed around strong bonds of trust, care and consideration of others do exist in this world and that rather than try to avoid it like she had in the past she should instead learn to embrace it. An attitude that not only allowed Lily to make peace with her own pain but also allow her to open up the next chapter in her life and allow her to embrace her new role as a member of Hestia Familia and her role as the familia’s strategist where her now trademarked calmness and her desire to protect her friends and familia will be of best use.HaruhimeHaruhime Sanjouno portrayed by veteran seiyuu singer Haruka Chisuga of Asterisk War and Alderamin of the sky fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Bell’s allies within the series. A member of the renard race a race that resembles human-like foxes that are native to the eastern lands Haruhime on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, kind and curious person by nature that despite her role as a prostitute is shown to be an attentive, polite and pleasant person that works hard at her given role despite the stigma that such a role applies within society. However while a prostitute Haruhime was shown to be someone that was also perceptive both on a personal level and a city level an aspect that I felt matched well with the image that woman of her role would know of what the true realities of their operating area are like. However despite being a member of that trade Haruhime unlike her sisters was shown to be someone that did not quite embrace her role and indeed can be said to maintain an aura of innocence in that she still clung to a fondness for children’s fairy tales that she had possessed as children. This love of and indeed fascination of such tales while serving well as the spiritual foundation that enables her to live her life freely without feeling pressured into changing it can also be seen as a double-edged sword of sorts however as within the same tales that she adores the role of prostitutes can also be seen as a harbinger of disaster to the hero’s of such tales. As a result this within her created a sense of complex in which while she desires freedom from her role she is also hesitant in calling upon others to help her achieve this as to her she is a tainted individual that will only serve to bring ruin to the hero’s that will try to save her which is shown in her extreme reluctance to have Bell help her.However, as the series goes on and Haruhime gets to see both the effects that her fate has on both Bell and her long-lost friend Mikoto Haruhime’s personality gradually begins to change. In the beginning of the series as a result of her status within her familiar and the shame that she felt that came from it Haruhime while certainly attentive and accommodating to all she encountered was someone that was noted to have very low self esteem and as a result was shown to be someone that had few friends within the familiar with the notable exceptions being Aisha and her closest advisers. She was also noted to not have a very clear idea on the path that she should take in life. Indeed at this point of her life Haruhime can be said to wish for nothing more than a clear purpose be given for her fate one that she hopes will somehow release her from it. However even when set on such a path it can be seen that Haruhime actually sees this decision of hers to be her’s alone and that no one but her should suffer the fate that she had chosen as evidenced by her desperate attempts to stop Bell and Mikoto from trying to save her by fighting her familia comrades. This attitude of wanting to find a purpose in life that will allow her to both serve her familia in a large capacity while also granting her the release from her fate that she had desired for so long while serving as her main source of motivation with her arc begins to gradually unravel as a result of her encounter with a lone adventurer that she had met by chance that of Bell Cranel. Unlike most adventurers who only ever visited her for pleasure Bell Cranel was different in that he was only here to seek sanctuary and not pleasure. At first though only seeing Bell as just another customer as Haruhime got to interact with him she saw to her surprise that unlike other adventurers who were boastful and did not take the time to understand the plight of others Bell was different in that he was not only attentive and willing to listen to her thoughts but also have an interest that he shared with her which is the love of fairy tales. For Haruhime the meeting of Bell can be said to be of something akin to a miracle for her as for the first time she was able to find someone from the outside that was not only sympathetic to her plight but also willing to help her break out of fate by for the first time in her life introduce the shining rays of hope that she had until now thought was impossible for her to see. As a result Haruhime while still retaining her quiet nature and a determination to protect the lives of others also starts to change becoming visibly braver and determined both to let go of her fixation on her role as a prostitute and also for the first time in her life try and select the path that she wants to take in her life.The character of Haruhime I thought was a well designed and developed character with her evolution from a quiet young woman who had resigned herself to her fate to someone that not only realised just how much having friends that she can count on for advice was but also on the kind of warmth, direction and purpose that they can introduce into one’s life and her resulting change in attitude as she sought to change her fate being especially well done.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the character designs for the series while remaining faithful to source material also did well in showing the development that each member of the familia has been through as a result of their success back in the first season. Environment wise while it was nice to see the streets of Orario again after so long I felt that the series also did well in creating unique environments for the series two story arcs that were both impressive in conception as well as giving the impression that in each case the stakes for Bell and his friends are higher than before with the castle that served as the opposing stronghold  for Apollo’s war game arc and the pleasure district that served as the main operating area for Ishtar Familia being notable examples. In terms of combat animations I felt that while each of the battles in which Bell takes part in were well designed and animated and featured excellent blends of action, tension and determination that the series also took great care to show that while Bell’s ability has rapidly improved as a result of the hard work that he had put in this was something that he didn’t do alone and indeed no matter how strong he is Bell is unable to take on upper-level adventurers easily a fact that is painfully reminded upon Bell by the countless adversaries that he faces in this season. However this in turn is offset by the fact that Bell is not fighting alone anymore and indeed Bell is now fighting alongside allies and friends that decided to join his family because they like countless other inhabitants of Orario was impressed and inspired by actions of an adventurer who despite having no need to have over the cause of his early days fought hard to protect countless innocents from harm and show to the world that no matter your origins and motivations as long as one fights hard they will be able to help protect others. While doing well in showing the strong unique skills and abilities that each member of the familia possessed this act of fighting alongside Bell to help him achieve his quest I felt also served to underpin one of the series main themes of each familia being more of a close-knit family that was connected by genuine bonds of friendship, trust, and mutual respect rather than the more conventional bonds that are found in standard guilds.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme respectively which was Hello to Dream that was performed by veteran seiyuu singer Yuka Iguchi and Sasayakana Shukusai that was performed by Sora Tob Sakana a newly formed idol group. These two songs I felt while both impressive in their own right conveyed within me different types of feelings that I felt matched the series tone with the former being a positive and upbeat song that gave the impression that while being an adventurer within Orario was hard and that each new foray into the dungeon will be a hard one each new day while bringing the potential for doom also brings with it an opportunity to not only improve your skills but also improve the bonds that you share with your familia members as well as the inhabitants of Orario that you interact within your daily lives for no matter your standing in Orario the connections that you forge also affects the lives of countless others that have met you. The ending theme in contrast, however, was different in that to me it conveyed a more relaxing feel due to its tone that gave the impression that after a day of adventuring within the dungeon that it’s time to unwind and enjoy your time with your friends in the nearest café. While the two songs were markedly different in the emotions that they conveyed I felt that the two songs contrasting effects worked well in this case as they showed that while an adventurers life within the walled city of Orario will be a tough one’s life will be easier if you were to seek and form bonds with like-minded allies and learn to fight together within the dungeons effectively while endeavouring to learn more about them in the safe confines of your home base after you return from a hard days foray into the dungeon. In terms of voice acting I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular I feel that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Inori Minase, Maaya Uchida and Haruka Chisuga all did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Bell Cranel, Hestia, Lily, and Haruhime respectively with Haruka Chisuga’s portrayal of Haruhime deserving of special praise as I felt that her performance was spectacular. While the characters of Freya, Eina and Mikoto weren’t given as much expansion in the series as the main cast was I also felt that their assigned seiyuu’s of Yoko Hikasa, Haruka Tomatsu, and Chinatsu Akasaki all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters who within the series provided Bell and his allies with some excellent if sometimes uncalled for support.Overall conclusionOverall I felt that Is It wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon’s second season was an excellent series that had among its strong points in my opinion being its unique premise, excellent story, well designed and developed characters, excellent voice acting and its unique take on the kinds of actions and environments that can exist in within seemingly stable locations like Orario. As with most animes that have additional seasons the second season of Damachi owes a portion of its success in my eyes to the foundations that were established by the first season of the series that aired back in Spring 2015 and while the first season itself was one that I really enjoyed it was not one that was not completely flawless in its execution. However it can be said that without these flaws the second season cannot be as much of a success as it is now had it not taken the opportunity to build upon these flaws and transform them into effective foundations that were both logical and adhered to the story and setting via the use of gradual expansion that emphasised on well-rounded explanation rather than on speed. The overall story for Danmachi can be said to be one of the series main strong points due to both the expansion that it provided to the main cast both physically and mentally and the expansion that it provided to the city of Orario via its use of its two core story arcs. While the first season of the series served well to introduce the series main setting, role and the members of the main cast it for the most part focused on showing how tough the role of being an adventurer within the city of Orario was and how hard it was to make yourself known in a profession that was filled to the brim with talent. However while it succeeded in both showing the challenges that Bell was to face in his quest to get stronger as well as in giving him the opportunity to make his name by taking on and vanquishing an abnormal hostile via his determination and hard-earned abilities this, for the most part, was focused only on the singular journey that Bell went through to get there. As a result of this while we got to see how much Bell had grown both as an adventurer and person we still knew very little of how the rest of the world worked such as how did Familia’s work in practice , how did familia’s interact with each other, what did non-combat staff of such familia’s do and more importantly what effects can they have on the city of Orario.In this I felt that the second season of the series did an excellent job of not just showing the kind of relationships that can exist between familia’s in the form of the extreme levels of arrogance that the likes of Apollo familia show to others under the direction of the infamous god but also of the levels of friendships that can also exist between familia’s due to the shared bonds that can exist between both its members and its gods as shown in the intervention by Micah and Takemikazuuchi’s familia’s as they leaped to the defence of their friend Hestia. While showing the strong bonds that can exist between gods the first arc also did well in showing the level of trust and bonds of friendship and respect that can form between adventurers ones that can serve to persuade them to take the fearful and unusual step of leaving one’s own familia in order to assist a friend that in their eyes have proven themselves as someone that they can depend on and someone that they should do all they can to assist when the time comes as shown in Welf and Mikoto’s actions within the series. With regards to the second question, I felt that while the series did well in showing the kind of roles that noncombatants have within familia’s it also did well in showing the darker side of society that existed within the city of Orario in the form of the pleasure district and the sex industry. This particular arc was one that I really enjoyed as it not only served to introduce this side of society to the viewers but also serve to use this as a foundation from which to introduce the character of Haruhime whose life and struggle to escape her tragic fate and live a life of happiness with friends that she can count on which when combined with Bell and his allies attempts to save her made her arc that much more compelling. Overall in terms of final score I believe that it easily deserves a final score of 8/10 on account of its unique premise, story, character development and its much-needed expansion of its main setting of Orario via its skilful expansion of both the familia system and the kind of things that can lurk beneath the shadows of the city."", ""Review: This season of Danmachi is fire compared to season 1 this is definitely much greater didn't get bored in any episode still has the great sword fight animations with a big serious turn in the series, now we can guess the possible end goal of the series as Bell ranking up to defeat the Black Dragon, there is some things ii did find bad this season which is the cut contents like why Yamato is still in the Hestia familia and that scene where the importance of a familia in episode 6 i think or 5 which makes me give it a 8/10 almost...a 9 but has too much cut content that would make some plot holes fixed.

The second season of this anime had thousands of fans including myself hoping for a continuation of events that had happened in season one.Our M.C Bell Cranel and his goddess of his familia Hestia have created a strong familia that anyone would want to be a part of, both within the anime and as a viewer. The creator Fujino Ōmori developed the manga and had the first episode...of the anime air on April 4th and continued until June 27th, 2015.An OVA was released on December 7, 2016 called DanMachi Sword Oratoria takes place during the first season, but with a small twist. Instead of focusing on Bell, the season is based on our heroin of the series Aiz Wallenstine. DanMachi Sword Oratoria reveals information behind Aiz\'s actions and why she decides to train Bell and her true reasoning for being interested in Bell\'s growth.In this second season, Bell fights some of his toughest battles he\'s ever encountered. During these encounters, Bell has once again faced death, new frightening gods and goddesses, and even gained the respect of someone who once wanted nothing to do with him. Although this second season didn\'t go as \'I\' would\'ve made it, it still turned out to be a pretty solid anime in the end.

Danmachi S1 was such an enjoyable watch and episode 8 of the first season was the episode I fell in love with Bell while S2 was more about establishing the familia but most of the characters are sidelined and was given all to Bell, Mikoto was decently developed buut the rest were sidelined which was a dissapointment. ', 'minor spoiler includedThe Anime Isn\'t Quite As I Expected. It seems rushed which resulted in being bland. even tho the anime name is literally ""how to pick up girls in the dungeon""we haven\'t seen any major dungeon-fighting scenes yet and i don\'t think there will be any considering the new arc and the episodes remaining. Not only that but also bell\'s overpowered skill(liares freese i think ) which boosts his growth rate made the story completely awful making him stronger than the guy who beat the shit out of him in the prior day resulting for his ascending to level 3 in a matter of...month which is ridiculous. TBH, I expected to see more of character development not more of his haremIn ConclusionThe Anime Story Is Very Good But it is not executed well which completely destroyed my hopes and expectations. I think only the retarded will give the story a 10 month which is ridiculous.

The story starts some time  after where season 1 ended and characters have since gained some strength for the upcoming challenges to come and with that giving less screen time for the actual dungeoncrawling, which is good since this seasons point isn\'t to become strong, it\'s being able to stand up to the challenges that have fallen on Bell due to his fast growth.We see a lot of conflict between familias compared to what we saw in season 1. This gives highlight to other ""rival"" characters to come and expand our known power policies in...the world of Orario itself. The Gods itself have more role in this season than the last where they were just kinda sitting back and just cheering their familias on, but now there is competition and strategy to try to win more area and money to expand the familia and rise in power.

Yea Hestia is still in love with Bell and keeps forgetting some obvious things and get in trouble for it, yeah Bell is still a virgin that is throughoutly helpless to talk to girls and shit, but yet it still doesn\'t have the same energy nor the ring to it that made the first season enjoyable.Overall this season didn\'t quite reach the levels to be a fun and enjoyable watch and dropped to leave a mediocre impression that left me a bit dissappointed. the world of Orario itself.

The main part is about the characters and their development. Bell Cranel. He does not change at all, through out the whole story and that is something that is annoying. It feels forced the way he acts for the story to progress and it gets tiring after awhile. That's mainly my biggest grudge and why I get angry watching it because it's easy to see how the story progresses but it's...not enjoyable if it's the same indecisive character having the same dilemma all the time. The first season was him overcoming himself and not being scared anymore but it feels like he has gone back to the start. If you have seen up to episode 8 you might understand what I mean.Except my rant about character development i've enjoyed the art and the sound, the story has been alright but just that alot in there that could've been better but its doable. not enjoyable if it's the same indecisive character having the same dilemma all the time.

I still found it plenty entertaining, and with as much as I enjoyed the war between families arc, I wasn\'t super big on the Ishtar arc, and felt that it dragged on a bit too long for me.Story: As I prefaced, I really enjoyed the first arc of season two, and covering the war between the two familias. I thought the action, and pacing was good, and generally speaking, found myself looking forward to the next episode each week. After that though, they...spun into the arc involving the Ishtar familiia. While I enjoyed the voluptuous women of that family, minus the toad woman, I just didn\'t feel super engaged in the story that transpired there, and often found myself just kinda watching the episodes to get through it.Art: The art was solid. The characters were vibrant and well drawn as they were in the first season, if not better in my opinion. I think the animation was solid as well. I didn\'t notice any kind of a fall off in this department from S1, and at times thought it was better.Sound: Similar to the first season of Danmachi, the OP didn\'t really captivate me. The voice acting was fine, and the soundtrack seemed decent, didn\'t really find anything mindblowing in this regard of the anime. Neither good nor bad.Characters: I always enjoyed the characters in the world of Danmachi. I love the unique personalities of each of the gods/goddesses, as well as their children. Not to mention everyone in Hestias family, and their back stories, or reasoning for being a part of it. I think the characters in particular, with this series, have always been very well done.Enjoyment: This was hard to rate, because I enjoyed everything AROUND the Ishtar arc, at about the same level that I enjoyed S1 of Danmachi, but, I just couldn\'t get into the Ishtar family storyline (no pun intended).

Hell, I have rewatched Season 1 when Bell killed his first Minotaur at least 20 times. Don't think there is a single thing in this season so far I am itching to rewatch or gives me an emotion.This sequel is a reminder...of how J.C Staff operates and a reason I'm starting to quit watching all of their anime.

It's a flawed show that a lot of people would probably call trashy, but at the end of the day it's entertaining, and that's what counts.The biggest problem with this season isn't that there are too many waifus or that the show is trashy or any other complaint I could bring up. It's that the pacing is breakneck, and a lot of essential content from the LN is skipped over. Events that should've taken two episodes were condensed into 1. Characters motivations are made paper-thin because some of them...are given barely any screen time. Even as an LN -reader, I had a hard time keeping track of all the characters because so many of them are given almost no screen time. The worst part is that the payoff to certain events feels wholly neutered. Some of my absolute favorite scenes from the LN were cut-out entirely or drastically changed, and it ruined moments that should have been climatic. The story's result is the same, but the impact is significantly lessened and makes the entire experience less satisfying.Now I'm not saying that if they had followed the LN more closely that this season would've been a masterpiece because I have criticisms of the LN's as well. But I do think it would have elevated this season to be at least as good as the first.I'm vaguely hopeful the second half of this season will be more representative of the original content, in which case I will alter this review to reflect that. are given barely any screen time.

The story's result is the same, but the impact is significantly lessened and makes the entire experience less satisfying.Now I'm not saying that if they had followed the LN more closely that this season would've been a masterpiece because I have criticisms of the LN's as well. But I do think it would have elevated this season to be at least as good as the first.I'm vaguely hopeful the second half of this season will be more representative of the original content, in which case I will alter this review to reflect that."", 'How long ago was Season 1, four years?\xa0 Something about that time gap feels wrong.\xa0 Well anyway, what do have this time?\xa0 Rescue plot, rescue plot...and rescue plot.\xa0 Alright who came up with this plot structure?Story:Continuing the story of the adventurer Bell Cranel, Danmachi II gives the mental equivalent of what our main character was given during Season 1 to push Bell towards becoming the hero that Orario needs.\xa0 But instead of making him fight a bigger and badder creature each week/few weeks, Bell is now given the arduous task of saving various girls, both new and old from different gods that want/need them for...various reasons.\xa0 Because if there\'s anything that heroes are known for, it\'s saving damsels in distress.And that\'s...pretty much all the story for Danmachi this time really is.\xa0 Focusing primarily on two arcs, those being the War Game and Haruhime arc, a lot of what we see for the show has Bell acting as the knight in shining armor in order to challenge what the gods in those respective arcs aim to do.\xa0 The upside to this change of pace comes in the form of Orario itself, as less of the series is focused on the dungeon and the going ons inside the hostile work environment of the adventurers, and more on the structure and design of the overworld that until this point (including Sword Oratoria) was only the series\'s backdrop for where the characters lived.\xa0 Worldbuilding exponentially grows because of the constant change in location for the story beats, and things such as relationships between gods and adventurers, the politics of the Guild, entire areas of Orario, and even places outside of the city start feeding in and painting a larger picture.The downside to this however is that these expository parts of the show are really only there to give intrigue to the otherwise repetitive story.\xa0 Compared to Season 1, Bell doesn\'t have any sort of concrete motivation that carries him throughout the season to be fighting against the adversity he faces.\xa0 The War Game forces him into fighting so his autonomy as a character is basically non-existent because he has no choice, and the Haruhime arc has him fight to save her because...she looked sad and needed saving?\xa0 There\'s not really a clear motivation beyond the terrible things that were eventually going to be done to the current damsel, so I struggle to find much reason beyond that there.\xa0 The last few episodes are the most egregious of the lot in terms of storytelling because it feels half-assed and they honestly should\'ve just ended it at the Haruhime arc where it at least feels like there\'s a satisfying end.Really Danmachi II feels more like a spectacle to watch rather than any kind of interesting story worth investing into.\xa0 The story of Bell is quite flashy and sometimes genuinely terrifying thanks to the show\'s improved atmosphere, expanded overworld, and varied action scenes involving either tactics or straight hand to hand combat.\xa0 However its lacking areas stick out more a sore thumb, having almost no variety in the story of this adventurer becoming hero, substituting its previous plot of \'saving the girl\' with a climactic fight with a different flavor of \'saving the girl\' with a climactic fight in the very next arc.Characters:I don\'t hate Bell...I just hate what the series DOES with Bell.\xa0 Because Bell is seen to be this optimistic guy who does all of the typical shonen things of saving his friends and getting flustered any time one of the seven some-odd girls (including several immortal goddesses) in the series hit on him, a lot of what ends up happening in the show is watching him find new ways to run away or a new person to run away from because he\'s flustered.\xa0 Hell it\'s even written in the series that he\'s immune to being charmed, so any fucking attempt to seduce him becomes a pointless waste of screentime on the same charade we\'ve seen so many times elsewhere.\xa0 And it\'s a shame because I feel like Bell could actually be a good protagonist.\xa0 His climactic moments feel warranted and feel like he\'s pushing through his adversity up to the point he lands the finishing blow.\xa0 It\'s just that prior to that, not enough I feel is done to make the climax of each arc worth being wholly invested into.With the exception of Lili and I guess Hestia, a majority of Bell\'s affiliates become lesser footnotes on the series as characters that push Bell towards the climax, basically acting as characters that give Bell a clear path to fight the final boss.\xa0 Lili and Hestia are only different since both of them show up with either their own mini arcs that coincide with the main plot of the series, or just overall have more screentime than most other characters.\xa0 It\'s kind of a shame since both Bell\'s relationship with Ais and the various lesser gods featured more prominently in the show are a breath of fresh air when we\'re not watching the scared bunny rabbit run away from all of the female attention he gets.New characters (of note) this time feature members of both the Apollo and Ishtar familia with the Ishtar familia being the far more interesting one due to their contribution to the series\'s worldbuilding as one of the strongest familias in Orario.\xa0 They mostly serve as the antagonists for Danmachi II, so what we see is pretty much all we ever get of them.Among them is Haruhime Sanjouno, a character who I\'ve been anticipating for a while since I learned of her existence in the series.\xa0 Now I really like Haruhime.\xa0 Personally I find her to be very cute and a pleasant contrast to the otherwise loud and rambunctious atmosphere that surrounds her in this series.\xa0 That being said, Haruhime isn\'t really a great character.\xa0 She fits the damsel in distress who\'s hoping for a hero mold so perfectly that honestly if she didn\'t, she wouldn\'t have much of a presence in the series.\xa0 And that\'s self evident with how little she contributes to the story in the two episodes after her time in the spotlight is over.\xa0 She just feels like wasted potential and hardly any effort is made to grow her character any more than what\'s established.Aesthetics:J.C. Staff\'s art this time isn\'t really all that stellar.\xa0 Not a lot has changed in the overall quality between Season 1 and 2, and that to me is kind of a weird considering I\'d expect maybe something to be better considering Danmachi was and still is quite a profitable series.But there are things that do improve.\xa0 Because the atmosphere for the series is surprisingly darker with themes of sexual abuse and some EXTREMELY unsettling characters that uncomfortably lust after Bell (seriously what is up with everyone and this one fourteen year old kid?), a number of shots in the series paint horrifying and more grotesque images than I thought was really possible in this series.\xa0 I wouldn\'t necessarily call it an upgrade from what was pre-established before with what we\'ve seen before in the show, but it\'s definitely a surprising change of pace nonetheless.\xa0 Just please never bring those characters back because Bell\'s chastity would be the least of this series\'s problems if that happened.Yuka Iguchi\'s ""HELLO to DREAM"" is a song that I find to be on par if not slightly better than its Season 1 predecessor.\xa0 Admittedly neither songs are really all that memorable or noteworthy to begin with, but I prefer the tones of ""HELLO to DREAM"" better, especially with the OP\'s picturesque shots of the Orario Spire in the middle of town in the sunset at the beginning.In contrast, sora tob sakana\'s ""Sasayakana Shukusai"" is a weird, ill-fitting jazzy song that does not fit with Danmachi at all.\xa0 I blame this more on the fact that a lot of episodes end on a cliffhanger, so immediately cutting to a shot of Hestia staring off into the window while loud band jazz starts playing is a jarring tone shift if I\'ve ever seen one.\xa0 It\'s not bad, but I really think they should\'ve gone with something else instead of...this.Personal Enjoyment:I think I\'m just kind of disappointed with Danmachi at this point.\xa0 Season 1 did not bode well for the series since despite its popularity, it wasn\'t really something that was a great sticking point since the show was just average in the grand scheme of things.\xa0 And Sword Oratoria being the supposed darker spin-off that followed the Loki Familia in conjunction with the events of the main story relied way too heavily on its spunky elf mage to pull the show instead of the actually interesting Sword Princess or story.\xa0 While I\'ve yet to see the Artemis movie, the things I\'ve read on it don\'t paint a pretty picture either.So what does this spell for Danmachi II?\xa0 Well I did enjoy parts of it.\xa0 Any moment where Bell is given a true badass moment feels really good even if there\'s a lot of empty weight behind the final attack, and Haruhime is just a character I\'ve grown fond of even if she\'s kind of empty and just contributes to the growing number of women around Bell.\xa0 Not only that, but the worldbuilding is actually pretty good and developing Orario as a kind of independent city-state is one of the better things this series has done with itself in a long time.But beyond that, there aren\'t that many things to note.\xa0 The last two episodes feel like needless conflict and both of the season\'s featured plots are jumpstarted for stupid reasons with only Haruhime\'s arc being the one that feels the most complete and most appropriate with the themes and mental fortitude they were going for with turning Bell into a hero.My suggestion more or less boils down to watching it if you\'re a fan of Danmachi or you\'re not too bothered by mediocre storytelling.\xa0 It\'s difficult to claim much else about Danmachi II since so many things about it are style over substance and each good thing it does has it shoot itself in the foot with something meh, average, or just detrimental to the series.\xa0 It\'s still entertaining to a point with a surprising amount of genuinely uncomfortable scenes about it, but looking for anything beyond that I feel is asking for a bit much. various reasons.\xa0 Because if there\'s anything that heroes are known for, it\'s saving damsels in distress.And that\'s...pretty much all the story for Danmachi this

From the early episodes, it becomes apparent that the word \'dungeon\' is merely a misleading facade, a tempting bait to attract audiences seeking captivating explorations and puzzling mysteries to solve.Instead, we are immersed in a narrative that seems more focused on social interactions and relationships between characters than actual expeditions. While some may appreciate this aspect, those expecting genuine dungeon exploration are likely to be disappointed. The few moments when the protagonists set foot in a dungeon are quickly...rushed and sorely lack intensity and complexity.The disappointment extends to the characters, whose development remains rather superficial. Their relationships often come across as clichéd and predictable, lacking genuine emotional depth. It would have been more satisfying to see psychological progression and evolution in their motivations, but the story prefers to focus on mundane interactions and scenes with little impact.The lack of a compelling plot and real stakes is felt throughout the series. Narrative arcs unfold without coherent connections, giving the impression that the writers are improvising as they go, without a clear overall vision. When plot twists do occur, they are foreseeable and fail to generate excitement for the viewer.Despite these numerous flaws, the animation and visual quality are top-notch, providing beautiful backgrounds and well-executed action sequences.

The art, sound, and characters were exactly how I imagined it to be. It might even be a bit better. The fighting effects shown during the war between Hestia and Apollo and the Killing Stone episodes were really amazing and captivating.However, as amazing it was for Bell to train and win the war against Apollo and as cool it was for Bell to save Haruhime, this season did not build much character development, nor did it play a role in the overaching story. Bell has...only gotten a little bit stronger, but I honestly learned nothing about the other characters. They did not play a significant role in this season while they did in the first season. The relationships between any two characters have not changed either. You could skip the entire season and still know what is going on in the next season.With that being said, there is an allusion to a third season at the end of episode 12 because they introduced a new character.

After all, most anime sequels or second seasons aren\'t so much a second story but a continuation of the same material. And sometimes that material isn\'t as similar to the prior material.The first season of ""Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?"" was an example of source material adapted in a way that made it suitable for anime. If your reading this, you\'ve probably seen it. If you haven\'t, go watch it and try to not read too much about it. But...it ends in a way that feels like a natural ending point for a season. I didn\'t actually watch it until this season was already finished, so i\'m not sure how big the excitement for s2 was, or if it met that. I\'ll not i\'ve not touched the source novels at all yet, so i\'m only judging for the anime itself. And technically this is the third season, since sword oratoria exists, which basically covers the s1 timeline from the loki familia perspective.This season starts off in a dungeon, but surprisingly the dungeon only appears as a backdrop this season. And in the first few minutes, bell and his party leave the dungeon and get taunted by a strange familia. And that begins an arc which lasts for the first 4 episodes. And so the season begins, and hits it\'s peak.And after this we get what feels like a filler episode, and then it\'s another arc which is one that definitely divides opinions. This one feels like it changes it\'s focus a few times, but by the last couple of eps, it\'s definitely another hit.After that, the last 2 episodes seem to be setting up for another arc, which is what s3 will cover.But is it actually good?Yes*The thing is, the first 2 arcs feel like they could have been 6+ episodes, so when they are only 4/5 episodes it feels like a few things could have been slowed down. But if they have actually rushed things as much as novel readers say, then they\'ve kept the pacing follow-able unlike some recent rushed novel adaptions.The art for this season is generally typical danmachi, though it does feel a bit weaker than s1 and sword oratoria. Given the amount of projects by the studio in early 2019 though, it feels ok. Hype moments feel hype and the character art is still fully on-model. Could definitely be better, but it\'s not bad.The sound is pretty much the same as the first season, with some of the old tracks being kept and used pretty appropriately. It\'s nothing new though. The op is a decent song, with some pleasant visuals that look a lot better than both previous ops. The ed is pretty average, both song and visuals.So is it actually worth watching? Probably. If the expectation was more dungeoning and monsters, mostly not, though there is one notable ""monster"" later on. But if you expected more hestia familia, or just enjoyed the series for what it was, i\'d say so.And plus, there is s3 coming out, so there is always that to consider. it ends in a way that feels like a natural ending point for a season.

So I think that they might have rushed this season.Art 7/10- The art is kept the same nothing bad about it. Everyone looked clear and there wasn't any drop in quality within it.Sound 7/10- I will give that the Dub sounded a bit better than before and that Opening and ending were ok.Character 7/10- For characters, there weren't many that you need to know since most of them were just villains who were will be forgotten either way. Also, I think Bell has not gotten much character development during this season which kinda is disappointing as I wanted to see him maybe stronger or braver.Enjoyment 6/10- I don't think there wasn't that much enjoyment in this season, there more action than before but I didn't really have much care in them which was quite disappointing as season 1 actually hyped me up but this season didn't show that.Overall 7/10- I'll give it a 7 for trying but I think it would be better if it was slowly paced and instead rushed. It was good at some parts but didn't really reach my expectations for it. I hope that next season can be a bit better the relationship between Goddess and a human.

Also, I think Bell has not gotten much character development during this season which kinda is disappointing as I wanted to see him maybe stronger or braver.Enjoyment 6/10- I don't think there wasn't that much enjoyment in this season, there more action than before but I didn't really have much care in them which was quite disappointing as season 1 actually hyped me up but this season didn't show that.Overall 7/10- I'll give it a 7 for trying but I think it would be better if it was slowly paced and instead rushed. It was good at some parts but didn't really reach my expectations for it. I hope that next season can be a bit better"", 'I really liked the first season and were hyped for another swing into this series, especially after the first season ended so strongly. The second season could be called more of the same, but the truth is that it is definitely less of the same, and most of what exists is a mistake that should not be watched by anyone.The first casualty of this season is the pacing. The amount of story in this season could have been packed into half the length without a problem. It\'s not that there aren\'t thing happening on the screen - it\'s just that most of it is irrelevant...or backtracking. Honestly the first arc is pretty enjoyable even though it is still relatively weak, but the second half just drags on forever.Awkward pacing might have been ok, I mean the characters are still the same one we like from the first series right? Sadly in this season many characters have been reduced into pastisches of themselves, but even worse are the new characters. The worst offender is the ""ugly woman"". I don\'t know what to say, it\'s a most blatantly sexist depiction of an ugly woman that thinks herself sexier than anyone else, that rapes people to death and is meant to disgust us.It takes a truly stupid man to write a woman as badly as this. ""Why, this woman is ugly, but of course she thinks herself prettier than everyone else despite everyone around her being disgusted by her looks. Since she is so ugly that nobody likes her she has to rape people instead. I guess she also murders her hehe lovers hehe, because ugly women are evil.""I guess the one who should be shamed is the author of the Light Novel, but whoever adapted this could have changed this up with little effort - making a bolder and more interesting adaptation, but they didn\'t. So the producers and scriptwriters bear blame as well for creating this disgusting excuse of an anime.Let\'s talk about the framing of prostitution as well, while we\'re at it. The MC meets a girl that he wants to help out of prostitution, but the way they talk about her being in prostitution is that it has somehow ruined her and that MC, since he wants to be a hero, can\'t hang out with prostitutes cause they will be his ruination or something like that, like a prostitute being the antithesis of a hero.But hey! The MC wants to save prostitute anyway which shows that this is a misconception in her mind, right? SPOILER WARNING It turns out that she actually never had sex because she fainted  every time before she could initiate intercourse with a customer, soo she\'s not a ""real prostitute"". It undermines the entire point and makes it seem that, yes, actually it IS immoral to be a prostitute. (On a side note, this character isn\'t very interesting in herself, but that seems minor compared to the rest).So yeah, this anime has some pretty shit values.What\'s good? Well, the art is pretty good and voice acting isn\'t bad. Probably not worth the aneurysm. or backtracking.

I loved the plot and the dungeon exploring and how little of a harem it was. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for Danmachi season 2; in fact, it was the exact opposite. There was no dungeon exploring (you know, the purpose of season 1) and this season slowly but surely (unfortunately) became an unwatchable harem. You are introduced into characters that you don't care about, characters that don't matter, and to be honest, characters where  the anime would actually be better without. Don't even get me started with Hestia and how unlikable she...gets in this season. Season 1 left us with high hopes, unfortunately, it all went downhill.-Spacecraft555 UwU gets in this season. Season 1 left us with high hopes, unfortunately, it all went downhill.-Spacecraft555 UwU"", ""I gave this anime a shot because I remember watching its prequel when I was a freshman in high school. However, looking at its prequel, I don't really see anything special. The plot is very predictable, the pacing is slow, and the characters are very one-dimensional. There is very little growth in characters and nothing significant happened so far. The biggest issue I have with the anime is the MC. Even with bland characters, if the MC has a strong and unique personality, it can save an anime. However, Bell is as generic as it gets. This stereotypical MC personality is one I can't watch...without getting frustrated. I recommend Magi over this. without getting frustrated.

The anime is simple but has charm.What awaited me in the second season was something different. The season starts normally, you face a family fight and that\'s about it. Although the structure was subtle, the whole competition turned out to be rather disappointing. And if that wasn\'t enough, the remaining 70% of the season is focused on the conflict with a second family.And these practically only try to achieve irrelevant goals and at the...same time, they are trying to rape the protagonists and turn them into their sex slaves.

As they strive to become stronger, they uncover secrets about their world and confront powerful adversaries in exhilarating battles./Review is based only on the anime and not the manga/novels!/I am someone who likes to wait a very long time for something to come out and then binge watch the series instead of watching it and then wait. To say the least compared to the first season Danmachi II was a good low blow for me. Trought out the whole...12 episodes we have good girl picking all right but almost 0 dungeon, the whole “Adventure type” went out of the window as there is zero to no actual adventures in this season but rather obstacles, the opening presentation also doesn’t help this anime as the whole opening contains more dungeon scenes than the 12 episodes into one.Story 7/10So given my opening line you could wander why I am giving the story such a high score. The only reason – I liked the story around Haruhime but everything else was just total – meh. If the story is looked without the idea of having a dungeon in there, it wasn’t that bad of a story. The wavering of Bell between the idea of starting a new war between familias and wanting to save Haruhime and acting alone with Mikoto was a good take and we get to see more of the other supporting characters and one of the more interesting ones in my opinion. Lili also gets to have her past involved again and gets a good resolvent from the ordeal. And the finally moving pieces towards and actual familia and not just two people army was also a good drive.Characters 5/10Hestia and Bell take all of the points out for this category. They literally are stuck in one and the same place as the first season. Bell continues to waver between choices too much, his character seems too weak to be main protagonist, everyone and everything helps him and he just never seems to get much growth.Mikoto is an interesting character and she just doesn’t het the development she deserves.Haruhime was not a bad character, considering her ordeal and what she went through she wasn’t portraited badly. However, I think that the conclusion that she wasn’t actually a prostitute even tho this was a point that drove so much of the plot ruined her character entirely and made her she a weak meddling and that doesn’t know and hasn’t lived at all. Something about making all those characters virgins and pure just because they are around Bell is very off putting and too childish, considering the audience.Apolo/Tod woman were the most annoying things ever which for me speaks a good written character because they can actually drive some kind of a plot around them and will spark some kind of emotion when watching.Freya/Ishtar – they felt too similar. Ishat looks like a downgraded version of Freya and this did not server her justice as Ishtar as an ancient goddess is described as complexed and with variety of character, along with this Ishtar along with being the goddess of sensuality was said to hold strong sense od protecting humans. Which brings me to my previous Danmachi review – the surface is barely touched. Personally, I thin it is better to just come out with original names if you are not going to use any actual references from the figures those names belong to, it’s just laze and tasteless.Sound 6/10Like the first season – nothing memorable and just right to the anime.Art 6/10Given the year it’s not bad but it’s not the best out there, again as the first season not an eyesore at least.Enjoyment 5/10As I really did expect more dungeon and adventure my enjoyment level far quite low for this one as we deal with too much other business. The last 2 episodes were also quite boring, while Bell, Hestia and Ais were in the village. Not to mention I do believe that Ais is way better match for Bell and the “Love” between Hestia and Bell seems way too pushed and unnecessary in those 2 episodes.Overall 6/10Just disappointing on the basis what you would expect. No dungeon, no development for Bell more than just a few decisions that were made like they are something super hard and important but rather faded into the nothingness after that. I do like the first season more than this one and the idea was better executed there. If I waited 4 years for this I would just have dropped it on the first few episodes regrettably. 12 episodes we have good girl picking all right but almost 0 dungeon, the whole “Adventure type” went out of the window as there is zero to no actual adventures in this season but rather obstacles, the opening presentation also doesn’t help this anime as the whole opening contains more dungeon scenes than the 12 episodes into one.Story 7/10So given my opening line you could wander why I am giving the story such a high score.

The trouble with Season 2, I think, is that it ratchets up the tension and stakes without retaining any of the parts of the show that made it novel or fun. There's no progression, all of the status updates have been cut out of this retelling and Bell does all of his training off screen. There are three slice of life episodes which aren't integrated into the rest of the season very well. The role of the dungeon in this conflict is utterly superfluous. You get the feeling that any moments that could have possibly endeared...you to the new characters in the cast have been meticulously, surgically removed.Danmachi Season 2 is also constitutionally incapable of treating its own subject matter with the kind of tact that it deserves. It tries to explore darker themes regarding the violent underbelly of the Dungeon City of Orario, however, Danmachi doesn't know how to depict injury, death, dismemberment, violence, or sex. What's left is a confusing shell of a story too scared to actually interact with the themes and conflicts it brings up. The entire conflict is robbed of nuance. Bell runs from location to location having half-hearted conversations and badly choreographed fights until the arc stumbles to the finish line.I sincerely hope the next season is better. you to the new characters in the cast have been meticulously, surgically removed.Danmachi Season 2 is also constitutionally incapable of treating its own subject matter with the kind of tact that it deserves.

The combination of those two things is what makes this season unbearable to watch, and it wasn\'t as extreme in season 1. Don\'t get me wrong, stories don\'t need to be extraordinary, unpredictable with...original twists in every episode to be considered good ones, and as a matter of fact, Danmachi does have a good premise with its world building, involving mythology in a fantasy world and rpg elements, it works and feels coherent. The real problem is how bland the arcs are, the antagonists aren\'t developped nor interesting, therefore it makes it impossible for viewers to care about what is happening. The other big issue is the ""logic"" behind the plot and how unbelievable events shown become.Apollo arc : We are supposed to believe that Apollo never heard of Bell before the fight in the tavern ? That\'s incredibly stupid for two reasons : the end of season 1 consists of Bell striking the death blow to the 17th floor boss in front of like a hundred adventurers that took part in the fight ? How come there are still rumors that Bell is weak or a coward ? Let\'s assume that those rumors are indeed in place for some reason, why would Apollo care for a so called coward adventurer ?The Prostitute arc is as stupid as the first one, and once again, the conflict that erupts is so absurd, the Ishtar familia legit KIDNAPS BELL and MIKOTO, they escape and when they are being chased by the Ishtar familia they are like "" ah ah what are you going to do Bell, if you fight back you\'ll declare war ah ah you can\'t do that "" like for real ? Wtf ? The show tries to explain that Ishtar familia is ""above"" the rules, but this is just too much to accept in terms of world building.And there would be much more to say about convenient events, what ensues from that is the viewer\'s detachment from the story : if we know that no matter what happens, something ridiculous/out of the blue will make the plot go on, we can\'t take it seriously.Message of Danmachi ?Another point that makes the season 2 way worse than season 1 is the way it\'s trying to establish some serious issues with the theme of prostitution notably.Danmachi is about a young boy trying to become strong in order to match a female adventurer\'s power that rescued him. Along the way, he\'ll get friends and a harem. This isn\'t original at all and that was fine in S1, there was fanservice and it matched the season\'s atmosphere, but why did they try to talk about prostitution ? It\'s just wrong you know, like all the rape references/""jokes"" towards Bell along this serious theme really highlighted how inappropriate this arc was. You either make a light story such as season 1 with comedy & fanservice or you can try to go with a darker story and high stakes events, but you can\'t try a mix of those and expect a good result.TL;DR :All in all, Danmachi II has many flaws, and is doing worse than its first season in many aspects, up to the point where it\'s hard to recommend it even to people who enjoyed Danmachi I. The story is uneventful, everything is predictable, the themes talked about don\'t fit at all this anime\'s atmosphere.

You find your characters back, the music is pretty good (as it\'s always been), but the flavor is just not there yet.Giving a real review now is pretty hard as there\'s still at least 7 episodes to air meaning that it can still go...super duper well, but for now, as interesting as it was, it was just way too short, and nothing realy made sense, at least 2 to 3 more episodes would be needed to give that arc a real reason to be there.

The biggest difference throughout the season is that very little of it takes place in or has anything to do with the dungeon. Rather, the season is very strongly centered around conflicts between Familia.The first season is straight up centered around the Hestia...family getting into a war with another Familia, which results in the Hestia Familia itself going through major growth through essentially cashing in on all the bonds that were formed in the first season but didn’t actually result in anyone new explicitly joining. Thematically it’s still pretty much entirely focused on the same simple core concept that the first season focused on, Bell wanting to be stronger in order to be a hero. However, this manifests very differently in a conflict between Familia, and ultimately I’d have to say the final battle in this arc managed to show off Bell better than any other moment in either seasons. That combined with the rest of the main cast also managing to shine pretty well, the action being some of the best of the two seasons, and the payoff to the arc being immensely satisfying, results in this arc overall being the best DanMachi arc so far.The second arc and the third arc, the latter of which which is more of a mini-arc, on the other hand I found pretty lacking. While the second arc does very much still have a focus on Bell wanting to be a hero, both arcs also tackle deeper, more complex themes. Unfortunately, it’s very muddled in how it handles them, with it being pretty wishy washy and not really committing to saying anything despite it making a show of doing so. I think the change in focus also results in a different atmosphere with different comedy that overall doesn’t land nearly as well.The second arc is somewhat of a mess due to this, but it does introduce a pretty great character and manages to pull them into being a main character pretty well though with some major issues still present. And though the villains of this arc are horrible in a way that’s just uncomfortable and unpleasant to watch, it ultimately results in highlighting how amazing of a villain Freya is. The pacing is also somewhat slow at first but it does get much better as it goes on. So despite the issues I’d say that in the end this arc still managed to work out okay.The mini-arc that ends the anime I don’t think faired as well. It focuses on the relationship between Bell and Hestia and uses that to explore what type of relationships immortals and mortals can have, but in the end it didn’t really do much. The plot surrounding that was also pretty arbitrary and though it did drop some random lore here and there overall it felt like it severely lacked substance, and felt like a pretty weak way to end the season.The art and animation for this season felt like they started off noticeably better than the first season, but sort of fell back to the quality of the first season over time. The new character designs were decent enough I suppose but none really stood out like several of the ones introduced in the first season. The OP and ED were both pretty solid in terms of visuals and audio and fit really well, though they also end up pretty explicitly spoiling the entirety of the first arc.

You barely see them in any dungeon that was what attract me to this show in the first place. I couldn't care less about what felt like filler that this season was showing me.The main character development was basically non-existent. No highlights or any importance were given to a particular moment and that was a prime example on what this season went wrong, specially with it's focus.At the beginning I was excited to finish the second season and starting reading the manga but now I give it a hard pass. "", ""I guess I am a huge simp, because the sole reason I started watching this series was because I saw this anime's poster and I find the blondie cute.I have heard about DanMachi before, but the name sounded so off putting to me that I didn't want to give it a try, it seemed like teenager fuel to me, and I wasn't really looking forward to watch that - I know, it contradicts my simp wishes for the fox girl -, but after I gave it a try, I found it to be not so bad.However, DanMachi has the same issue that the first season...of Konosuba had for me, it is an adventure anime that.... they stay in the same city? I find the lack of worldly adventure boring, even with the dungeons they go to - mostly on first season, and practically non-existent on second season - it doesn't fulfil what a real adventure is like.In this season we have 3 stories: War Games, Pleasure Quarter and the last two episodes try to liven up a bit the mood and finish off with some cliff hanger for the following season. The first two arcs take too long to develop, instead of creating a more detailed story, it seems like they are stalling the inevitable, I don't know how different those were portrayed on the light novel, but what is the point on having a War Game that was supposed to take 3 days, but it seems to finish in a matter of hours? Also, the main battle in this arc is inconsistent with what was earlier shown (which is another argument for the poor world building of this anime). The second arc have similar moments shown in a lot of the episodes, if the author had cut short those moments, maybe this arc could have been cut by half. Last two episodes is purely for comedy purpose, which ends up being lame how they stupidify Ares.My main issue with the worldbuilding, besides the region-locked adventure, is the characters's strengths, first we are shown attributes, Bell mentions on the first season that his attributes reached rank E and in a matter of a couple of episodes he is already Rank S, afterwards no Rank mention is done, nor attributes, we are now purely dealing with level, also it seems like a pure grinding level system, since the strongest character we have seen, so far, isn't even level 10. It is just a way the author did to simplify and dumb it down his own work, and it affects the story a lot, because we get to see a level 3 character take a beating of other level 3 characters, or by the plot armour powers, be able to treat other level 3 like weaklings.My praises to Hikasa Yoko, and my disappointment for Minase Inori. Particularly I find the latter, one of the best seiyuus of the 2010's generation, her vocal range is impressive, but I found her quite bland here, that and the fact that Hestia's character is poor. BTW, overall, most characters here are tasteless, I liked Lion and Syr though.Were my simp expectations for golden-angel-fox-girl met? No. Is she still cute?

Where I actually enjoyed the first season despite the overpowered hero powers and plot armor, this season was almost mindnumbingly boring.I had hoped for more dungeon exploration and cool action scenes where he uses an overpowered Firebolt. I mean, that's what happens in the first season a few times. But my expectations were betrayed by twelve episodes of boredom. The War Games arc came out of nowhere and felt completely without tension. It was obvious from the start what was going to happen and the conflict had zero depth to it. It wasn't entertaining...in the slightest. At least with the dungeon crawling there was little plot and it was fine that way. But trying to do political maneuvering with such a poor excuse for a story line? That's just unacceptable.The second arc, regarding the Ishtar Familia and saving a certain character was almost just as bad just in other ways. It focused way too much on needless fanservice and almost raping Bell, again and again and again. The main character was once again reduced to a good-hearted sod who wants to save all the pitiful people in the world and it makes him completely personality-less. Maybe I simply didn't notice this in the last season, but all main and side characters seem like cardboard cut-outs. If a side character like Hermes is my favorite because he's kinda quirky, that already says enough about the quality of the other characters.So the story was pretty bad. The art and sound weren't anything special, although I did enjoy some of the celtic folk tunes that were in the background from time to time. Characters weren't anything special.

Where is the plot?  Where is the steady progression of our character?  There are too few moments here where our main character redeems himself,  but he is just not as likeable as he was in the first season.  None of the events that happen in this season seem like they build off the first and even the dungeon itself is rarely utilized.To put it shortly,  this season just sprinkles hints or buys time for what is really to come,...and I still don't know what is planned.  Everything that happens lacks some kind of significance,  and doesn't build off anything it seems.  It's just a bunch of events and side stories here and there.

The first half of the season is dedicated to the battle against Apollo, who has taken it upon himself to hunt Bell and force him to become a member of his...familia, whilst the latter half goes up against Ishtar's familia as she goes after Bell and attempts to sacrifice Haruhime for more power. Unfortunately, the politics for this one wasn't that interesting as we don't really get a good sense as to why everyone is after Bell, who is a pretty basic fantasy protagonist.Couple that with the demonisation of women in the sex trade, and I wasn't a massive fan of this. The way it handled Ishtar's familia in particular was very off-putting, and Haruhime herself - it just didn't seem to be handled that well. Fair enough feeling conflicted because of the trade she was forced to work in - forced prostitution is definitely a thing especially in historical settings, but having this entire familia essentially be evil, capture men and force their services on them, and also sexually abuse each other when they disobey orders? I wasn't a fan.Couple that with Bell's growing harem and I just didn't care. Fantasy shows/isekai all too often fall into the trap of having a very basic protagonist who is kind of boring, and lots of attractive women surrounding him who apparently love him for some unknown reason, and this was no exception to that rule. familia, whilst the latter half goes up against Ishtar's familia as she goes after Bell and attempts to sacrifice Haruhime for more power.

It suffered from pacing issues, a lack of moving the series forward in a meaningful way, and felt overall like filler episodes.  Quality filler, but filler nonetheless.  And that\'s because nothing of any real merit happened.  Nothing particularly shocking, or memorable.  Just standard fantasy anime fare.  The first season was much better than this one.  While the first season was moving Bell Cranel and a crew towards goals, this one took a step back and became more like one of those harem animes from the mid-2000\'s, where everybody is obsessed with being the...one to land the MC.  70% of the anime was ""I want Bell Cranel and I\'ll do anything to have him."".  While the Ishtar arc was a slight departure from that, it was mostly contrived and based upon the most shallow of motivations for it all happening, in the first place.What also hurt this season was the 4 year gap between it and season 1.  With that long of a gap, unless an anime is truly iconic, you lose all emotional connection to the cast that was built up, and even forget people all together.  Even after reminding myself of what happened in Season 1 by reading the Episode descriptions on Wikipedia, I still don\'t remember anything about Makoto or Takemikazuchi Familia at all.  I don\'t remember half of the houses or people in them and what they did after 4 years away, and this anime didn\'t do much to remind me.  So, it feels like it\'s picking up where it left off without you and leaving you behind.The most disappointing part, is that with the exception of the final fight of the anime, the fight animation and choreography took a real step back from the previous season.  One thing I do still remember is how epic the fights were in season 1, particularly the fight with Bell and the Minotaur.  There were no such epic fights here. Because the fighting was house between house, there was more broad, war-like scenarios that lacked the sleekness and precision of one-on-one fights. They weren\'t boring to watch, but the weren\'t excellent, either.That being said, it was still entertaining to a degree.  I love Hestia. And I enjoy watching her. The rest of the cast is likable enough, the anime can be funny at times, and the story, while filler-esque, wasn\'t snooze inducing.  I also liked the unique aspect of prostitute warriors.  I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen an anime where the villains are an army of hot scimitar-wielding hookers.But, at the end of the day, the only thing that can describe this season is ""mediocre"".

Boy oh boy, I had to stop after what I assume is the first arc landing me at some point in the 4th episode. Awful. Has there ever been a more contrived plot device for action? OBVIOUSLY!! But this one had my jaw hitting the floor with both the set up and pay off. The rules set up for this contest were immediately vetoed with no apparent input from...the god of the Apollo family? He did allow a concession, but I don\'t believe it allowed the inclusion of people outside Hetalia\'s family. So why was that rule just jettisoned immediately? Unless something happened off camera to make it viable? The sheer incompetence of the Apollo family deflated even the superficial ""epicness"" of this encounter. Down like a lead balloon she blows. The size and scale of their stronghold, and how quickly it was undermined was something to behold. In a world where individual combatants obviously have the ability to destroy castle walls and scale large distances quickly, did the distribution of the Apollo family make any sense whatsoever?? Highschool DxD did this far better and that show is hardly known for its SAT scores. Our little rabbit went through an arbitrary training session and then immediately became capable of defeating an enemy he was powerless against? I understand his growth rate is magnified by his feelings (yaddy yada), but the payoff was so limp wristed that I have to question if whoever came up with this had ever seen a shounen anime before? My good man, Hyakinthos, was apparently channeling full body ""butter fingers"". Developing an acute case of cerebral palsy within an episode or two. These four episodes were both derivative and executed with such callous disrespect for the shounen formula that I could stomach no more. Abysmal trash. 3/10 the god of the Apollo family?

In a world where individual combatants obviously have the ability to destroy castle walls and scale large distances quickly, did the distribution of the Apollo family make any sense whatsoever??

Erementar Gerad,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1250/Erementar_Gerad,"['Characters/DevelopmentI was surprised after watching this one as I expected it to be your average adventure anime with the same old story, characters that get forgotten and bad flow in story. I am glad I was wrong, this was a great viewing. The story is a rather simple one but flows very well throughout the anime having some interesting action and emotional moments. Fights aren&rsquo;t too alike to each other and the emotional moments aren&rsquo;t the same each time because they are sometimes sad, sometimes cute. The plot also has its interesting moments, with a few awkward ones too but theres nothing overall disappointing about...it. The action in this one as I said aren&rsquo;t too alike to each other throughout the anime as the enemies have different styles for battle and different terrains were they happen at. I did however get bored of Coud getting pushed around without getting hurt too badly at the start and towards the end. I like the emotion the most in this one, especially the way Ren gets upset and learns she starts to feel jealous later on. There are also some sweet romantic moments I don&rsquo;t wish to spoil, but quite unexpected which is very good. Something I&rsquo;ve Noticed, the way this anime is set out and the characters, it really reminds me of Outlaw Star. First, the girl is found in some sort of container in both of the animes and are both wanting to go to a certain place with the main character who promises to do so. Second, the characters are alike. You have Coud and Ren who are like Gene and Melfina. Then you have the beast girl character. You also have a good warrior in both and the annoying &ldquo;kid&rdquo; if you like in both of them. Thirdly, there are always people getting in the way, some people trying to kidnap the girl and some other adventures inbetween.Animation/SceneryAnimation is rather good as well, but there were a few repeated scenes in a few spots. The Reacting scene did however got repeatative and boring half way through but at least the studio made those scenes end quicker than near the start. The art style also looks very soft with good tones of colour, with nothing too bright or dull. I did notice the art did get more sharp and better later in the anime too. Backgrounds were interesting but nothing fantastic except a few areas in the later episodes. Character designs are interesting, Ren is very cute with the way she looks with her purple hair and green eyes which is quite different than a lot of female characters and suits her very well. Coud is also rather decent looking for an adventure anime which doesn&rsquo;t go over the top with hair design and clothes. The others are also interesting without being too far fetched, except the hair style of Wolx, but I rather liked it. Characters also never get forgotten as ealier characters return later in the anime.Audio/MusicMusic adds to the atmosphere and feeling of the anime, especially the music used to explain what happened in the previous episode. They sound like some old folk/country tunes and fit well with the style.ConclusionA very good adventure anime, without being too farfetched.

From the Manga by Mayumi Azuma a splendid story emerges from the pages of the manga to an Anime series that has all the fun you need. A fantastic blend of Sci-Fi and fantasy, with the touches of romance on top.This show needless to say stands out to me more than most action series. Unlike typical action series, namley naruto the female characters aren't easily faded into the background. While Ren can be the damsal in distress, there's no denying her...own strength and abilities and there is certainly no denying her desires to protect Cou as he protects her. But probably Cou impresses me the most. At first appearance he seems to be your typical male character full of christma a bit cocky but you can clearly tell that he not only loves Ren and wants to protect her with all his might but he can be humble as well. Mostly it's because he can be humble respectful and take defeat that makes him a mature character almost unheard of in series like these. I think this probably only one I've seen, with a strong ensemble cast of males and females. He doesn't act macho all the time and doesn't have an enormous ego.Animation wise well it's probably not THE most impressive in the world. Especially in the way it will suddenly go Chibi on you, or the fact background look like colored sketches. However the characters look splendid.Ah music. Yuki Kajiura seldom disappoints me. Giving the mystical and bit of Irish-Celtic feel to the shows original score, while occasionally breaking out into her trademark style, of vocals and elaborate piano melodies. But I wish she would do her fanciful violin trademark some more! Music scores often suffer in action series but the original score for this show shines out as another bonus quality.However the show is not with out it's flaws.

(As is commonly done) Admist these clich&eacute;s the series isn't beaten down with them. Hey what show doesn't have it's share of flaws?

And, while this is the main plot point driving the story, it branches off into so many directions creating an intricate web of diverse sub plots, all of which are explained fairly well so that the viewer is able to understand it all and enjoy it all the same. The main sub plot, is that of edel (that is what i call them, although some translators prefer eldo, or eden) raids, mystical beings who can fuse with a human to become a weapon. A...lot of effort is put into making what a realistic world would be like if edel raids really existed, how some people would use them purely as weapons, where as others would care for them as much as a human being. The whole premise is very interesting and very well explained as said above, and arcs out into a very original and epic adventure.The art and sound are very nice, having one of the absolute best openings I have ever seen in an anime. The characters are diverse and interesting. Coud being a young lad, and a fighter by nature. At first he seems like a fairly standard hero, but as the plot progresses you find he has a few strengths and flaws that normally wouldn't surface themselves in an anime. The heroine, Ren, is quite different for the norm of an adventure such as this. Usually you'd expect to find the strong willed girl, ready to fight it up with all the men. While Ren definably has a strong will, and will fight when necessary with all her might... she really is her own original character. If I could describe her in one word... it'd probably be ... sleepy, or maybe blunt? Shes a quiet girl who doesn't warm easily to people and doesn't say a lot. Shes not shy by any means, but rather reserved and has a bit of a hatred for humans. As such, she is thouroughly enjoyable to experience as a character and can easily be nominated as one of the greatest female leads of all time.Overall the experience gained from watching elemental gelade is a good one. The story builds and falls at all the right times, and you can fell the joy and sadness that the characters are trying to express. It is beautifully done, and an excellent watch.

I'm not one of those people who write long and critical reviews but if you like action packed amines with cute guys and a sappy heart warming ending, than this is an anime for you! Two lovers meant to be together but enemies try to keep them apart! I JUST LOVED IT!!! if your not into the sappy stuff then the beginning and the middle of the series would be best for...you, its full of action packed super powered people fighting! But I was kinda disappointed in the slight lack of gore, like I mean a guy was stabbed and his shirt didn't even rip! I don't like a whole lot of blood but some sign of an actual injury would help. And I have to say the plot was very original- usually when they have a species co-extising with humans It's usually demons or monsters. All the characters were amazing and had their own unique personalities, and of course the wholes striving for world peace thing is an unavoidable clique but you cant really tell. you, its full of action packed super powered people fighting!

The journey from two to one. It is a journey Cou and Rin take together to better understand who they are and their feelings for each other. The plot I would say is there to drive the development of two characters along. That is not to say other characters do not develop in time, just not very much. The story is kinda simple. Boy meets girl , boys falls for girl, boys and girl save the world. I wished I could have the show a better grade as...it is pretty good, but there was something I deeply hated about it: the intro and the story teller voice recounting what had happened in the previous episodes in short. It is a voice that does not fit the show at all. Because it tries to put you to sleep. Interesting enough they did not go with the well know song+movie voice but with the once upon a time voice.

You know, It feels more like i'm talking to myslef here than actually helping people decide whether to watch this or not... No way you're the best. Thanks you're too kind.Anyway onto the review, as a side note the way i reviewed Codegeass was a bit of borefest to write and most likely to read, so i'll be going back to the first way (The way I did Sexyrei er i mean Sekirei, if anyone cares.)Story: I'd say it was pretty good. Not heavy like other animes that really get you thinking/...depressed, but not so light that you have no interest in it at all. The story was fun, being action oriented, comedic at times and romantic. It was a nice story that when you were done with it you were satisfied.Art: Pretty smooth, style wise it was cool and the battles were nice and smooth. I'm not much of an art critique so i like every little style of art in anime.Sound: The music was great, making suspenseful scenes just that and action scenes ...action...-y. Also I really liked the voice acting in this. ( Kill me or whatever but I usually always watch anime in english.) While somecharacters had the best voices ever, others took some time to get used to. But that's not to say it sucked...just was unique at irst, though i feel in the long run it really worked.Character: This show just had a lot of character. The interaction between ren and coud? (I guess that's how you spell it?) were always nice and cute. The interactions between Cisqua and her co. between coud was also fun. On top of that were some very fitting voices as I previously mentioned, especially for coud (Sounds alot like the english voice actor for Zack fair...instantly made it a hundred times better...eventhough it already was good.)Overall: Again I skipped Enjoyment (Why do we even have that lever...er I guess it would be section in this case...) [Kudos if you get the reference] Anyway overall I really enjoyed this anime, It wasn't change your life crazy or...crazy crazy. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes romance, action, comedy, animes. Also it has a similarity to soul eater, as in certain people change into weapons to fight with a human. So if you watched soul eater and like that you might like Elemental Gelade also, though keep in mind there are differences.Well...short sweet to the point...more or less.

Like I said its pretty simple. Not much to say there.Art, not bad not amazing I enjoyed the animation, but it was never anything amazing. Some scenes were well done, others are meh. Details with the surroundings seemed like they were quickly painted down without much intentions, but the characters themselves were well done.Sound. Ugh, I found the OP and ending just very catchy they didnt really help with pulling me into the anime....On top of that the mid cut where they would insert commercials was like... is this a western? Anyways wasnt too impressed with the sound.Characters. Not too shabby Ren is the quiet deep thinker, or so it seems. Her impressions on people are changed on a whim, while Coud is the must fight because I have to type. Cisqua is amusing has some good qualities and interesting whit :D enjoyed her.Enjoyment overall, I wont say its bad, but I found that it just didnt quite do it for me. In the first episode I felt that when Coud was getting beat up from some random ninja (yes there are random ninjas)... why isnt he bleeding? Maybe this should go into the Animation but still I think there should be some form of blood in this.Overall. Pretty generic anime, not sure if i would recomend but i also wouldnt say skip it.

Elemental Gelade is the opposite: the opening episodes will probably not wow you. It seems pretty standard, doesn\'t it? A young male hero trying to prove himself, a mysterious girl he has to protect, and some pirate vs ninja action.But the show becomes so much more.Story: 7/10Overall, the story is rather basic. Taking place in a world where humans live alongside Edel Raids (girls who can react with a human to become a weapon), main hero Cou is a...sky pirate that ends up reacting with Ren, an extremely powerful Edel Raid. He promises to take her to her destination, and a three-person Edel Raid protection agency accompanies them and tries to get Ren for themselves. As Ren is such a powerful Edel Raid, the group finds themselves in a lot of trouble and such. Most of the story is just their travels and don\'t involve a concrete plot. A more solid story emerges in the second half, but you still shouldn\'t expect any amazing plot twists or anything. The story is not what this is about, oddly enough.Characters: 10/10Ah, now this is what I love about the series. The characters are surprisingly well done. I don\'t just mean Cou and Ren either; the ""side"" characters even get more development than main characters in most series. Cou starts out like a typical shonen hero, but he really evolves (augh, can\'t explain much better due to spoilers). Ren also starts out hating humans for using her race as weapons and changes as she sees the world and the circumstances people are put in. Personally, I like the three Arc Aile members best, particularly their leader Cisqua. She seems like typical comic relief with her hot-temper initially, but her ties of loyalty to her work really make for some interesting developments as she sees first-hand just what her company means to the world. Rowen also seems like Mr.Perfect with Edel Raid Kuea wanting nothing more than food, but even they have much deeper sides explored in the story. What I found great was that each of the Arc Aile members got an episode to themselves tor really explain things. Just looking at the first few episodes versus the last few shows just how much the group evolves.Art: 7/10The art is pretty average, if not a bit on the above-average side. It dives into chibi once in a while, which adds a nice charm. Don\'t expect to be blown away by the art, but it isn\'t bad to look at either.Sound: 8/10Elemental Gelade has a very different feel in terms of sound. It\'s very...folk-music-like. The darker tunes are also interesting with their creepy piano and whatnot. The songs the characters use to React could have been better though, considering what an important part of the plot they are. Still, it\'s a nice change that still fits the moment.Enjoyment: 9/10Really the show is about how the characters develop, and I think all the little things work together really well to show that.

All the warning signs were there, and I should have avoided it, but I figured I\'d go ahead and watch it. What puts Elemental Gelade isn\'t any single thing, but more a combination of mehs and boring concepts and executions. But I digress, because we both know I put myself through this just to procrastinate. On with the show.In the world of Elemental Gelade, there exist humans, and alongside them exist the Edel Reids. The Edel Reid are simply put, living weapons. They look just like humans, and their only...distinguishing feature is a gem somewhere in their bodies, called an elemental gelade. These gems give them the power to transform into weapons when they React with a human, who is thereafter called a Pleasure. Reacting forms a contract between the human and the Edel Reid, so no other two can React as long as the pleasure is alive.The main character, Coud van Gireut, has the good luck of Reacting with the most powerful of all the Edel Reid, Reverie Metherlance, who likes to be called Ren for short. Of course, many want the power of this Edel Reid, so Coud\'s life is often thrown into peril by those seeking to kill him. Along the 26 episodes this anime has, Coud meets several other Edel Reids and Pleasures, in a typical quest format that doesn\'t really create any lasting impressions or bond between the viewer and them. As is the usual for these type of series, Coud and Ren reform those who they run across, thanks to their deep bond of love.Coud and Ren\'s entourage are Cisque, Rowen and Kuea, members of the Guardians, a group that seeks to protect the Edel Reid by giving them a safe, protected place. At first they try to steal Ren away, but eventually settle in with Coud and Ren on their journey to find the Garden of Eden, a place where Ren yearns to go, as she feels some strange sort of connection. This is spoilerrific, but the Garden of Eden is the base of the Chaos Choir, the main ""antagonists"" of the series. I put antagonists in quotation marks, because the show tries to draw parallels between them and the Guardians...and fails at really doing so. One of the methods the show uses to accomplish this is the appearance of the Edel Reid Hunter Wolx, the typical bad boy who gets reformed by the good guys. He only appears for about 2 or 3 episodes, so again, doesn\'t create a lasting impression, other than showing the perpetuation of yet another cliche in this type of anime.This anime gets 6/10 from me, the concept is good, but the execution fails because of the many cliche developments this anime goes through.

She is actually an Edel Raid, magical beings in the form of human women who can form contracts with others to become living weapons. Because of this, Edel Raids are sought out by criminals to exploit for their fighting power or sold off to others for personal gain. Accompanied by members of the organization called Arc Aile that protect Edel Raids, Cou promises to protect Ren by accompanying her to Edel Garden, the homeland...and birthplace of all Edel Raids.What allows Elemental Gelade to stick out from your typical shounen series is that it offers a solid exploration of the relations between humans and Edel Raids. There are humans that disregard the humanity of the Edel Raids, valuing them more as tools for their power as weapons or for monetary value. But there are also humans who recognize the Edel Raids as people with thoughts and try living as normal a life with them as possible. A number of episodes also explore things from the perspective of an Edel Raid, as some show hostile reaction to human treatment of their kind and even show concerns over Arc Aile's protection of them as the protection comes at the expense of their freedom and isolation from those they develop attachments to. This element effects things for some later plot and character developments that adds some intrigue to the series, notably with Cisqua feeling disillusioned with Arc Aile's handling of human and Edel Raid relations and an enemy faction of Edel Raids opposing humanity.Beyond the solid exploration of Edel Raid and human relations, Elemental Gelade is otherwise standard fare to a great degree for a shounen series. Many of the typical character types for a shounen adventure are there with character Cou your typical good-natured and naive hero, Ren the shy and quiet girl gradually taking romantic interest in the male lead, and Cisqua being the energetic and upbeat leader of the Arc Aile squad accompanying Cou and Ren. A number of episodes focus on Cou and his allies having to fend off enemy threats trying to abduct Ren or another Edel Raid for their own gain that are overcome in battles of varying scale. There is a budding relationship between Cou and Ren that gradually develops throughout the show's run, though both are too archetypal for me to give a hoot about with their romance. Also, a fair amount of convenient deus ex machina is milked for Cou and his allies to defeat the enemy threat and get a rather predictable happy ending. This is nothing horrible in terms of plot and character development, but it doesn't necessarily do anything that breaks the mold either.Overall, I suppose I'm kind of indifferent toward Elemental Gelade. It offers decent exploration of the relations between humans and Edel Raids that provides it some solid foundation for plot and character development. But many of the parts that make up its story are still pretty standard for adventure titles aimed for the shounen demographic. Still if you are craving for an adventure series to kill time watching, the series is at least worth a rental or single streaming depending on the means you choose to view it. and birthplace of all Edel Raids.What allows Elemental Gelade to stick out from your typical shounen series is that it offers a solid exploration of the relations between humans and Edel Raids.

But there are also humans who recognize the Edel Raids as people with thoughts and try living as normal a life with them as possible. A number of episodes also explore things from the perspective of an Edel Raid, as some show hostile reaction to human treatment of their kind and even show concerns over Arc Aile's protection of them as the protection comes at the expense of their freedom and isolation from those they develop attachments to. This element effects things for some later plot and character developments that adds some intrigue to the series, notably with Cisqua feeling disillusioned with Arc Aile's handling of human and Edel Raid relations and an enemy faction of Edel Raids opposing humanity.Beyond the solid exploration of Edel Raid and human relations, Elemental Gelade is otherwise standard fare to a great degree for a shounen series. Many of the typical character types for a shounen adventure are there with character Cou your typical good-natured and naive hero, Ren the shy and quiet girl gradually taking romantic interest in the male lead, and Cisqua being the energetic and upbeat leader of the Arc Aile squad accompanying Cou and Ren. A number of episodes focus on Cou and his allies having to fend off enemy threats trying to abduct Ren or another Edel Raid for their own gain that are overcome in battles of varying scale. There is a budding relationship between Cou and Ren that gradually develops throughout the show's run, though both are too archetypal for me to give a hoot about with their romance. Also, a fair amount of convenient deus ex machina is milked for Cou and his allies to defeat the enemy threat and get a rather predictable happy ending. This is nothing horrible in terms of plot and character development, but it doesn't necessarily do anything that breaks the mold either.Overall, I suppose I'm kind of indifferent toward Elemental Gelade. It offers decent exploration of the relations between humans and Edel Raids that provides it some solid foundation for plot and character development. But many of the parts that make up its story are still pretty standard for adventure titles aimed for the shounen demographic. Still if you are craving for an adventure series to kill time watching, the series is at least worth a rental or single streaming depending on the means you choose to view it."", '""What we have here is a failure to communicate.""The story of Elemental Gelade (EG) is an unfortunate example of an enticing premise bogged down in a mire of contrived plot devices — it has some shining moments and juicy drama, but the road to them is paved with poor choices and frustration. If you\'re looking for a romantic adventure/drama set against a fantasy backdrop then you may enjoy what EG has to offer, but if you expect intelligent characters making rational choices and/or growing from their mistakes then I\'m afraid you\'re probably in the wrong place.Oh and before we get started, if you\'ve been taken...in by that misleading jazz about ""sky pirates"" like I was, then please don\'t be fooled — no skyship in this entire series seems to last longer than 60 minutes, and our heroes spend the vast majority of their time on solid ground.The story structure is semi-episodic, but executes this format better than most — many episodes (or sets of two or three episodes, in the case of some longer arcs) tell mainly self-contained stories with bits of overarching plot sprinkled in, but most of these mini-stories are quite relevant and serve to develop the world in meaningful ways. Characters from prior arcs often return to make minor cameo appearances in later episodes, providing some resolution and going a surprisingly long way towards making their otherwise isolated sub-stories feel more involved on the larger scale.The story itself is a tale of adolescent adventure and interracial romance as our wide-eyed, idealistic protagonists attempt to traverse a world rife with racism and slavery. This classic backdrop is quite compelling and drew me in immediately, but I soon came to the unfortunate realization that it would be almost exclusively used as an excuse to have the shy, reclusive heroine kidnapped and saved by the reckless, loudmouth hero over and over again in a variety of slightly differing ways, often stemming from frustratingly painful-to-watch miscommunication between the two. We watch them make the same mistake over and over and be punished for it in the same way again and again. It\'s like watching some kind of shock-collar training.Speaking of shock-collar training, they actually make use of it at one point to try and force the hero to improve himself. The results of that training last approximately until the end of that arc. Long-term character development is largely limited to the stages of the two mains\' budding romance — other than that, only two or three characters stood out to me as having received any significant development at all beyond their introductions. The vast majority of characters are exactly the same in episode 26 as they were in episode 1, and those few that aren\'t are generally ex-villains who did sudden 180° turnabouts after our screamy shounen protagonist made them realize the error of their ways with some passionate speech about love and hope and acceptance. A few side characters deserve shout-outs for standing head-and-shoulders above everyone else in terms of development (even if it is only over the course of their particular, single arcs).In spite of all these shortcomings, the basic premise of the story and world were still solid enough to keep me interested. Most of the minor characters have engaging tales to tell (almost all of them being more interesting than the main cast), a few arcs really stand above the rest as unpolished gems and there\'s at least one decent plot-twist near the end to reward viewers for sticking around. For all its flaws, it might still scratch that adventure/romance itch if you\'re willing to suspend your disbelief and tolerate a fair bit of numbskullery.6/10 in by that misleading jazz about ""sky pirates"" like I was, then please don\'t be fooled — no skyship in this entire series seems to last longer than 60 minutes, and our heroes spend the vast majority of their time on solid ground.The story structure is semi-episodic, but executes this format better than most — many episodes (or sets of two or three episodes, in the case of some longer arcs) tell mainly self-contained stories with bits of overarching plot sprinkled in, but most of these mini-stories are quite relevant and serve to develop the world in meaningful ways.

I would have to give props to them on character development throughout the anime as it never ceased to develop the characters properly. That is, except for Envatilia. She was mostly just a side character consistently. They did attempt to give her some sort of depth since all the other characters had way more back story and growth, but it was only featured in one of the episodes. After that, she went right back to only being a weapon for Rowen who complains about being hungry all the time. As for the...story in the anime, it was fairly good. Sure it was done before, but they definitely executed the story much more successfully than most. I find the dynamic between Coud (Pronounced-Coo) and Rin (or Reverie) very nice, but sometimes hard to watch. Overall the relationship between the two was strange and uncomfortable at first, but most definitely got better over time. I won't give spoilers, but the ending was kind of put together haphazardly, though it didn't really effect the rest of the experience thankfully. story in the anime, it was fairly good.

This story follows a young man named Cou (or Coud), who finds a young girl who happens to be the most powerful weapon in the world.What I liked most about this anime is the genuineness and heart of the main characters. Our protagonist is a boy trying to become a man, and he\'s finally found a chance to prove himself and even find himself along the way.The girl is the sheltered, innocent type who has little to no knowledge of the outside world. In this story she mostly plays the...damsel in distress albeit being a very powerful entity.

You find yourself rooting for the boy who doesn\'t understand his feelings but wants to do the right thing.The action is of a mediocre quality, the series is more emotional than anything.

Normally it could be fine to insert such a character in an anime/manga like this; however, the way it was done here is simply horrible as you expect a character to be developed to learn from their mistake and not to repeat the same mistake in 90% of the anime/manga and to never learn but instead to keep causing further damage.We could indeed say that the character development of Cisqua could be probably rated 1/10, one of the worst I have ever seen in an anime/manga, this because the character is born like that in the first episodes and literally finish in the same exact way.Might sound harsh to judge everything from a single character, but you have to be objective and consider that if a character is shown in every single episode and has a really high presence, it is normal that it will have an high impact on the entire serie.For what regard the other characters, I liked the development of Cou and Ren, not individually but when together since they helped each other to find their own errors and to understand each other and each other ""races"" (ren understanding humans, cou understanding edel raids)Kuea and Rowen are really funny and enjoyable character, which develop their thoughts to the point to not being anymore loyal puppet of a faction who\'s causing damage, in difference of Cisqua, but to understand that what was going on was wrong and their had to fix that and chase their own happiness and the one of their friends rather than causing them damage every single time.Beside of that development of thought, there was no other development but is not strange consider the year where it was created, so that\'s fine.# Story - 6Story, for an early 2000 anime/manga, is pretty classic/standard (at that time there were many that were developed with the same logic/style) but is anyway enjoyable to a certain point, which is fine.#Art / Sound - 7Like for the story, giving the year it was created, both art and story are pretty much nice and enjoyable. faction who permanently damage the humans and the edel raids under the light of the sun where everyone can notice, despite they claim to be the protectors/guardian, but they finish to seriously damage, and lead to almost death, and cause sufferance to the main characters which are supposed to be her friends; and in all of that what she does is keeping supporting this faction as a loyal puppet, by ignoring all the sufferance it is causing to the entire world (it is shown through the series).In short, the more the world, humans and edel raids, and her own friends, get damaged and finish to suffer and almost die under the hands of that faction, and the more she will support that faction leading to further sufferance and damage.It\'s like an immature character who can\'t accept the truth of the facts, and in this way lead to damage everyone around her and the entire world.

This isn\'t just a normal girl as she is what is called an ""Edel Raid."" These Edel Raids possess a jewel and the ability to allow the user a unique power that is mainly used to aid in battle and combat. The show really takes you on a journey throughout...the mysterious world of Guardia and is a fun show to watch and unfold.Story - 7This story follows the journey of a sky pirate named Coud and his adventure with his newly found Edel Raid that goes by the name of ""Reverie, Metherlence"" more commonly referred to as ""Ren."" Their adventure is about going to the land of gold called the Edel Garden within the far, far reaches of the sky, all the way, far up in the clouds where Ren desires to go.As they pursue this journey they meet up with many people, many people, including people from the Edel Raid Protection Agency who attempt to purchase this newly discovered Edel Raid for a great sum of money, though Coud refuses, these people join his journey and fight alongside him to reach the special land they had been searching for.There are many people who want to gain these mysterious Edel Raid powers that Reverie possesses, solely for themselves, as she is a way rarer type of Edel Raid, rarer than most of the other ones. And some of these people are willing to fight battles to gain these special powers and do anything it takes to get a hold of Ren. The story is a good overall adventure story which is great for anybody who wants to experience a nice journey of action and romance.Art - 6The art and animation featured in this show were alright for 2005 standards. The art looked decently clean for the time this show was released. The animation was also alright and didn\'t look too bad (most of the time.) The scenery had a decent amount of detail, displaying what they were supposed to with fair amounts of detail here and there.The character designs were pretty original and decent looking, though there definitely could\'ve been a little more detail added to some of the characters in this show. Otherwise the show had decent looking art for 2005 and so was the animation which could look a bit odd at times but was still pretty decent.Sound - 6The sound in this show was decent although basic. The opening and ending songs were generally good songs but not very memorable and rather forgettable after I had finished this show. The background music was honestly just a little basic, with nothing in the background music I would personally re-listen to.The voice acting was also decent and it seemed like they did a good job for voice acting these characters, as it seemed like they chose voice actors that really suited the personalities of the characters in this show. The music and voice acting featured in this show seemed to be alright and slightly above average.Character - 7Characters in this show were mostly well written. The main character, Coud, was a cool character who had genuine feelings for Ren and wanted to defend her. Ren herself was a rather calm character who always stood with Coud and aided Coud in countless battles which took place over their journey. The three other characters in their team were also helpful at fighting and attacking any enemies that came their way, and they were also funny sometimes.Enjoyment - 7This show was pretty enjoyable and a fun watch. While there may have been things the show could have improved on, the show managed to display a fun little adventure that is great for fans of action and romance genres of anime. The concept of Edel Raids among other things in this show were pretty interesting and are worth watching the show for.Overall - 7Overall I liked the story.

Bubble,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50549/Bubble,"[""Bubble had a beautiful world with an even better soundtrack and astounding visuals. Although it blew me away with its animation and the intricate details of character movement/design, it is extremely held back by the way the story starts itself off. it came off to me as an incohesive story and I felt no connection to the characters whatsoever. The ending definitely started to pick up and showed nice contrasts from the beginning leaving it off on a really good note I feel. I can say wholeheartedly that I'm glad I watched it just don't know how much I could recommend it. :) "", 'The latest movie to get released from Netflix in a nutshell:Imagine Makoto Shinkai\'s somewhat lackluster Tenki no Ko a.k.a Weathering With You, except there\'s bubbles and parkour to create a decent movie.No doubt that this insanely high-profile Netflix-exclusive movie is the work of acclaimed people (most of them being from Shingeki no Kyojin a.k.a Attack on Titan since this is Wit Studio with producer Tetsuya Nakatake, director Araki Tetsuro, sound director Masafumi Mima), along with writers Gen Urobochi and others, plus the musical genius of HiroyukiSawano. With a high-calibre staff team like this, this Netflix release must look and feel the part of accomplished veterans,...and just feels incredible...music and production-wise only.In a very simple storytelling way (because it really ain\'t much), Bubble showcases a post-apocalyptic Japan where people can parkour to their liking, so much that it created a competition-like feeling to the young-uns living there. And in comes the supposed ""The Little Mermaid"" twist character Uta, birthed out from saving this somewhat closed-hearted Hibiki from drowning, only to land at his familial ship Reiyo of Team Blue Blaze, became human and lead Hibiki to be a better parkour player. While it showcases that, it also does is focus on the romance aspect of both Hibiki and Uta in terms of ""noise"", showing that hearts can resonate together when they hear the same vocality. Case in point, this feels like a combination of 2 other movies: Belle and Cider no You ni Kotoba ga Wakiagaru a.k.a Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop on both music and romance aspects but with the classic Attack on Titan twist. The other characters weren\'t so memorable, and as mentioned, they\'re only there to service for numbers and progress the plot.Honestly, when you take the entire package as a whole, it feels half-fulfilled, half-empty at the same time as well. Both Wit Studio (and their core staff) and HiroyukiSawano absolutely delivered in their craft, as are the theme songs from Eve and Riria that shouldn\'t come as a surprise for fans of either entity and people behind this movie. But the structure of the movie being like this just wasn\'t a good one, and for a movie that\'s very highly anticipated (or if you\'re one that got spoiled by reading the pre-review in the forums that was posted months before the Netflix release), it just felt disappointing and underwhelming.I don\'t really want to say this, but Bubble is one recent anime movie that I felt can be labelled as ""mid"". I usually take everything into consideration, especially when it comes to movies, but sad to say that even with the talents of Wit Studio and HiroyukiSawano, it\'s the scenario and character writing in this that suffers tremendously. This is a movie that\'s all about the musical and graphical showcase (since it has a higher budget than regular TV anime no matter the source which is Netflix or otherwise), not one that\'s too focused on story, though it would help if the story was written better for a more immersive experience.Can someone PLEASE make a movie that\'s not so heavily inspired by Makoto Shinkai for a change? Because the anime movie landscape is getting stale at this point if most movies now are created and attempting to imitate the success of the prolific author-cum-filmmaker. and just feels incredible...music and production-wise only.In a very simple storytelling way (because it really ain\'t much), Bubble showcases a post-apocalyptic Japan where people can parkour to their liking, so much that it created a competition-like feeling to the young-uns living there.

The other characters weren\'t so memorable, and as mentioned, they\'re only there to service for numbers and progress the plot.Honestly, when you take the entire package as a whole, it feels half-fulfilled, half-empty at the same time as well. Both Wit Studio (and their core staff) and HiroyukiSawano absolutely delivered in their craft, as are the theme songs from Eve and Riria that shouldn\'t come as a surprise for fans of either entity and people behind this movie. But the structure of the movie being like this just wasn\'t a good one, and for a movie that\'s very highly anticipated (or if you\'re one that got spoiled by reading the pre-review in the forums that was posted months before the Netflix release), it just felt disappointing and underwhelming.I don\'t really want to say this, but Bubble is one recent anime movie that I felt can be labelled as ""mid"". I usually take everything into consideration, especially when it comes to movies, but sad to say that even with the talents of Wit Studio and HiroyukiSawano, it\'s the scenario and character writing in this that suffers tremendously. This is a movie that\'s all about the musical and graphical showcase (since it has a higher budget than regular TV anime no matter the source which is Netflix or otherwise), not one that\'s too focused on story, though it would help if the story was written better for a more immersive experience.Can someone PLEASE make a movie that\'s not so heavily inspired by Makoto Shinkai for a change? Because the anime movie landscape is getting stale at this point if most movies now are created and attempting to imitate the success of the prolific author-cum-filmmaker.', 'The trailers for this movie honestly didn’t inspire much confidence. The visuals were undoubtedly gorgeous, and I was extremely excited to see what this outstandingly talented group of industry veterans was going to create, but the premise and characters looked so boring, and boring is the last word that comes to mind when I think of Tetsuro Araki. Typical “boy meets girl” story; obsession with the Tokyo Metroplex; generic Eve pop song; inconsequential-looking friend group; pretty boy protagonist wearing Beats™ by Dre. If you told me those were the trailers for the next Makoto Shinkai film, I would’ve been like, “Wow! Why is his direction...suddenly so engaging?!” But I still would’ve believed you. However, after having actually watched the movie, I’m glad to say many of these elements were likely included for marketing purposes only, none of them are ultimately a detriment to what makes the film good, and the actual execution is quite something.I was surprised to realize this film was inspired by The Little Mermaid. More specifically, the Hans Christian Andersen tragedy, not the Disney fairy tail. Its highly symbolic world and setting is visually breathtaking and a total joy to become immersed in the beauty of, but it’s also deliberately mystifying. A giant bubble has formed around the city, and gravity has gone haywire, but never do you comprehensively understand why. The film provides the audience with the exposition necessary to understand what’s directly relevant to the plot, but otherwise, it let’s your imagination run wild, and it’s done not in a way that feels cheap and underdeveloped, but instead deliberate and magical. If Bubble had deep and memorable characters on top of everything else it has going for it, it could’ve easily been a genuine masterpiece, but without them, it’s not suddenly a bad movie, because everything else about the film suggests it might actually be one anyway.Araki’s imagery combined with the thrill of Sawano’s music never fails to blow your mind. The artwork and animation is simply stunning, even for WIT, Obata’s designs are splendid, Sawano is rightly praised as a legend by virtually everyone, and Araki is one of my favorite directors for a really good fucking reason. With more and more studios desperately trying to copy WIT’s 3D environments, it’s worth reminding ourselves why WIT’s were so impressive in the first place. Yes, the renderings and graphics were perfect, but the real reason they felt so exhilarating was because Tetsuro Araki was the one directing the shots. If you saw the trailers for this movie and didn’t immediately think, “Well, alright. This is obviously just an excuse to have people parkour around a weightless and inventive cityscape with jaw-dropping animation and electrifying visual action.” Then, honestly, you need to do yourself a favor and watch more of Araki’s work.Watching this felt like watching Promare in theaters. Around half an hour in, I realized it wasn’t trying to be Imaishi’s next Gurren Lagann or Kill la Kill; it wasn’t trying to be deep; it was just trying to be a visual feast, and it succeeded. GKIDS had a translated interview with some of the creative staff which played after the screening, and if I remember correctly it was Shigeto Koyama who kept talking about how the “movement” of the film was constantly bringing him to tears. Everyone laughed as if he was joking, including himself, but he insisted he was serious, and when asked to elaborate, he just kept repeating that same word. “Movement.” While Bubble didn’t move me to tears or anything, I completely understand what he was saying after watching it. I wasn’t terribly invested in the story or characters, but I understood and appreciated them, and with even such a simpleminded connection established, I was able to get swept away by Araki’s sheer creative vision.People, generally speaking, think I’m a cunt. They think I hate anime, and I just make excuses to bitch and complain. They think I nitpick and overemphasize every tiny little issue I can find as a cynical excuse to hate on whatever anime I’m talking about. I insist this isn’t true. I insist my harsh analytical criticism is merely a product of my high standards, and should an anime meet those basic standards—a competent production, a competent script, a competent director, and so on—then I’m actually extremely generous. As long as an anime has a solid foundation and doesn’t actively annoy me, I’m very easily entertained, and Bubble is irrefutable proof. It’s not that the film is nothing special, because it is special; it’s that the film isn’t tremendously deep or complex. If, by the sound of things, you think you’re too good for something this fast and loose, then Bubble may not be for you, but I cannot say the same for myself. Indeed, this film may just be too good for me.Thank you for reading. suddenly so engaging?!” But I still would’ve believed you.

This should already sound alarm bells that there is too much inspiration from other works, and nothing here to call their own. Even when attempted, it\'d just be forgotten as fast as it came in (see last few minutes and Hibiki backstory). Seriously, if I...had to go and think up what was originally here, I\'d have to go and rewatch the entire thing because I got nothing for you.The actual inspired content was nothing too heartfelt anyway. I suppose that\'s a given with some elements here, like how the side characters exist to only aid the main guy in whatever he wishes, but it\'s not even like the main dude was the strongest of characters I\'ve come across in recent time. The same is also true for Uta. That reminds me, the romance here is mediocre as well since it only existed during parkour moments or moments that were dramatic. There was nothing of natural romance which is quite a shame.The only selling point here, although somewhat of a sellout way to go, seems to be only the audiovisuals, which are undoubtedly amazing. Well, maybe not Shinkai level if we are going to talk about crystal looks being on a pedestal compared to the actual story, but you know, it\'s stuff people would usually look at with starry eyes. No less expected from Wit. Music was good for the most part too, Sawano did well on that. Everything was correct to the scenes that took place. Although it was just a variation of the main theme and song only Hibiki and Uta can hear, they still delivered to high quality if nothing else.---------*Spoilers here*Now, this part is going into spoilers and the review has essentially finished, but whilst watching this movie I came up with too many damn questions. It was unreal. In fact, some moments were so flawed my initial 7 is now turning into a 5 lol. I usually don\'t like being too critical, and I find enjoyment in most things I come across. But when you hear the following, led by a team of elites, you will see where I am coming from.The biggest issue I have is some of the world\'s logic and questions are never answered. Let\'s start with Hibiki\'s mom. Some no-one who looked like she wanted to kill her son. For what reason? Dunno, probably because he had hearing aids or something, but her existence feels so wrong in what she does, or at least, the directing made it confusing to present her in a light that was simultaneously two different things. She\'s a no one in this story, but since she is connected to the main character I thought I\'d talk about her. Hibiki seemed to have no problem with her from what I recall tho, maybe I am overthinking. There\'s also another question as to why the hell Hibiki is even the prince to Uta anyway, of all people. Because he could hear the song? Would love to know but it never goes into detail. They just found each other and fell in love.Some world logic that makes zero sense. Towards the end of the movie, Shin\'s prosthetic leg is perfectly fine in kicking steel from Tokyo Tower AND well enough to continue on inhuman parkour with zero problems, but breaks when Hibiki jumps from it lol. Also, the Under Takers are literal plot devices. Those guys streamed all the parkour in an illegal area and no one is coming to bust down the place. Odd if you ask me. It also made zero sense for them to help out Blue Blazes save Uta when they had no issue with sending people close to their deaths via that blackhole thing. Lol. You could call all this nitpicking, but I found it funny that this existed. There are a lot more irregularities that feel unnatural but I\'d be here forever if I listed them all so I just left my favourites.---------That\'s all from me really. Can\'t keep expectations too high these days, but I don\'t really regret watching this, it\'s a time killer thing rather than anything to look back on with great pleasure.

It is what it is.', ""This is my first review and probably the last.I usually watch anime and don't give much thought to what other people think, but I just can't ignore the reviews this masterpiece of anime is getting.I know you shouldn't comment on other people's reviews or opinions but in this case I just can't help it so I apologize in advance and hope for the best.I've seen people claim the story and plot doesn't exist, which I think is absolute nonsense in my Opinion. The Film begins and you are thrown into a story that focuses on the Plot and the Fate that binds the two...main characters from start to finish, You yourself as a viewer are completely sucked in not only into the story itself but also into the world which Art and details are beyond amazing underlined by melodies and sounds that perfectly support and harmonize with the anime and the world. In addition, there may be people like me who now forever have the certain melody in there mind that will bring them back to this anime.I'm willing to admit that if you were expecting an anime that has parkour as its main focus, you might not be entirely convinced but i think even this part was handled quiet well. I also think it was to be expected that this film also had more of a Your Name or Weathering with you vibe.For my part, I am completely convinced and picked up by the masterpiece that this film is the emotions were completely believable for me but maybe they are just not for everybody.I for one think if you were expecting an exciting parkour anime and now you are disappointed then please don't write a bad review based on your disappointment when it was absolutely not what the anime was aiming for! :)Ah that felt good to get out.Thats it for my review.Great day to everyone reading this. main characters from start to finish, You yourself as a viewer are completely sucked in not only into the story itself but also into the world which Art and details are beyond amazing underlined by melodies and sounds that perfectly support and harmonize with the anime and the world.

Bubbles plus parkour! What do you think?- Yeah thats great I had been working on a nice cute girl design.- We can also add some nice music! They liked that in Vivy.And so the whole team puts their heart and a lot of passion into this project, making crazy visuals, scenes and score only to realize at a half way point:- Shouldn't we make some kind of plot for this?Your enjoyment of Bubble is gonna depend on how much you can ignore a lack of story or real characters for the sake...of beautiful eye candy.This movie doesn't really have a story, everything serves as a setup for some crazy next scene they envisioned in Wit which is why there is a strong feeling of randomness while watching Bubble. We need a cool parkour scene? Let's introduce some randoms which kidnap one of the characters for views. We want crazy cosmic bubbles? Let's just make some bubble portal in the middle of Tokyo which leads to some other dimension or something.This ideology extends to characters.Authors introduce million characters because they had nice designs for them and wanted more people in parkours, which means they don't develop any of them making them into some kind of stereotype for a character. We also have our main characters:Cute girl and of course Cool dude.Cute girl learns how to speak. On the other hand Cool dude was for 5 seconds an Edgy dude before becoming a Cool dude so there is something. Cute girl and Cool dude become friends and I think fall in love.That's about it.Visually this is incredible. Beautiful landscapes of flooded Tokyo, weird gravity, all the different bubbles make gorgeous scenery with something interesting always on screen. Artwork is elevating this movie into a spectacle which is enriched with a feel of mystery by the mesmerising soundtrack. Direction of parkour sequences and the animation in them make it all engaging despite action having no stakes at all. Unfortunately some of the moves they do are so outrageously impossible it takes me out of the scene.It is a shame that they don't have any good writers in the studio because this could have been a masterpiece. of beautiful eye candy.This movie doesn't really have a story, everything serves as a setup for some crazy next scene they envisioned in Wit which is why there is a strong feeling of randomness while watching Bubble.

NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE. there is no plot, there is no tension, there is no buildup and there is no payoff. normally, I would be fine with it. but... man, those characters suck. I am unable to say that they even have a sense of personality. there...is no driving idea or motivation for characters, neither the \'antagonists\' (if we can call the rival team that?). it all feels so lackluster. I felt literally nothing except frustration watching this anime.in a nutshell - forced hetero romance can ruin yet one more film. all in all, I have no idea why they copied \'Weathering with you"" and then pushed ""Little Mermaid"" in there... this film doesn\'t feel like it\'s own story and looks very generic for some reason. I cannot put my finger on it but it just all look so poorly organized.. it\'s all just a compilation of situationships happening without any reason. just like the \'romance\' of the movie. it was so unnecessary... and boring and weird? especially because the female lead acts like an animal or a child.... I have no idea how is that supposed to be cute or romantic? if you want a feral inhuman girl, there you go I guess?I genuinely want someone to explain to me if they were interested in what was happening and why lol.spoilers?the characters are so bland I don\'t even remember their names... plus none of them even had a distinctive personality (if we can say that they had any to begin with).first we have a generic black haired MC with little sad backstory. fine. I have no idea if the creators did it intentionally, but he was basically a walking autistic representation (which I though was nice, but at the same time \'Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop\' had almost the exact same character archetype, so to feel like Hibiki was genuine is a lie lol) again, I have no idea what his character is except he seems autistic.Main female lead... oh boy, guess what? she does not even behave like a human most of the time, barely speaks and acts like what? a CHILD. I absolutely despise the trope. pretty girl out of nowhere, obviously not a human, acts like a wild animal, can\'t speak, but guess what; that\'s fine because everyone loves her for some reason, she also has unexplainable crush on MC and serves no real purpose, except she is good at parkour, which is supposed to be half of her personality- the other half being pretty girl that just learned how to speak lol. YAY... she basically upgrades from a pet to a child in my eyes. I thought we were over making women in media look dehumanized and void of any personality? apparently not hehenext up we have random and pretty forgettable characters filling the screentime:lowkey annoying sexy girl that fills the role of a \'mother figure\' I guess? but she mostly is there to be sexy ofc...a child,a guy that has a loud voice and is into the sexy lady for some reason,two filler characters with almost no dialogue,a dilf who\'s there to be cool and um.. there I suppose?and of course - background characters with no purpose or motivation.if you just want a pretty movie to look at, it\'s fine. don\'t have high hopes, but it\'s there.

His reputation definitely hurt this movie due to expectations alone for certain people.The movie also runs into classic “movie” problems, namely pacing, I feel like an additional hour to build up the characters and HibiUta dynamic would’ve greatly benefit it, but not gonna fault it too much there.  My main two complaints come from the side-cast and plot:The characters beside Hibiki and Uta are also basically just “there”, while some have roles to play, none are really developed upon barring a support role either in the parkour scenes, or to dump exposition to the viewer.The beginning 2/3rd’s of the film have no relevance to anything besides the HibiUta building. The last 1/3rd of the movie is where the “plot” finally starts to kick in, but no real answers are given to most of the questions you have/had going into the movie, namely the origins and “intent” of the bubbles. ||Regardless of it’s flaws, I still enjoyed a lot.It’s an absolute pleasure to the eyes and ears; the ED song was great, and HibiUta was pretty cute, I liked their dynamic and the ending.

My main two complaints come from the side-cast and plot:The characters beside Hibiki and Uta are also basically just “there”, while some have roles to play, none are really developed upon barring a support role either in the parkour scenes, or to dump exposition to the viewer.The beginning 2/3rd’s of the film have no relevance to anything besides the HibiUta building. The last 1/3rd of the movie is where the “plot” finally starts to kick in, but no real answers are given to most of the questions you have/had going into the movie, namely the origins and “intent” of the bubbles. ||Regardless of it’s flaws, I still enjoyed a lot.It’s an absolute pleasure to the eyes and ears; the ED song was great, and HibiUta was pretty cute, I liked their dynamic and the ending. I just wish it was longer and the characters, mystery and plot were fleshed out more.', 'Tldr: it\'s a flawed story with likable characters, a lot of cool yet mostly unexplored ideas, top tier animation and an amazing soundtrack. by no means a must watch, but still worth watching if you\'re interested in the concepts or want some top notch parkour animation.********************************************************************For the lack of a better word, this movie was lacking.But why? the concept is great, the music is amazing, the animation is some of the best out there and the writing while not the best of the best, it is also far from being bad.So why? what could possibly be the reason......********************************************************************Loosely based on little mermaid. a well known story, that even if you somehow don\'t know it, you will since the movie tells it, and says how it ends not too far into the first act, and to me, that\'s this movie\'s biggest downfall. Basing your main plot around a well known story, means audience having a good idea of what the story beholds from the start, which obviously is not the best thing, specially when you say how it ends and make sure the few who don\'t know it are also spoiled.But unlike what you may think, that\'s not always a bad move ,while that type of story in most cases is not as good or at least not as interesting as a truly original idea, it can and has worked before in many cases. But for that to happen you need a little something called, ""reasons""if those reasons aren\'t present, you are just actively spoiling your story for no, well, ""reason"". and to no ones surprise, all spoilers do, is lessening the impact. and ruining the shock factor.again, it can work.you can use the known story, to set up a twist by breaking the audiences expectation.you can expand upon the idea and add to it.or you can even just remake it in a different setting, but in that case telling the audience what you are based on from the start becomes a moronic move.The problem with bubble is that other than the elements mirroring the little mermaid story, it doesn\'t expand on ANYTHING.*********************************** Out of context spoilers for this part:Where did the bubble came from? who knows.Why had the time stopped in the tower? who knows.why was the girls sister which was the other part of these ""bubble"" angry when she left? who knows.Where did the bubble go? ""yOu sEe thErE arE tHeSe vorTex""no that is not an explanation. That\'s cop out answer/theming at best. At the very least the movie could have it match the themes of the show like what parasyte The maxim did.********************************************************************The show had a lot of ideas, but it didn\'t even attempt to go through any of them outside of the bare minimum. I just don\'t get it, if all you had to offer in terms of story was the little mermaid story, why would you even think of telling that to the audience DIRECTLY.And I do mean that, the romance barely functioned since it was kind of rushed, and the characters where just ok. nothing bad, but in no way special either. There is no message, there is no symbolism, there is no clever foreshadowing, theming or plot twist.All the story had, was the little mermaid story and some unexplored ideas, and for some reason decided to spoil a massive part of it by telling you what the story is based on.it\'s not all disappointment though. The animation and art are out of this world. the background were also some of the most wall paper worthy I have seen in a long time.The music was also great. It didn\'t blow me away and become one of the best I have heard, but It was great through out the whole movie.But the sad truth is that, this movie felt unfinished. it left a lot to the imagination in the worst way possible.Wit has never missed the mark as far as I have seen, and this too was by no means a bad movie, but it was certainly disappointing.thanks for reading ********************************************************************Loosely based on little mermaid. a well known story, that even if you somehow don\'t know it, you will since the movie tells it, and says how it ends not too far into the first act, and to me, that\'s this movie\'s biggest downfall.

This was probably the worst movie I have ever wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes on. It was a waste of time, and I won\'t get that time back, maybe i\'m getting too old.The good: The art is beautiful, breath-taking even. The voice acting is done well and the score kept my interest. I also thought this was a neat concept, it seemed so fun and fresh(?). I was excited to watch it. Also, the animation was super fluid,...I loved the scenes where no one was talking and there was no mention of the plot. The character designs are fun too.The bad: Oh dear god where do I start. The plot was nonsensical and barely fleshed out. Like many are saying, it feels as if the producers and creators relied on the animation to carry weebs into liking this movie.Uta is your run of the mill manic pixie dream girl who really is only there to fall in love with the male lead. Like, no really, she comes to life because she wants to save him. She\'s kind of annoying, and I feel bad saying that.Hibiki is another cardboard man made for the ""my god, he\'s just like me!"" crowd. He\'s unlikable right off the bat and doesn\'t really get any better. Even with scenes explaining why and how he is, and basically try to make you like him more, did nothing for me.The other characters: what other characters? You mean the ones who aren\'t fleshed out and are just there to stroke the protag\'s d- I mean ego?Overall: Yeah, it\'s just a bad movie and I am so sad it was because I was hyped to see it. I only rated it because of how bad it was, like nothing good outside of superficial aspects.

Oh well.', ""The new and highly anticipated Netflix original film with the best staff gathered, a new anime with the most respected people working on it, a not so new story?Bubble is a movie that takes place in Tokyo which had suffered from a supernatural phenomenon and left the capital of Japan uninhabitable with floods on the ground and bubbles in the air. The story starts off with introducing us to the characters, the characters are not too different from most anime movies that have come out in the past years, the main character is a stoic person who does not bother being with other people, an...eccentric and energetic younger kid, a boy who seems to have anger issues, funny enough, it also features a story that seems familiar, a survival type romance which is taking place because of a supernatural phenomenon. For the first half, it becomes quite hard to be interested or care about the story or the characters as nothing new or special is shown, no character interaction that catches my attention and no development that I want to witness, just some parkour racing that the characters are involved in, which looks like something that would be more attractive to someone who likes 1) Parkour 2) anime like beyblade or bakugan. The story does take a turn when our stoic protagonist encounters a near death experience and gets saved by this bubble girl who turns out to be someone who took a shape of a singer or actress and is originally a bubble that looked like it had a soul. Our protagonist and the girl start to form a relationship and this relationship is what starts the development of our protagonist who gradually starts to care more and show more emotions. In the second half, things became more interesting with the protagonist: Hibike and the bubble girl: Uta, as they take part in a race together to save another one of the characters, this race was one of the more interesting parts which was uplifting and enthralling however as the story continued the pacing did not get better, switching between high action scenes to normal conversations, not maintaining a balance and often forcing me to zone out. It introduced side characters that had a role in the movie but their roles were not much fun either and it failed to make the characters seem important to the story. Now with a good deal of pacing issues, boring characters and story, we move on towards the ending which I think suffered the most from all the previous issues such as pacing and being able to make anything seem important, with some backstory which made me think that things are more interesting now, with bare explanation to the phenomenon and my lack of interest for the parkour concept and a declining interest in the main couple I did not enjoy the final part enough, there are movies like Weathering with You in which I felt more attached to both the story and the characters and enjoyed it throughout, this movie barely had anything fun or interesting for the first 75 percent that what was supposed to be the best part of the movie, I could not be invested in it. I still give credit to the main couple who had backstories and development complemented with beautiful animation and sound that made scenes with them together more beautiful and had more feeling in it.The animation was my favourite part of the movie, with amazing camera movements during parkour scenes, beautiful and vibrant colours that you would just want to frame on your wall. The movements were fluid and dynamic, the camera following the characters created a great cinematic experience. Some of the shots which closed up on Uta and Hibiki's face were cocaine to the eye with the colours and the details. The sound was top notch, great soundtracks which were used well and created a deadly combo with the animation. These were the things that gave scenes in the movie more feeling to them and more joy to watch when things were at the best, although at some points these elements did not match the feeling of the scene, or at least it tried to force the feelings on to the viewer.Personally, someone who is less invested by the parkour races and a story and characters that look like a repeat of other films, the style was not enough to make up for flaws, even the state of the art animation and sound only partially helped. I'm convinced that Netflix original anime are now to just try things out that's it, no one on this platform wants to make a complete story with a good idea put to use. eccentric and energetic younger kid, a boy who seems to have anger issues, funny enough, it also features a story that seems familiar, a survival type romance which is taking place because of a supernatural phenomenon.

Spoiler-free until stated otherwise.POSITIVES:Most of the music was pleasant, and fit the vibe of the movie.The art (subjective as it is) was easy on the eyes and often ‘wallpaper worthy’.Special praise must go to the dynamic scene direction, fluid animation, and smooth angle changes. There was one sequence in particular that paired dynamic animation and soft background music excellently.In fact, these factors alone could be enough for a particular kind of viewer to love watching this movie.NEGATIVES:The writing here...was nothing special. Most of the characters (even the main two) had next to no depth to them. There was very little momentum to the plot, and rather cheap (if not nonsensical) tricks were pulled to trudge us along it at times.Another movie I had a similar experience with was ‘Weathering With You’, although ‘Bubble’ has marginally less pretty art and a marginally more cohesive narrative.SPOILERS SECTION (Skip ahead to OVERALL if you want no spoilers) :Despite my suspension of disbelief, the whole basic premise of ‘orphaned boys engaging in team versus team urban parkour in a crumbling Tokyo setting with supernatural dangers’ rang hollow to me. This initial premise, having not been adequately fleshed out, laid a shaky foundation.A central issue with the movie arose not soon after: investment in character, or the lack thereof.None of the characters were given sufficient backstory or personal focus for the viewer to care about them much, or to even understand their reasons for engaging in ‘high stakes urban team parkour’ in the first place. The movie might often make you ask yourself, “Why do I care about what’s happening here?”.I could go into details about how frankly ridiculous the whole ‘rescue arc’ was: “we are the conveniently evil looking generic bad guys, who kidnapped this woman from your squad, and you must rescue her by beating us at a high stakes urban team parkour match, so we can get internet fame” was pushing limits of credulity. I think it was just an extremely cheap way to create an imitation of stakes/drama so that the main characters could have a motivation to learn to work together and bond before the final act.The final act naturally suffered as well.The supporting cast of characters had very ‘convenient’ contributions ham-fisted into the narrative, which were probably intended as the payoff for the ‘teamwork’ theme.Explanations for the supernatural forces were vague, which by itself I did not mind much.The foundations/motives for the two main characters were not laid down early or clearly enough. In fact, it is only towards the end with the narrator’s monologue that we start to see the full(er) picture.Ultimately, the conclusion and ‘sacrifice’ of the main character girl lost some of its impact because of the one-to-one ‘mermaid tale’ told before. Expectations—far from being subverted—were barely met (if that).OVERALL:There were many narrative choices that landed poorly, and the movie unfortunately spent huge chunks of its runtime on flashy but ultimately non-cohesive elements. I could go on about the deficiencies of the writing, and praises of the direction, art, and sound; but I want to focus on what I think the vision behind this work possibly was:**“In the fleeting moments between grand cycles of death and rebirth, the precious beauty of the human connection is what gives value to life.”**I believe this was the narrative core of the movie, but had very little time devoted to it.This movie could have been split into two—much better—films:1) An excellent, impactful drama/mystery/romance with the focus clearly on the two main characters and their story.2) An equally great action/sports movie with the focus on themes of teamwork and found family.The melding of these two concepts together was not done cohesively and thus diluted the impact of both sides into a single, ultimately shallow/mediocre work. was nothing special.

That doesn’t mean it’s without its flaws, however.Bubble is a spectacle of animation and if it’s any indication of what’s to come from WIT in the future I’m very excited. After dropping Shingeki no Kyojin, WIT last released Vivy, my pick for original anime of the year(2021) and Bubble retains many of the same qualities we saw in Vivy. Where they diverge is that while Vivy stays a well written story throughout, Bubble’s final act lets it...down. The post-bubble disaster world where parkour is a way of life is a fun and unique concept, but the story fails to really explain key details about the world. There’s quite a few leaps in logic taken particularly about the origin of the bubbles, what exactly Uta is and even the state of the outside world.The main attractions of the movie are the OST, animation and Uta and Hibiki’s relationship. All of which are really good and definitely make for a worthwhile viewing experience. Despite the story being weak at the end, the combination of Sawano’s OST and some incredible parkour animation made the last 35 minutes or so an emotional ride. I would have really liked to have got a little more story/lore out of the movie, but I do understand time constraints and that WIT probably decided to just stick to a character driven story, which worked ok, but not great.If only for the music and the animation, Bubble is worth the watch. Its story does let it down, but it’s not the worst written out there. I do think most people will be able to enjoy this and have fun with what is a rather unique concept.Bubble gets 8 out of 10. down.

Literally nothing in this show feels like it\'s rightfully earned and can be related to, everything just looks like magic, feels like magic and runs on magic.

Bubble is a dystopian retelling of 1837 Danish fairy tale \'The Little Mermaid\'. Please remember I specify the original fairy tale and not the 1989 Disney adaptation, as that film\'s plot is notably different. This is all dropped in front of some side-plot of battle-parkour in a Tokyo torn apart by supernatural disaster. The city is littered with these bubbles (shocking, I know) that defy gravity, which is where we\'re introduced to our COOL, DARK-HAIRED, QUIET, BROODING PROTAGONIST who is the ONLY PERSON who can make use of such bubbles to...parkour better. Mr. Edgelord is an orphan as a result of the aforementioned supernatural disaster and is the ONLY ONE who can ""hear the song"" coming from Tokyo Tower, which functioned as ground zero for the detonation. This is the starting premise of the film, and all of it is absolutely littered with plot holes. I\'ll go into that later.Minor spoilers from this point. I\'ll try to avoid the film\'s major details, but please note that this film\'s plot is so shallow and nonsensical that I could detail the entire film from start to finish and you\'d still likely have the same viewing experience that I did.I\'ll start with what I enjoyed about the movie since it\'s a fairly brief list. The animations is very cool! Seriously, Bubble is at its best when it watches like some massive flex by the biggest names in the animation industry. Kazuhiro Yamada, Kyouji Asano, Yakaaki Chiba, Tetsuya Nakatake and Tetsurou Araki working on the one project should have been as close to animation-exodia as we will get for many years to come. A few years ago, I would have said that was the case here. The key animation was spectacularly smooth but devoid of much personality. I think Ufotable has really raised the bar on sakuga with Demon Slayer and the Heaven\'s Feel films that I find it hard to call this groundbreaking anymore. The parkour sound effects and impacts also sounded great thanks to Masafumi Mima taking control of the audio engineering. That guy\'s an absolute machine and it\'s very likely he did the sound design on your favorite anime.There were, of course, aspects of the production that disappointed me—albeit not many. The largest of which is the soundtrack. If you made me listen to this film and told me it was Hiroyuki Sawano without me knowing any better I\'d say you\'re full of shit. This is easily his weakest work I can recall off the top of my head. I\'m used to this guy giving me goosebumps and making my soul ascend to a higher plane of existence. This man\'s soundtracks have carried me through multiple gym PRs and brought me to tears. The score of this film is very forgettable. It\'s just ok. Very inoffensive and mostly reserves itself to the background. Hard to complain about, but hardly praiseworthy. The voice acting was also very bland for such an all-star cast. Mamoru Miyano is very forgettable here considering he\'s one of the best to ever grace the industry. Yuki Kaji\'s character was also insufferable, but that felt more like a scripting and direction issue. The actual lead was some no-name with a sexy, brooding, whispery voice on their first job who failed to deliver any kind of impact during the film\'s emotional climax.Now to discuss the plot! I don\'t know what Gen Urobuchi\'s problem is. Madoka is kino, Fate/Zero is pretty great, Psycho-Pass S1 had some interesting themes going on, and then everything else is absolutely atrocious. Let me try and break down this plot. The whole parallel of The Little Mermaid is not subtle, the film explicitly brings it up and beats the audience over the head with it ad nauseum. In the original fairy tale the little mermaid dreams of having a human soul so she can live forever in heaven like the other humans (Mermaids live longer, but burst into sea foam after 300 years). I sort of understand the concept with bubbles? A bubble might not age but they do ""pop"" after a time, which causes the subsequent flooding of Tokyo. However, the condition in the fairy tale is the prince cannot marry another otherwise she will turn to sea foam come the next morning. Spoiler alert for a 100+-year-old story: the prince marries another girl and the mermaid is faced with her imminent death. The sea witch informs her if she kills the prince and lets his blood run on her feet she can turn into a mermaid once more and live out her remaining days, but the mermaid could not bring herself to do so and returned to the sea to accept her death. However, due to her selflessness, she turned into an air spirit and was allowed to serve the humans for 300 years with the reward of going to heaven after. It\'s important to note that nobody tries to stop the mermaid from going to the surface in the original, the mermaid just wants to for her own selfish desire for spiritual immortality. It\'s a timeless story with interesting themes, yet none of these are represented in Bubble. There\'s no competing love interest, there\'s no explanation of Uta\'s curse, there\'s no explanation of Uta\'s goal, nothing. It feels like the only parallel we see in the entire film is the little mermaid becoming a human, falling in love with a prince, before being forced to return to her former self in the end. That\'s it. It\'s not as if this is some fleeting parallel either, the film, once again, bashes this over your head from start to finish. While it does so, it disregards any questions you may have about the overall story.At first, I thought this big bubble surrounding Tokyo had isolated these kids, forcing them to compete for food and resources in these dangerous parkour battles. That\'s an interesting premise, right? Except that\'s not at all what\'s happening. They\'re allowed to leave and go live in a normal town at any time. They\'re just there for fun. So why don\'t they leave? Why isn\'t the area restricted by the government? Or being researched? Or being monitored? Why is it abandoned? What are the vortexes in the sea? Why does gravity not work properly? Why does the gravity get fixed? Why are there bubbles? Where do the bubbles come from? What are they for? Why do the bubbles get mad at Uta? YOU DON\'T KNOW, AND THE FILM MAKES NO ATTEMPT AT EXPLAINING. The little you do know about the world comes from extremely forced exposition from the older characters. Makoto, the older female lead, was one of the saving graces of this film since she reminded me of Misato, albeit a shallow one. While her drinking booze and caring for the children was charming, she ultimately served no purpose other than delivering exposition and lacked any form of depth. In fact, the entire cast was devoid of nuance. The entire story is a textbook on why ""show not tell"" is a rule in filmmaking. The result one arrives at when you give the task of writing a script to Gen Urobuchi and two others who have never worked on a single project in the industry.The main character is also the ONLY ONE who can hear the ""song"" of the tower. The reason for this? He\'s autistic, and the writers equate auditory sensitivity to superman\'s super hearing or some shit. I guess he\'s the only autistic kid in all of Tokyo? It\'s all in some very shallow attempt to tie in a ""what makes people different is what makes people special!"" motif that doesn\'t work in the slightest. The entire resolution of this film makes no sense, it\'s just some ""love conquers all"" cliché that should, apparently, eradicate all questions about the world the audience has had until that point. When the dust settles, you\'re left with an episode of My Crazy Obsession about an autistic parkour enthusiast in an intimate relationship with a bubble. So visionary. Incredible.Honestly, take out everything that isn\'t this production team animating anti-gravity battle parkour through apocalyptic Tokyo and I\'d rate this much higher. The narrative really drags what is an otherwise cool premise into the proverbial unexplained sea vortex. Disappointing. 3/10 parkour better. Mr. Edgelord is an orphan as a result of the aforementioned supernatural disaster and is the ONLY ONE who can ""hear the song"" coming from Tokyo Tower, which functioned as ground zero for the detonation. This is the starting premise of the film, and all of it is absolutely littered with plot holes. I\'ll go into that later.Minor spoilers from this point. I\'ll try to avoid the film\'s major details, but please note that this film\'s plot is so shallow and nonsensical that I could detail the entire film from start to finish and you\'d still likely have the same viewing experience that I did.I\'ll start with what I enjoyed about the movie since it\'s a fairly brief list. The animations is very cool! Seriously, Bubble is at its best when it watches like some massive flex by the biggest names in the animation industry. Kazuhiro Yamada, Kyouji Asano, Yakaaki Chiba, Tetsuya Nakatake and Tetsurou Araki working on the one project should have been as close to animation-exodia as we will get for many years to come. A few years ago, I would have said that was the case here. The key animation was spectacularly smooth but devoid of much personality. I think Ufotable has really raised the bar on sakuga with Demon Slayer and the Heaven\'s Feel films that I find it hard to call this groundbreaking anymore. The parkour sound effects and impacts also sounded great thanks to Masafumi Mima taking control of the audio engineering.

Disappointing. 3/10', 'In the everlasting debate of which animation studio is the best we often hear the names KyoAni, MAPPA, ufotable, but with the release of Bubble, I think Wit Studio has taken the top spot for now.Just from the production standpoint, this is a perfect masterpiece and there is no denying it objectively. Plain backgrounds, lackluster animation, background characters not moving? Yeah, no, not with Wit Studio.Bubble always shows a colorful and dynamic background in every scene. The amount of details is beyond insane. And you can see the sheer effort in literally every frame. You can pause this movie at any second and spend...minutes just looking at all the details.But the animations might be even better. At this point, Wit Studio was just flexing their abilities. Moving camera shots with even more movement of the characters while also providing an dynamic background. The parkour scenes might be the best thing of this movie. There is so much movement on the screen and still you can\'t spot something that does not scream effort and detail.This is as close to an orgasmn for your eyes as it gets.The soundtrack was made by Sawano Hiroyuki, nothing really more to add. The music is perfect, the sound effects themselves are gorgeous, simply an amazing package in terms of sound.As for the voice acting, I was really impressed by the performance of the main duo (Japanese), especially for their first pure dubbing roles. Those two really embraced their roles and I hope to hear more from them in future anime. And on a personal note, I just love anime movies with ""rather unexperienced"" voice actors in the main roles, surrounded my veterans of the industry (in this case Kaji Yuki, Miyano Mamoru etc.), another plus for me :DThe story might be the weakest point of the entire movie, but with such an amazing production it\'s really hard to surpass that. BUT, that doesn\'t mean the story is bad. I personally loved the story, which I won\'t spoil here, I loved how the characters interacted, I loved how the set up this world of bubbles (who would have thought that a movie called ""Bubble"" had a lot of bubbles), how they built up Uta and Hibiki and especially the conclusion.(I must add, the backstory of Hibiki had me a little teary for whatever reason, he is sooo cute and innocent :c)Overall, Bubble is a masterpiece when it comes to production, animation, sound (design), voice acting, everything is absolutely stunning. But it also comes with a great story, so at the end of the day, I must really recommend it to everybody, just for its production. And I highly recommend it to people that like beautiful stories with a slight emotional touch! minutes just looking at all the details.But the animations might be even better.

I am EXTREMELY disappointed. Good art does NOT equate to a GOOD anime. The heart of a film should be its story and I stand by that. This story has HINTS of something that could be good, but that\'s all it has. It does NOT dive into any depth. For instance, the exposition is awkwardly delivered, where one of the unmemorable side characters says ""you...know I don\'t have any parents, just like everyone else here"". Who even says that in normal conversation, a no-shit Sherlock moment if I ever saw one. This is also NEVER developed any further, they don\'t go into how the characters have changed and how they cope with losing their parents, it\'s just brushed off as the reason they do parkour.Many questions left unanswered:Are all the bubbles people? Why was Uta the only bubble that became a person? Why was she SO important that she could stop the disaster? Why randomly out of nowhere does she have a sister? Does that imply there are more of her out there? Why are there bad bubbles? And why can they be neutralized from Uta\'s song? Why is Hibiki so special, no one else could hear the song that came from the tower? It was Uta, but also the tower, why was it coming from both of them at the same time? What caused the whirlpools and explosions? How did Hibiki anger the bubbles? Do bubbles have feelings?HOW TO STOP WAR....... BUBBLES!!!!!Art: 10The art in this movie is amazing, the action scenes are immersive as hell. I would expect nothing less from Wit Studio. This movie is basically just them flexing their skills, it is STUNNING. The creativity in the world-building and all the details left me struggling at some points to keep up as it was one of the most immersive things I have seen in a while.Sound: 8Overall the music was nice, maybe slightly repetitive on the main theme, but that\'s just a personal nit-pick.Character: 1If you like 2D characters, this movie is for you. There are only three characters in this film. Hibiki is the awkward sad boy who has trouble connecting with everyone else in the anime. Uta, the manic pixie dream girl character, whose purpose is to bring the MC out of his shell. And Shin plays the role of a wise mentor, who looks after the boys in their parkour adventures. Shin is the only character other than Hibiki to have a hint of a backstory, with him having a picture of an inferred deceased family on his boat. All other characters have no depth, Makoto the scientist is solely used for exposition and fan service. It disgusts me. Like as a girl with tits I would NEVER sit with my chonka honkas on my desk, that is NOT even comfortable like wtf. Uta is, as stated, a spin on the classic manic pixie dream girl, who literally dies at the end turning into bubbles, leaving Hibiki a big old sad boy. Hibiki does have an auditory disorder, which is his reason for being isolated from others, but some girl comes along and suddenly IT\'S NOT A PROBLEM ANYMORE. He falls in love with her after ONE PROPER CONVERSATION where he trauma dumps, that is literally just him talking to her and Uta just stares at his lips (which were strangely plump and shiny). All Uta does is follow him around and laugh. Also, what the even is Hibiki wearing, crop top more like not top. I don\'t wanna see a man\'s belly button at all times. Also, not gonna lie, I lowkey ship Hibiki with his team-mate Kai over Uta, they had far greater chemistry. That cheeky kiss tease excited me for NOTHING.Enjoyment: 5This film was stunning, but as I said, art and story are different things. With the repertoire of people behind this film, I would expect better. These Netflix anime releases are CATFISHING ME AHHHHHH. I always go into them expecting more than they are. know I don\'t have any parents, just like everyone else here"".

Tolerated the story.Eve\'s track (without animation) convinced me to watch the movie and I feel the track perfectly conveys the emotion of the entire movie. The movie supplements it with vibrant colors and animations that carries momentum of the tunes being played (amazing audio/video mixing).The story is definitely not this movie\'s strong suite. It\'s capable of carrying the movie through emotion/hype, but to anyone prone to analyze in real time it will fall apart. There\'s a supernatural event occurring that is referenced all the time but it barely gets explored. It\'s nice in a sense it keeps a mystery up, but...conclusion left me disappointed. There are antagonists, which feel like cartoon villains, as they seem to only be ""evil"" to move the plot along. The story is having a massive identity crisis by touching on 3 themes and not really going all out on either of them. conclusion left me disappointed.

The story is having a massive identity crisis by touching on 3 themes and not really going all out on either of them.', ""'Bubble' is really two movies for the price of one. The first movie is a sci-fi apocalyptic retelling of 'The Little Mermaid'. The second movie is... parkour.What I can say about the first movie is that it has an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, that's where my praise ends. The characters are largely undeveloped and their motivations ignored. As a result, the climax and resolution feel hollow. The character design went above and beyond in differentiating the cast through accessories and quirks, but all of this means nothing when we learn nothing about them as people during the film.What I can say about the...second movie is that it's likely the reason the first movie falls flat. It's hard to develop plot and theme when 50% of the runtime is a parkour AMV. There's not much connection between, on one side, who the characters are, where they come from, what they want, etc. and, on the other side, the parkour. The parkour is just parkour. I suppose we can chalk up its presence in the film to the 'rule of cool' (that is, if you feel like parkour is cool). Yes, the parkour is well animated, but the narrative suffers from its inclusion nevertheless.If you're looking for something light after a particularly long day at work, or you want something playing in the background while you try to get to second base with your date, or if you're a huge parkour fan, then go for it; no judgment here. My review is written under the assumption that none of these are true. second movie is that it's likely the reason the first movie falls flat.

Yeah, well Bubble is essentially Tenki no Ko but with more parkour. It’s the same formula - beautiful visuals desperately attempting to cover up the absolute dumpster fire of a plot which is being showcased.It’s one of...those pieces of media where, if you told me they fully animated the entire thing BEFORE considering even a little bit of the plot, I would completely believe you. It’s seriously that incoherent.The only reason I’ve awarded Bubble a 4/10 as opposed to a 1/10 is because at least there were no points which left me laughing so hard that I was gasping for air, due to how absolutely pulled out of the director’s backside they were (gun found in a trashcan side plot, anyone?). Don’t get me wrong, Bubble doesn’t make any sense either, although I’ll give it credit for having characters that aren’t ENTIRELY cardboard cutouts like the aforementioned 2019 Shinkai movie (Uta at least has hints of development here, even if they don’t make much sense. Plus her character design is genuinely cute).Bubble is a film with pretty much no redeeming qualities apart from its animation.I won’t go on for too long, you get the point.In short, if you want to watch something pretty in the background, go for it.

The story is rather average, with many of the romantic elements being unremarkable. The setting is interesting but underdeveloped, serving only as a backdrop. The animation is well-done and utilizes many dynamic camera angles, which can sometimes be jarring but are mostly well-executed. The standout aspect of the ONA is Uta, whose character is exquisitely designed and steals the show whenever she appears on screen. Bubble is undoubtedly a feast for the eyes, showcasing impressive animation techniques and visually striking parkour scenes, but unfortunately, its lackluster plot...and underdeveloped setting fail to fully engage the audience. and underdeveloped setting fail to fully engage the audience.', ""I enjoyed the movie very much, the art was amazing and satisfactory.But the story left me with so many questions, to be honest, I'm confused.I'm also willing to accept that the answer may not matter, the story is perfect without those details.Still, this lack of answers is getting to me, I love it when we are presented with a lot of questions and all of them are answered by the end of the movie.A bit of SPOILERS:Where did the bubbles come from?What about her sister?Why Tokyo tower?Why Uta touches Hibiki, why does she turn into bubbles? "", 'When Prince of Stride was first announced, I said to myself how this should be a ton of fun, very thrilling and have great animation to go along with it all, however what we got didn\'t really deliver on all of these fronts all to well. So when I found out not too long ago that my favorite Japanese writer (Gen Urobuchi), legendary director Tetsuro Araki, the creator of Death Note (Takeshi Obata) and my favorite Japanese composer (Hiroyuki Sawano) were all teaming up to give us a parkour anime film with the amazing Wit Studio, I knew that I would get something that at...the very least wouldn\'t let me down like Prince of Stride did...And for me personally, it didn\'tStory - 7/10Albeit it not being something spectacular or too thought provoking, I found the story to be good enough given that they managed to establish the world by explaining what the bubbles are, its effects on Tokyo and how the survivors decided to live. That and they explained the concept of the parkour game very well, however I would have liked to see more of a variety from the games, like how the Undertakers used technology with their play style....That and even though I liked the metaphor of the ""spiral"" I think it could have been fleshed out moreCharacters - 6/10One thing I will say here is that this film had two newcommers casted as the lead, and although initially I could hear the inexperience in Hibiki\'s VA, as the movie progressed he found his stride and his voice acting in addition to the VA of Uta started to sound like one of someone that has experience to them.But as for the characterization, apart from Hibiki and Uta, everyone else could have used a lot more screen time in order to match the amount of development that the two leads had (Both leads imo were great though). And this here, in addition to what I said in the story section is why I feel like this would have worked better as a TV series instead of film because this way both things would have had more room and time flourishSound - 10/10Its Hiroyuki Sawano, there isn\'t really more that\'s needed to be said here lol, but one thing I will say is that both the OP and ED were pretty great too, and I can\'t wait to listen to the OST some more when its availableArt/Animation - 10/10Once again, Wit Studio has knocked it out of the park visually and with the combined efforts of their animators, mixed witht the character designs of Obata and the direction of Araki, we were blessed with tons of moments of brilliant animation during every single parkour scene straight up to the smaller and more intimate moments of close ups and backgrounds greatly and masterfully showcasing just how much time and detail was put into this film visually which in itself is almost if not right on par with the likes of a Makoto Shinkai filmEnjoyment - 9/10Even though I wish that this had more time to give us a more solid piece of work I still found myself very invested in the two leads and mesmerized by how beautiful the film was, all the while anticipating how the parkour matches will play out as well as if Uta makes it out in the end or not (Because this IS a story written by the Urobutcher himself lol)Overall - 8/10Bubble is a very ambitious piece of work undertaken by many giants in the anime inudustry and although it doesn\'t hit every mark on its target, there is still plenty here that\'s left to enjoy and even love and if you don\'t mind stories that aren\'t that deep, you won\'t be disappointed one bit, even if you only want to watch it for the eye candy. the very least wouldn\'t let me down like Prince of Stride did...And for me personally, it didn\'tStory - 7/10Albeit it not being something spectacular or too thought provoking, I found the story to be good enough given that they managed to establish the world by explaining what the bubbles are, its effects on Tokyo and how the survivors decided to live.

Honestly, a cool concept and something i would not mind watching more of. The landscape was interesting enough to keep me entertained. The show does well to use the Little Mermaid to set up its own story. The themes of destruction and restoration remain consistent throughout the show. There were some glaring issues i found.I think this story was very typical. We have the main character who is a loner and outcast who has the goal of figuring out where this song comes from. He...comes across the female MC who knows nothing of human stuff, somehow teaches her, and they fall in love. They are met with hooligans, and she must be taken away from him and he must fight the supernatural forces and they have social commentary at the end. If you did not like this synopsis, I can see why you might hate the movie. As for me, I was fine with it. I felt the pacing was a bit fast in some areas of the show but was fine.This whole story can be summed up to alien little MermaidArt:10/10To be honest, this movie really wowed me with the art and animation. It is no surprise that Studio Wit does well with its animation of parkour sequences thanks to working on Attack on Titan. However, I clearly saw traces of inspiration from Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song. There were several moments that had a close up on either of the main 2 characters and the art was very detailed. I found it to be quite stunning.Sound: 10/10I am a quite simple person when it comes to music. I felt the music paired well with the show and was banging my head to the music. I liked it.Enjoyment: I came for the action, and I was not displeased. I had a good time with the show as well as with the pretty colors across the screen.Character: 7/10Our main character Hibiki, is shown as a sort of a loner type who tunes people out with his headphones. It turns out that he has auditory hypersensitivity. It is revealed that he has this disability, and his mother slowly rejects him. This leads him to listening to the song of Uta and surviving a disaster. His main reason for being in Tokyo is to reach that sound he once heard. Fine motivation. My only issue with him is outside of him being less memorable i feel like they introduce this condition, and it seems to not really affect him later on. I have no idea what people with auditory hypersensitivity go through but his headphones are treated as the symbol of his isolation and he loses them to symbolize him being social with someone else. To me, I feel like his hypersensitivity just became irrelevant halfway into the movie.Similarly, we are introduced to a side character with a prosthetic leg who receives some great attention. We see this side character with his own parkour segment and even knocks a steel beam with his leg. Incredible.....and then, the Main character uses the bottom of the side characters feet as a launchpad near the end. It was an incredible moment and yet... the side characters leg somehow manages to shatter into pieces. Obviously, I do not know how prosthetics work but I would have thought his leg would have been shattered long ago.Uta is the second main character. She is used to parallel with the Little Mermaid because she is walking amongst humans, interacting, and falling in love with the male MC. I really had no issue with the way the story plays out to try to imitate the Little mermaid. i think they may have used it too much as later on, Uta recites several story points in the fairy tale to describe the same thing that happens in the movie. I did feel though that the introduction of her sister as an antagonistic force was shallow though.The rest of the side cast exists. They similar to the main characters, they are really forgettable and only serve the purpose of supporting the male character. I had no ill will towards them but they did not really make me care for them.I will say tho, there was an enemy team known as Undertaker who I thought was gonna be a main bad group but they were nothing important. They go to steal a side character from the MCs team to be used as motivation to do a battle. If Undertaker wins, they take the big ship that the MCs group lives on as a hideout. In hindsight, I thought it was going to be revealed that some organization had interest in the bubble phenomenon and was using this group to gain intel, especially on Uta. For some people who despise this trope, fear not, this did not have that happen. But I feel this buildup of Undertaker was kinda lacking. They had cool technology of water propelled shoes which helped propelled people farther and faster.Enjoyment: 10/10I had a blast with the show despite the lower scores for characters and story. I came for the action and left amazed by the visuals and soundtrack. The story and characters were not bad whatsoever. I enjoyed seeing parkour as well as the setting of a ruined Tokyo as their playground.overall, this show was a 9/10 for me. comes across the female MC who knows nothing of human stuff, somehow teaches her, and they fall in love.

One of the most boring films I've watched this year and one of the most boring animated films I've ever seen. Maybe not as dull as Ocean Waves or Earwig and the Witch but I still regretted spending time on this film instead of something else.Let's get the positives out of the way first: The animation is gorgeous. Literally the only reason why I didn't rate this lower. The animation is genuinely stunning and beautiful to look at and all the action sequences felt very fluid to watch....The sound was also pretty decent. The voice acting and soundtrack were both good.Everything else I did not enjoy at all. Weak and nonsensical story, flimsy worldbuilding, useless side characters and the two main characters I did not care about in the slightest. The reimagining they did for The Little Mermaid could've been interesting but it was pulled off in a way that I couldn't find any enjoyment or interest in. The sound was also pretty decent.

I found the music obnoxious and generic but I\'m sure other people will love it.The story is lacking in cohesiveness, it\'s almost like 4/5 separate episodes combined into a story and so there\'s this feeling of ""stopping and starting"" every 20-30 minutes or so. The actual contents of the story itself are just a tired cliche. The little mermaid be re-enacted with still charisma vacuum characters and a literal bubble organism is not exactly my idea of a compelling dramaSpeaking of the characters, what was there here to latch on to? The cast was nothing more than a...vehicle for the plot, which was pretty empty as I mentioned before. There\'s nothing more to this movie to latch on to.And that especially includes the world. The setting was cool conceptually, but they failed to ground it with a meaningful culture or realism. If this is a society of researchers, why are the only researches we see two adults that hang out with the blue blazes? There are things you need to explore with a post apocalyptic world. How does the economy work? What does society look like? Is there some kind of class system? Is there some form of law and order? What are the logistics of living in this society? These might seem like pointless criticisms to most people, but even if you\'re handling a fantastical premise, you need to ground it with something tangible and real that people can understand. Where are the criminals? the smugglers? the drug addicts? the lower class who can\'t afford to live anywhere else?

The visuals are stunning and the music is the best thing this movie had to offer. But beyond good animation and scintillating music, there\'s little to comprehend about this movie. In a way you could compare this with some of Makoto Shinkai\'s recent movies, especially ""Your name"" and ""Weathering with you"". All three boast great visuals, music and have a mysterious, supernatural backdrop/premise. But in the case of Your name and Tenki no ko, the main story gelled well with the background setting. In Bubble however, the story is all over the place. At one stage, it doesn\'t...even make sense. I\'m all in for non linear screenplay, but this one holds everything till the very last - and even when things get cleared at the ending, it isn\'t that convincing. Just because the story revolves around some supernatural cannot-be-explained premise doesn\'t mean things in the world can behave like whatever the writer/director wants it to be. And don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not saying Bubble is some mindless movie that runs on high production value. There was definitely a vision in making this movie, the ending is proof for that. But it feels like something got lost in the translation from paper to screen. In the end, it ends up being a movie where many scenes become enjoyable only due to the visuals and the theme music. even make sense.

The animation is incredibly fluid and the parkour, which comprises all of the ""action"" of the movie, is a genuine treat to watch. The artwork too is seriously stunning, though some weird face close ups are kind of jarring with how much more detailed they can be.That\'s where the praise stops.Following the cold open, the first dialogue we hear is the most egregious exposition dump I\'ve ever seen in any piece of fiction. I have never in...my life seen any piece of media speak down to its audience to such a degree. Dora the Explorer asking me where the map is feels less condescending and I so desperately wish I was joking.The bar is immediately set so low that Satan couldn\'t even play limbo with it.This awful dialogue stays unrelenting. The derivative plot, done a million times before and in an equally better number of ways, was clearly too big a risk for the writers to trust the audience with it. Absolutely nothing is left to the imagination.Every square inch of story is beaten to death with implacably ham-fisted disdain for the viewer.This wouldn\'t be nearly as glaring an issue as it is if the movie didn\'t think it was absolutely nailing it. It constantly shoots for unearned emotional beats and thinks the characters - most of whom are unnamed or only referred to by name a single time in the film - are able to pull on heartstrings.It\'s harrowing.Dozens of people - at least - looked at this script across multiple iterations, approved it, and performed it, all without enough pushback to make a difference.I\'ve never been so thoroughly shaken by a work so pathetic as to owe its entire tepid existence wholly to a nepotistic script writer position.Anyway, yeah, I don\'t like the movie.

A world sunken into an odd, bubble induced apocalypse makes for unique and colorful scenes, the parkour subplot turns the impressive feats of athleticism into an absolutely stunning feats of animation, and the character design is creative, unique and colorful - some might even say, 'bubbly'.

That's what Wit Studio's newest movie, Bubble, unfortunately turned out to be. Basically, five years ago, gravity-altering bubbles fell upon the world, followed by an explosion destroying Tokyo and trapping it in a bubble dome. Since then, kids have been using the gravity defying bubbles as a means to engage in dangerous catch-the-flag gang wars for fun. A young man named Hibiki tries a reckless stunt and almost drowns, but is saved by a mysterious wild girl who he names Uta. The...two of them bond, and Uta comes to know Hibiki and his friends, but another phenomenon threatens to decimate what's left of Tokyo. Yeah, not exactly a novel premise, but I'm of the philosophy that execution is important, and that even cliched characters and premises can be done well if you care and utilize them as much as you're able. Sadly, as much as Bubble tries, narratively it's kind of a mess.For one, the anime doesn't make much of an effort to really expand on its setting. Yeah, Tokyo's been destroyed and a bunch of its citizens flat out left, but how has the government reacted to it? Did the government just leave the illegal citizens to their own devices out of apathy, or are they perfectly okay with letting a bunch of kids running around so long as Science Lady is there to supervise them? The movie never really bothers to answer these questions, or really explore how Tokyo being destroyed affects the psyches of all the characters involved, other than saying that kids who lost their families gravitated there. It feels like the decimated Tokyo is more a prop and set piece for all the parkour action, and the gravity bubbles seem similarly put there just to justify having a bunch of teenagers performing stunts that realistically would be impossible for them to pull off. Plus, even the so-called gang wars themselves seem to serve little purpose to the story other than to give the movie a thin sense of conflict that doesn't really give it a lot of stakes. Basically, the movie's trying to tackle a bunch of different concepts and premises but failing to utilize any of them to their full potential.This also extends to the characters as well. Basically, other than Hibiki, none of the characters are remotely interesting or three-dimensional whatsoever. Hell, we barely learn anyone's names outside of some members of the main group. One character, Kai, never even so much as gets his name mentioned until an hour and ten minutes into the damn movie! If you can't even be bothered to name one of your main characters until late into the movie, that just shows you don't dare. Plus, Kai has this weird subplot where he's weirdly jealous of Hibiki for reasons the movie never elaborates on, but barely anything is done with it, and we also never learn why Shin and Makoto, the only two adults there, are taking care of this ragtag group of kids to begin with. Uta herself is little more than just a mysterious, feral waif who's there to be Hibiki's doomed love interest and a prop for tragedy porn, never being able to develop any sense of self. Also, the other parkour teams are just a complete waste of animation and are just there to provide artificial conflict that ultimately leads to nothing, especially since the movie never bothers to develop them beyond their assigned stereotypes. Ironically, Hibiki fares somewhat better, and the closest the movie gets to actually being good is having him suffer from some kind of auditory processing disorder, and a surprisingly well-depicted depiction at that. Honestly, had the movie done more with that and cut out all the other unnecessary stuff, it might have been good.Alright, that's all for the bad stuff, so let's get on to the good stuff. It's no surprise that Wit Studio went all out for the animation department, and it really shows. From the beautiful background art and eclectic but still down to earth character designs, to the epic action and sweeping camera angles watching every move from every direction, to the lighting and shot composition, the whole movie is visually stunning. I don't have as much to say about the soundtrack, as it's your typical Sawano fare, and while it is good, it feels like Sawano is just repeating the same sound he uses for all his other OSTs. He really ought to break out of his shell and do different things once in a while. Also, whose bright idea was it to give the movie a full anime opening sequence? It looks nice and all, but I feel like it was unnecessary. It didn't work for Your Name, and it doesn't work here. I really hope this doesn't become a trend for movies. And again, Hibiki's backstory was the best thing about the movie. Had Bubble gone all in on either Hibiki's drama or just being an action movie about a bunch of gangs, it probably would have been able to find stable footing. Alas, twas not to be.Sorry, Bubble. I really wanted to like you, and the movie does have some redeeming value. But in the end, Bubble made the grave mistake of trying to do too many things and never excelling at any of them, which proved to be its downfall. It's available for streaming on Netflix if you want a nice little time killer, but Bubble doesn't really offer anything beyond pretty animation and high paced action. two of them bond, and Uta comes to know Hibiki and his friends, but another phenomenon threatens to decimate what's left of Tokyo. Yeah, not exactly a novel premise, but I'm of the philosophy that execution is important, and that even cliched characters and premises can be done well if you care and utilize them as much as you're able. Sadly, as much as Bubble tries, narratively it's kind of a mess.For one, the anime doesn't make much of an effort to really expand on its setting. Yeah, Tokyo's been destroyed and a bunch of its citizens flat out left, but how has the government reacted to it? Did the government just leave the illegal citizens to their own devices out of apathy, or are they perfectly okay with letting a bunch of kids running around so long as Science Lady is there to supervise them? The movie never really bothers to answer these questions, or really explore how Tokyo being destroyed affects the psyches of all the characters involved, other than saying that kids who lost their families gravitated there. It feels like the decimated Tokyo is more a prop and set piece for all the parkour action, and the gravity bubbles seem similarly put there just to justify having a bunch of teenagers performing stunts that realistically would be impossible for them to pull off. Plus, even the so-called gang wars themselves seem to serve little purpose to the story other than to give the movie a thin sense of conflict that doesn't really give it a lot of stakes. Basically, the movie's trying to tackle a bunch of different concepts and premises but failing to utilize any of them to their full potential.This also extends to the characters as well. Basically, other than Hibiki, none of the characters are remotely interesting or three-dimensional whatsoever. Hell, we barely learn anyone's names outside of some members of the main group. One character, Kai, never even so much as gets his name mentioned until an hour and ten minutes into the damn movie! If you can't even be bothered to name one of your main characters until late into the movie, that just shows you don't dare. Plus, Kai has this weird subplot where he's weirdly jealous of Hibiki for reasons the movie never elaborates on, but barely anything is done with it, and we also never learn why Shin and Makoto, the only two adults there, are taking care of this ragtag group of kids to begin with. Uta herself is little more than just a mysterious, feral waif who's there to be Hibiki's doomed love interest and a prop for tragedy porn, never being able to develop any sense of self. Also, the other parkour teams are just a complete waste of animation and are just there to provide artificial conflict that ultimately leads to nothing, especially since the movie never bothers to develop them beyond their assigned stereotypes. Ironically, Hibiki fares somewhat better, and the closest the movie gets to actually being good is having him suffer from some kind of auditory processing disorder, and a surprisingly well-depicted depiction at that. Honestly, had the movie done more with that and cut out all the other unnecessary stuff, it might have been good.Alright, that's all for the bad stuff, so let's get on to the good stuff. It's no surprise that Wit Studio went all out for the animation department, and it really shows. From the beautiful background art and eclectic but still down to earth character designs, to the epic action and sweeping camera angles watching every move from every direction, to the lighting and shot composition, the whole movie is visually stunning. I don't have as much to say about the soundtrack, as it's your typical Sawano fare, and while it is good, it feels like Sawano is just repeating the same sound he uses for all his other OSTs. He really ought to break out of his shell and do different things once in a while. Also, whose bright idea was it to give the movie a full anime opening sequence? It looks nice and all, but I feel like it was unnecessary. It didn't work for Your Name, and it doesn't work here. I really hope this doesn't become a trend for movies. And again, Hibiki's backstory was the best thing about the movie. Had Bubble gone all in on either Hibiki's drama or just being an action movie about a bunch of gangs, it probably would have been able to find stable footing. Alas, twas not to be.Sorry, Bubble. I really wanted to like you, and the movie does have some redeeming value. But in the end, Bubble made the grave mistake of trying to do too many things and never excelling at any of them, which proved to be its downfall.

This project had big build up when it was announced that Wit Studio, who animated the first 3 seasons of Attack on Titan, was involved in this movie. It also had the director and producer of the first 3 seasons of Attack on Titan and legendary writer, Gen Urobochi, of Madoka Magica and Psycho pass fame was writing for Bubble (2022). It was also revealed one of the best anime composers, Sawano Hiroyuki, was going to compose for this film. It just screamed amazing!So imagine my disappointment...after watching this film when it turned out to be quite bland. Yes the animation is phenomenal, the music score is god tier and the world itself is pretty interesting. However, the plot is just a very typical boy meets girl situation and it never goes beyond that whatsoever. The characters are just generic, one dimensional and forgettable. I never connect or root for the main characters and the supporting characters just end up being there for the sake of it. There isn’t anything at stake until the last 30 minutes of the film. The first 100 is just a slow pace drag of occasional things happening.It’s a shame that with all these industry veterans, this is the best they came up with. At least the visuals and music is astoundingly good. after watching this film when it turned out to be quite bland.

But what I liked the most is that the story reminded me of the little mermaid… However, bubbble is more cool and not so ordinary like little mermaid. For example, the mermaid in bubble is a bubble and the prince aka Hibiki named the girl Uta, which in Japanese Uta means song. Also, bubble takes place in Tokyo and with the bubbles people there they do parkour. But, what surprised me more is that Hibiki...and Uta are connected because Hibiki means echo and Uta means song. This means that whose two were fated to meet each other!!

I was constantly blown away by the fluid animation and musical score, and I’ll definitely circle back and listen to this soundtrack quite a bit in...the future.

The characters are also for the most part serviceable to the plot, and the plot is... well, it's something.I got a sense the story took elements from several sources, though it didn't do enough to make itself unique or at least evoke a sense of closure. One source seemed to be Ride Your Wave, the primary element borrowed from that being its theme of accepting loss. Another source seemed to be Ponyo, the primary element borrowed from that being a sort of unusual romance. And the other source seemed to...be Penguin Highway, the primary element being the sci-fi phenomenon. They all also in some way share to varying degrees half-baked sequences for their climaxes. Personally, I'm fine with a work that puts themes above its story as long as it feels cohesive and earned (like Penguin Highway). I dislike works that fumble their themes and overly relies on superficial excitement and/or the audience to fill in the large gaps (like Ponyo). This story straddled the line between delivering something cohesive and something not really cohesive. The throughline of The Little Mermaid did make it feel more cohesive than not, yet that also made the story feel unoriginal and expected.This is definitely something worth checking out for the visual sequences. I wouldn't say the story itself is a flop, but it certainly could've used some work because it had a strong premise with lots of potential. be Penguin Highway, the primary element being the sci-fi phenomenon.

Lets find out!Story - 7/10This is a hard one. I really really liked the setting of the movie. It was such a unique setup for the parcour elements and made for some breathtaking scenery. The story moves forward very fast and doesn´t slow down. This made for a constant flow of great scenes back to back. However the main...plot in itself was not fleshed out enough. This is one of those ""Tf just happened?"" movies and sometimes that can be a good thing. But you either fully commit to it and not give any explanations to let the viewer analyse the scenes himself (a really great example would be ""Serial Experiments Lain"") ,or you don´t try it. The ending, while being a visual feast was not as satisfying as other anime movies who also went full spectacle in the end, namely ""Promare"",""Fate stay/night ; Heavens Feel"" or ""Weathering with you"" . Speaking of the latter, there are a LOT of similarities between the two. I usually don´t mind something like that and i am the last one who would accuse a movie of ""ripping off"", but here it was just a bit to much reused ideas, especially in the last quarter. Still, the backstory of our main character and the great pacing still makes for a really solid experience storywise.Art - 10/10By far the best animated movie i have seen since ufotable´s ""Fate stay/night : Heavens Feel"" Trilogy. This movie has redefined so many aspects of animation in its short runtime. The dynamic camera movement that director Tetsuo Araki loves to use since back in ""Attack on Titan"" has reached its peak with this movie. Every parcour scene was a visual feast, it felt fantastic running across and between Tokyos Skyscrapers. The character art was impeccable. Studio WIT is known for having an extra team for handling character movement and it really showed. The make-up animation made the close-up shots a joy to look at. The star of the movie are obviously the mysterious ""Bubbles"". Something like water bubbles can be really hard to animate because of how the light is reflected in it while moving. And finally i have to give a shoutout to the team doing the background art. I won´t spoil anything but there is a scene in the middle of the film that plays in a flower field.

This time, it is water that gets the spotlight. Everything from water dripping in a fountain, over sparkling bubbles, as well as full on underwater action scenes sounds perfect. Hiroyuki Sawano is BY FAR the single best composer in anime at the moment. ""Kill la Kill"", ""Guilty Crown"", ""Attack on Titan"" and ""Promare"" all had standout soundtracks and this movie is no different. While it isn´t his usual loud, bass-boosted style, it still set the tone in every single scene it was used in.Characters - 7/10Like many standalone anime-movies (exept ""A Silent Voice""), the movie doesn´t feature any standout characters. The main character received some nice development up until the end, but the story itself leaves just to many questions open which leads to unfinished character arcs. I still found the cast pretty likeable. The whole idea of having a team of talented parcour-runners taking part in races to the finish-type games is really cool and unique and gives each member of the team a significant roll to fill.

Visuals and animation carried characters sucked ass but i don't care I never remember characters from anime films anyway . One problem it had was there was no real antagonist well...the antagonist we got wasn't at all flesh out or and when we did get an antagonist they were kinda boring typical dooshbags. Another problem is that it felt like everything went right they never lost and there was never any consequences  the main character just kept winning he never really lost.

I wished the animators and directors took a different twist at the end rather than just going with the whole flow of it all.Character selection was pretty decent as well. We have your atypical brooding moody protagonist, his whole support system of friends...and of course some baddies who were pretty likable throughout the film.This anime is tagged as some form of sci-fi romance genre and I couldn't agree more to it.

Uta and Hibiki, the main characters give each other hope. Without Uta mysteriously showing up, Hibiki would still be some kid afraid of listening to the real world.The story itself was a beautiful thing to watch unravel. They made it work. I gave the story an 8 because it was predictable. I knew it was coming and I just hoped they displayed it well. I think that regardless of how predictable the ending was, they couldn't have ended it any better. It was emotional. It was both happy and sad. The story would've been a...10 if it weren't for the predictability.The animation style was cool to watch on screen. It wasn't the best animation ever, but in moments they really wanted you to focus on, the animation style got intense and detailed, precisely what it needed. I rated the art a 9 out of 10 because it worked really well with the feeling the movie was trying to give off.The sound was really well-done. It was kept simple but sweet. One tune that appears multiple times throughout the movie unites our two main characters, Uta and Hibiki. It continues to bring the two of them closer, and it helps bring the story to a closing. If Hibiki hadn't been able to hear that tiny tune, the movie never would have started in the first place. It was a 10/10 sound job.The character development shown throughout the movie is nothing short of inspiring. I've never seen such well-done and realistic character development before. Hibiki has a sensory issue where noises are projected louder for him than they are for others. He wears a pair of headphones all the time in order to muffle the noises he hears. This song that he keeps hearing is the only noise that he doesn't know the source behind. He can only assume that it is coming from the Tokyo Tower. Upon arriving at the tower, he falls underwater, completely helpless and unable to escape. Suddenly, a girl, Uta arrives and helps him. After this encounter, Hibiki grows closer to the girl. This allows him to not only open up to her but to the rest of the world. This is a cute way to show how important a single person can be in someone's life. For me, the characters were an overall 10/10.The enjoyment was a definite 10. There wasn't a moment that I wanted to pause the movie or look away. Even though the story was predictable, it was still entertaining and kept you guessing about other plotlines before the climax.Overall I give Bubble a 9/10. It was a great movie and I recommend you watch this. It was entertaining, the animation was great compared to most, and the audio was incredible.

But it's refreshing to watch something devoid of the usual tropes, with some of them being shouting attack names, never-ending monologues or conversations in the middle of a fight scene, plot armor that's so ridiculous to the point it makes no sense, power of friendship, exaggerated facial expressions, and so forth. All of these are prevalent in most action anime. I get it. That's just how it works.Bubble, however, is devoid of these tropes. That alone shouod be an obvious indicator of why I appreciate it so much, though it is...most certainly necessary to note that Bubble is not action-based like the tropes I listed.The premise is a breath of fresh air. Partly. I don't mind it being a mixture of Weathering With You and The Little Mermaid. Whoever came up with this has added something new to it. The bubble phenomenon. Most other anime I've watched are a simple rehash of something else. Maybe the issue here is my not having watched many anime, but that doesn't matter at all. I have my own preferences that don't align with those of others'. Another thing I like about Bubble is the total lack of cringe scenes, seemingly forced humor, and pointless fanservice.The only downsides I see here is a plot evoking confusion, and lack of sufficient explanation.

It has some still shots that are beautiful. And in some moments the animation and the art stand out a lot but not in the whole movie. The very wit animation when they do parkour (reminds me of when they animated snk with the three-dimensional maneuvering team). The animation DECENT does not seem to me something so remarkable but well I had to fill it with something good. Let's close in what seems to me more or less, more more than less...but that's it.So… why four?Well here's the bad:The script was written by Urobuchi, a scriptwriter who wrote two of my favorite anime. And in this movie he unfortunately he did anything for my taste. Sawano did not stand out as much as he commented above on the good side either. Let's see the soundtrack of the movie is fine but I expected more coming from him.The story is lousy, the world building is horrible, the characters are re-contra re-cliches. It is that of the characters not one stands out, NOT ONE. They are all horrible. The protagonist is as generic as he could be, Uta doesn't tell me ANYTHING (and apart literally). When he already learned to speak Uta it seems that he is going to say something super important but nothing, very disastrous dialogues. As for the rest, they all seem bad to me.The movie lasts almost 2 hours and NOTHING happens. But when I say that nothing happens, it means that nothing happens. When the movie was an hour old I thought it was going to come with the entire climax of the movie, but NO! Nothing happened. What is the climax of the movie? That they kidnap Makoto? And they make a race to rescue her and that's it... that's it? Or maybe I'm focusing too much on the climax and the idea of \u200b\u200bthe movie was just to have good animation, do parkour AND A WAIFU!. And where is everything else???This movie really doesn't say anything. And they don't explain anything. Why did the bubbles attack Tokyo? Hibiki's mother?Also, between the main characters, it was barely explained why they were attracted to each other in the first place, or why they made some of the decisions they made apart from the Prince and Mermaid fairy tale.I came with very high expectations and unfortunately they did not meet.4/10.*Spanish review with SPOILERS**Reseña con SPOILERS*Voy a dividir la reseña en lo bueno y lo malo:Lo bueno:Técnicamente y en cuestión de dirección es bastante bonita.

The overall story is very poor but could\'ve been made decent with some changes, like putting more thought to the overall reason why this whole scenario was happening. I also found the overuse of quoting ""My little mermaid"" redundant and lost its impactfulness very fast.The art and sound of Bubble is amazing and was what still...gave me a lot of enjoyment while watching this. Some scenes were like straight from a music video which makes me think that you almost get the same enjoyment than watching Eve\'s music videos with great art.There was couple scenes that I quite enjoyed but it was all either due to the beautiful art or a nice action scene with good sound design, which wouldn\'t have really needed the context of this movie at all. Maybe if this was either 20-30 minutes shorter or the time had been used to make the story and world building overall better this could\'ve been 8 or 9 to me, but I cannot give this more than 6 with the lack of substance in the story.So if you want to watch beautiful art and good music this is an okay watch, however there is probably other movies that have those with better story.I personally knew I wanted to watch this because of Eve\'s opening and this having Mamoru Miyano as a voice actor.

The initial premise, the location, the minor past we're shown are rather unique and my expectations were a lot higher than the movie I ended up watching.

The music was another decent aspect though, I did enjoy the accompanying audio, it felt fitting and...almost whimsical, but it wasn't enough to drag this any higher than a 6/10 personally.All in all, the only strong point is the visuals and the music. almost whimsical, but it wasn't enough to drag this any higher than a 6/10 personally.All in all, the only strong point is the visuals and the music."", ""I truly wanted to like this, but the story is not at level. It was actually below mediocre imo. I just couldn't feel any real empathy for the characters. even with all the drama it didn't touch my heart at all. Movies like Your silent voice or Your Name have an story 20 time better than this movie. It's unfortunate because the animation and quality of the art is an outstanding 11/10! What a shame. I will only recommend this movie to peoples interested in the anime industry or peoples that just enjoy watching high quality art, but don't expect great character development nor good...story.Salutations. story.Salutations."", ""Unfortunately, being animated and having music aren't merits worth giving this one any time of day you have.Reading further will lead to spoilers so if you wish to avoid that: Bubble isn't good enough that you should put your time here rather than something better, whether it's for its visuals or not.You've read the original The Little Mermaid story, right? Then you've seen the film. The story very explicitly references the work throughout the experience but rather than taking the work and being transformative with it, it just plays out exactly as you would expect. It's not as if taking reference from other works and...using it is wrong, but the problem lies in that if nothing is done with that inspiration, what would be the point in watching that work over experiencing the original instead.There are stories that reference old material all the time and remain unique by doing something new with it, to give an example in anime the Your Name movie comes to mind as it takes from an old 80's novel in Japan. And in Your Name is adds more which previous body swap stories didn't have including a unique theme. This makes the story of Bubble feel forgettable in comparison as it has no theme or message that hasn't been done in countless stories before. To add to how pointless and forgettable the film is the fact that there's a lot of characters that could be removed from the plot yet not affect it meaningfully whatsoever. To let my point sink in, try a thought-experiment if you seen the movie and remove one character with a speaking role from every scene and estimate how little the plot would change or how easily replaceable they could be by another character. I claim this to be a flaw since time is being put in these character and yet will be immediately forgotten the moment the credits roll, it makes the film feel incomplete. To be more clear, my point is side-characters that don't contribute to the plot or story yet still take your precious time feels like mismanagement.To add to the previous point of feeling incomplete, there's more than plenty factors in the world of Bubble that's left with no clear conclusion. Although in it defence as well, those plot points don't really have to be focused on as they're irrelevant to the story. I'll also take the chance to praise the film for thinking deep enough about the world to have people inhabit destroyed Tokyo for believable reasons like scientists researching the bubble and juveniles being juvenile. This is likely due to Urobuchi's hand in the writing for the film.And with all this said, is there a point to the story? At the least, this movie does have a message to give to the world, but it's told to the audience so directly it'll disengage you from the experience. The message being it's worth risking pain to connect to others. No thought is needed to be put in to understand it, A boy that closes himself of from others because it hurts him to hear and an alien girl who can't touch him tries to connect with him.It plays out exactly as you'd think...My issue isn't that it'd predictable, my issue is that it's been done before AND better in other works and so I ask what actually makes this special. We're all thinking it was a little disappointing and you aren't wrong in thinking so.4/10 for being so uninspired using it is wrong, but the problem lies in that if nothing is done with that inspiration, what would be the point in watching that work over experiencing the original instead.There are stories that reference old material all the time and remain unique by doing something new with it, to give an example in anime the Your Name movie comes to mind as it takes from an old 80's novel in Japan.

To be more clear, my point is side-characters that don't contribute to the plot or story yet still take your precious time feels like mismanagement.To add to the previous point of feeling incomplete, there's more than plenty factors in the world of Bubble that's left with no clear conclusion. Although in it defence as well, those plot points don't really have to be focused on as they're irrelevant to the story. I'll also take the chance to praise the film for thinking deep enough about the world to have people inhabit destroyed Tokyo for believable reasons like scientists researching the bubble and juveniles being juvenile. This is likely due to Urobuchi's hand in the writing for the film.And with all this said, is there a point to the story? At the least, this movie does have a message to give to the world, but it's told to the audience so directly it'll disengage you from the experience. The message being it's worth risking pain to connect to others. No thought is needed to be put in to understand it, A boy that closes himself of from others because it hurts him to hear and an alien girl who can't touch him tries to connect with him.It plays out exactly as you'd think...My issue isn't that it'd predictable, my issue is that it's been done before AND better in other works and so I ask what actually makes this special. We're all thinking it was a little disappointing and you aren't wrong in thinking so.4/10 for being so uninspired"", '*SPOILER FREE* For me, this is one of those ""I enjoy it a lot but it\'s not good"" type shows. I\'ll try to explain what I mean.Story: 4I really don\'t understand why they took the route they did. I feel like they could have used this whole ""bubble"" and parkour theme in a different plot setting and it would have unfolded so much better story-wise. The whole relation to the already existing story seemed kind of unnecessary, and I could have just watched them do parkour for an hour and a half.Art: 9I decided to watch this because of how beautiful it looked, and...believe me it\'s great. The animations of the jumps and the lights are all so pretty. I just wish they didn\'t use these random ""detailed"" images for certain aesthetic shots (e.g: the faces of the characters at some points). If you watch the movie, you will understand what I mean by this.Sound: 10I love the soundtrack. I might just be me being a sucker for soundtracks of any video games or movies I watch, but sound adds so much for me, and so this was just an easy 10 personally.Character: 6The characters were overall pretty normal, and I really wish we could see the other side characters in deeper light. I know they aren\'t main characters, but they serve almost no purpose, and so I wish I could feel like I know them a bit better. Also the main character (guy) is developed a bit too fast imo, but idrk how to feel.Enjoyment: 8Only because it was so memorable for me, I loved watching them jump around and do their races. It\'s something I personally never really see before, and I just really liked that. I honestly blurred so much of the rest of the movie out which is why my score is high.Overall: 7I give 7 (""Good"" in MAL\'s score) because I think what I liked, I liked a lot, but there are just too many issues with plot and development that make this movie lackluster. I really just wish they made the parkour the center of the story and made it longer, because man I watch the Eve music vid for it and I just can\'t get over those scenes. Just my opinion tho.

It wasn't because I had started out eating ravioli however. The animation is absolutely breath taking.DETAIL: The details are phenomenal. They added DUST in the air when the scene was still. Which is very realistic and honesty really relaxing to look at. I don't know what else to say to indicate how much detail was in this movie. If dust isn't enough to describe how much detail they added, I am unaware of what would.STORY: It was good, but there wasn't much of...character developments. I am favorable of a good development story. That is the only down of this movie. Otherwise, it was FANTASTIC.MUSIC: Fantastic. I got a bit of AOT vibes. I wouldn't be surprised if they hired the same music producer. Not saying the movie had any AOT like scenes... in a sense. There is a bit of an annoyance with the main tune though. I didn't really enjoy how much it was replayed. I do enjoy it more with the other instruments used in the soundtrack, so I suppose it was just that high pitch tune I wasn't very fond of.There were some questions that never got answered however, and it will be discussed in the end of this review.OVERALL: I loved it. It would have been absolutely perfect if I was given enough character development for me to emotionally connect more with the characters.This is my own interpretation in the movie, but if Hibiki really was intended to have autism, I love it even more. If he didn't, oh well, it really, really would have fit in well here with the story line.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON:Okay yall, why did the big galaxy bubble even come to the planet anyway? I feel like that is a HUGE point that needed to be made for this movie to make much of any sense.Also.... WHY IS UTA A BUBBLE? Her sister is the main source of the.. bubble galaxy, but Uta is one of the tiny floaty bubbles? Is each bubble a family member???? And why is her sister the center and not a parental figure or someone other than a sister? Of all things, a sister. They could have included that the parents are dead, but they didn't so I dont know why. WAIT, DO THEY EVEN HAVE PARENTS? HOW DID THEY COME TO EXISTENCE? ok, so many questions....Then I have a problem with why Uta's sister wanted her to stay? What's the reason? I thought maybe like the story of the little mermaid it would be to keep Uta safe, but if that was the case, why did Uta's sister not freak out until Hibiki was giving Uta the necklace?Why did the people that try to kill a team member suddenly want to help them?

Great animation and visuals paired with an interesting and unique setting. This movie suffers a lot from lack of time. We are introduced to so many interesting characters that really needed at least an episode each to be fleshed out. Instead, they just take little to no screen time. The whole ""bubble phenomenon"" was never fully explained. Overall the movie was really fun, but it lacked depth. It had enormous potential that got squashed by the time constraints.

The setting is beautiful. The portrayal of post-apocalyptic Tokyo is similar to the one found in Makoto Shinkai's Weathering With You. Generally, the film gives the impression of a weaker, incomplete attempt at replicating the aforementioned movie.The soundtrack is neither brilliant nor terrible. There isn't much to say in this regard. In fact, it might be quite underwhelming, considering it was composed by one of the biggest names in the industry.Sadly, the characters aren't compelling either. Many are...unremarkable, and the viewer is not given an insight into their former lives, aside from less than a handful of characters. The viewers don't spend enough time with them. It feels as if there is a noticeable surplus in unneeded characters. Consequently, the majority become nothing more than caricatures to fill the void and progress the plot. There is little reason to care for or resonate with any of them.The film works well as a way to kill time. The art and animation is eye-catching to say the least, and provides mind-numbing enjoyment. I can't imagine the vast amount of work that has been poured into the animation itself. The movements are incredibly fluid and this is perfectly showcased in the art of parkour.I'm quite disappointed that Gen Urobuchi's writing, which I adored in Madoka Magica, happens to be the biggest defect in this film. Perhaps, this film embodies the idea that a highly acclaimed production line-up does not guarantee a phenomenal product.

That's not to say mystery isn't an effective storytelling device, but there's a difference between creating a story and leaving people clues as to what could be going on and throwing you into a story with no clear purpose and expecting that lack of base to...pan out.

I was super hyped for this movie, but it turned out to be a lacklustre retelling of The Little Mermaid with a parkour element that, to be honest, just felt out of place.Story: 4/10If you asked me what the story of this movie was, I wouldn't be able to tell you. It had something to do with parkour, and gravity, and Tokyo Tower. It was confusing to follow, and if I'm being honest I was too bored to bother figuring it out. Nothing in this movie felt important...to the plot. Even the main character felt unimportant. I don't see what Uta herself added to the plot at all, and I'm convinced the movie would've been just the same without her. That's how unimportant it all was. If I had to describe the story in any way, it would be The Little Mermaid meets Weathering With You, but in the worst way possible.Art: 9/10But credit where credit is due, this movie is stunning. Right up there with Your Name and Weathering With You. If you're just looking for something aesthetically pleasing then sure, give this film a go. It's pleasant to look at.Characters: 2/10With the exception of Uta, who at least has the added personality trait of 'cat girl', every single character in this movie was bland and just plain boring. Makoto is smart, Hibiki likes to keep to himself, and I can't think of a single individual trait for any other character in this movie as they are literally all just carbon copies of each other. You will find more interesting versions of these characters in any other piece of media.Enjoyment: 5/10This movie felt so meh. It kept me occupied for 1hr40, but the whole time I was watching it I was kind of just waiting for it to end. But I can't necessarily say I didn't enjoy this film, even though I can't pick out anything I liked other than the visuals (and maybe Makoto).

Its essentially a love story, yet not one that is the most obvious. This is a love of what makes us human. This is essentially a retelling of a story, one that existed before a certain gigantic cartoom based company retold it. I wpnt spoil what it is, but ots not exactly hidden in easter eggs within this film, its quite obviously referenced.The first thing ill comment on is thr animation. Its possibly the most beautifully animated colour pallete I have seen.  Lets be real though, its Wit Studios and i think...we all know what they are capable of. Nevertheless, despite what they have delivered before, i still believe this is a step forward in animation. I wouldnt say it was better, season 3 of AoT has some of the most dramatic and exciting animation i have seen. I do believe however, this is a move forward to what we should expect the remainder of this decade to look like. It really is stunning. Its vibrant, its smooth, its dripping with colour and delivers parkour animation seemlessly. For me, this is strong 9/10 on the animation front.Musically, it also delivers. Considering that sound is the main connection between our main characters, Uta and Hibiki, it rather prominent. What I loved here is how the score interacts with characters directly, their dialogue forms part of the music. Taking away musicals, it is very very rarely seen where there is a direct link between the characters and music, spmewhat 4th wall breaking but not. Setting this glowing positive for me to one side, the score in general is really great. It fits the world and the animation perfectly. Musically, this is a strong 8/10.This retelling really is original. Further, this is one of theain things i love about anime. There isnt another medium on earth that could pull off this story like anime does. For me this story is split into two chunks. The first chunk is our introduction to Hibiki. The last chunk is the conclusion of Hibiki and Uta. My first gripe is though there is some development of Hibiki, nothing happens with every other character. Though this may not be an issue to some, when we get to the later chunk, when emotions are displayed from the characters, due to their lack of exploration, for me, the emotions they convey arent believable. In addition, i feel these two chunks where stuck together and was left wishing more time was spent to tie in the scene and character setting with the conclusion. Although the pacing was ok, for me, this film lacks the character development that could have made it great.Its a good film, but sadly a 7 is the highest i could give it, and I really would want to go higher, i just cant.

The many parkour scenes are all well done, with only a few recycles of the animations, which are only noticeable if looked at carefully. The other parts are, in any case, good, although they don\'t stand out.There are few frames in which the drawings are more detailed and shadowed, which is a choice that I didn\'t like, as they are random, unexpected moments, and the contrast with the general...style of the film makes them weirder to the beholder. Still, I think that for many it\'s a nice feature.All the merits of the animation are yet overshadowed by a complete lack of any organic story. The plot does not stand for itself, along with characters that are the very definition of uselessness. No supporting character is pivotal to the film and the abused concept of a post-apocalyptic Tokyo is tedious. If you cut out half of the cast, the plot remains unaffected, in my opinion. Even the two protagonists will not leave you anything. The protagonist\'s backstory is supposed to give the viewer hints about the story and encourage sympathy for the character, yet it fails in both, especially in the latter. Uta is not original nor remarkable in any way, except for its ""catchphrase"", the soft sing, which I honestly wouldn\'t qualify as an important quality to remember for a main character. The OST support the scenes, but it is not memorable. Thus, at the end of the film, the viewer remains with many questions unresolved and plotholes. If the aim of the film was a modernized version of ""The Little Mermaid"", by which the film is inspired, the objective completely failed.I would suggest this film only to those who are willing to shut off their mind for a couple of hours and want just to get mesmerized by the animation. style of the film makes them weirder to the beholder.

Seriously. When it was first announced everyone thought it would be something amazing, cus of the people who were working on it, but I've honestly learned to not judge shows or movies based on who they were made by. The visuals and sound design are amazing, I was very intrigued by the detailed eyes and the stunning action. I liked the world it sets up. I however do not like the direction the film was steered in. After watching so many anime, I've encountered a very common theme, that being some-shut-in-boy-meets-a-quirky-girl-and-she-changes-his-life-and-then-they-have-to-part-ways-for-some-plot-reason. And let me tell...you I'm tired of this trope. I'm done. I've never been annoyed by a story like this. From the start, right after meeting Uta, the story is just...predictable. The characters are all blank slates with an unforgettable personality shoved on top. I can't remember a single name except Uta. I don't even remember the climax or the ending.I'm so lost in what the film wanted to do, which bumps my score from an original 6 to a 5. This film could've been something really great, but really it was just a whole cluster of nothingness. you I'm tired of this trope. I'm done. I've never been annoyed by a story like this.

It's honestly not that good, and the only thing carrying it was the animation. While watching it, I was really hoping for it to be good because of how stunning the art was, but the story was extremely lackluster. The romance seemed forced, and none of the characters were fleshed out and I felt no connection towards any of them.As for the love aspect, I don't like how rushed it was. However, I'm generally not a fan of the love at first sight trope,...so I might be too critical of it. Anyways, I feel like there wasn't exactly a coherent build up to the love. Hibiki originally seemed quite offput by Uta, yet when he randomly remembered she kissed him, he just starts to like her. They spent very little time with each other and didn't have many bonding moments, which is why I feel it was forced. Also, the fact that everyone from BB felt so compelled to save her and risk their lives for her during the second bubble fall was weird, considering they had basically just met her. I'm also a little disappointed they didn't really touch on Kai's crush on Makoto. It would've been cute, but it was kinda forgotten after it being mentioned a few times. I wish I could blame the flawed romance upon the short amount of time it was given to unfold, but other anime movies have done leagues better in even shorter time.The story was pretty bland and predictable. As mentioned in other reviews, it felt like a culmination of other anime's plots. I feel like the parkour part was a little odd, and didn't exactly fit with the story, but it made for some amazing animation, so I won't complain too much. I wish we saw Shin do more parkour though. He was an interesting character that I wish got more screen time. Also, it's really weird how the Undertakers got developed in the story. When they were first introduced, I honestly thought they'd be the main villains, and that girl with the talking device would have more to her. The Undertakers had literally kidnapped Makoto, injured Hibiki, and cheated in the games, so the fact they helped BB later on was unexpected. After their little arc, they randomly turned good for some reason and lent their boots to BB to save Uta. They had no reason to help them, and I don't see why they would, especially after being introduced as somewhat villains.The art and music were on another level. Honestly the four points I give this movie are because it was so wonderful to look at. I do art myself, so I was just admiring some of the shots of Hibiki and Uta. Hibiki's character design is a little generic, but he's pretty regardless, and so is Uta. Some of the background scenes were so nicely done as well. The music also fit the story and art and was pleasing to hear.As a character, Hibiki didn't really have much to him. There wasn't really any character development for him besides him randomly liking Uta. Uta was handled a bit better, the progression of her turning into bubbles was interesting, and although her love for Hibiki still seemed rushed, it was a bit more genuine than Hibiki's love. As for the other characters, I actually felt like Makoto had decent screen time. She didn't really develop persay, but she was just a good character. I liked her along with Kai, but Kai didn't get much screen time. I wish he got more, because his parkour was pretty cool and I loved his character design. Shin also had some decent screen time and a bit of development, even though I wished to see him more.Overall, the story was weak and it was hard to develop a connection to any of the characters, but the animation was incredible. Honestly at some part it was hard to sit through, as it was kind of boring and predictable, but I wanted to finish it for the art. Certainly, it's not the worst anime I've seen, but I feel like animation like that was wasted on a story so bland. so I might be too critical of it.

As expected the animation in this movie is really well done and its really good to look at but there\'s also some elements that lack the refinement u would expect al though i would stay its still a good movie but at it\'s core the story is really simplistic at best without going too much into detail this story is kind of a retelling of the fairy tale classic ""my little mermaid"" it\'s about a guy named hibiki which in this case would refer to the prince...in the fairy tale and uta who is in aspects the little mermaid. If u look at the story through this perspective it is okay at best but it\'s nothing amazing since it\'s sort of a story most people have seen or heard dozens of times. The parkouring deffinetly looks amazing and u can 100% classify this as eye candy but the story is nothing to write home about the villain or how ever u wanna see them called ""undertaker"" is just to vauge and unexplained kind of like almost everything like hibiki\'s mom who shows up for about 5 minutes of the movie at best and just shows that she couldn\'t handle being around hibiki cause of his condition and the stress it bought her besides that almost everything is explained in a manner that if u don\'t catch on immediately u won\'t get what is going on. For example why all the people are still where they are in the first place. i would say the movie did a good part putting it blunt in re telling the ""my little mermaid"" story in a rather unique jacket.I would say watch the movie if watch for animation cause then it\'s deffinetly up to par, But if you\'re here for an amazing story i would say look somewhere else.Story: 7Art: 10Sound: 10Characters: 6Enjoyment: 9Overal: 7 in the fairy tale and uta who is in aspects the little mermaid.

I don't have anything else to say.Voice Acting: It's not bad. It had a mixture of great veterans and rookies. And they did a good job....Music: It's Sawano Hiroyuki, and he did what was expected from him. The opening and ending songs by Eve and riria was great. I'm a fan of Eve I'm more than satisfied with the song. And riria's voice is also great.The bad part is the plot. The one in charge of writing was Urubushi Gen, who is undoubtedly one of the best out there in the industry. But he did a rather underwhelming job here. In the middle of other great parts, the bad writing stood out more. The plot had no explanation or any proper backstory. Just some supernatural things happening without any reason. The characters had no developments at all. The female protagonist literally had nothing in her. It wasn't even explained what she actually is.The main problem is no questions were answered. Why, what, how- nothing at all.In conclusion, if you're in the mood of watching something for cool animations, great visuals and score then I absolutely recommend it. But if you are like me, searching for a good story then don't watch this movie. Music: It's Sawano Hiroyuki, and he did what was expected from him.

Ontop of that, Gravity seems to be distorted, making objects float - Perfect Parkour Playground.The Art and Animation is absolutely great.

I enjoy anime for colors, camera movement, and frames that typically can\'t be done with actual people, so I was very intrigued when I saw there was a parkour movie coming out.Story:The story seemed a bit thrown together, especially towards the end. I felt like there wasn\'t enough time to properly build-up to the choices the movie took, but it wasn\'t something that ruined the film...for me. The story revolves around a phenomenon where bubbles rained from above that altered gravity and ended up focused on Tokyo. The people of Tokyo left, leaving behind a city that became inhabited by youth that had nowhere else to go or whose parents perished in the phenomenon. Parkour battles became the culture and are more or less the central point of the story.Art:It\'s a movie. The colors were nice and I enjoyed them immensely. The camera movement and animation were clean, and a lot of the shots made me very happy. I got what I was expecting when it came to a parkour movie. Lots of fluid, fast-moving action.Sound:I think the sound was pretty spot on. The tempo fit perfectly for faster parkour scenes, and a lot of the audio was pleasant to the ears. It definitely added to the movie rather than subtract from it.Characters:Pretty simple characters for almost everyone. The ""villains"" had a justifiable and relatable reason, but they aren\'t the main focus, just a minor antagonist in the first half. There weren\'t any annoying characters, and I enjoyed the team dynamic at the end, but no one was exceptionally unique. There is a major focus on similarities to ""Little Mermaid"", which becomes a driving plot point. It was a little strange but definitely unique and it wasn\'t taking away from the movie in my opinion, so I\'m not complaining. The characters all looked unique as well and after the first shot with each person that plays any role in the movie, I could recognize them apart from each other.Enjoyment:If you were interested in some cool shots, or just need something to kill some time, I\'d recommend giving this movie a go. I found it pretty enjoyable and don\'t regret spending the time to watch it. The parkour aspect was new to me in anime and I enjoyed it quite a bit, which was the main reason I picked this up in the first place.Overall:Overall, I\'d give this movie a mid to high 7, so I\'ll just round it up to an 8. I can definitely see why someone might not enjoy it as much as I did, especially with the strange story choices later on, but I came for the parkour and animation and am quite sastified with that. for me.

(Srry if my English broke-)Story (5): As the synopsis said, on the last paragraph I thought the secrets of HOW the bubble is built would me revealed. In reality, it made me even more confused. Why? First, there\'s too many scene of Hibiki touching the ""bubble"" of Uta, and it\'s fully revealed on the ¾ of the movie like, WHAT.Second, the end was like- Uta drained, and...the bubble left was following Hibiki in his future competition. Then, it didn\'t explain Tokyo in the future (Ik it\'s explained for the construction whatsoever, but shouldn\'t the kids getting detention bcs it\'s ILLEGAL to parkour (said on the snyopsis paragraph 2).The story was alike w/ Tenki no Ko (Weathering with You), it\'s kinda guessed, too (how Uta made it referred to The Little Mermaid). I thought it\'s Action Sci-fi, but I think it\'s more like Action Drama?Art(9½): The art is a BLAST. Litteraly every frame could be a WP!! What I less-like is how did a man (Hibiki) do such sport, but he didn\'t get muscle-buffed, and his beet is more likely- feminine?(seen when he started to walk to his past self) But overall it\'s fire. I like your style :)Character(6): (I will only fill the details on Uta & Hibiki) Uta is such a mystery. Until the film ended I was still confused w/ her past. ""Who\'s that sister?"" ""So she\'s Ariel?"" But what I caught in the story, she was a bubbly & sweet (also strange) person. Her character development.. is just her voice. I thought she will have a ""strange"" character development, but she just remain the same. Standing out to be ""strange but perfect(?)""As for Hibiki, he\'s also a mystery. ""Where\'s his father?"", etc. He grew so much (for a 5-yr), especially when he met Uta. From the VERY INTROVERTED BUT STOOD OUT one to be softer.Other characters remain a mystery, too. Like the rest of the members, Makoto (prof), Shin (man w/ a leg), and the rest. Like Undertaker, or the ""crew who saved the fallen ones"". But yeah it\'s just a movie, if the side&back characters got their scene time longer / w/ their own past, it\'ll be a series.Sound(8): The BGM, OP, and the ED fits the movie pretty well. It\'s kinda sad that sometimes the BGM stood out more than the own dialogs.Overall(7): The story was & the characters didn\'t stand out evenly, but the art & the sound was stunning. the bubble left was following Hibiki in his future competition.

The story has it's touching moments but it really is nothing special. The characters beside the main 2 also don't really get any development, so that could also have been a lot better.The soundtrack is phenomenal, Hiroyuki Sawano did a wonderful job and it really made the emotional moments better. I really enjoyed it when watching, but it doesn't compare to the greatness of many other anime movies.Overall its a...7 for me, it has its moments. 7 for me, it has its moments."", 'yeah umthe movie sucksI think it was trying to be deep but ends up overestimating its depth and falls flat.The artwork and animation is gorgeous.

The character close up shots were as beautiful as they were in Vivy (another anime from wit studio).The sound design is top notch as wellwith sawano composing the music is a cherry on top is what i would say if the movie was actually good but unfortunately it just isn\'t...the characters are bland as heckdidnt care about any single one of themit just feels that this was supposed to be a music video or something but they made it into a movie so that wit studio could flex a little more than they already have.trash filmdont recommend it the characters are bland as heckdidnt care about any single one of themit just feels that this was supposed to be a music video or something but they made it into a movie so that wit studio could flex a little more than they already have.trash filmdont recommend it', ""Evren çok güzel tasarlanmıştı tam bir görsel şölen bayıldım.

With its magnificent visuals and a quality ost, we discover an enchanted Tokyo, in an enormous bubble, where groups of young people live their lives to the fullest by doing parkour through the city that has become deserted because it is dangerous. Independent and autonomous, these kids have understood that their paradise is not order and security, but this feeling of freedom while they do their passion despite the danger it can represent. It is almost like a Makoto Shikai movie, like Tenki no Ko, there are...so many things to do with this beautiful universe that we quickly get hooked. The story is very poetic, it puts us back in our place, as an insignificant part of a bigger universe, so magnificent functioning in a cyclic way, at all scales. A beautiful but ephemeral story, a meeting, a girl who like the little mermaid met her prince charming, but ends up having to return to the sea and transform herself into foam (here into bubbles). Caught in the universe thanks to the great visuals, one can quickly be charmed by this simple but touching story. But like a dream, as soon as you pay a little attention to the details, you quickly become aware of the inconsistencies, and you end up waking up, and quickly moving on. Bubble doesn\'t try to do something really deep and coherent in its story, it\'s far from the talent of Shikai and its deep story of Tenki no Ko, and it\'s probably because of that that so many people were disappointed by the result. The big flaw of Bubble is its worldbuilding, nothing is explained about the logic of the world, simply because there is none. I\'m telling you, it\'s a dream, with a lot of inconsistencies.Let\'s take an example, spoilers ahead. Towards the end of the movie, Shin\'s prosthesis is perfectly fine to hit the steel of the Tokyo tower AND good enough to continue doing inhuman parkour without any problem, but it breaks when Hibiki jumps off the prosthesis. Also, in the logic of this parkour world they created and cherish together, the group using ultra cheat equipment come from nowhere, cheat, are ready to trick their ""enemies"" to the point of sending them to be killed in the whirlpool in the water, go as far as kidnapping someone, all that... to make a buzz on the internet, that\'s all? And they\'re not forbidden to use their equipment, and then they become nice at the end, only because they were impressed by Hibiki and Uta\'s performance, I guess. I agree, it makes the visuals in the courses look very nice, and makes the final parkour scene look more impressive, but it\'s totally lacking in worldbuilding quality.The secondary characters are reduced to a single personality trait, again far, far away from the complexity of secondary characters like Keisuke in Tenki no Ko, and this beautiful family that lives life to the fullest doesn\'t seem as real as Ekko\'s group can be in Arcane. And that comes into play when it comes to making an anime that makes an impression, not just beautiful visuals. In fact, I think the term I used at the beginning, dreamlike, is really perfect to describe this movie. We are enchanted with a beautiful universe, a beautiful dream that comes to free us from this bland reality of the current society, but only a dream, ephemeral, certainly poetic but still rather simple, often incoherent, which evaporates quickly after waking up.It\'s still an interesting film that\'s worth seeing, but you shouldn\'t expect any masterpiece.Overall: 6/10 so many things to do with this beautiful universe that we quickly get hooked.

I had waited for 2 weeks since I heard it was coming out. I am a big AoT fan, so when I heard that the WIT studio director was making a movie I got very excited. And the fact that the fantastic outstanding Hiroyuki Sawano was making the soundtrack was just too much.When I watched the movie I couldn't help but reload the scenes one after another. The visuals were purely outstanding and the music sent chills through my body since it reminded me of the AoT soundtrack.However, when it came...to the characters its a different story. I am not going to say that the character development was bad considering it was an 1,40h movie. But they could have made the characters feel more humane in many ways and not as cold as they was potrayed. There was a few scenes where they went a little more deep into the characters but in general I would say that the character development was decent, it was not bad.I dont think this movie would do good as a series or a manga considering that their climax is the art and music, but as a movie its pretty good.I would recomend this movie to anyone since its not in anyway violent or unfriendly and it is a great movie for a one-time watch. to the characters its a different story.

One small one at the end, but you\'ll know it\'s coming before it\'s said. It\'s inconsequential to the plot.I never thought I\'d watch an anime that doesn\'t answer a single question.Well, that\'s not quite accurate. It answers why there are kids doing parkour in an apocalyptic Tokyo. That\'s it. We don\'t learn anything other than that.I have a lot of issues with this movie, many of which I can\'t discuss without spoilers, so I\'ll avoid talking about those issues. I think that some of the concepts of this anime could have made a really great movie if the story was...written different and handled differently. There wasn\'t much buildup for anything, there was rarely any explanation, and the characters were all done poorly. Even the characters that I was enjoying a bit initially ended up not being done well.There are some animation issues during the parkour scenes, where characters don\'t look like they\'re touching the surfaces they are supposed to be bouncing off of or running on. The animators did a great job with all the flashy, complicated parkour moves and various different angles, but I would have rather seen less intense moves and some more standard camera angles if it meant the characters actually looked like they were running on the surface they were supposed to be running on.The backgrounds are gorgeous and expertly executed. Some of the scenes are done in a more soft, detailed style on the characters, generally the scenes that they deemed the most important. Some of them contrasted too heavily with the standard style of the movie and had the characters looking somewhat off-model while others just looked too blurry in comparison to everything else. (I was watching in HD. There are times where facial features in this softer style were blurred while other aspects looked perfectly fine. They made some features TOO soft.)Some of Uta\'s voice lines have horrible sound quality in comparison to every other character, mostly with her first speaking lines. Throughout the movie she has multiple different sounding voices, even in the span of a few seconds. It sounds like 3 slightly different characters but they\'re all supposed to be her.The rest of my distaste for this movie comes from the story, and I won\'t go into much detail on that because I want to avoid spoilers. I had a LOT of issues with the story. My biggest being: We get no answers. No explanations aside from setting up the problem initially (Apocalyptic Tokyo in a Bubble and we don\'t know why). Characters are flat, thematic ideas that could have been cool are ruined by bad writing, moments that would have been really cool if they had leadup and explanations are ruined because they have none. There are aspects that are super predictable because it\'s what you see time and time again from this particular genre of anime movie. If this movie was done better I wouldn\'t have minded the predictability of it.The one small, barely even a spoiler spoiler I will say is that the main character, Hibiki has auditory sensitivity. It\'s something he\'s struggled with since childhood. The movie does a great job setting this up and not making it a feature of his character but just something he lives with. They even showed some of the struggles and discrimination he\'s faced for it! But they make a huge mistake. After a certain point in the movie he just doesn\'t have his sensitivity anymore. They got rid of it to emphasize his ""Character Growth"", which is in horrible taste.This review ended up being longer than intended.

I just have a lot of thoughts on this one, not many of which are good.', ""Some people make it difficult to remember the entire point of movies and TV shows, and that is just to entertain, there was never meant to be lessons told, there was never meant to be deep intertwining plot points, and that is just what cinema has become, and that's not to say it's bad, it's just to say that there is a huge disregard for movies and shows that don't wish to achieve what most movies and shows try, and that's to having a meaning intended for a specific audience, instead of just being something you can plainly enjoy for the sake of it.Now I...may sound like a massive hypocrite, coming from the person who doesn't like Demon Slayer's story given it's painful simplicity, and a bunch of other aspects of plenty of my reviews recently for casual viewing shows, and I can see your point, but the entire reason I give those points is because I believe I have the right to criticize a show about something that it tries to do but doesn't manage. To get onto the topic of Bubble, the movie definitely shows it's colours through not only the insanely well plotted visuals and sound directing, but in it's enjoyability through it's easy and smooth structure. Modern art has become highly demanded and there is a reason for that, most art pre-WW2 had so many common characteristics making it hard to differentiate between artists and their works, so much detail, so much meaning and definition, that it's just become hard to have a piece of work you can just simply enjoy because it's art, the Constructivism movement in Russia post-WW1, had imposed a movement to popularize the simplicity of art through basic and blatant words to get messages across in ways everyone can understand rather than to be so under-surface and difficult for other people to understand, which in turn worked in favour of artists and designers using such techniques and changed society into the minimalism loving society it is with the simple modern art that we see today, and movies since then have seemed to reflect it in one way or another with their simple messages and themes that any child and their mother can appreciate.Bubble gets its inspiration from The Little Mermaid, which can be seen in its romance genre plug, between the 2 protagonists of the film, and of course the numerous times it was directly quoted throughout, (be honest with me, if you missed them talking about The Little Mermaid and have no idea what I'm talking about you need to re-watch the film again but awake this time) it's easy to see what else was inspired. Given the need for detail in structure that viewers seem to crave, we have overthrown films with simple structure and themes, like Words Bubble Up like Soda Pop, and now Bubble, for failing to comply with our needs, when in-fact, Bubble aims to achieve only what its predecessors have and that is, again, just to be entertaining. The Little Mermaid thrives of its simplicity and became one of the most iconic hit films to ever reach cinema with its romance and mystic touches, simple enough to be enjoyed by all and somehow to shape the way movies are created, and now we can worship the creators of Bubble for bringing this back to us in the form of anime, thanks to the brilliant staff behind the movie, the animators of Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song, director of Attack on Titan, and the music composer for 86, Guilty Crown, Nanatsu, and many more.The last major thing I wish to point out is that I wouldn't be surprised at all if this show took inspiration from Made in Abyss, and before you go and burn me at the stake for giving such an outrageous statement, allow me to justify myself: The movie sets itself around a mega phenomenon unexplainable by modern science, daring residents create it as their home in or around the phenomenon. A curious unexplainable character is introduced as the main character is about to die by cause of the mysterious phenomenon, and they almost instantly hit it off, the mysterious character is introduced and given a 3-letter name. The main character has a problem with one of their five senses which later has purpose for the premise, and the main protagonists come across villain-like characters with black masks. Hold on a moment I'm not finished yet, there is also a huge black hole like thing in the center of all the abrupt chaos, and finally, the mega phenomena has connection with the mysterious character, who is called back to the center of it all by the end of the film.Put both Made in Abyss and Bubble side by side and you can see the clear common characteristics, and in some way this is a huge compliment to the producers on this one for creating a movie so simple and understandable, comparable to one of the best crafted and complex shows I have ever seen, while it stands obvious which stands triumph over the other in most aspects it's beyond impressive what they've pulled off with such a theme, with some seriously beautiful writing within it all.Bubble shares a common theme throughout the movie and it's the theme of loneliness, it's easy to shut yourself off from the world when all seems at loss and to lock yourself away, as though it makes everything simpler and easier to handle, and it's beautiful the way the film represents this. Bubble tells the story of someone suffering loneliness and inability to communicate without having some kind of issues whether physical or mental, and giving them someone who is able to live past these problems and bring some companionship back into their life, and once it's taken away and the main character re-lives the purpose of intimacy, and it becomes clear that there is a purpose to get along with people and to live your life out alongside others; this is the true beauty of Bubble, a simple movie telling the story of loneliness in a way which anybody can understand, and in such a crazy and vibrant environment, to really emphasize and make clear the impact one can have on someone who is alone. may sound like a massive hypocrite, coming from the person who doesn't like Demon Slayer's story given it's painful simplicity, and a bunch of other aspects of plenty of my reviews recently for casual viewing shows, and I can see your point, but the entire reason I give those points is because I believe I have the right to criticize a show about something that it tries to do but doesn't manage.

Modern art has become highly demanded and there is a reason for that, most art pre-WW2 had so many common characteristics making it hard to differentiate between artists and their works, so much detail, so much meaning and definition, that it's just become hard to have a piece of work you can just simply enjoy because it's art, the Constructivism movement in Russia post-WW1, had imposed a movement to popularize the simplicity of art through basic and blatant words to get messages across in ways everyone can understand rather than to be so under-surface and difficult for other people to understand, which in turn worked in favour of artists and designers using such techniques and changed society into the minimalism loving society it is with the simple modern art that we see today, and movies since then have seemed to reflect it in one way or another with their simple messages and themes that any child and their mother can appreciate.Bubble gets its inspiration from The Little Mermaid, which can be seen in its romance genre plug, between the 2 protagonists of the film, and of course the numerous times it was directly quoted throughout, (be honest with me, if you missed them talking about The Little Mermaid and have no idea what I'm talking about you need to re-watch the film again but awake this time) it's easy to see what else was inspired. Given the need for detail in structure that viewers seem to crave, we have overthrown films with simple structure and themes, like Words Bubble Up like Soda Pop, and now Bubble, for failing to comply with our needs, when in-fact, Bubble aims to achieve only what its predecessors have and that is, again, just to be entertaining. The Little Mermaid thrives of its simplicity and became one of the most iconic hit films to ever reach cinema with its romance and mystic touches, simple enough to be enjoyed by all and somehow to shape the way movies are created, and now we can worship the creators of Bubble for bringing this back to us in the form of anime, thanks to the brilliant staff behind the movie, the animators of Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song, director of Attack on Titan, and the music composer for 86, Guilty Crown, Nanatsu, and many more.The last major thing I wish to point out is that I wouldn't be surprised at all if this show took inspiration from Made in Abyss, and before you go and burn me at the stake for giving such an outrageous statement, allow me to justify myself: The movie sets itself around a mega phenomenon unexplainable by modern science, daring residents create it as their home in or around the phenomenon. A curious unexplainable character is introduced as the main character is about to die by cause of the mysterious phenomenon, and they almost instantly hit it off, the mysterious character is introduced and given a 3-letter name. The main character has a problem with one of their five senses which later has purpose for the premise, and the main protagonists come across villain-like characters with black masks. Hold on a moment I'm not finished yet, there is also a huge black hole like thing in the center of all the abrupt chaos, and finally, the mega phenomena has connection with the mysterious character, who is called back to the center of it all by the end of the film.Put both Made in Abyss and Bubble side by side and you can see the clear common characteristics, and in some way this is a huge compliment to the producers on this one for creating a movie so simple and understandable, comparable to one of the best crafted and complex shows I have ever seen, while it stands obvious which stands triumph over the other in most aspects it's beyond impressive what they've pulled off with such a theme, with some seriously beautiful writing within it all.Bubble shares a common theme throughout the movie and it's the theme of loneliness, it's easy to shut yourself off from the world when all seems at loss and to lock yourself away, as though it makes everything simpler and easier to handle, and it's beautiful the way the film represents this. Bubble tells the story of someone suffering loneliness and inability to communicate without having some kind of issues whether physical or mental, and giving them someone who is able to live past these problems and bring some companionship back into their life, and once it's taken away and the main character re-lives the purpose of intimacy, and it becomes clear that there is a purpose to get along with people and to live your life out alongside others; this is the true beauty of Bubble, a simple movie telling the story of loneliness in a way which anybody can understand, and in such a crazy and vibrant environment, to really emphasize and make clear the impact one can have on someone who is alone."", 'the narrative was somewhat comprehensible, albeit those alien bubbles danced a tad too far into the realm of the absurd for my liking.

On top of that, the vocal work done by Riria (voice of Uta) was so soothing and memorable. There were several moments where I noticed the change in tone or instrument to fit the scene\'s emotions, and usually I\'m very deaf to these sorts of things lol. And not to forget how catchy Uta\'s melody is (I find myself humming...it often).At the same time, Studio Wit nailed it once again. I\'m not gonna claim to be an expert on animation, but it\'s visually stunning and the action is fluid and dynamic. There\'s so much care and detail put into not only the foreground and the terrain the characters interact with, but with the backgrounds as well. The character designs are simple (Uta being an exception), but they work well and are still recognizable.The overall concept was interesting, the mysterious bubbles being equally mind boggling and beautiful to look at. And, of course, Uta herself being the most mystical of it all, a strange girl seemingly made of the bubbles. The movie does a good job of conveying the origin of the bubbles through visuals rather than listening to character ramble on about theories, and it\'s satisfying that they take full advantage of the ""show don\'t tell"" that oftentimes is easily failed in other works.And last, but definitely not least, I wanna touch upon the chemistry/romance between our main duo. Hibiki\'s trauma makes it difficult for him to interact with those around him, his hearing only adding onto his troubles. However, Uta\'s song is his metaphorical light at the end of the tunnel, helping to ease him into the noise surrounding him. At the same time, Hibiki is the only one to have heard and acknowledged Uta\'s singing, and it creates a connection between the two. The chemistry is setup from the get go, and it\'s incredibly cute to watch the two interact and grow closer after she saved him from drowning. The progression from ""Who is this weird girl?"" to Hibiki\'s realization that he\'s developed feelings for her (the visual portrayal of this was precious) was well earned and a pleasure to watch.My score and overall enjoyment is probably most definitely because of how closely I was able to connect with the movie\'s characters and themes. As someone with trauma that impacted my ability to interact comfortably with others, there\'s nothing more welcoming than finding a connection that helps ease those fears. For me, being able to hear the voices of the two people I love most is something I\'m most thankful for, and I\'m so grateful to them both.In a way, it\'s like I\'ve found the Uta to my Hibiki (I know it\'s cheesy, but hey, cheese tastes good)At the end of the day, it\'s not gonna resonate with everyone, and that\'s okay, but I still recommend giving it a watch.

The visuals from WIT were outstanding and eye-candy. The 2D and CGs were blended well and detailed. The character designs were appealing to the audience. However, these designs were not suited to how they looked. The action scenes and cinematography were great. The backgrounds and scenery were very vibrant. It captured the magic of the film.The seiyuu performances were pretty fine. But I like the soundtrack of Hiroyuki Sawano. The mysterious lullaby and the adrenaline-pumped music were top-notched. OP and ED were good also.What I mentioned earlier were the good/outstanding parts of the film. However, this is the most disappointing part;So the story was set in post-apocalyptic Tokyo, where this mysterious “Bubble” phenomenon happened and it’s still raining at that time. There was a group of guys doing parkour stunts in the middle of their traditional tournament. Whoever comes the winner, will take a box of supply food. One day, a guy named Hibiki climbed a tower and got saved by this mysterious girl. Later on, she started to hang out with him and with the rest of the gang.Judging from the trailer, the premise looked interesting. But after that moments, the story and narrative just suddenly slapped down hard. The films had these plot holes, in which you may think, “how the heck did that happened?” They didn’t show where these bubbles came from and how the heck those things entered the Earth’s atmosphere. Even a balloon can’t do that but… argghh!! The story became mid when they connected the story to the little mermaid. It became predictable and somewhat forgot that this was to be a sci-fi film. Who was that sister of Uta? Of all the people in Tokyo, why was Hibiki the only person that Uta came for? The plot was so shallow and unexplainable. Forced dramas here and there, and the whole thing was similar to Weathering with you and Patema Inverted. Heck, the two did a better job than this in terms of drama and romance. The writers weren’t sure how would they conclude the whole thing and somehow, they just rushed and combined the whole thing, to make the ending, “satisfying”. The characters were one-dimensional and forgettable. Only Hibiki got a good yet understandable development, while the rest were bland and predictable.Overall, this was a pretty bad film. If you expect something great, you might get disappointed. The only thing that stood out was the parkour element because it’s somewhat cool. But the setting, story, and characters were poorly executed and unexplained. The film had this huge character roster but in the end, they didn’t care much.

Just so you know I\'m very...critical when it comes to Hans Christian Andersen fairytale adaptations and I know this is only supposed to be highly inspired by it and I at least acknowledge the attempt that was made but... well, I\'ll get into that a little later too. But let me get to this step by step.Animation: 9/10The animation of this movie is absolutely stunning and breath-taking. It might be one of the reasons I was eager to watch this. There\'s almost nothing to criticize about it and if it would have been just for the visuals, this movie could have slayed. Unfortunately (or rather fortunately) a good movie needs more than simply stunning visuals... somethign even more essential.Story: 4/10The reason it took me a while to write this review after watching the movie was because I couldn\'t exactly put my finger on why I did feel bad about the storytelling (I mean aside from the ending). Like I initially mentioned I was really excited for the premise of the movie and aside from the setting even the build-up seemed to be good. At least in the beginning. There was a lot of potential but like with many anime movies I\'ve watched: in the end  it failed to deliver. They did the build-up pretty good. The mystery of the mysterious bubbles defying all physics and even messing with earth\'s gravitation, giving room for these risky (yet fun looking) competetions between teams. Which was a part that made me sceptical at first but wasn\'t executed too badly imo (and like I said especially animated in pretty way). A very interesting plot and even more so after Uta appeared. BUT now to the problem I\'ve got. 1.) They get the setting right 2.) they create an interesting captivating build-up but then everything goes wrong... when there is nothing to it. Absolutely NOTHING. After the point Uta\'s ""sisters"" (bubbles representing the little mermaids sisters who want her to return to her) try to ""force"" her to come back everything goes downhill and the plot crashes like there is absolutely no storytelling anymore. Just taking leftovers and mixing them up together. I get the point that they were trying to show things rather than telling (like Hibiki and his friends making it to the tower, trying to save Uta and then him being all by himself and realizing he has ""met"" her before or rather she was the singing voice he heard before and the reason why he was saved?). I appreciate the sentiment but at first it got me confused and then a little frustrated because the story left me nothing to dwell on and nothing to take from it.Don\'t get me wrong... The moment Uta dissolved into bubbles was somehow emotional but I do feel like it didn\'t had the impact it was supposed to have. Like in ""The Little Mermaid"" she wants to have legs, explore the human world and since she fell in love wants to be with that person. No one in her family gets her but it\'s only after the prince breaks her heart that her sisters try to convince the mermaid to kill both - the man she loves and his wife - to be saved. But the sister\'s motivation in this movie doesn\'t exist or at least it was not expressed to the audience. They were just evil bubles? Not only messing with the earth and humans but now also getting mad for their sister to be taken away from them when it was her choice? What happened there? And then she couldn\'t even stay? I\'m normally more on the side of showing instead of telling but believe me - even in that case a story needs, well, at least a little storyTELLING and they didn\'t explain anything not in the slightest. Neither where these mysterious bubble-being came from in the first place, what their intentions were, nor how Uta could become human, why there was even a time limit or why the others got mad at her not being there (I guess for not being able to sing with them?). But it doesn\'t explain their purpose or strive in general. If you are inspired by someone like Andersen take note that he was able to breathe life into even ordinary things, plants, animals - basically everything he made a focus of his stories. And using bubbles would have worked too if he had written it. But I couldn\'t resonate with the bubble-beings for one tiny second throughout this movie. It\'s like they were a plot-device when they were supposed to be the reason the plot existed and therefore needed to be developed, explained or at least woven more into the story itself. But no. So much left unexplained and not even like in ""an open ending"" it felt rather unfinished and didn\'t focus on what should have been important. Nothing to learn and nothing to take away. The relationships between the characters were a little better I guess but it couldn\'t make up for the lack of storytelling.Characters: 6.5/10They are nothing really special but I like them fair enough. Especially Hibiki who had a good character development throughout his journey. I\'m a little more on the fence with Uta tho. While she is cute and sweet and I think she somehow helped Hibiki growing... I can\'t shake off the feeling that much to my previous statement regarding the bubbles and their lacking purpose, something was missing with her as well. Her design was very unique and I absolutely love her voice which doesn\'t surprise me given she\'s voiced by Ririra. who I recently discovered sang one of the best anime openings I\'ve heard in a while (with one of the best animes of this seasons I\'d assume. Not that it matters but I wanted to mention at least one random fact). It matches her well... And I really like the dynamics of the two main characters and even Uta and the supporting characters. But when the story doesn\'t go anywhere often also the characters don\'t really have anywhere to go and they were not fleshed out enough to make up for that. That\'s why to me they are nothing special.Music: 6/10While I felt the music was fitting and well picked I\'ve gotta say they can\'t compete with the visuals. In a sense they are nothing special and even forgettable. And I feel like they could have made more out of it (especially with Riria\'s beautiful voice). It kind of reminded me what the game ""Norn9"" was doing with Aion and her voice but somehow in this movie it didn\'t really work well? Maybe they were trying too hard. But the music wasn\'t bad...Overall: 6/10If you\'d ask me to recommend this movie for its visuals and maybe even likeable characters I\'d say: yes. But if you\'d ask me if I would recommend it on the basis of amazing storytelling and audience satisfaction I\'d have to say: NO. Absolutely not. There was a lot of potential but it didn\'t live up to it. When it came to the most important part of the movie - the climax - it went downhill faster than my bank account. So I guess watching or not watching is up to your personal preference (if you like visuals more than good and solid storytelling this might be for you). I\'m sorry this review couldn\'t be more helpful but if you feel like reading this review has contributed nothing for you to decide whether to watch it or not... It\'s the same feeling I had after watching the movie: contributing to nothing. At least it wasn\'t a complete waste of time but it isn\'t exactly awesome or mind-blowing either. But I do stick to what I\'ve said earlier: combining a fairytale theme with sci-fi has great potential and maybe one day someone will get it right (and actually I\'m trying it with my own projects too). And writers improve over time so I might be keeping an eye on this studio. critical when it comes to Hans Christian Andersen fairytale adaptations and I know this is only supposed to be highly inspired by it and I at least acknowledge the attempt that was made but... well, I\'ll get into that a little later too.

The problem?  It really didn't have a ton going for its actual story.Story: Bubble tells the story of a strange phenomena, where a large bubble explodes in the middle of Tokyo.  After the explosion, the entirety of Tokyo is encased in a gigantic bubble.  This follows by smaller bubbles falling like rain into the streets until they eventually pop, flooding all of Tokyo.  Since the bubbles slowly flood the city, its citizens abandon it and declare it an illegal...zone.  Many kids, all of which are orphans now due to the bubbles destruction, decide to live within the city, despite the dangerous environment, where they compete it parkour competitions.  Hibiki climbs the old Tokyo tower, but ends up falling into the water below.  He is eventually saved by a mysterious girl, who he eventually names Uta, but with no idea where she comes from.I gotta be honest, I hated the story.  The story's just so incredibly shallow and doesn't really tell anything of value until the final half hour of the runtime.  The first half of the movie shows us these competitions, including the dangers the lie within the city.  These weren't entirely too bland.  The movie's actually a lot of fun to watch, but that doesn't mean the story is strong, what-so-ever.  For example, one of the dangers that are observed during the competitions is clearly a threat, but there was literally zero explanation of what it is.  Does something this extreme not warrant some amount of attention?  In addition, the prizes for these competitions appear to be that of food and supplies, but the only reason they need them is because of our crew's stubbornness about staying inside the bubble when they could simply leave - which they can willingly do.  It really does feel like the movie's objective is to have fun, and while it passes that with flying colours, the story in it's entirety never digs deep.When it feels like the movie is trying to pick up, you're likely getting close to the end.  It does pick up a little bit, as there's very clear tension building with our characters.  Again, it's fun, but it's not because the movie has this spectacular ending.  Most notably, there's a complete lack of explanation about both one of our major characters and how they end up with how they are, and the origins of the entire bubble phenomena to begin with.  There are clearly things changing around our characters as we approach the end, but what caused it?  It's never really explained or have a direct path that would make us understand.  (3/10)Characters: Our cast faired a little better because there were some backstories given to a few of them.  Hibiki has a past that makes him rather uneasy, specifically because it causes strain to his mother.  That kind of mother-son relationship is hard to hold for some, and you do feel sorry for him, at least a little.  He does distance himself from others, but losing those close to him clearly contributes his hesitation to get close to anyone.  Uta isn't really a fascinating character outside of her initial interactions with our crew.  She's weird at the best of times and basically a follower otherwise.  The rest of our main crew fair a bit better, as they're really tight as a team, even if they have differences - I loved Hibiki's gradual development with Kai.Side cast don't have a whole lot of them, though Shin has decent points here or there about him.  The Undertakers are a group that challenges other teams, apparently for streaming views from outside bubble, and they basically antagonize themselves for that purpose alone.  It's boring at best, and you can tell they were only included here for one purpose, near the end of the story.  Makoto appears to be a researcher of sorts, sticking with the crew to study the bubbles.  Her role was to tell us parts of the story in a semi-natural way, but aside that, she was okay at best.  (6/10)Art: It's a real shame that the story was so lacking because this movie was one of the best I've seen.  Wit Studio has put out some amazing looking anime, and this should be among them. Everything looks heavily detailed and the setting, particularly during the competitions, only enhance what we feel that much more.  It's a big part of why this movie has some fun to it.  (10/10)Sound: Not only does the art impress, but so does the sound.  Hiroyuki Sawano is a legend with OSTs and songs these days, and his work here is very strong.  He uses the main concept melody is some many smart ways, and the enhances it during some of the busier scenes.  Because this movie isn't really in the science-fiction genre where most of his other works are featured, he didn't really have to get fancy with the instrumentation, and he mostly kept it simple by his standards.  It's just a shame he didn't compose any lyrical pieces for this film, though the two songs here were fine anyway.  VO work was really strong, led by Zach Aguilar (Hibiki), Erica Lindbeck (Makoto) and Robbie Daymond (Kai).  Emi Lo (Uta) was fine, though it was a little jarring to hear the movie swap back and forth between her and the Japanese VA, who sings during certain parts of the movie.  (9/10)Overall: Bubble is really difficult to recommend because the story just wasn't for me and the characters were mostly shallow too.  It's such a shame too because the production levels were just so high here.  This has been a trend on Netflix anime movies and series, which is a total shame.  If you want to turn your brain off and just watch the fascinations in front of you, I could see this movie being an okay watch, but there are far too many questions during and after this movie that make it difficult to warrant a higher rating.

(6/10)"", 'Bubble is an interesting movie that has top tier animation, style, and audio; unfortunately, the plot (and subplot) doesn\'t really feel like it has anywhere it wants to go-thematically or plotwise-and the characters are ...there. The movie reminds you about the whole ""Little Mermaid"" motif it has going again and again and again and then once more in case the viewer hasn\'t noticed. The whole subplot about the parkour races goes from crazy to psychotic and completely fails to make use of the \'team\' as anything more than stepping stones to the main character\'s victory. I\'ve seen some reviews comparing Bubble to \'Weathering With You\',...but whereas WWY\'s characters are meaty enough to carry the viewer through the simple plot of that movie, Bubble\'s characters are nothing but skin and bones. Bubble probably would have been better off as a music video. but whereas WWY\'s characters are meaty enough to carry the viewer through the simple plot of that movie, Bubble\'s characters are nothing but skin and bones.

Length of movie wasnt nearly enough to explore the world and especially characters. Most of them got only 1 line at best of who and why they are here even if they played quite important roles in story delivery. When character risk their lives but you barely know them, it really lowers the tension of the whole scene.The saving grace is the excellent quality of art and sound as well as animation quality which left me in awe and hungry for more after watching action and parkour scenes....Overall the movie was very good, though in my opinion it could have been a lot better if it was 12 or 24 episode anime.

Now, onto the anime basic review (after watching the film once).Story; All around the world, bubble began to rain upon the world defying gravity. Although it was beautiful, it only lasted so long till Tokyo Japan became the only isolated city with its mysterious waters, spider like holes and bubbles that don\'t pop. Although the city of Tokyo became bare after the bubble explosion, some kids, mainly orphans from the accident, became the only residents of the dangerous city becoming parkour experts that way they can win goods...to keep on living in the city. The ace of the Blue Team, Hibiki, has always been a lone wolf in search of a song that comes from the bubbles. In search of the person singing, he ends up getting dragged into the gravity defying waters and gets saved by a girl named Uta. These two can both hear the song from the bubbles, and end up spending every day with each-other, discovering their true selves in this messy world. Discover why these two are so attached to each-other, why the bubbles still exist and what will happen to Tokyo. Art; Absolutely gorgeous. The dark swirls made me nauseous, the bubbles felt real enough to pop and every breeze that moved with the characters almost felt real. Sound; Let\'s be real... anything that EVE sings in will ALWAYS be a banger, but ever the main ""song"" or ""tune"" was beautiful/scary. It carried the film perfectly. Characters; Perfect cast, but if it wasn\'t for the main two characters the movie would\'ve been completely boring (this is obvious, but my point is that the supporting characters weren\'t interesting enough... long haired dude, one leg man, big boobed smart girl and scary team who only want money for their fancy shoes? da heck).Overall, I really enjoyed the film... But the ONE BIG THING I couldn\'t get out of my head the whole movie was ""Hibiki looks like Kotarou Azumi\'s twin, just athletic"". These characters have nothing to do with each-other, aren\'t even close to being in the same world, not made by the same Studio BUUUUUTTTTT the faces they make and the god dame hair style ugggghhhh.Highly suggest this animated movie to anyone who wants a quick ""what the hell is going on here"" movie, with possible tear jerker scenes. This is a perfect slice-of-life, sci-fi with a pinch of romance. to keep on living in the city.

Be it animation and art-style, writing of characters and stories or simply in overall quality. Thus, making competition fierce, thing that shows by having, in almost each season, a show that breaks top 10 and ends up top 100 all-time. However, I personally don’t think that saying “Bubble” is one of the most visually stunning and beautiful shows ever made, is an understatement.As one might expect from Wit Studio, the animation is absolutely insane with awesome fluid sequences that bring a whole dynamic to each scene. The backgrounds,...landscapes, places and details are some of the best ever animated, in my opinion, rivalling the likes of “Violet Evergarden” or “Weathering With You”. Each minute of the show, having action or not, sucks you in and immerses you to the point you can almost feel the surroundings and atmosphere around the characters.Story-wise it takes a lot of inspiration from Makoto Shinkai formulae and is a self-conscious interpretation of the “Little Mermaid” story, but it does an amazing work, nonetheless. There has been critics surrounding this aspect, but in a world where a lot of remakes and reruns of shows and concepts is a staple, I think enjoying the story independently is the way to better approach and enjoy the movie.Overall, “Bubble” is a beautiful story that transpires dedication from each staff member, which were able to achieve breath-taking action sequences, banger music and visually gorgeous scenes and moments. landscapes, places and details are some of the best ever animated, in my opinion, rivalling the likes of “Violet Evergarden” or “Weathering With You”.

I am not really keen on movies as I have a short attention span and often find that plots in movies are quite rushed. But honestly, despite being able to somewhat guess the plot of the movie, I was still shocked by the second half.The artwork itself is truly worthy of a rating of 10/10 and had intense scenes which I immensely enjoyed (despite being more of a romance fan).The characters...were unique and while it only focused on one character's perspective, I felt like I could feel the emotions that the others experienced.Overall, I would highly recommend anyone to watch this, or at least try it. were unique and while it only focused on one character's perspective, I felt like I could feel the emotions that the others experienced.Overall, I would highly recommend anyone to watch this, or at least try it."", ""Watch The Anime Enjoy it and don't bother reading reviews!! :PThis anime felt very fresh and I enjoyed the crap out of this movie!The only anime movies I have seen that gave me similar vibes were Your name / Kimi no Na Wa  & Toki Wo Kakeru Shoujo.

Instead, it throws disjointed concepts at its viewers in an attempt to appear abstract and philosophical. The result is tied together with tired anime tropes carried by paper-thin characters. The world it presents, though pretty, is also made shallow when it tries to appear mysterious by explaining precisely none of the concepts it introduces. What are the bubbles? Where did they come from? Why do they possess supernatural abilities? Why is the main character special?...I'm not sure the writers themselves had a definite idea.It is thankfully made into a passable watch by its beautiful visuals and soundtrack. The parkour scenes are all very enjoyable, perhaps to the point that I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy pretty animation like this, but definitely not to the point of warranting a second watch.

While parkouring his way up to the tower, he gets into an accident and falls in the ocean, whereon, he meets a girl out of nowhere and learns that she too knows the song that only he has heard of before.This animated movie is based on an incident where bubbles suddenly fell out of the blue all over the world, and in the middle of Tokyo, they formed a sort of base after a huge explosion wrapping a part...of Tokyo inside a massive bubble that was filled with water. Orphans that lost their families during the incident now illegally reside inside this cluster and take part in a dangerous game of parkouring where the winning team gets the bounty set for the game. Living their lives like normal, everything soon takes a turn when Hibiki brings over the girl (Uta) that rescued his life after the accident. Events become clear and the truth of the bubbles since the incident 5 years ago comes to light, making a drastic change in Hibiki\'s and everyone lives that live inside the bubble.The animation of the movie is really top-notch, it doesn\'t spare a single second to flaunt its flawless animation, be it in the stunts that they do while parkouring or the basic animation between the interaction of two characters or even the basic scenes in general that represent the scenery.

Also wasn't very convinced with the romance between Uta and Hibiki, but I guess its because it's based on the little mermaid.Once I saw all those characters in the opening, I knew there was no way they could develop...them all in one movie.

While I can definitely see that, it doesn't take away from the bittersweetness of the whole thing in retrospect, and how it still affects you. It's moving, actually. The story moves you.The only thing I guess, I didn't really like that much was not-so-subtle indication that it's similar to The Little Mermaid (the original one, not the disney one). They kept alluding to it during the movie, and i knew that at some point, it was going to be played out. A little subtlety does help sometimes when putting messages across.

Firstly, I don\'t think a time slot of 1 hour and 40 minutes was remotely enough to convey this whole story in the first place, but I\'d like to point out the immensely enjoyable things before pointing out what the faults were.- The animation working along with the very nice cinematography really captures your attention when you see them parkour. It was truly a treat to watch.- The coloring, the character designs, and just simply the entirety of the art is just a joy to look at like every anime movie often times is....It was gorgeous, similar to that of the movies by Makoto Shinkai (Garden of Words, Your Name, etc.)- The sound samples and music were fine. Nothing really unique or catchy stood out in particular.The story was mid simply put. The character writing was pretty one-dimensional, and the story unenjoyably predictable. There is nothing wrong with predictability imo, but man was it bland. The movie clearly depicted that this was a retelling of the story of The Little Mermaid; well they delivered on that perfectly. There were little to no alterations in the foundation of the story. It honestly felt like a bit of lazy writing, and I think they could\'ve done so much more with their version of The Little Mermaid.I believe they could\'ve taken the time to explore the whole phenomenon and who these lifeforms who are regarded as ""bubbles"" are. They\'re clearly not the same bubbles we know of when we made them back when we were in kindergarten using soap and water. They\'ve attempted to dive into this entire phenomenon with Makoto, but in the end it was just regarded as if they have absolutely no leads. Even then, we could\'ve been told the story of the bubbles from their perspective. Why are they here now? Clearly they did not approve of a human and a bubble feeling affection towards each other, so why\'d they dare stay after the first incident? What is this special communication that Uta and Hibiki have between each other where they can hear each other sing? Those are some ideas I feel like that could\'ve full blown explored, but they simply couldn\'t do that with their time.Another thing they couldn\'t do with the amount of time they had with the movie is exploring the dynamics between Uta and Hibiki; hell, they could\'ve done more with all the character dynamics with all the cast. Simply telling us that these kids are people who felt like outcasts, so they escaped into the world of parkour isn\'t enough to make us feel invested. We need to feel emotional attachment by hearing their story, so we know what makes them them. So in the end, I felt like the romance was really rushed. I also find it weird that a kid could fall in love with a bubble at first glance, but it\'s pretty acceptable knowing the fact that he\'s the only one who could hear her voice as if they were both given purpose to live for each other. Also, the kid was living a pretty sad life, after having his mom, the only person he has, basically give up on him due to his condition.Put shortly, the characters and world weren\'t explored nearly enough, it was pretty orgasmic watching the parkour scenes, a lot of missed potential for a banger movie that could\'ve been a little under 3 hours. Not enough time to show blossoming romance and the world building. The character interactions were honestly pretty bland and felt like it added nothing, but that is along the lines of cast dynamic.

Decent watch, but rather watch Mushoku Tensei :D', 'With this movie, I just pulled it up on Netflix because it was on my watch list for a while and I was bored, but this definitely an interesting movie, but I feel that it definitely has it\'s ups and downs. My main turn-offs for the movie came from the fact that I feel a lot of this was either really corny or just went unexplained. Now, not much couldn\'t have been done about the corny part, that\'s just how these types of movies are, but to fix the whole plot holes thing, I feel like it would\'ve been better off as a 12 episode...series to take more time to develop the characters and explain some more things about the show. But, there\'s also some really good parts about this movie. Just to get it out of the way, the animations is incredible, probably some of the best animation I have ever seen, and I feel Wit Studio really took their time with it. There\'s also those scenes that are simply just heartwarming and makes you feel good or regret how you have yet to find a significant other. I feel that this is very similar to the type of stories that Makoto Shinkai (the creator of Your Name and Weathering with You) would write with the whole ""sci-fi x fantasy + a little taste of romance"" type feel.Anyways, with my final rating, I\'m going to give Bubble a 85/100 series to take more time to develop the characters and explain some more things about the show.

Despite its popularity there have been many negative reviews but I still recommend it, Uta is a wonderful character and even if unfortunately there was something missing to make me appreciate until the end, I do not regret having seen this film. "", ""Disappointed so much since the biggest names in the anime industry produced this, and yet, the story was so unoriginal and the character of Uta was so annoying. Annoying in a sense that I see herself as some foolish Disney princess obsessed for his prince. Never liked stories such as Little Mermaid and other cliche fairy tale stories, so this is the biggest letdown for me. And they've just flooded Tokyo again for the sake of this failed romantic movie? They really are a selfish characters huh? Just like in Weathering with you. Uta and her sister came to Tokyo just to bring suffering to...people. What an utter pest. people. What an utter pest."", 'Coming into 2022, this anime was one of my most anticipated movies. We have the director of Attack on Titan Season 1-3 and Death Note, WIT studio, writer of Fate/Zero, and the composer of Attack on Titan coming together to make this sci-fi action thriller.Let’s get the obvious out of the way. The animation was breathtakingly gorgeous. There was never a boring shot. Every single frame and motion was jaw-droppingly beautiful. WIT studio poured their heart out to make this masterpiece of animation. Just like in other anime from WIT like Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song, the close-up animation of character’s face was distinctly...angelic. Those moments were special, and I’m still in awe.However, sadly the story did not deserve such godlike animation. There’s a blend of Little Mermaid, spiral, bubbles, and parkour. Unfortunately these elements did not work out very well. The first half of the movie felt like it was going nowhere. The characters were mostly uninteresting, which made the emotional scenes less impactful. The encompassing theme of this movie just did not land.Overall, I don’t think it’s bad, as I still had a good time, but with this much power dedicated to make this supposedly masterpiece, Bubble was still a disappointment. 7-7.5/10 angelic.

I mean, Hiroyuki Sawano, the legend himself? + A whole cast of amazing people dedicated to make something extraordinary. But, the lack of character Design and story had a great impact on the movie even with such Amazing Visuals and Music.So, the question is, is it worth watching? Yes, definitely. I'd recommend it to everyone,...even with a lack of solid storyline, its still worth a watch. Let's hope our dear Production House team learn something from their mistakes and fill all the gaps the next time.Over-all, i liked it and i appreciate all the effort that was put into this movie. even with a lack of solid storyline, its still worth a watch.

Don't get me wrong, despite the score I don't think this is a bad movie per se, or should I say a bad production, because the main reason it fails so damn hard for me is exactly because of that. IT FAILS BECAUSE IT'S A MOVIE.Now, let me both explain and rant for a bit. It doesn't have enough runtime or exposition to explain why the characters have that much emotional connection. and it's because of that it disrupts the narrative and anything the movie tries to portray, making the characters and therefore their relationships feel...artificial, unrealistic and unidimensional.Sure, making it a 22 episodes core might be too much of a gamble, but I don't think 12 episodes would be enough to build the bonds or have enough build-up to reach the kind of climax they tried to achieve, let alone explain the core basis of how the 'universe' within the movie came to be the way it is. Damn, they could even have made character arcs on how the characters use the parkour gimmick of the show as a way to express escapism of their current life situation.It's a somewhat good idea but fails real bad because the producers didn't have enough faith in the project to make it a proper series and played it safe with a short movie, trimming it to the very bones and ending with a pretentious, empty-looking rushed film artificial, unrealistic and unidimensional.Sure, making it a 22 episodes core might be too much of a gamble, but I don't think 12 episodes would be enough to build the bonds or have enough build-up to reach the kind of climax they tried to achieve, let alone explain the core basis of how the 'universe' within the movie came to be the way it is.

Now this itself raises many questions.Who is providing these rations?The kids are not supposed to be there anyway, so any supervisory body should be kicking them out of Tokyo rather than providing them with rations to further incentivize involvement...in Battlekour. Additionally, what if someone isn't involved in Battlekour? How do they survive/get any food?But whatever I don't really care that Battlekour makes no sense because omygod it is animated so well The movements of every character and the changing environment around them is so immersive that I lose every single thought in my head and am solely focused on that character in the moment.So eventually our MC (Hibiki) falls in the water, drowns and exhales bubbles which collide with the naturally occurring bubbles and form our secondary character, Uta. Now this is just incredibly confusing. How is Uta formed from a bubble collision and how is this the first time this has happened?Uta and Hibiki get close until the evil bubbles descend on Tokyo and Uta sacrifices herself to save Tokyo.

I think I made a bigger one by once giving this movie a bad review. I don't expect to be given, I'm simply here to apologise.The movie cover and promo materials itself really tells you its visuals. It's pretty, and clearly had a lot of effort and time put into it.You should have seen that coming though, since it's coming from Wit Studio - the guys that also made AOT and Spy x Family.The music and soundtrack is also just as high standard. It fits the movie's theme,...it hits the right notes at the right time, and is overall a treat to the ears.Although, you should also have expected this since the OSTs are largely produced by Hiroyuki Sawano.Now, the reason why I chose to rewrite this entire review. The plot.The entire theme of the movie itself is appealing and entertaining. Parkour in a post-apocalyptic-esque Tokyo is the base, and the romance part is the huge cherry on top that somehow blends well.There was also a significant degree of character development between the main characters that ties everything up, and watching each character interact is interesting, or witty at times.While I still think the entire plot feels a little too rushed to be in a movie, I think there was just enough development that you are drawn in to the characters and the storyline, and you can feel for them.Why I gave this movie a bad review once, I have no clue.

While it doesn\'t have the best storyline, I still wanted to leave a high rating so people would still give it a try and enjoy it for its GLORIOUS CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film but at the same time, I\'m terribly disappointed because IT HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL. It\'s a retelling of Andersen\'s tragic The Little Mermaid (not the Disney one!) and I thought the world-building is very unique. Tokyo gets...entrapped in a bubble that causes some gravitational malfunctions leaving it uninhabitable and a bunch of kids end up using the whole city as a playground for their parkour battles. While Hibiki is your typical cold-hearted and talented MC, I couldn\'t think of other films or movies with the same concept of setting.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!Having said that, I would have appreciated more background as to how this Bubble came to be. Most of the explanation about it was done through a narrator and has a lot of scientific references (ie the big bang, stars, atoms etc). They tried to explain it towards the end of the movie that it was Uta and Hibiki that caused it but it literally took a line for that explanation. Hibiki just said maybe him being able to have that connection with Uta at the observatory angered the ""bubbles"" and caused the explosion. ????????I have sooooo many questions. Did Uta come to earth specifically for Hibiki? Or it just so happened that they interacted during the Bubble Fall? If that\'s the case, what caused the Bubbel Fall? What are those red angry bubbles?! Is the big bubble around Tokyo because Uta refuses to go back? Who is HQ? Who does Makoto and Shin work for? Is HQ looking out for the kids? It is illegal to live in the bubble unless approved by HQ meaning the boys are test subjects? Argh so many plot holes.Plot holes aside, if we were to just accept its world for what it is... I would have liked it a lot better if the writers didn\'t reveal Uta was a bubble from the get go. Imagine if this got revealed to the viewers the same time as Hibiki, it would have a lot more impact. Because knowing what Uta is from the very start, it is kind of hard to root for them to be together. You already know it\'s impossible. So had they just omitted that part at the beginning and introduced Uta as a normal (somewhat odd) teenager, it would have been a major plot twist that would undeniably sent me on a feels train.END SPOILER!!But STILL if you have a couple of hours to spare, I\'d say go give it a try and try not to overthink the storyline.

Brilliant Idea! until it wasn't:Bubbles, tried their best to give us a good anime movie, failed terribly.It feels like a very cheap anime.

Nothing ground-breaking, but watching it definitely isn't a bad experience.The best part of Bubble is the sleek animation, gorgeous visuals, unique design choices, and a beautiful soundtrack. This alone makes Bubble an interesting watch. Of course, nothing should stand on visuals and soundtrack alone, and I have to admit that Bubble lacks in terms of character and story.It's a unique retelling of 'The Little Mermaid', so a romantic subplot is expected off the bat. It's not entirely heavy-handed though, and the romance doesn't feel completely out of nowhere. The plot is just a little barebones, that's all. What is there...I find enjoyable enough, and it leaves enough to the imagination that some people like and some people don't. I can live with a story that leaves me to imagine certain details just to have an enjoyable 100 minutes watch of something cute and fun.

I enjoyed the setting, with parkour, bubbles, and lower gravity (Possibly, idk). It\'s like a fantasy world which suits my taste. The story also starts off lightheartedly, no extreme fights over food and all those stuff, which is what you\'ll expect from a post-apocalypse type setting.The anime is basically inspired from \'the little mermaid\' and while that is alright, I feel like the anime may be too focused on the main characters. Admittedly, other characters do get their own screen time, but I\'m more concerned about other factors, like where they get their food from, the gravity level (which...may explain their impossible parkour jumps) etc. I think the movie could have been longer to let us know the setting better but with this limited time, I understand why they would focus so much on the MCs.ART9/10.

The animation with Wit did not disappoint. You could absolutely see the style in the action shots. The characters were compelling though I wish the side characters were more emphasized, they felt a little sidelined.While I did enjoy the parallel to The Little Mermaid, I felt they were being too on the nose with it. Maybe I just have a thing for subtlety, but sometimes it felt too direct. However, the quotes from the story were still compelling.Overall, heart-tugging and entertaining...film. film.', ""Its a glorious and masterful contemporary retelling of the Hans Christian Anderson's little mermaid.

The most common criticism is that the movie is bad because the subject is not fully meaningful and detailed. I strongly disagree.

And why did I actually bother to create an account to write this review about Bubbles in the middle of the night? Because I think there may be something missing in a lot of what I read tonight about this movie.A lot of fair points have been made in the reviews I read, and I actually agree with most of them.Is the story really amazing? No, it is not.Are the characters deep or well developped? Not that much.So you may ask, what can be more important than Characters or Story then? I would be tempted...to say well.... nothing? But not in this case.Bubbles is amazing in it\'s simplicity actually. We may not have any political background, explanations on how exactly those people survive in this abandonned city, where the supplies come from ect..What we do have though, is an emotionnal gut punch.It is not a character study, or a plot driven drama.

And it delivers 100% in my eyes.I am not only an anime fan, but a general cinema fan aswell, and I always value honesty in productions. If a movie wants to convey a feeling, or humour, or excitement and just does that, great, I\'m in! And Bubbles does exactly that. It doesn\'t over do-it with side stories that go nowhere, doesn\'t try to look smarter than it is, and I think we should celebrate this.Let yourslef go, the characters are enjoyable as they are, the story is straigh forward if a little cliché (well retelling an old tale implies ""déjà-vu"" doesn\'t it?) and, maybe, you\'ll find a really enjoyable experience here.

The plot is predictable and unremarkable, and the characters are weak; however, the music and art are phenomenal and highlights. If you enjoy romance and action, this may be of interest to you. It feels much like Makoto Shinkai's lesser quality films. I would not personally recommend this movie for the story or characters, but the art and music were wonderful.Story: 3/10Bubble has an interesting setting: a destroyed version of Tokyo but with big bubbles that shift gravity enough to allow for optimized parkour matches. The plot follows...Hibiki as he wins parkour team battles independently. The plot takes a few twists that are convoluted but also predictable, forcing some fairy tale relationships and also destruction. Overall, the premise could have been interesting, exploring the cycles of production and destruction, or even the recycling nature of the planets and the universe. However, the plot stuck to a lackluster sequence of events with some forced action and boring characters. Furthermore, the narrative switched to a romance, inappropriately, and the overall plot results in a mix of blurry and blended themes. There isn't much of a moral to the story, and it is certainly forgettable. It isn't a movie that will blow your mind with plot twists or make you emotional, mostly because of the characters and their stakes. This entire story meanders until the end, when there is supposed to be an emotional conclusion that falls almost as flat as a single layer of water molecules stuck together by nothing but their hydrogen bonds.Art: 10/10WIT Studios did an excellent job with the art. Not only is the scenery wonderful and bursting with color, but they choreographed many action sequences with intriguing parkour.Music/Sound: 9/10Hiroyuki Sawano is a legend and really made the (weak) story and beautiful art come to life. The voice acting was also surprisingly decent for English dub.Characters: 2/10The characters in this story lack depth. With the colorful art and fitting music, you'd expect to at least connect with some of the characters. Instead, you have uninteresting characters describing themselves through dialogue. It's hard to take them seriously when their character arcs start and finish with making jokes about being orphans. The introduction to characters is heavily driven by dialogue, and there isn't enough time to show character development. Hibiki is one of the only characters to grow, which is expected for a main character, but he is also a very hollow shell. Even the deuteragonist, Uta, is as bland as possible. She's a simple plot device, which really ruins the premise of the movie. If you're going to make the plot of the story contingent upon a character, you have to at least attempt to explain the character's motive. Instead, we have a character that blindly falls in pseudo-love and (no spoilers) we don't even learn why or how she found the main character. It seems as though the movie tried to mix fairy tales with the plots and characters from Makoto Shinkai's films, but this led to very boring and predictable characters.Enjoyment: 3/10I watched this movie for the art and music, which were wonderful.

I've always thought about an anime series that explores the fluidity of human movement. Exploring the art of traversal, so simple with monumental potential, and when I saw the teaser trailer I was excited. This was it, the movie that explores parkour with an interesting world, and perfect animation. Little did I know, bare-bones romance was gonna ruin the movie by deforming it into the blandest, most boring, “Born pretty yesterday” trope.Inflated with a cast too big for its own good, boring main character, meandering plot, constant exposition,...ass-pull levels of writing, nonsensical rules. I'm not being exaggerated by calling it an animation reel. Looking at the writing credits, there's a total of three writers, and you can tell they REALLY wanted their individual movies made.You can see the struggle over which plot to give importance to. The parkour contests, the mystery of the world, and the romance. They tried to juggle the three, incredibly dense elements, from which there can be a movie in its entirety. It's obvious they'd fail. The romance needed time and consistency, parkour needed more focus and struggle, and the mystery needed attention. It crippled the movie, and gave us an incomplete set of first drafts, from three different films combined into one.However, the positives are there.

The overall worldbuilding with Tokyo as a lost place is really beautiful and also the soundtrack adds up to it perfectly just as expected from Hiroyuki Sawano. Also the choice for the voice actors was really good (But I might be a bit too biased with this point). But that’s it. That’s probably the only good thing I can say about this movie.Storywise… If we can even talk about a proper story in the first place,...you better don’t expect much. There isn’t a deep and only plain storyline with only shallow characters. The only character with an explained backstage story is Hibiki and a slight hint to one of the side characters whose name I already forgot. I assume I will forget most of the stuff that happened in the movie after a while.There was potential for the entire story which got totally wasted on a movie.

The beautiful lighting, amazing art, and the breathtaking parkour animation, truly makes this a visual masterpiece. All that aside though, the story, although by no means bad, doesn't shine as much as the animation.The story is basically about a young boy named Hibiki living in a sort of post apocalyptic Tokyo where the gravity doesn't work as normal and there are bubbles everywhere, and people partake in parkour for things like food rations. One day, after hearing singing in the tower which was the source of an explosion, he chases the sound and...almost drowns, when a girl saves him, and eventually joins Hibiki's parkour team and is given the name Uta, meaning song.The writing is pretty solid. However, the story leaves a lot to be desired. Bubble opens up lots of loose ends which keeps the plot interesting, but as the story ends, very little of these loose ends have not been tied up and it left me a bit confused and wanting more. Furthermore, the characters aren't all that great in this movie. Hibiki is pretty generic, doesn't really have much to his character, and Uta doesn't really talk. Not to mention the romance between Hibiki and Uta feels very forced and not very compelling. I just hoped they had a bit more time together on screen.So beauty aside, the story doesn't offer that much.

I was excited to see it once I saw the trailer, however despite several strong points the movie has, it still ended up being somewhat disappointing.The strength of Bubble lies in its animation, or more specifically it\'s choreography. As a film centered around characters competing in parkour in a submerged version of Tokyo, the racing scenes were still well done, and in an odd way very realistic. You can tell that a lot of research and effort was put into getting the parkour scenes just right, and it definitely paid off....The way the camera moves and follows the characters around while they twist and turn was also very well done.The music for the film was fine I guess, although I was king of expecting more considering that EVE was involved in the production. I guess it fit the tone of the film though I only found a few of the tunes memorable.The premise of Bubble is nothing special, it\'s your standard post-apocalyptic Tokyo-has-been-destroyed by a supernatural phenomena.The plot & characters are my main issues with this anime, the idea of rival teams competing against each other for essential items is not a terrible idea, but it\'s developed in a way that\'s so far-fetched that even some of the in-universe characters find it nonsensical. The majority of the characters barely got any development, so when the emotional beats were suppose to hit for me they fell completely flat. There\'s once instance halfway through that a rival team kidnaps a member of another team to raise the stacks in the competition, but after the match is over this incident is never even mentioned to again despite its severity, making the whole thing feel a bit unnecessary.The two main protagonist and their relationship was the real letdown of this film, given that this is what the whole anime is based around. The male lead Hibiki is, aside from being a parkour ace, is nearly identical to the sulking, ear-phone wearing Cherry from ""Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop"", and Uta is your generic alien girl who has a unexplained crush on a human. The two barely meet and they are already in love with one another. Their relationship barely has a chance to develop before the climax hits, and I think its to the detriment of the anime.Overall, I think Bubble had some interesting ideas and concept, you could see that they were going for some analogy of the ever-changing nature of the world and how everyone is interconnected, but this never really hits its mark because even the characters of the film don\'t seem to care too much as why Tokyo is in ruin or about the parkour competition. If you\'re a fan of well-done choreography and parkour this might be an anime for you, and it might be a nice turn-your-brain off leisure watch. That said, there are plenty of very similar films with the same themes (such as Weathering with Your and Patema Inverted) that are done so much better, and I would personally recommend those instead of Bubble.

Gyokou no Nikuko-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/45620/Gyokou_no_Nikuko-chan,"['**TL;DR AT THE END.**  i am genuinely sorry that this review is so long. i will be discussing the fat elements of this movie a lot, since it\'s a perspective i understand intimately.a quick summary of this movie: it\'s a sweet slice of life centered on the protagonist, 12 year old Kikuko. the movie is split into three arcs which cover three seasons. in the summer, Kikuko gets into her first Petty Middle School Drama at school when her only friend forces her to make a tough social decision. in the fall, Kikuko begins a friendship with a quiet, strange boy that goes to...her school. in the winter, Kikuko falls ill. Through all of this, Kikuko lives her daily life on a houseboat with her fat and joyful single mother, Nikuko.as a fat woman, i was really excited when the trailer for this movie came out, because i thought that it might take a look at the relationship dynamic between a daughter and a fat mother. media that looks upon fat people favorably is rare in general, and in the anime/manga scene it\'s practically nonexistant. that being the case, i knew that the representation wasn\'t going to be perfect. but i still had high hopes- a mother-daughter relationship provides an absolutely perfect environment to explore fatness, how fatphobia changes women\'s lives, and how living as a fat woman impacts your familial relationships. i was, unfortunately, very disappointed by what the movie had to offer on this front.i was surprised at the backseat role that Nikuko plays in this movie, given the film is named after her. especially in the first two arcs, Nikuko is largely (hah) absent for most important scenes, and serves more as the backdrop of Kikuko\'s life. despite this movie\'s trailer framing the movie as a mother-daughter movie, Kikuko hardly has any meaningful interactions with Nikuko until the last arc of the movie. more on that in a bit.let\'s talk about Nikuko\'s fatness for a second. Nikuko is drawn in a way that\'s really cute, and her life is joyous, and she\'s not ashamed of herself. that in itself is nice, it\'s nice to see fat characters existing and being happy without any ""i\'m sad because i\'m fat"" plotlines. Nikuko does have a very strong history of being manipulated by unscrupulous men, which i side-eyed a bit, as ""fat woman is easy because she\'s insecure, gets totally played by asshole guy"" is a plotline that irks me to no end. thankfully, the writers didn\'t take it all the way there, never revealing why it is she\'s so prone to manipulation. not so thankfully, this is because Nikuko never gets any meaningful character development or character exploration throughout the entire film. even more unfortunately, although the writers made the wise decision to not make Nikuko into a woobie and play into Fat Angst,  it feels like it leans too much into the opposite direction. Nikuko\'s entire character can\'t be taken seriously at all. Even when serious things are happening to her daughter, Nikuko can\'t be serious about it, because then she wouldn\'t be the Funny Jolly Fat Lady anymore. no matter how hard you squint, Nikuko is hardly anything but a clown, even during her own slightly depressing backstory. she\'s there to make you smile and laugh by being fat.i think it\'s possible to make a fat character funny WITHOUT making their fatness the butt of all their jokes, but the writers chose not to dig into that, presumably because it\'s not as easy as just saying ""look, she eats a whole French toast in one bite, isn\'t that soooo funny?!""so, the fat representation in this movie is kind of a miss. what about the wholesome mother-daughter relationship? well, that ends up being a bit of a miss too. through the whole thing, there\'s this awkward distance between the two, where neither seems to want to make the effort to become closer with each other, simply settling for daily life and surface-level conversations. Nikuko doesn\'t act very motherly, aside from providing Kikuko\'s basic needs, instead playing a role resembling a big sister or best friend. in fact, there are many scenes where it feels like Kikuko plays the role of mother, while Nikuko acts like a child, and the detrimental nature of this dynamic is never even casually mentioned, only being touched with a ten-foot pole once (when Kikuko says ""who\'s the child here?!"" as a throwaway joke). this was very frustrating at times, because it felt like there was a huge elephant in the room being ignored: that Nikuko kind of sucks as a mother and Kikuko is struggling in silence because their bond isn\'t deep enough for her to seek out Nikuko\'s guidance.even when there are emotionally potent moments in the movie, they hardly ever involve Nikuko. this is an incredibly sad missed opportunity to me. Kikuko has emotional struggles that would be perfect as a pathway to introducing Nikuko\'s more motherly side, but instead of getting Nikuko involved in her personal life at all, Kikuko solves most of her problems on her own. the only time Kikuko has a meaningful conversation with her mom is at the very end of the movie, and even then it doesn\'t get any deeper than an ""i love you.""  the sports festival scene is far and away THE shining moment for both of their characters as we get to see a glimpse of what the movie could be like if it actually cared about their family dynamic.ALL THAT BEING SAID, this movie is still really nice! wholesome to the core, it emulates Ghibli in a way that doesn\'t feel contrived. gorgeous and lovingly-crafted scenery, beautiful character animation, good pacing (seriously, this movie and My Neighbors the Yamadas are the only slice of life movies that haven\'t bored me to tears), funny jokes (when they\'re not about Nikuko being fat), and a good balance between emotional ups and downs that never feels jarring. the emotional flow of the story is smooth like a wave, good at tempering sad moments with twinges of happiness.i think i just wanted more from this movie than the writers were willing to give, which is fine. just because it isn\'t what i wanted it to be doesn\'t mean it\'s a bad movie.that\'s my take on it, anyways.anyone looking for something about fat people that actually explores the emotional nuances of being fat should read Pochamani. anyone looking for a cute family-centric slice of life should watch My Neighbors the Yamadas. anyone looking for gorgeous oceanside small town scenery should watch Ponyo. anyone looking for a powerful coming of age story should watch Anohana. if you\'ve exhausted those other options, come watch this movie, it\'s cute.6/10.tl;dr: the movie is cute, gentle, and wholesome, but ultimately fails to deliver a strong mother-daughter bond AND positive representation for fat people. if you\'re not looking for either of those things, this is a pretty good movie. if anything, it\'s worth watching for its great scenery and fun character animation. her school. in the winter, Kikuko falls ill.

The art was beautiful, the story was beautiful, and even the theme was beautiful.The art was almost comparable to that of ghibli, except more expressive. It wasn't just a plus, it actually helped to set the entire tone of the movie and even just scenes on their own. The laughing and the crying of the mother made it clear that this was going to be a heartwarming movie, but the nearly continuous expression of the daughter (or others around her) gave the tone more nuanced.The story was one where I feel many people could find a part they relate...to. There are many characters all with different experiences which allow you to attach yourself to any of them, while still feeling like you can at least understand the main character.The lesson is unsurprisingly about love and acceptance not just towards family, but also towards yourself. This tends to be a repetitive narrative throughout the industry, however, this was such a personal take that it almost felt new. I want to make it clear that this was my personal opinion on what the theme was. This movie felt like an art piece hanging on a gallery where you could almost interpret any theme you needed from it.It was very moving, as by the end I felt as though I had been there experiencing the story alongside the characters. In fact, I found myself wishing there was more. This isn't because it didn't end well, or because it didn't feel correct. It was just such a journey that I wish it went on forever. to.

When alone, Kikuko imagines external things making brief remarks. A lizard would say in a devious man\'s voice her darker thoughts. A shrine Torii gate would speak to her like a passer-by salesman, and a cicada would lament that he lived underground for 7 years only to die above within days. My favourite is a penguin that cries, ""Death to all!""In portraying her experience of the world and how it changes over time, the film doesn\'t tell one continuous plot, opting to tell several that kickstart her coming-of-age. A small...crush on a boy whose eccentricity she feels an affinity to. A brief drama with her friends that only a child her age would find so devastating. A tween-like fear of being embarrassed over her mother in front of her peers. These low-stakes, lifelike events don\'t exist to tell a definite moral conclusion, but to transform her slowly as she develops deeper, more meaningful relationships with others.The relation between Kikuko and the Other is of both stylistic and thematic import in the film. In many shots the camera will linger on the thing she\'s looking at, from her POV or over her shoulder, and then switch to a close-up of her face, centering on the light in her eyes. Her gaze and the subject she\'s beholding make a powerful dyad that many of the film\'s intimate scenes revolve around.This phenomenological presentation of Kikuko\'s world extends to other aspects of the movie. The background art is grounded in reality, but everything is a little more colourful than it would be in real life: the restaurant tables are more vividly red, the trees more verdant. Her daydreams are intruded by bizarre imagery of foods in the shape of her mom. Indeed, she speaks many words and spends many ruminations about her mom.Kikuko’s mother is the real star of the film. Miss Nikuko is a woman who lives life in fullness, both in her stomach and in joy. She\'ll bring giant rice balls to lunch and down a whole toast in one gulp. She\'s overjoyed by aquariums like a child. In a yakiniku she\'ll always have the loudest laugh and tell the worst puns. In sleep she\'ll snore like the roof will fall in.

The movie spends loving moments animating her large gestures, her body bouncing around and unafraid to stretch and contract out-of-model to express her emotions as fully as she experiences them. These close moments between Kikuko and Nikuko are depicted in their tiny seaside town between all the minutiae of rural life, or in their warm cosy boat home, with worn-out appliances and checker-patterned blinders and all the kinds of little decorations and clutter one would pick up over decades.

The reason that Nikuko constantly gets her heart broken, and isn’t ashamed of telling bad jokes nor of being so gleeful, is not that she is unaware or naïve. The true reason is the stuff that comprises the fabric of the film, what all her boundless laughter and life-to-the-hilt point to: that all the hardship and heartbreak of the myriad adventures in life will never stop her from going at it again. So Nikuko is, and so Kikuko comes to appreciate, to be boisterous and strange and unashamed in all your enterprise, and leave the rest to fortune. crush on a boy whose eccentricity she feels an affinity to. A brief drama with her friends that only a child her age would find so devastating. A tween-like fear of being embarrassed over her mother in front of her peers. These low-stakes, lifelike events don\'t exist to tell a definite moral conclusion, but to transform her slowly as she develops deeper, more meaningful relationships with others.The relation between Kikuko and the Other is of both stylistic and thematic import in the film. In many shots the camera will linger on the thing she\'s looking at, from her POV or over her shoulder, and then switch to a close-up of her face, centering on the light in her eyes. Her gaze and the subject she\'s beholding make a powerful dyad that many of the film\'s intimate scenes revolve around.This phenomenological presentation of Kikuko\'s world extends to other aspects of the movie. The background art is grounded in reality, but everything is a little more colourful than it would be in real life: the restaurant tables are more vividly red, the trees more verdant.

Especially the aspect of being raised by a single mom getting scammed by those she chose to love and struggling all her life under low income, and even then loving unconditionally her child. It brought back memories that are fonder to me than people think.The animation is absolutely stunning and the characters are funny, compelling, and relatable. I do recommend this...for those who enjoy slice of life and drama anime. for those who enjoy slice of life and drama anime.', '>Gyokou no Nikuko-chan 2021 artwork-might help;#At first I thought what made this film comfortable was the ship and the houseand maybe I thought this had a slight similarity to \'Tokyo Godfather\'It\'s just that it\'s animated as cheerfully and cartoonishly as possible so it\'s suitable for PG and middle to upper teens.also not as harsh as the world and realistic in the real world.*In the first 5 minutes, Nikuko-chan\'s tragic background is already sadIt\'s true that it\'s too good, it\'s okay, there are limits, so I understand....quoted from my lecturer ""Pitying others has its limits."" damn, there\'s a lot of meaning here**Don\'t think other people understand you, but vice versa.the poetry that I digested in the first 5 minutes was;- ""before assembling other wings, make your own wings for flying.""There isn\'t much of a message in this film. but once it\'s in!not hypocritical.

Gyokou no Nikuko-chan takes clear inspiration from the Western premises of an impulsive middle-aged woman being swayed by romantic attention, yet her carefree and kind demeanor makes all the difference, particularly for Kikuko. It plays out like an ecological fable; the relationships of people versus open-minded acceptance. Nikuko is a large woman with imperfections that stick out like a sore thumb, but her eccentric nature doesn't detract from the positive mother-daughter relationship on display. The film is inherently lighthearted, loosely escalating to...coming-of-age realizations. Nothing especially substantial occurs until the closing act, and viewing it outside of fictional dimensions, the gentle messages are primarily directed at the viewer. Needless to say, a narrative isn't required to develop, but basking in the ordinariness of daily life greatly benefits from dynamic components. It's a matter of whether the weight-related punchlines, which are occasionally amusing, are enough to compensate for what it lacks in compelling characters.Watanabe's drama about an oft-dysfunctional family removes conventional domestic roles from its thematic repertoire, dividing responsibilities equally. It's mood-centric; adolescent discovery of various emotions that may not be explicitly stated. The humor dabbles in anthropomorphic realism, as we'll see animals passing by after blurting out silly phrases. Additionally, Kimura's watercolor backgrounds are appealing and the film is obsessed with food for obvious reasons. The key animation is generally solid, and aside from similar designs to Kaijuu no Kodomo, both are analogous in shot selection. Gyokou no Nikuko-chan avoids merging into a linear flow of momentum, incorporating sudden flashbacks as it sees fit. The reflective disposition of the undercharacterized cast touches upon easygoing melodrama, yet the absence of a more convincing conflict prevents fully advancing its storytelling prowess. Tonally pleasant as it bridges the gap toward idealized adulthood. coming-of-age realizations.

Not only did the food entice me, but I also found the visuals and vagueness of the plot quite engrossing. For my first time watching an anime film in a local theater, I must say, I was thoroughly delighted with my experience. If you have family members that you feel make it their mission to embarrass you and are looking for a film that empathizes with you, look no further than Fortune Favors Lady Nukiko. So, is this film all that I’m talking it up to be, or were my...opinions swayed due to the unique circumstances surrounding my viewing experience?This film follows the everyday life and tribulations of a girl named Kikuko and her mom Nukiko. Who is larger than life in more ways than one and is the antithesis to her daughter, excluding their kind natured personalities. Throughout her life, Nukiko has been taken advantage of and bullied for her silly, kind-hearted, and often dumb-founded nature by many men. Often extorting money from her, before getting out of dodge. Throughout her many expeditions, Nukiko and her daughter finally settle down in a small fishing town/district where Nukiko runs a restaurant. Standing out more than ever before.As mentioned earlier, upon seeing the trailer for this film, the vagueness of the story was piquing my interest. So coming into it I figured the central plot/conflict would be revealed. I mean, the run time was two-hours so there had to be something in terms of a plot right? I was wrong, but was pleasantly surprised by that as well. After the film finished, I came to my senses and realized that I had just watched an Iyashikei-sol film in theaters. Now I’ve seen my fair share of Iyashikei shows and films up to this point, Natsume and NNB reign as some of my favorites in the genre, but I went into those knowing full well what to expect. But when I discovered the film is composed of several small stories, shown with beautiful and calming scenery and visuals with no real central conflict other than Yukiko’s mom being a goofball, I was surprised but delighted.And in case you didn’t know, an Iyashikei is a genre of anime/film that evokes a sense of healing in the viewer. The anime is calming, has a relaxed atmosphere most of the time, and usually has little to no score aside from flowing river banks, smooth ghasts of wind, and summer time cicadas humming along to a sun addled field of green grass. They are also usually episodic with conflicts that vary from episode to episode in terms of severity. Or in a film’s case, chapter by chapter. This is the case with this film, where even the more intense scenes or moments still take a more liberal approach to how they’re displayed.For example, there’s a scene where we see a woman working the streets before working at a strip/dance club. We’re shown this through a heavy blurred filter where the casino-strip’s street light’s luminescence is exacerbated so much that the scene feels dream-like and not as intimidating as it must’ve felt for Yukiko’s mom. This scene is followed by a strip/pole dance montage where we see neon silhouettes of two women, one of which we’re familiar with doing their moves. Something about the imagery of this flashback sequence stuck with me. Maybe it was the fact that it put their line of work through a different lens than what I’m used to. In various media, I’m used to seeing dance/strip clubs in a somewhat vilified manner, or at the very least, portrayed in a less than stellar light. The way this scene portrayed that environment and form of expression was done very tastefully, with beaming colorful visuals to boot.Another example of an intense scenario presented in a calm, tasteful, and respectful manner is when Nikuko is describing the circumstances surrounding the events of one of her late husbands. Nikuko and co. are presented as shadows traversing a canvas that visually reminiscent of hieroglyphics. In this scene, we’re shown a man on a patio smoking. His figure looking down on his luck, slouching over, chin resting on hand. Moments later Nikuko describes that the man left a letter saying he was going to go kill himself at his home town. She describes her venture to find and save the man, but to no avail. While a depressing scenario indeed, it is very brief and shown through a lens that shows that though Nikuko loved him, and out of her partners he was the one who treated her the most respectfully, we’re not given enough information to feel a strong emotional attachment to him. I felt that was intentional and the emotions I felt watching that scene were meant to reflect that of Nikuko’s and her daughter’s towards him.I’m not going to describe the beauty of each and every scene, because at that point I’d be spoilering the entire film and I don’t want to do that. But just know that whether the scene is of a penguin at a zoo who’s filled with visceral hatred towards the human race, a young boy making silly faces, or a talking amphibian, just know that it’s done with great attention to detail and has a calming aura to it. To round out the things I love about it so much, I’ll close off my praises by giving credit to the voice acting, Nukiko’s seiyuu (Shinobu Otake) in particular. What a performance, giving Nukiko such a boisterous and voracious voice. Only adding credence to how much space her personality in a room takes up. I found her panicking in the sports day event to highlight this performance the most as she’s constantly switching from forgiving others for her clumsy nature, to panicking not knowing where to find an item, all while retaining a lovable mom-like quality that doesn’t become annoying.Speaking of actions that become annoying, was there anything in this film that I felt fit that criteria? Yes, I have two gripes with this film and they intertwine with each other. I felt that there were relationships between and plot points weren’t explored to their fullest potential. Whether that be with her friends, or (spoiler) her real mom. Because the way this movie is set up is like your average Iyashikei show. Episodic and not necessary to watch sequentially until the last few episodes. This movie is the same way, and I wish that we saw more of her interactions with her friends instead of just being one and done after their conflict is resolved.This issue only gets worse as we reach the final act which I’ll spare you the details on. But let it be known that the ending is just too abrupt. It didn’t ruin the film or lessen the impact it had on me. But it did make me audibly go,”What? That was it, are you serious?” It’s been awhile since a show or film left me so dumb-founded. The most confusing part was checking my phone and seeing that there were 15 - 20 minutes left in its runtime, and this is even proceeding the after-credits scene. It’s because there was a series of shorts called,”Deiji Meets Girl” playing right after it. I didn’t know this until the preview played right before the film, and even then I didn’t think it’d share the run time of, “Fortune Favor’s lady Nukiko”.This film caught my eye due to its unique and captivating visuals, as well as its ability to make me crave food that’s not even in my dimension. Having a family that I feel at times go out of their way to embarrass me at times made me relate to the main character, only furthering my intrigue. Did this film manage to be all that I hoped it to be? Yes and no. But that’s because it exceeded my expectations by going full Iyashikei when I wasn’t expecting it, for the better might I add. Though this hindered it at times, namely in the ending which left my mouth ajar and my head squandering to make sense of what I just witnessed. Had this been a show, I’d be eagerly waiting for a second season we’d never get. But as a movie, I eagerly await a sequel that I know we’ll never get. If the novel furthers the plot more than the film, then I’d pick that up. opinions swayed due to the unique circumstances surrounding my viewing experience?This film follows the everyday life and tribulations of a girl named Kikuko and her mom Nukiko.

Basically there are giant balls that can kick ass and have a bunch of cannons and can withstand atomic bombs. Then there's Qwenther and Havia who outsmart them and become famous and the whole story is just them figuring out the weaknesses and beating everyone else. Of course you have to have the teenagers be the ones beating everyone up though because that's the law of mecha. Even the commander is only 18 -_- not saying there's anything wrong...it's just so cliche...Art- It was pretty averageSound- I liked some of the sound tracks and the voice actors were nice tooCharacter- They do a good job with the characters and it's entertaining watching Qwenther always awakening his inner genius at the last moment and saving the princess.  It's always funny when they throw in the pervert element of the 2 mc's too. The producers made good antagonists that made you want to smack them and it brings out the mc's good points even more. There isn't much character development though since they were basically at the peak from the start.Story- Loved it. It was basically repeating but it kept be hooked the whole time just watching them fight Objects. They waste a lot of time explaining the plans and stuff though even though if you're a normal human being it's hard to keep up with sometimes.Basically if you like action and a little bit of humor it will probably fit your fancy. You don't have to like mecha to like this. Personally I'm not a huge mecha fan but I really liked this anime.That's all thanks for reading. ^~^ it's just so cliche...Art- It was pretty averageSound- I liked some of the sound tracks and the voice actors were nice tooCharacter- They do a good job with the characters and it's entertaining watching Qwenther always awakening his inner genius at the last moment and saving the princess.

When you throw an armored machine with unimaginable technology into war, these bad boys are supposed to be the ultimate ace in the hole. They can apparently turn tides in modern warfare. Objects are supposed to revered and feared on the battlefield. Then, we are introduced to two boys - Qwenthur and Havia. These two are able to actually defeat a heavy object with their reckless strategies and thus their daily military misadventure begins in this unorthodox sci-fi show.Adapted from the light novel of the same name, some viewers may be familiar with the origins...of this series already. It’s created by Kazuma Kamchi, the brainchild of Toaru Majutsu no Index. With 10 volumes released, the anime adaptation covers a 2-cour of 24 episodes. As as sci-fi modern warfare story, Heavy Objects hits on a variety of ideas. But is it really satisfying with its execution?There’s a bunch of agendas the series tries to achieve when judging on the surface. One of these is establishing the main players, or otherwise nations that clashes in warfare. These include the Legitimacy Kingdom, Capitalist Corporations, Information Alliance, and the Faith Organization. Each of these favors different values and has their own goals. Second, there are the main characters. Qwenthur and Havia are the two main guys on the frontlines and are literally daredevils. With a wacky sense of humor, both of them really has ways to escape death. Time and time again, the show puts them into situations where they are likely to die yet somehow escapes with their hearts still beating. Some might call this “plot armor” but the show marks it more as a gimmick. Both of these guys are also very crafty and is shown by the way they defeated their first Object. Joining them are two female characters - Frolaytia and Milinda, the elite princess.  Frolaytia is their commanding officer and often puts them in dangerous missions. Her quite temper and slight sadistic personality makes her someone to be feared. The show also makes her more of the fan service character as often times, there are suggestive camera shots at her body. This is furthered by the fact that she tempts the boys with her pseudo-sadism. On the other hand, Milinda is more of a quiet girl who relies on using her pilot skills to get the job done. As the pilot of the Baby Magnum, she displays impressive skills that makes her a threat to her enemies. Throughout the series, I think it’s pretty obvious that she has a crush on Qwenthur judging on her reactions.By the third or fourth episode, it’ll be obvious at how the show is structured with its storytelling. It’s chronicled in a series of arcs that has an overall connection to the main story. The Objects are the main attraction that gets featured in warfare. As thus, a good deal of the show concentrates on exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of the Objects. Each of them has a different configuration, design, armaments, model, and other features that makes it stand out on the battlefield. Now, I admit. I’m kind of a sci-fi nerd when it comes to shows like this. And by the context of this show, it’s quite fascinating when examining the features of these Objects.  Essentially, they are armored fighting machines with almost all of them having a spherical main body. The design of each Object is covered by body armor that makes their defensive capabilities pretty stiff. Their propulsion system allows the Objects to maneuver on almost any time of environment. As a show that transits battle environments from the frosty lands of Alaska to dense jungles of the Amazons, it’s pretty important to show how Objects can function in different circumstances. Then, there’s also the reactor that fuels the energy of the Objects. Think of it like as a battery. The pilot controls the cockpit and each Object has its own unique control system. The show mostly features this for Milinida as we see the detailed structure of Baby Magnum’s cockpit. Finally, each Object has a heavy arsenal of weapons that ranges from impressive railguns, laser beam cannons, plasma weapons, and technology that far surpasses our own in the real world. In retrospect, the show does a neat job to cover the mechanics of the Objects and why they have such reputations. And in a story of sci-fi warfare, that needs to be.On a more personal or relationship level, the show is a bit of a hit or miss. In particular, Qwenthur is a character that is hard to get attached to. He is a daredevil but also very dense when it comes to the feelings of some characters, in particular Milinida. At various points during this show, he gets unintentionally caught in misunderstandings that comically puts himself and others in danger. He invokes the wrath of the girls without knowing with his poor choice of words. And to top it all, he doesn’t realize it even with his good buddy Havia screaming at him. On the other hand, Qwenthur and Havia has a pretty amusing relationship. Their on screen moments shows that they act more like brothers than comrades. Their reckless tactics often requires teamwork and strategic timings so the show emphasizes on their trusting connection. This easily shows that they respect each other while also getting the job done and is one of the key reasons that they are able to survive so many times. Furthermore, the boys often help out Milinida when she is in danger while putting their own lives at risk. It earns Frolaytia’s criticism but there is also genuine among of trust that she places onto the boys. It’s a bit of an unorthodox relationship when these four are shown on screen each time but there’s definitely a good amount of connection between them.On some of the more negative note, Heavy Object relies far too much on its comedy at times. The sex jokes are pretty evident that quickly gets repetitive. From tight pilot suits to pole dancing, the show tries to pull out every trick from the book. There’s also not enough concrete characterization for the majority of the cast. Although Havia gets some decent characterization in one of the arcs, it’s not really enough to salvage the show. And speaking of main characters, Milinida is a girl that I think people will find hard to relate or like. That stoic face and lack of character development doesn’t make her stand out much in the show. At times, she is even used in story as a fan service object. While the show invests a good amount of time about the Objects, there’s little investment on some of the main antagonists. And even when it does, it’s pretty stereotypical. Finally, some of the supporting characters like Havia’s fiancé, Ho Ho Ho(Yes, that’s not really her real name), Sladder Honeysuckle, etc will be easily forgettable except for their names.After the promotional videos, it became fairly obvious that J.C Staff would also participate with animating the main series. And because the nature of the original character designs, except to see some similarities.  On the positive side, the studio put a good amount of effort to make Objects look like a legitimate threat. I already mentioned their combat features and the show does a well job in crafting them in physical form. This is also demonstrated in the sheer force of fighting power they show on the battlefield. Indeed, the action is solid and fairly well coordinated with its stylized choreography. Character designs are also inspired with military outfits depending on the battle environment. The pilot outfits are also noticeable especially in the case of Milinda. Now, do be aware that there’s also a fair amount of fan service. The awkward timings that usually focus on the girls can sometimes feel humorously uncomforting. Despite that, artwork is decent in general ranging from the impressive Object designs and battlefield landscapes.Depending on your perspective, the music and soundtrack of the show may or may not stand out. There are two OP theme songs although the first one has a more lyrical beat than the second. The OST of the show is what you may expect if you’ve seen other sci-fi related features. Only of course, it’s somewhat more lighthearted at times while also tense during battle scenarios. The character voice mannerisms are what I depict as fair. The guys’ voices blends between casual to stressful depending on what the type of situations they are caught up in. Sometimes though, it makes them look like fools in the face of danger. Milinda’s voice sounds like a robot at times so it’ll be hard to adapt with from early on.  And of course, there’s Frolaytia. Any fan who is familiar with Shizuka Itou will recognize her voice right away and she seems to carry on her role when stepping in the shoes of the commander. Remember Akeno from High School DxD or Hildegard from Beelzebub? Yeah, you get the idea.Heavy Object is a trick pony. It’s a show with sci-fi elements that also tosses in comedy in the face of danger. With the way the story is structured, it’s to be expected that there will be a variety to offer. This is true when applying to the Objects but the characterization in the show is rather unimpressive. Relationship dynamics is not something I think people will appreciate unless they are part of a target audience. As such, the show is designed to not be taken so seriously like some realistic war story. In fact, you’ll have to watch based on what it’s shown rather than what you’d expect. of this series already.

Almost looked like an Apocalypse show to me, but not really. The concept of the action is ""Object"". Now, what is Object. Object is an Amazing weapon which people use in War. So let me fix it again, The concept of the action is War, Strategy and Object. Why is Object considered as Amazing Weapon even Nuclear bomb can\'t even destroyed it ? Object looks like a Ball. A big ball with a high quality of Steel as it\'s Skin. and it\'s not only 1 layer of steel. 10 or more layers if i\'m not wrong. Because of Object, Now people made a...different way to War. Basically it\'s just an Object VS Object without any flesh soldier on the field, and if one of the Object can\'t move anymore, That will be the end of the War. Pretty Simple, but that\'s what people imagine it would be. In reality, or more like in this anime, Things went different after Object appeared in the middle of the War. War is still the same as usual but with Object right now. People will keep killing each other. Conflict between Country never stop. Fighting for money. for desire. The war still the same as the usual, and this where Qwenthur and Havia came in.Like i said up there about the story, in my opinion, it was a really complicated story especially when it comes into an Object. they really went deep into the Obejct that sometimes i can\'t even understand what the MC is talking about. well i guess it\'s obvious because it\'s Sci-fi Anime. Overall from the story, it was great despite having a complicated story. Not! all the story are complicated. it\'s just when it comes into an Object, i got confused. I like the way they executed the arcs. i don\'t read the LN but i like it. There were no plot BIG! plot twist but overall i like it.The animation...they used 3D/CGI for the action. i think they used CGI so that it looks real. for me, it looks great. the action looks great in my opinion. Fit perfectly to how the action goes. 3D/CGI really match perfectly with the action in my opinion. And sometimes it\'s not all abou Object, fighting each other like a monster. there were some soldier figthing each other (including Qwenthur and Havia) and i like it. Not only that! the MC always bring a humorous content while in the action. There were some comedy too while there were not in the action (Fanservice XD) but i like the way they put a comedy in the action XD It was a really fun ride with the two bastard MC XD.The character, like i said, the MC\'s are so funny. Really good choice of personality to put in the battlefield, the action always filled with a comey. i like that.The soundtrack was great in my opinion. Made a really fit atmosphere to this anime. That for the OP and ED song. for the actual soundtrack, it was good i guess. i don\'t have any problem with itOverall, it was a really fun ride to me. i wish there is a second season tho...i really enjoy it. Thanks whoever make this show....( J.C.Staff and SANZIGEN) for making this show 9/10I recommend it if you like Military and Sci-fi and...Mecha. and it\'s really unique too with having that kind of character for the Main character. never seen this kind of show before tbhi\'m gonna miss this showSorry for bad english.Hope my review can be helpful to you all.Thanks. Have a nice day different way to War. Basically it\'s just an Object VS Object without any flesh soldier on the field, and if one of the Object can\'t move anymore, That will be the end of the War.

Have a nice day', 'Quiz time!  What\'s the most important element of a good war story?a) The gripping character drama as relatable characters are forced into dangerous situationsb) The moral ambiguity of the conflict (good people having to do bad things)c) The themes of loss, both of life and of innocence, on the battlefieldd) The tits and ass of the 14 year-old mecha pilotIf you answered D, congratulations!  You might be a future light novel writer.Every season of anime has one show that is so awful it can\'t even be enjoyed for its failings anymore.  This season, one of the candidates for that prestigious wooden spoon...falls to Heavy Object, a series based off a light novel (alarm bells ringing yet?) by the notoriously anal-retentive Kazuma Kamachi.  While it isn\'t the absolute worst the season has produced so far, it\'s right near the bottom.STORY- 1/10The world of Heavy Object is one where the titular Objects, giant, round mecha, fight in a series of never-ending conflicts with laser guns and all sorts of other advanced technology.  Just from reading the blurb on MAL and seeing the picture, I bet you\'d expect a hilarious Michael Bay meets G Gundam-style train wreck with mecha beating the piss out of each other, deliciously hammy screaming, the power of nakama, and everything that possibly can blow up blowing up.It\'s not.While some shows might be terrible in both production values and story, they are just so delightfully over-the-top that you can derive all sorts of enjoyment from them.  This show is not that at all.  If Code Geass is the equivalent of two 747s colliding in midair, and Mirai Nikki is the equivalent of a fully-loaded freight train plowing a poor 16-wheeler who had the misfortune to stall right on the railroad tracks, Heavy Object is the equivalent of backing into a light pole in the neighborhood going 15 miles an hour.""But surely,"" you say, ""when two incredibly powerful and destructive mechs go at it, there\'s got to be something to enjoy, right?""First off, a lot of the time it\'s not even two mecha fighting at all.  The story is mainly about our two bland protagonists goofing off, being perverts, and...blowing up Objects with barely applicable ""reasoning"".Yes, the most advanced technological weapon in the history of man, one that ""was single-handedly able to change war forever"", is defeated by two ordinary foot soldiers.  And again, and again, and again, and again.  You now have a good idea of the plot.  It devalues the threat of the Objects so much because the countries that use them seem downright idiotic for letting two regular joes being able to blow them up on a regular basis.  Hasn\'t anyone actually thought of preparing for sabotage, or trying to stop it?As well as being utterly boring, it doesn\'t help that the show shoehorns in what seems like every light novel trope, in dead seriousness.  There\'s constant gazes and glimpses of the schoolgirl mecha pilot\'s, well, ejection hatch, and most of the fanservice of both her and the attractive female commander (case in point: the infamous pole-dancing scene) comes off as completely out of place due to the fact that there\'s just so much of it despite it being completely superfluous and unnecessary.  The commander wears kimonos that show off her shoulders and breasts.  There\'s an idol singer who shows up for a few episodes.  A private military contractor in the final few episodes dresses like maids, and they say ""goshujinsama"".  I am not making this up.  This is despite the ethnic makeup of every character that has appeared in the story being 0% Japanese.At some point, you wonder if the writer has any idea what a war story, or mecha story, actually is.  But that doesn\'t stop Kamachi.One of the good parts of To Aru Majutsu no Index, as much as I had gripes with it, was how detailed its setting was.  Almost every character and artifact that appeared had pages on who they were and why they were important, and it added a lot of depth to what would be a forgettable harem light novel.  Heavy Object doesn\'t even have the worldbuilding aspect going for it.  The world is fractured into all sorts of small countries fighting each other because...they are.  That\'s it.  This is compounded by the fact that the author seems to have no idea how an actual military works.  Let\'s just say that anyone who\'s actually served overseas would be less than pleased at this anime\'s portrayal of war.There\'s even times where the story tries to get serious, and bring questions of morality into the equation.  The key word here is ""tries"", because it sure doesn\'t succeed.  Characters will discuss the immoral side of war (while the enemies they\'re fighting are obviously and hilariously evil, mind you), and then the next scene will be another steamy fanservice scene in a change so quick it will give you whiplash.  All the light novel tropes mentioned above makes it impossible to take any serious aspects of the story at face value, and the sheer cliche status of the characters makes it downright idiotic to try to introduce these ""mature"" elements. Morality is a key issue of war stories, but Heavy Object is too much of a joke to really even be considered one, and as such should never have attempted to get serious in the first place.  I hear fans all over say that ""you shouldn\'t take it seriously"".  However, why shouldn\'t I when it attempts to pose questions such as this?  It clearly wants to take itself seriously.  Why should it be judged as a parody?CHARACTERS-1/10Main characters Qwenthur and Havia are completely and totally depthless and generic, except for their perversity which seems to increase exponentially every arc.  It\'s like the author decided to drop two harem MCs into a setting without even making it a harem, because both of them could be interchanged with any other light novel protag without missing a beat in the story.But my major issue with them is that they\'re one of the biggest Gary Stu duos of the season.  Remember the fact that Objects are supposed to be so powerful they make foot soldiers obsolete?  Well, these two never lose against them. They do what is the equivalent of defeating a nuclear missile with a baseball bat, and they do it every single arc.  You thought Touma and his ""nullify everything"" was bad?  The amount of plot armor these two have could send an elevator into freefall just by getting on it.  Because who needs narrative tension when you have plot armor?  It\'s not helped by the fact that they\'re incredibly unsympathetic; they get away with almost everything questionable they do, and the show just laughs it off.In contrast, Milinda, the female mecha pilot, exists only to lose.  The ability of the protagonists to pull bullshit logic out of their asses allowing them to win is matched only by her ability to job in fights she clearly has the edge in.  The only reason why she\'s there is to provide fanservice, which, as she is a major character, clearly signals something\'s wrong with that portrayal.  ""Depth"" does not mean ""bra size"", ""depth"" means ""backstory and motivations"".The female commanding officer is largely the same as Milinda, although she at least has a few lines explaining her situation and is reasonably competent at her job.  Nonetheless, the characters are all so one-dimensional that it\'s nearly impossible to like them.ART- 7/10JC Staff, known for their adaptation of mediocre light novels like Shakugan no Shana, DanMachi, and the aforementioned Index, takes the helm on this production.  The art is pretty good.  I\'ll admit it\'s done quite well, and while some of the CGI might be a little shaky, it melds well most of the time.  It\'s quite possibly the only thing saving this show in the first place.SOUND-3/10Both the music and the voice acting are completely bland and unforgettable.  Despite there being some names in the cast that are recognizable, all the characters\' voices are as generic as their personalities.  The music is even more so; if anyone managed to get a track from this anime stuck in their head, I\'d be impressed.  It goes hand in hand with the low production values of the art, and adds the final cherry on top of this atrocity of an animated television series.OVERALL-2/10Heavy Object had the potential to be an at least sort-of enjoyable trainwreck, but as noted above, it couldn\'t even manage that.  Instead what we got is a weird mishmash of all the wrong parts about serious war stories, hot-blooded mecha shows, and trashy LNs.  When the art is the only thing saving you from a 1/10, you know something\'s wrong.  Hope I could at least convince someone not to watch it, or to go into it with heavy apprehensions, and it leaves me with the final thoughts that Kazuma Kamachi really needs to step his game up. falls to Heavy Object, a series based off a light novel (alarm bells ringing yet?) by the notoriously anal-retentive Kazuma Kamachi.  While it isn\'t the absolute worst the season has produced so far, it\'s right near the bottom.STORY- 1/10The world of Heavy Object is one where the titular Objects, giant, round mecha, fight in a series of never-ending conflicts with laser guns and all sorts of other advanced technology.  Just from reading the blurb on MAL and seeing the picture, I bet you\'d expect a hilarious Michael Bay meets G Gundam-style train wreck with mecha beating the piss out of each other, deliciously hammy screaming, the power of nakama, and everything that possibly can blow up blowing up.It\'s not.While some shows might be terrible in both production values and story, they are just so delightfully over-the-top that you can derive all sorts of enjoyment from them.  This show is not that at all.  If Code Geass is the equivalent of two 747s colliding in midair, and Mirai Nikki is the equivalent of a fully-loaded freight train plowing a poor 16-wheeler who had the misfortune to stall right on the railroad tracks, Heavy Object is the equivalent of backing into a light pole in the neighborhood going 15 miles an hour.""But surely,"" you say, ""when two incredibly powerful and destructive mechs go at it, there\'s got to be something to enjoy, right?""First off, a lot of the time it\'s not even two mecha fighting at all.  The story is mainly about our two bland protagonists goofing off, being perverts, and...blowing up Objects with barely applicable ""reasoning"".Yes, the most advanced technological weapon in the history of man, one that ""was single-handedly able to change war forever"", is defeated by two ordinary foot soldiers.  And again, and again, and again, and again.  You now have a good idea of the plot.  It devalues the threat of the Objects so much because the countries that use them seem downright idiotic for letting two regular joes being able to blow them up on a regular basis.  Hasn\'t anyone actually thought of preparing for sabotage, or trying to stop it?As well as being utterly boring, it doesn\'t help that the show shoehorns in what seems like every light novel trope, in dead seriousness.  There\'s constant gazes and glimpses of the schoolgirl mecha pilot\'s, well, ejection hatch, and most of the fanservice of both her and the attractive female commander (case in point: the infamous pole-dancing scene) comes off as completely out of place due to the fact that there\'s just so much of it despite it being completely superfluous and unnecessary.  The commander wears kimonos that show off her shoulders and breasts.  There\'s an idol singer who shows up for a few episodes.  A private military contractor in the final few episodes dresses like maids, and they say ""goshujinsama"".  I am not making this up.  This is despite the ethnic makeup of every character that has appeared in the story being 0% Japanese.At some point, you wonder if the writer has any idea what a war story, or mecha story, actually is.  But that doesn\'t stop Kamachi.One of the good parts of To Aru Majutsu no Index, as much as I had gripes with it, was how detailed its setting was.  Almost every character and artifact that appeared had pages on who they were and why they were important, and it added a lot of depth to what would be a forgettable harem light novel.  Heavy Object doesn\'t even have the worldbuilding aspect going for it.  The world is fractured into all sorts of small countries fighting each other because...they are.  That\'s it.  This is compounded by the fact that the author seems to have no idea how an actual military works.  Let\'s just say that anyone who\'s actually served overseas would be less than pleased at this anime\'s portrayal of war.There\'s even times where the story tries to get serious, and bring questions of morality into the equation.  The key word here is ""tries"", because it sure doesn\'t succeed.  Characters will discuss the immoral side of war (while the enemies they\'re fighting are obviously and hilariously evil, mind you), and then the next scene will be another steamy fanservice scene in a change so quick it will give you whiplash.  All the light novel tropes mentioned above makes it impossible to take any serious aspects of the story at face value, and the sheer cliche status of the characters makes it downright idiotic to try to introduce these ""mature"" elements. Morality is a key issue of war stories, but Heavy Object is too much of a joke to really even be considered one, and as such should never have attempted to get serious in the first place.  I hear fans all over say that ""you shouldn\'t take it seriously"".  However, why shouldn\'t I when it attempts to pose questions such as this?  It clearly wants to take itself seriously.  Why should it be judged as a parody?CHARACTERS-1/10Main characters Qwenthur and Havia are completely and totally depthless and generic, except for their perversity which seems to increase exponentially every arc.  It\'s like the author decided to drop two harem MCs into a setting without even making it a harem, because both of them could be interchanged with any other light novel protag without missing a beat in the story.But my major issue with them is that they\'re one of the biggest Gary Stu duos of the season.  Remember the fact that Objects are supposed to be so powerful they make foot soldiers obsolete?  Well, these two never lose against them. They do what is the equivalent of defeating a nuclear missile with a baseball bat, and they do it every single arc.  You thought Touma and his ""nullify everything"" was bad?  The amount of plot armor these two have could send an elevator into freefall just by getting on it.  Because who needs narrative tension when you have plot armor?  It\'s not helped by the fact that they\'re incredibly unsympathetic; they get away with almost everything questionable they do, and the show just laughs it off.In contrast, Milinda, the female mecha pilot, exists only to lose.  The ability of the protagonists to pull bullshit logic out of their asses allowing them to win is matched only by her ability to job in fights she clearly has the edge in.  The only reason why she\'s there is to provide fanservice, which, as she is a major character, clearly signals something\'s wrong with that portrayal.  ""Depth"" does not mean ""bra size"", ""depth"" means ""backstory and motivations"".The female commanding officer is largely the same as Milinda, although she at least has a few lines explaining her situation and is reasonably competent at her job.  Nonetheless, the characters are all so one-dimensional that it\'s nearly impossible to like them.ART- 7/10JC Staff, known for their adaptation of mediocre light novels like Shakugan no Shana, DanMachi, and the aforementioned Index, takes the helm on this production.  The art is pretty good.  I\'ll admit it\'s done quite well, and while some of the CGI might be a little shaky, it melds well most of the time.  It\'s quite possibly the only thing saving this show in the first place.SOUND-3/10Both the music and the voice acting are completely bland and unforgettable.  Despite there being some names in the cast that are recognizable, all the characters\' voices are as generic as their personalities.  The music is even more so; if anyone managed to get a track from this anime stuck in their head, I\'d be impressed.  It goes hand in hand with the low production values of the art, and adds the final cherry on top of this atrocity of an animated television series.OVERALL-2/10Heavy Object had the potential to be an at least sort-of enjoyable trainwreck, but as noted above, it couldn\'t even manage that.  Instead what we got is a weird mishmash of all the wrong parts about serious war stories, hot-blooded mecha shows, and trashy LNs.  When the art is the only thing saving you from a 1/10, you know something\'s wrong.  Hope I could at least convince someone not to watch it, or to go into it with heavy apprehensions, and it leaves me with the final thoughts that Kazuma Kamachi really needs to step his game up.', 'LA at first was excited at this anime, being a light novel adaptation by Kazuma Kamachi (the creator of the To Aru Index franchise), however from the first impressions of this anime, it gave off a huge amount of exposition about the world of Objects and that was about it for about 3 episodes or so, it wasn\'t until it got to it\'s episodic arcs where it really got interesting.The episodic arcs from episode 4 onwards changed as the arcs showed us not only world building of the world of Objects but through how the Objects are used by differing nations either wanting materials to...straight up want a dog fight with the main cast\'s Object and with Qwenthur and Havia helping just that one step and heck even they (obviously) move the plot forward to ensuring Milinda wins the battle with their lives intact.Qwenthur does have the entire ""he knows how to beat them"" schtick about him and yes he does, but even then he doesn\'t ALWAYS win and the anime knows that, however he has the typical ""dense main protagonist"" when it comes to romance -sigh- it\'s even here. As for Havia, well LA likes the character enough although he has ""perverted best friend"" status all over him. LA\'s favourite character is actually Frolaytia Capistrano because \'\'Shizuka Ito\'\'.If this anime had any flaws, it would be it\'s huge amount of exposition and less amount of the characters and more on world building, the characters by the most part are cogs for the plot and nothing more as the ""world"" they are in dictates what they need to do, twofold when it comes to Qwenthur and Havia as they are usually ordered by the higher ups to do whatever to further the plot.The animation by JC Staff were decent enough for the character designs and backgrounding, although the background limits itself to ""ocean"", ""desert"", ""artic"" and ""inside a mech"", on speaking of which SANGIZEN handles the mech and by all means they did good when it concerns the Object battles, like even with it\'s 3D CGI on the mech\'s, it works. LA will say this about CGI, if they can be fluidly animated to the scene or fight instead of blatantly obvious that it is CGI, then LA can praise the CGI and guess what the Object\'s battle set pieces using the CGI were done well.There are many plot twists concerning the plot especially about the Object to the inner conflicts of the multiple battles and as to WHY they are happening. The plot twists helps immensely to get immersed into this world and LA praise Heavy Object for that.The ending is like another episodic arc but with the stakes risen to a volatile degree and by all means it felt big due to the amount of minor characters helping Qwenthur and Havia and helped immensely, due to how Heavy Object is formatted, there could be more to come from this anime series but nonetheless this final arc was a great watch.Heavy Object looks at first a huge expositionary anime about it\'s world, but once it really gets started it really starts focusing on it\'s Object wars, the Object themselves and really how the main cast moves the world of Objects. The characters although typical and cliched, they are more golden cogs for the bigger view of the episodic plot arcs for a bigger world and war of Object.LA will say to look at this anime up to it\'s 4th episode, if your curious about Heavy Object\'s world, then carry on, if not then pass on this one. It\'s an anime where it loves it\'s world with it\'s characters being the cogs moving the plot and sure the exposition comes out A LOT but if you can slog through that and get into the more focused episodic arcs, you WILL be satisfied with it with a bigger and better world building and A LOT more risks. straight up want a dog fight with the main cast\'s Object and with Qwenthur and Havia helping just that one step and heck even they (obviously) move the plot forward to ensuring Milinda wins the battle with their lives intact.Qwenthur does have the entire ""he knows how to beat them"" schtick about him and yes he does, but even then he doesn\'t ALWAYS win and the anime knows that, however he has the typical ""dense main protagonist"" when it comes to romance -sigh- it\'s even here.

Within an hour of its airing, most people I pay attention to kept making hilari-dumb tweets such as “dropping Heavy Object because I don’t even lift” and “not even bothering to pick Heavy Object up because it looks too big for me”, and it never ceased to be funny. One wonders why we didn’t come up with this joke...before airing considering how obvious it is in retrospect. Guess we were too busy looking at the girls’ massive bosoms and connecting the unfortunate name to them.Now I’m a guy who’ll watch anything as long as it looks interesting, regardless of quality. And in Heavy Object’s case, I picked it up solely for the opportunity to exploit its name because I’m not mature enough to let such a childish goldmine slide past me. Unfortunately, it’s been more than six months since the show’s initial airing and by now, every other person who was also stupid enough to stick with this show has dug up every fleck of yellow sparkle in the thing, leaving me with little fresh material. As such, the only way I can proceed forward with my intended goal in regards to this awful anime is to put on a straight face and use these name-jokes ironically by pointing out its overuse and then using them anyways. Already did the first part and I’m going to proceed with the second, so let’s start right now by saying Heavy Object is truth in advertising because it’s a pretty heavy anime alright. Heavy in bullshit that is!Heavy Object comes to us from the creators of Index/Railgun, which I don\'t remember a thing about aside from Touma punching nuns, so I couldn\'t tell you how it compares to them other than the fact that the production values are toilet-tier with or without comparison. It\'s full of horrible production choices, from the cheap-ass CG explosions to the character designs being plainer than a rocking chair in a nursery home. The main characters are pretty bland as well. Qwenthur Barbotage and Havia Winchell are two male soldiers who received recognition for doing the impossible and destroying an elite war machine called an Object with their own ingenuity aka dumb luck and plot convenience. This causes people to realize that Objects are less effective than Metal Gears in terms of invincibility and as such, the duo are sent on a string of dangerous missions by their commanding officers hoping that lightning can strike twice. Because this is a two-cour show based on an ongoing light novel series with no end in sight, the lightning strikes about five times throughout Heavy Object\'s run, each time more contrived than the last. But considering the situations are in of themselves contrived, it all balances out I guess.The problem with our leads is that they have as much charisma as Pauly Shore and Steven Baldwin from Biodome. Everything that happens to them is completely situational, and when they\'re not doing their soldier duty, they\'re either reading porno mags or groping their superior officers. Not that it helps that said superior dresses like a stripper trying to pose as an officer, and the camera takes every opportunity to pan all over her own ""heavy objects"" even when she\'s on the battlefield. But I feel something has gone horribly wrong when the only thing you can remember about each arc after it\'s finished is what fetish the writer crowbarred in this time. There\'s also this little girl named Milinda who is pretty much the opposite in terms of fetish design, but if you think this show is above what looks to be a little girl taking every opportunity to strip down, then you don\'t know JC Staff. And no, none of the females are any better than our male leads in terms of likability. They\'re just not stupid enough to the point that you\'d want to punch them, then drill holes in their heads before turning it on yourself.As is usual for what passes for writing in light novel world, Heavy Object is a load of heavy plot without any actual story to support viewers when they pick it up. There are several episodes - usually at the start of a new arc - that consist of nothing but exposition and the male leads trying to import some foreign porn. Not exactly something that I want to carry around, is it? And the missions themselves are completely throwaway, not amounting to anything but visual junk food that never changes that status quo and isn\'t even exciting to watch due to the horrible direction and the obviously pandering fetish fuel. None of the military stuff even remotely resembles real life, and if this is supposed to be a satire regarding the future of government weapons, whatever it\'s trying to say about them is completely lost on me. At one point, the characters run into a military unit consisting of nothing but female soldiers dressed in maid uniforms for a reason that I honestly can\'t remember and refuse to look up because the outfits are never relevant to the plot and neither are those soldiers for that matter. We all know the only reason it exists was just so that we could have maid fanservice in this anime, so really who cares? And it\'s the fact that no one does that exemplifies just how completely pointless anything that happens in Heavy Object is.Speaking of female soldiers, there sure are a lot of them holding important positions in a primarily male-dominated profession, aren\'t there? Every single arc seems to have at least one new girl for the characters to interact with, and I can\'t remember a single important supporting cast member with a Y chromosome that didn\'t look like he belonged right at home in an NTR hentai. You could say it\'s a progressive choice, but given how most of the females have to be supported by men who aren\'t exactly General Patton in terms of intimidating in order to do anything, along with the fact that I don\'t exactly see the males wearing uniforms with their chests hanging out, you\'d have a hard time convincing me or 99% of the human population that that is true. It\'s just bland, light novel, reverse feminism bullshit of giving the females powerful positions and removing what made them so powerful in the first place to the point that you might as well have not bothered.And that\'s what Heavy Bullshit is at the end of the day. Bland. Invisible. Toothless. Castrated. Completely fucking stupid. So full of nothing but heavy crap that made my thinking muscles sore after holding onto it for so long. There\'s no story, there\'s no character development, there\'s no overall progression, and the production is so lazy it makes a Snorlax look energetic. My advice to you? Don\'t even bother picking it up. There are much better ways to work out that don\'t involve the risk of dropping a heavy object right on your foot and causing permanent damage. before airing considering how obvious it is in retrospect.

They\'re as generic as a light novel anime adaptations out there with a protagonist who\'s OP as hell and gets all the girls he wants with ease. When J.C Staff announced this anime, I avoided this at first but I decided to just go and give it a try. Surprisingly, Heavy Object is one of my guilty pleasures. One of the reasons why I enjoyed it is because Heavy Object isn\'t your usual flying robots mecha anime.[Story]: (3/10)In the distant future, a massive, spherical tanks called ""Objects""; armed with a very powerful cannon and equipped with...an armour that renders tanks, jets, warships and even nuclear weapons obsolete, has changed the nature of warfare and how it\'s played out.Even though I said that I enjoyed Heavy Object, I can\'t deny that the storyline was absolute shit and I realized this after watching about 3-4 arcs. The same stuff basically happens for every single arc. Hell, I could summarize a whole arc for you right now. The main character goes in and/or is forced into the battlefield by their superior, they figure out the issue and they destroy the so-called ""invisible"" Object. They then move on to a new country and the process repeats itself. That\'s it. I just summarized the whole show for you because that\'s what happened in every single arc up to the final episode. Depending on the person watching this series, by the time you get into the 4th arc, it\'s going to feel repetitive as hell. The plot structure is literally the same for each arc. After watching about..Hmm, let\'s say 4-5 arcs, you\'ve pretty much seen everything Heavy Object has to offer.Now let me explain why I enjoyed the series. Heavy Object features a different kind of mechas and it isn\'t your usual ridiculous flying robots that I came to hate and is instead, a giant tank-like machines that absolutely cannot fly and it literally looks like a giant ball on threads outfitted with giant-ass cannons. I thought the Object vs Object battle scenes were amazing even though it was just a battle of attrition (kind of similar to WW1\'s Trench Warfare) which is the most boring kind of battle to watch but the show somehow made it thrilling to watch.However, an Object vs Object battle scenes are not the only action that you\'ll see in Heavy Object. We also see the main characters strategizing on how to take down an Object and executing said strategies to destroy an Object, even though half of the strategies that they come up with are so obvious and it makes you wonder how a military with more extensive training than a mechanic and his partner couldn\'t come up with those strategies. Hell, I\'m just a military nerd/enthusiast and I somehow figured out how to destroy a giant-ass Object with obvious weak spots because history has thought us that every giant war machine that mankind has ever made can be easily destroyed. It also makes you wonder if the author knows slightly anything about the military because it\'s obvious that he doesn\'t. There was another military show that ran on the same season as Heavy Object called ""Gate: And so the Self Defence Force Fought There: Season 2"" and you can tell that the author actually once served on the JSDF because the military tactics that they use on that show are fairly realistic and makes Heavy Object\'s military tactics look like a childish joke.There are about 10 arcs in the series and all of them lasted about 2-3 episodes. Except there was one arc in the series that only lasted for about an episode and its main purpose was to develop Havia\'s character which I though was a pretty good episode. Hmm, 2-3 episodes per arc. That should tell you that HO\'s pacing is rushed right? Right but since I stopped paying attention (not completely) to the story after watching about 3 or so arcs, I felt like the pacing suddenly went from fast to average.For a show that talks about the ""horrors of war"" every time, all I see is a bunch of fanservice scenes in almost every single episode. Almost every single female characters in the show that gets screentime are subjected to ass shots, big bouncing boobs scenes, camera focusing on boobs while the characters are talking about politics and war, female characters in sexual poses, and etc. I\'m honestly tired of anime shows sexualizing its female characters. Like do we still live in the 20th Century where women are just sexual toys to be played around by men or something?______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)Ever since ""Railgun S"", J.C Staff\'s animation has been really improving and Heavy Object is no exception. For the most part, the animation is smooth and consistent and there were barely any still shots which made the Object vs Object battles exciting to watch. The character designs are pretty average and if you\'ve seen any J.C Staff anime from 2013 and onwards then it should look very familiar to you. As for the Object\'s designs, I thought they were ugly at first but I got used to their design and I suddenly thought they were amazing. If I have to guess, studio SANZIGEN did the Object\'s designs.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8/10)The soundtrack is your generic ""Action Movie"" soundtrack. Some of them were great and some of them were average. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme songs are ""One More Chance"" by ALL OFF and ""Never Gave Up"" by ALL OFF. The ED theme songs are ""Dear Brave"" by Kano and ""Kawaranai Tsuyosa"" by Yuka Iguchi. The 1st OP theme song is absolute trash and I ended up skipping it by the 2nd episode. When the Opening changed, I was relieved because the 2nd OP theme song is 100 times better than the first OP theme song. As for the ED theme songs, both of them were amazing, 1st being the best.I watched the English Dub version of the show so I\'ll be reviewing the English VA\'s. For a Broadcast Dub anime, the voice actors surprisingly did a great job not f*cking up the character\'s voices. They didn\'t sound monotonic at all and you can tell they put some emotions in a cardboard cut characters. Watching the show in English Dub is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this show. I didn\'t have to read any subtitles and I just turned off my brain while watching this show. When I heard that Alexis Tipton was going to cast Mellinda, Heavy Object was suddenly an automatic watch for me because I love her voice and she completely met my expectations when I heard her voice as Mellinda in the first episode.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (6/10)I like the main characters..There, I said it.""Oh please, do explain why you love the main characters"".Very well then. The two main characters Qwenthur and Havia are a couple of walking Gary Stu characters who\'ve experienced not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4 but 10 death defying experiences with the Objects who are supposedly used as a deterrent against another countries to make them shit their pants and to make them think twice about waging war against a country who has a powerful Object. Objects are supposed to nullify ""Boots on the ground"" but alas, that doesn\'t stop these 2 main characters, equipped with one of the most protective plot armours that you could ever find in the medium, from blowing up 10 Objects in a row. Hell, if a Rapture ever comes, these 2 main characters will easily defeat our Lord and Almighty Savior ""Kirito-kun"" who is known to mankind as the most powerful character to ever exist. They\'re also a couple of one-dimensional cardboard cut-out characters that received little to no character development at all. So why?! Why the hell do I like these 2 main characters?!Ready for the answer? Here we go...They\'re hilarious and I meant that in a good way. Both Qwenthur and Havia have a great chemistry when they\'re paired up together. They\'re a great comedy duo. Everytime they\'re paired up, it just leads to hilarious moments and perverted moments that also somehow made me laugh. Well, the comedy is not as funny as KonoSuba but the show still made me laugh from start to end. Millinda is also hilarious when she gets jealous or when she and that red-haired girl are arguing. That\'s about it.So the protagonists of the show received little to no character development. How about Millinda and that 18-year old girl whose breasts is the size of a bowling ball Froylatia? They should have at least received some character development right?. Wrong! They didn\'t. The only good side they have is they\'re hilarious and that\'s it.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)At first, Heavy Object pissed me off because I was expecting a great war story but instead got a literal ""Two-Man Army"" taking down an Object. Then I did one simple action that no one expected. I switched my brain off and turned my brain into hibernation mode. It worked! Next thing I know, I enjoyed the series and watching Heavy Object every Friday night became one of the best 25 weeks of my life.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]The premise and concept of Heavy Object had potential but instead went into the otaku-pandering route. The concept of war in Heavy Object is a joke and it shouldn\'t be taken seriously. The story went absolutely nowhere and the plot structure is literally the same for each and every arc. The characters may be hilarious and quite enjoyable to watch but they are still a bunch of one-dimensional characters that received little to no character development. Heavy Object\'s fanservice is also insane and I\'m wondering why there\'s no Ecchi tag in the show\'s genre because the show is full of big boobs, ass and pantie shots.With all the ranting aside though, I still enjoyed the series and you may enjoy it too if you turn your brain off because Heavy Object is one of those ""turn your brain off"" series. By the way, I\'m expecting a new series from the author to be released next year called ""Light Stuff"". It better be good.[OVERALL]: (6.8/10)Pros:+Enjoyable series if you shut your brain down and you don\'t overthink what the show is trying to tell and do.+Amazing ""Object vs Object"" action scenes+Great 2nd OP theme song and all of ED theme songs+Great chemistry between Qwenthur and Havia+Characters are hilariousCons:-Heavy Object\'s concept of war is a joke-Heavy Objects\'s military tactics are also a joke-Story went absolutely nowhere and the plot structure are literally the same for each and every arc-Excessive fanservice-Main character\'s excessive death-defying experiences. In other words, they have unlimited ""Deus-Ex Machinas""-All of the main characters are one-dimensional-You\'ve pretty much seen everything Heavy Object has to offer after the 4th or 5th arc-Pacing issues an armour that renders tanks, jets, warships and even nuclear weapons obsolete, has changed the nature of warfare and how it\'s played out.Even though I said that I enjoyed Heavy Object, I can\'t deny that the storyline was absolute shit and I realized this after watching about 3-4 arcs. The same stuff basically happens for every single arc. Hell, I could summarize a whole arc for you right now. The main character goes in and/or is forced into the battlefield by their superior, they figure out the issue and they destroy the so-called ""invisible"" Object. They then move on to a new country and the process repeats itself. That\'s it. I just summarized the whole show for you because that\'s what happened in every single arc up to the final episode. Depending on the person watching this series, by the time you get into the 4th arc, it\'s going to feel repetitive as hell. The plot structure is literally the same for each arc. After watching about..Hmm, let\'s say 4-5 arcs, you\'ve pretty much seen everything Heavy Object has to offer.Now let me explain why I enjoyed the series. Heavy Object features a different kind of mechas and it isn\'t your usual ridiculous flying robots that I came to hate and is instead, a giant tank-like machines that absolutely cannot fly and it literally looks like a giant ball on threads outfitted with giant-ass cannons. I thought the Object vs Object battle scenes were amazing even though it was just a battle of attrition (kind of similar to WW1\'s Trench Warfare) which is the most boring kind of battle to watch but the show somehow made it thrilling to watch.However, an Object vs Object battle scenes are not the only action that you\'ll see in Heavy Object. We also see the main characters strategizing on how to take down an Object and executing said strategies to destroy an Object, even though half of the strategies that they come up with are so obvious and it makes you wonder how a military with more extensive training than a mechanic and his partner couldn\'t come up with those strategies. Hell, I\'m just a military nerd/enthusiast and I somehow figured out how to destroy a giant-ass Object with obvious weak spots because history has thought us that every giant war machine that mankind has ever made can be easily destroyed. It also makes you wonder if the author knows slightly anything about the military because it\'s obvious that he doesn\'t. There was another military show that ran on the same season as Heavy Object called ""Gate: And so the Self Defence Force Fought There: Season 2"" and you can tell that the author actually once served on the JSDF because the military tactics that they use on that show are fairly realistic and makes Heavy Object\'s military tactics look like a childish joke.There are about 10 arcs in the series and all of them lasted about 2-3 episodes. Except there was one arc in the series that only lasted for about an episode and its main purpose was to develop Havia\'s character which I though was a pretty good episode. Hmm, 2-3 episodes per arc. That should tell you that HO\'s pacing is rushed right? Right but since I stopped paying attention (not completely) to the story after watching about 3 or so arcs, I felt like the pacing suddenly went from fast to average.For a show that talks about the ""horrors of war"" every time, all I see is a bunch of fanservice scenes in almost every single episode. Almost every single female characters in the show that gets screentime are subjected to ass shots, big bouncing boobs scenes, camera focusing on boobs while the characters are talking about politics and war, female characters in sexual poses, and etc. I\'m honestly tired of anime shows sexualizing its female characters. Like do we still live in the 20th Century where women are just sexual toys to be played around by men or something?______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)Ever since ""Railgun S"", J.C Staff\'s animation has been really improving and Heavy Object is no exception. For the most part, the animation is smooth and consistent and there were barely any still shots which made the Object vs Object battles exciting to watch. The character designs are pretty average and if you\'ve seen any J.C Staff anime from 2013 and onwards then it should look very familiar to you. As for the Object\'s designs, I thought they were ugly at first but I got used to their design and I suddenly thought they were amazing. If I have to guess, studio SANZIGEN did the Object\'s designs.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8/10)The soundtrack is your generic ""Action Movie"" soundtrack. Some of them were great and some of them were average. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme songs are ""One More Chance"" by ALL OFF and ""Never Gave Up"" by ALL OFF. The ED theme songs are ""Dear Brave"" by Kano and ""Kawaranai Tsuyosa"" by Yuka Iguchi. The 1st OP theme song is absolute trash and I ended up skipping it by the 2nd episode. When the Opening changed, I was relieved because the 2nd OP theme song is 100 times better than the first OP theme song. As for the ED theme songs, both of them were amazing, 1st being the best.I watched the English Dub version of the show so I\'ll be reviewing the English VA\'s. For a Broadcast Dub anime, the voice actors surprisingly did a great job not f*cking up the character\'s voices. They didn\'t sound monotonic at all and you can tell they put some emotions in a cardboard cut characters. Watching the show in English Dub is one of the reasons why I enjoyed this show. I didn\'t have to read any subtitles and I just turned off my brain while watching this show. When I heard that Alexis Tipton was going to cast Mellinda, Heavy Object was suddenly an automatic watch for me because I love her voice and she completely met my expectations when I heard her voice as Mellinda in the first episode.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (6/10)I like the main characters..There, I said it.""Oh please, do explain why you love the main characters"".Very well then. The two main characters Qwenthur and Havia are a couple of walking Gary Stu characters who\'ve experienced not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4 but 10 death defying experiences with the Objects who are supposedly used as a deterrent against another countries to make them shit their pants and to make them think twice about waging war against a country who has a powerful Object. Objects are supposed to nullify ""Boots on the ground"" but alas, that doesn\'t stop these 2 main characters, equipped with one of the most protective plot armours that you could ever find in the medium, from blowing up 10 Objects in a row. Hell, if a Rapture ever comes, these 2 main characters will easily defeat our Lord and Almighty Savior ""Kirito-kun"" who is known to mankind as the most powerful character to ever exist. They\'re also a couple of one-dimensional cardboard cut-out characters that received little to no character development at all. So why?! Why the hell do I like these 2 main characters?!Ready for the answer? Here we go...They\'re hilarious and I meant that in a good way.

Innovative in storyline, great in 3DCG, and most of all, enjoyable. Every episode was either funny, thrilling or maybe even sad at times. But the whole idea is the same - the whole series was extremely enjoyable for me as it wasn\'t that stiff - every...topic was handled pretty well and the military ambient wasn\'t hyperbolized, either - I will continue this topic later, though. The story is set in the future, when most of the unions and leagues known to us nowadays are broken, mostly because of the development of warfare. Whilst that development in shape of Objects (immense mechs with unstoppable force) is crucial to understand the issues held in the anime, the story itself is about two soldiers, Havia and Qwenthur, fighting against stereotypes in future world.Story - 9/10As I mentioned above, protagonists fight against stereotypes, or just the rules of war that say ""the nation with the strongest Object wins"". With that, there was no one who would try going flesh-and-blood against an Object. Whereas others never even thought of doing so, Havia and Qwenthur in order to save them and their homeland - A Legitimate Kingdom, they give their best to overcome the stereotypes and save the day in numerous missions throughout the series.The story is filled with a handful of turnarounds, problems that these young men face. The biggest factor that made me give this story 9 points out of 10 is the reference of modern-day problems. Whether that was intentional by the author or not I noticed the resemblance of Objects to nuclear bombs nowadays - the nations who have them are considered the most powerful and dragging them into a war poses a threat of them using said bombs. In that case - objects are like these bombs, the more you have them the more powerful you are, and hypothetically you cannot do anything to stop it.That mixed with Qwenthur\'s numerous technical digressions, but also humour with a pinch of ecchi-like jokes made me really like the story as a whole.Art - 7/10Well, when it comes to art in Heavy Object my opinion is rather split. Character design is mediocre, but on the other hand, every location is beautifully stressed and buttoned up which made a huge contrast overall.Whole art is nicely tied up by omnipresent Object fights carefully made in 3DCG that really raise the quality of art in the series. Unfortunately, whilst 3DCG may be the most emphasized point in Heavy Object\'s art, but I\'ve noticed the deterioration of background art\'s quality when the objects are battling which made me lower the rating of art drastically.Sound - 7/10There isn\'t much to say about the sound - openings and endings were mostly dull, nothing out of this world and background music was okay. The biggest pros was the voice acting. Really well-fitted to characters and, foremostly, fresh. That was the thought I had while listening to the acting.Character - 7/10Most of the characters in Heavy Object were quite simple, and the viewer gradually gets to know them better episode after episode. Pacing in this anime is pretty good, so characters seem developing naturally, that\'s what I really liked. On the other hand, there were times that I had the impression that some of the characters were TOO simple. Up to the last episode Havia\'s reactions seemed quite static to me, as if he didn\'t get any experience from his ""adventures"". Him and a few of others felt the same way, making the series boring or repetitive at times. Thanks to the pacing though, characters are mostly fun to watch, that\'s why I gave it a 7!Enjoyment - 10/10 Overall - 9/10As you, my dear reader, have already figured it out I really have enjoyed the series of Heavy Object. Althought it had its flaws, I was looking forward to every episode aired, and though I may be writing this because I was devastated by the low rating it has, I really would love to see more people watching and enjoying it as much as I did.The army-mecha-comedy setting really left a mark on me, as I don\'t remember such an underrated series that I enjoyed this much. For me definitely it is one of the best 2015 Fall animes, certainly the most underrated - great story, nice characters and everything buttoned up fairly equals a lot of joyfully spent time that I recommend for everyone else.Thanks to anyone that is reading this, it is my first review here so I would appreciate some words of criticism if it\'s needed. I hope you enjoyed it, and I hope you will enjoy Heavy Object! topic was handled pretty well and the military ambient wasn\'t hyperbolized, either - I will continue this topic later, though.

I hope you enjoyed it, and I hope you will enjoy Heavy Object!', ""In a world where the various nations have been fractured by war, a new power comes into play, one that has changed the very face of war. Objects. Mechanized monstrosities that look a lot like a Death Star with a shit ton of guns attached to their hull. These Objects have become synonymous with war, changing the rules of engagement, turning what had once been a serious and deadly affair into something more closely resembling a board game. This is one of the most serious, thrilling, and brutal anime ever.I'm being serious here.I'm serious, damn it!Joking aside, this series does have some intense moments. It's...basically a modern action series that centers around Qwenthar and Havia, a student who's studying to become an Object engineer in order to get rich and a blue blood noble who's trying to succeed as the head of his family. Much of the story revolves around them fighting Objects, defeating Objects, and making crass jokes about porn and boobs.One of the aspects that I really enjoyed about this series was the concept of Objects. As I mentioned before, Objects are basically massive constructs that take the basic mecha idea and turn it on its head. These are nothing like Gundams. Objects are basically large spherical weapons of war. With heavy armaments, armor that can withstand even a nuclear explosion, and the ability to devastate everything in their sight, it is said that only another object can defeat an object - well, at least until Qwenthar and Havia come along.The anime follows a series of arcs, with each arc being dedicated to Qwenthar and Havia fighting against a variety of Objects. Each Object that they fight is different from the last, with different weapons, a different configuration, different strengths, and different weaknesses. Not only does the anime showcase how each Object is unique, but it also does a good job of maintaining a certain level of suspense by having Qwenthar try to figure out how to defeat each Object. While you pretty much know that he's going to win in the end, you still have to wonder about how he's going to do it. In this regard, the anime does an excellent job.One area where I feel the anime doesn't do as good a job is in the relationships between some of the characters. While I dig the bromance between Qwenthar and Havia, I felt like the relationship between Qwenthar and Milinda was stagnant. Milinda is the Objects pilot. Dubbed Princess, her role in the anime is as the stoic yet badass female pilot of the Object known as the Baby Magnum. However, you don't see much of her. Sadly, it seems her role is basically to battle other objects and then be a fan service girl for the rest of the time. One thing I hated about their relationship is how oblivious Qwenthar is. I get that the oblivious trope is a big thing, but there's only so much dense main character that I can take. Everyone except for Qwenthar is aware of her feelings, but lord curse us if the main character ever gets a brain and realizes it as well.Now, Frolaytia Capistrano is one of the characters who I feel was actually done well. She's a badass commander who doesn't take other people's shit and has a sadistic side. I think what makes her such an appealing character is that she's confident. She doesn't hesitate to make decisions that she feels are for the best, and she's also not afraid of using her looks to get her way. While there are a number of times where she's shown in a sexual light, I think it fits her character as the badass but sexy commander. I also like how, rather than simply putting up with Havia's blatant sex jokes, she fires them back. She can shoot the shit with the best of them, isn't afraid of getting down and dirty, and knows how to use assets to get her way, both on and off the battlefield. basically a modern action series that centers around Qwenthar and Havia, a student who's studying to become an Object engineer in order to get rich and a blue blood noble who's trying to succeed as the head of his family.

The weapons of choice in all combat are called Objects. Objects are machines of destruction that cannot be destroyed by military weaponry.Humans who go up against objects are seen as suicide missions. That's exactly what Havia and Qwenthur are forced to do. Qwentur a student who wishes to be a designer of Objects and Havia a rich noble who just happens to be in the service. They are put to the test.The story itself is just one major battle after another to fight for...their country. The four main characters we see the most are Qwenthur, Havia, Milianda Britani (aka Princess) and Froletya.For those who love to see giant robot fights. This is a bit of a curve ball. Objects are not suit that are shaped as humanoid things that fight (like Gundams). The major rule everyone plays by is once your object is destroyed then the fight is over.That pretty much sums up what goes on in there. Besides spoiler things that I won't go into much detail on. The show itself has seriousness and some very ecchi(fanservice) things thrown in for those looking for it. Their favorite target of course is Froletya (for two very large obvious reasons).  All in all I had a great time watching it. I'm a sucker for things mecha and seeing underdogs who are forced into combat are things that bring a smile to my face. their country.

Just when the army were doing nothing but sits around and wait for their Objects to return from war, we have the main Characters, Qwenthur and Havia, Qwenthur was a guy who seeks to be a Object Designer or richness because of what he had realized in the past, but he is still an Student in the Army Program. Havia was form a noble family, he joined the army to prove himself worthy to take the responsibility of what his family is about, he is a Soldier of the Army Program. As the story begins them cleaning the Way for the armies road and air field.The base was under attack. They did nothing and send out the Object and the Elite to do her job, their Elite is a called Princess. And their Object is an 1st Gen, they are up in battle with a 2nd Gen.Princess could deal with any Mech that are even better than her, but that was when they found out that the war with Mech is not that peaceful for Army Members that are not Elites.Usually, when an Mech is defeated, an White flag would be putted up, So now one will get in harms way. But the enemy Object did not care, it rushed to the base and destroyed everything, and the story picks off with Qwenthur and Havia saving the princess and broke the balance between men and objects, they took down an object with just some useless equipment.They did the incredibly, they also saved the princess.That was when they went on worldwide mission to save the world with useless equipment and make it work, they also caused problems of their own, like how enemies are rising to take out the Object without another objects since they think if someone can do it, its possible for them too!While the story goes from there, the story was filed with Enjoyable content.I personally gave it a 1+ Rating because of how it was real hard for me to find a good anime until this came.You would find Contents for you to smile and laugh in this anime, the Art is also cool along with the sounds, they both got great effects and even stays great when its normal time in the anime.You might drop out on first few episode, I did not since I saw something others could not see and kept me going until the end, and it was totally worth it!I went to sleep that day with a smile on my face.Go get your smile, check it out till the end!  :-D considered an Mech Anime bad, but however this one sets out something different.I think its 9/10 because!The story sets out on when the real world was more in the future with an War Mech called Objects, Objects are unbeatable War Mech that decides who wins the war, the wars are now up to Specs and Elites (Pilots) of the Objects. Just when the army were doing nothing but sits around and wait for their Objects to return from war, we have the main Characters, Qwenthur and Havia, Qwenthur was a guy who seeks to be a Object Designer or richness because of what he had realized in the past, but he is still an Student in the Army Program. Havia was form a noble family, he joined the army to prove himself worthy to take the responsibility of what his family is about, he is a Soldier of the Army Program. As the story begins them cleaning the Way for the armies road and air field.The base was under attack. They did nothing and send out the Object and the Elite to do her job, their Elite is a called Princess. And their Object is an 1st Gen, they are up in battle with a 2nd Gen.Princess could deal with any Mech that are even better than her, but that was when they found out that the war with Mech is not that peaceful for Army Members that are not Elites.Usually, when an Mech is defeated, an White flag would be putted up, So now one will get in harms way.

Boy does it fit here.In the future, giant robots handle warfare in place of human soldiers. They\'re incredible exterior armors make them immune to nearly every conventional weapon, so basically the only way to kill these ""objects"" is with an object of your own.Qwenthur and Havia, a military engineer and a soldier respectively (whose royalty background you\'d swear they swapped by mistake), don\'t have that luxury. While the ""Princess"", the female lead, handles riding their nation\'s Object, they are pretty much errant boys, assisting in maintainance and being looked down...on by their superiors.

As a result they are left on-foot against a giant metal monstrosity.Since their chances of escaping are slim, they decide to go sabbotage the thing, which is surprisingly easier than one would expect.

Spoilers ahead!)The heaviest item I have ever picked up was a giant television in my parents’ basement.Though, at the time, it felt like I was carrying a medium-sized engine rather than a piece of technology that I once played all of my video games on. I distinctly remember picking it up, but, I had so much trouble, my father had to help out. Even then, when it finally got stashed away, the muscles in my arms convulsed from the strain.That either says a lot about the TV or a lot about me. Probably both.Regardless, it weighs...nothing compared to the monstrosities created within Heavy Object. I’m talking pounds versus tons. Hundreds of thousands of tons. But more than weight, it also has tons of problems, too.STORYHeavy Object places Qwenthur and Havia, a student abroad and a radar analyst, in the battlefield of war. However, in this day and age, wars are not fought between foot soldiers but rather huge, hulking, and heavy machines codenamed Objects.To see these Objects in action, the anime partitions itself into many mini arcs. Each arc, not lasting longer than three episodes and adopting crazy-long titles, follows the same pattern. The Legitimate Kingdom’s (the good guys) Object shows up and cannot succeed on its own. Qwenthur and Havia do the majority of the grunt work. And everybody lives happily ever after.For twenty-four episodes.Without fail.It makes one wonder how this country survived without Qwenthur and Havia since they pretty much win every single battle by themselves. It also causes some frustration with the action. Milinda, the pilot for Baby Magnum (the Object owned by the Legitimate Kingdom), almost never destroys an enemy Object and vice versa. In essence, this leads to a lot of repetition and frustration when the battles involve little more than two giant balls rotating about each other while their artillery, gunfire, and lasers continually miss.To be fair, each encounter manages to differentiate itself from the others even if they are more or less the same set of events. For example, “The Graveyard of Junk is a Mountain of Rare Metals” sees Qwenthur infiltrating the inside of the Object to stop the Elite that pilots it. And “Tom Thumb Races Through the Oil Field” sees Qwenthur trekking underwater to blow up mines being dragged along by the enemy Object.Plus, the anime diversifies its setting. Yes, it has a few extra snowy locales, but the anime makes an effort to have the war take place within a dense jungle, rough mountains, and an abandoned city. With the change in locale comes different types of Objects and, hence, new solutions that Qwenthur and Havia must concoct.To be even more fair, the point of Heavy Object’s pattern, the reason why the bro-buddy duo always arrives to save the day, is to support its biggest theme. That theme? To show that man still has purpose despite the overwhelming reliance on Objects.Qwenthur and Havia represent a “dying breed” of war: troops. With the advent of war doctrines and these technological behemoths, ground support is rarely needed nowadays. On top of this, they can barely do anything against such monstrosities. But these two demonstrate time and again that what man has created, he can destroy.Admittedly, this theme undergoes a lot of heavy-handedness in the form of swathing exposition. I.e., hearing Havia cry about man being unable to beat machine (when they have literally been proving otherwise) gets tiresome.The anime attempts to tackle other themes, such as the darker side of war (notably rape) and the loss of comrades. But these ideas either undergo the same overt explanation or are only briefly thought about without exploration.Stepping back from the themes and looking solely at the plot developments, the anime sees trouble here as well. Frankly, a lot of the plot points come out of nowhere. The “Mirror of Truth” in the final arc. The spy planted by the Legitimate Kingdom during “The Coal Mine Littered with Stacks of Money.” The so-called “Blind Net” that terrorists were aiming to destroy to attack a resort on the moon. These are just a few examples of the anime coming up with material on the spot.Simultaneously, the anime can demonstrate a bit of writing know-how. From those same examples, the anime takes advantage of characters or ideas introduced beforehand, making the outcomes feel logical. Like when Qwenthur uses diamonds he stole from that mine or when the villain in the final arc is the same guy they let live earlier in the season. In other words, the plot points start off awkwardly but end up nicely.Lastly, the anime loves to include sexual moments. More specifically, the anime centers a lot of its comedy and downtime on shenanigans involving a naked Frolaytia or a “mission” to out the boys’ smut stash. Not ecchi but rather provocative. And that makes sense – two boys cooped up in the military gives the sex much-needed context. To put it differently, having this material around does not detract from the experience but instead improves it.All in all, the anime may not be much more than comedy, action, and sex. But when it does try to be more than that, it cannot carry itself.ANIMATIONThe art and animation for Heavy Object teeters on the edge between passable and not quite so.The Objects themselves are rather dull. They are hunks of metal with giant cannons attached to them. Cool, but, when each one more or less has the same look, with minor variations in dull colors, they aren’t the most pleasant entities in the anime. Although, to be fair, the CGI used to create the objects looks acceptable, maybe even nice, a majority of the time.Locations are likewise lackluster. Mountainous regions and dense forests are arguably atmospheric, but they do not lend themselves to minute details, inducing the same sense of repetition as the Objects. Plus, more often than not, the areas are vast and open, leaving even less room for artistic flexibility.Actual animation tends to stray somewhere around average. Explosions explode in a fiery mass of smoke and debris. The Objects strafe, jump, and cruise appropriately. And Frolaytia gets a few extra frames for her breasts and poses to up her sexuality.The rest of the anime, however, does not stand out. Qwenthur and Havia run around a lot, they do a lot of speaking. But nothing impressive. Nothing awful either (at least, no notable dips). Just an average amount of body movements and facial expressions.The character designs are the same way with a few exceptions. To be fair, Qwenthur and Havia are somewhat meant to be the all-around Joes. Meaning their short-cropped hair and regular physiques go along with their every-man personas. But their change in gear, depending on the area, comes only with barest of details. “Ohoho” gets her fake design and her actual design, a switch the anime uses for nice comedic effect.Frolaytia, though, deserves the biggest mention. Her silver hair, tight officer’s uniform, sharp, purple eyes, personal pipe, and bountiful assets turn her into a commander worth leading others and lusting after.Every other design, however, does not reach the same level. Milinda’s bob-cut blonde hair and purple-and-blue attire, while cute, does not catch the eye. And the rest of the cast are just too plain to mention. Admittedly, that may be the point – despite the Objects, the setting is a realistic one – but they still do not make for enticing designs.CHARACTERSThe cast of Heavy Object have a major problem: little is known about them.The characters who receive the most time are Frolaytia and Havia. Frolaytia decided to join the military to escape the hungry eyes of hormonal men. In essence, her genetics (specifically her ability to create heirs) has made her much sought after. Not as a person or a woman but as an object to continue the family heritage of her “potential” suitors.Her backstory makes her tough personality and harsh leadership easier to understand; she simply hates being looked down upon. Sadly, that’s the extent of her character. Every other time she’s on screen is used to showcase her sexuality: bending over while playing pool, groaning in the gym, and so on. Even when her backstory turns into a plot point, the anime makes fondling her breasts and calling her a slut the answer to her problem.Havia is not that much better. As the lesser half to the best-friend pair, he is actually in line to take over as head of his family. Meaning he did not have to join the military. But he chose to anyway as a way to learn and grow and become stronger.He, more so than Qwenthur, is the funny man, cracking jokes whenever possible. He also acts as the voice of reason. Where Qwenthur is always gung-ho about diving into yet another Object quarrel, Havia argues against the decision, citing the scale, the difficulty, or any other relevant factor that will surely lead to his and his best friend’s demise.And despite his perverted tendencies and love of women, he betrothed himself to the daughter of a rival family, indicating a sense of maturity that one does not often associate with him.Similar to Frolaytia, however, Havia does not get much more than this. Indeed, he’s the “lesser half” because Qwenthur usually gets most of the glory. Granted, this imbalanced praise is a joke that the anime uses – Havia getting mistreated does make for some nice comedy – but he rarely gets the commendations he deserves.Speaking of Qwenthur, even less is known about him. He is a student training and learning in order to become an Object designer. Suffice it to say that his time destroying said Objects has certainly given him a lot of knowledge. Most of the time, though, he spends joking with Havia, staring at Frolaytia, or helping Milinda. Other details are given, such as a father who works for a living or his knack for quick thinking, but his character does not extend beyond these details.Believe it or not, Milinda has it even worse. Perhaps the worst. She is an Elite, a specialized soldier who controls Objects. Technically a princess, her unemotional personality and unique lifestyle has kept her separated from others. In short, she’s lonely.Qwenthur turns into her romantic love interest, but that goes nowhere. In fact, her loneliness hardly changes. She is always in the Baby Magnum (and being useless), so she rarely interacts with him. Doubly so for Frolaytia, Havia, and the other characters. She gets next to no backstory, her relationships do not change, and she does not develop as a person. The most the anime gives about her character has to be gleaned from (both of) the ED visuals. Her only role is to pilot the Legitimate Kingdom’s object and occasionally provide a different brand of sexuality.Still, it’s difficult to call the cast awful when the anime focused on exactly what it wanted to be: a high-action anime featuring two bros, some sexy girls, and a ton of tech. But it still would have been beneficial to see them affected more by their situation, by the outcomes, and by each other.SOUNDThe music for Heavy Object is arguably its weakest category.At the minimum, the first opening track and the voice acting performances are worthy of some props. What the first OP does well is combining coolness with a twinge of comedy (in the first half) and a triumphant tone (in the second half). The hard rock, catchy beat, and mixture of both Japanese and English lyrics also contribute to the overall strength of the piece.As for the voice acting performances, while not top-of-the-line or stand-out, they make the cast fun to listen to throughout. Natsuki Hanae as Qwenthur and Kaito Ishikawa as Havia work well in tandem, providing fast-paced dialogue segments, lots of yelling, and occasional swearing. Shizuka Itou as Frolaytia does not speak fast or yell or swear all that much, but she brings the sex appeal with a sultry voice nonetheless. And while Eri Suzuki as Milinda has a nice monotone way of speaking, she is not around enough to make much of an impact.The rest of the music finds trouble. The second OP tries to replicate what the first OP did, but it fails. It’s still hard rock, triumphant, and filled with both Japanese and English lyrics. But, this time, the beat is not as catchy, the triumph is not as thrilling, and the singing sounds clunky, out-of-place.Listening to the ending tracks makes it obvious how different in tone they are from their OP counterparts. Focusing on happiness, the first ED still uses guitar and drums, but the piece backs itself with quieter vocals and a pleasant piano. Unfortunately, the first half is too tame and the second half somewhat comes out of nowhere with emotion – i.e., the two halves do not mesh well together. At the minimum, the last few notes – with just the piano and the singer – make for a sweet little ending.The second ED, similar to the second OP, follows its former self. Happiness is still the main feeling, but this track has better flow, using background singers, violins, and a tighter transition between the first and second halves. It ends with not as sentimental a note, the vocalist is not a powerhouse, and the track as a whole is pretty boring. But it at least stands taller than the first ED and the second OP.Last but (maybe) not least, the original soundtrack consists of many a track comprised of lots of techno beats and effects and compositions. A decision made mainly to coincide with the cool-tubular-awesome vibe of the anime – two bros hanging out on a battlefield filled with guns and hot girls. Overall, though, the OST does not leave any lasting impressions despite how fitting it may be.ENJOYMENTI had one constant positive that I always looked forward to with this one: Frolaytia. She was a goddess. I loved every scene she was in; I couldn’t get enough of her. She was sexy and tough and amazing.I also quite liked Qwenthur and Havia’s relationship. Their bickering about what to do or where to go was a lot of fun. It managed to feel as though they really were best bros forced to take part in a bunch of high-stakes missions. Havia making a snide comment, Qwenthur responding back with a witty line. One of my favorite moments with them has Havia tackling Qwenthur to the ground once Havia learns that Qwenthur fondled Frolaytia’s bosom (to help her out of a bind). They made for a silly duo whose exploits had me laughing from time to time.Action-wise, I was not too enthralled. In the beginning, when the prospect of Qwenthur and crew going up against these massive Objects was fresh, it was a bit interesting to watch. But as the season progressed, it started to drag as the action became more of the same.However, I will give praise to the “The Graveyard of Junk is a Mountain of Rare Metals” arc. The anime used Qwenthur’s safety word and the semi-love-triangle between him, Milinda, and Ohoho (actual name apparently unknown, which is funny in itself) to make for some really solid episodes.Speaking of romance, it would have been nice for romance to have more of a foothold in the show. Especially since it is hinted at with both Qwenthur (with Milinda) and Havia (with Lady Vanderbilt, the rival family’s daughter). That route was technically one the anime had no interest in pursuing, but since the feelings were there, I wanted more.Heavy Object does have positives. Frolaytia and the consistent bro-buddy presentation chief among them. But the negatives overshadow whatever strengths it may have. A misshapen plot, boring art, unexplored characters, lame music, and boring action. In other words, the anime suffers under its own weight.SUMMARYStory: Bad, lots of action and sex, but the semi-repetitive material, overt handling of its themes, and the shaky plot points cloud those aspectsAnimation: Bad, boring art style, about average actual animation, okay character designsCharacters: Bad, Qwenthur, Havia, Frolaytia, and especially Milinda are either lacking in characterization or receive too little of attention, but, considering the focus of the anime, these problems are not a complete deal-breakerSound: Bad, good first OP, bad second OP, bad first ED, bad second ED, bad OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Frolaytia was a goddess, Qwenthur and Havia’s relationship was fun, but the action itself was boringFinal Score: 3/10 nothing compared to the monstrosities created within Heavy Object.

Shizuka Itou as Frolaytia does not speak fast or yell or swear all that much, but she brings the sex appeal with a sultry voice nonetheless. And while Eri Suzuki as Milinda has a nice monotone way of speaking, she is not around enough to make much of an impact.The rest of the music finds trouble. The second OP tries to replicate what the first OP did, but it fails. It’s still hard rock, triumphant, and filled with both Japanese and English lyrics. But, this time, the beat is not as catchy, the triumph is not as thrilling, and the singing sounds clunky, out-of-place.Listening to the ending tracks makes it obvious how different in tone they are from their OP counterparts. Focusing on happiness, the first ED still uses guitar and drums, but the piece backs itself with quieter vocals and a pleasant piano. Unfortunately, the first half is too tame and the second half somewhat comes out of nowhere with emotion – i.e., the two halves do not mesh well together. At the minimum, the last few notes – with just the piano and the singer – make for a sweet little ending.The second ED, similar to the second OP, follows its former self. Happiness is still the main feeling, but this track has better flow, using background singers, violins, and a tighter transition between the first and second halves. It ends with not as sentimental a note, the vocalist is not a powerhouse, and the track as a whole is pretty boring. But it at least stands taller than the first ED and the second OP.Last but (maybe) not least, the original soundtrack consists of many a track comprised of lots of techno beats and effects and compositions. A decision made mainly to coincide with the cool-tubular-awesome vibe of the anime – two bros hanging out on a battlefield filled with guns and hot girls. Overall, though, the OST does not leave any lasting impressions despite how fitting it may be.ENJOYMENTI had one constant positive that I always looked forward to with this one: Frolaytia. She was a goddess. I loved every scene she was in; I couldn’t get enough of her. She was sexy and tough and amazing.I also quite liked Qwenthur and Havia’s relationship. Their bickering about what to do or where to go was a lot of fun. It managed to feel as though they really were best bros forced to take part in a bunch of high-stakes missions. Havia making a snide comment, Qwenthur responding back with a witty line. One of my favorite moments with them has Havia tackling Qwenthur to the ground once Havia learns that Qwenthur fondled Frolaytia’s bosom (to help her out of a bind). They made for a silly duo whose exploits had me laughing from time to time.Action-wise, I was not too enthralled. In the beginning, when the prospect of Qwenthur and crew going up against these massive Objects was fresh, it was a bit interesting to watch. But as the season progressed, it started to drag as the action became more of the same.However, I will give praise to the “The Graveyard of Junk is a Mountain of Rare Metals” arc. The anime used Qwenthur’s safety word and the semi-love-triangle between him, Milinda, and Ohoho (actual name apparently unknown, which is funny in itself) to make for some really solid episodes.Speaking of romance, it would have been nice for romance to have more of a foothold in the show. Especially since it is hinted at with both Qwenthur (with Milinda) and Havia (with Lady Vanderbilt, the rival family’s daughter). That route was technically one the anime had no interest in pursuing, but since the feelings were there, I wanted more.Heavy Object does have positives. Frolaytia and the consistent bro-buddy presentation chief among them. But the negatives overshadow whatever strengths it may have. A misshapen plot, boring art, unexplored characters, lame music, and boring action. In other words, the anime suffers under its own weight.SUMMARYStory: Bad, lots of action and sex, but the semi-repetitive material, overt handling of its themes, and the shaky plot points cloud those aspectsAnimation: Bad, boring art style, about average actual animation, okay character designsCharacters: Bad, Qwenthur, Havia, Frolaytia, and especially Milinda are either lacking in characterization or receive too little of attention, but, considering the focus of the anime, these problems are not a complete deal-breakerSound: Bad, good first OP, bad second OP, bad first ED, bad second ED, bad OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, Frolaytia was a goddess, Qwenthur and Havia’s relationship was fun, but the action itself was boringFinal Score: 3/10', ""The plot is original, and although many characters are cookie-cutter, they were still engaging. Super-mega-gigantic-BDO's fight battles instead of armies. But who's behind the scenes? What's the real reason? There's political intrigue, the usual light sexual humor, plenty of explosions and lots of fun to be had.When our daring duo of Object killers dialogue, it reminds me of Spice and Wolf. The technology is futuristic, but not too much - it's all very believable.The world is made up of four super powers, all with objects. There are also fractures among the powers that be, so civil war and even corporate infighting using objects occurs....On land, sea and underwater, objects seem to master everywhere - although there are no true flying objects. But I suppose a few million tons won't fly well....The bottom line is that it's fun to watch and is NOT a scant 12 or 13 episodes!

But I suppose a few million tons won't fly well....The bottom line is that it's fun to watch and is NOT a scant 12 or 13 episodes!"", 'War.  When it comes to war, the general idea that comes to mind is two opposing sides battling each other for domination in some way shape or form.  Many forms of media and real life have bounced off this idea with things like psychological war, cold war, and just straight up war.  And so, with JC staff\'s 2-cour adaptation of Heavy Object, we have war between gigantic balls with guns attached to them.  Oh boy...Side Note:  If I misspell the names, don\'t flame me.  Kamachi has weird names, and there\'re different spellings everywhere.  Funimation spells it one way,...wikis and other sources spell it another, you get the gist of it.Story: As the world has gone through drastic changes in the world of Heavy Object.  Due to the introduction of a new war machine called \'Objects\', gigantic nuclear powered spheres with all kinds of weapons attached to them, the world has now been split into four world powers, each representing a different aspect of humanity that is considered important, the Legitimacy Kingdom, the Information Alliance, the Capitalist Corporations, and the Faith Organization.  It is here where we follow the story of Qwenther Barbotage, an aspiring Object engineer who learns the true meaning of war as he fights against objects.Side Note:  Can I just say how hilarious the idea of fighting an object actually is?  I just imagine someone screaming ""RUN!  IT\'S AN OBJECT!""  Cause quite honestly, that is the most non-descriptive thing you can say about a rampaging war machine.  It\'s fabulous.  Now back to the actual review.Heavy Object in its simplest explanation is destroying objects.  That\'s basically it.  The entire show revolves around Qwenther and his buddy Havia, a radar analyst, essentially just derping around on the battlefield, figuring out on the top of their heads how to rout an object to the point that they win the battle with the enemy object destroyed.  It\'s a very repetitive story that\'s only interesting because every new object is different and our bumbling idiots have to work out a different strategy every time, usually involving something to do with the main object of the series, the \'Baby Magnum.\'  (Don\'t ask why it\'s named that, just roll with it.)  With such a simplistic story, there are bound to be flaws, and Heavy Object has that in spades.One of the most glaring issues about Heavy Object is its sheer lack of anything else.  While yes the show focuses more on the in-battle aspect of war, there\'re also moments in the show that tackle the underground politics or negotiation side of war, which we really don\'t get to see.  Because of that, anything motive as to why they are fighting the specific object at the time goes largely unexplained or with so little information that they might as well not be saying anything at all.  As a result of this, character, particularly villain motivation, is rather absent, and we\'re just sort of left with a \'boom, boom, pow\' anime without really all that much substance behind it.Overall, Heavy Object\'s story isn\'t really much to talk about.  It has a lot of missing details to convey a proper story, and all of the screentime is devoted solely to the battles that are going on without much aftermath or any background information to go with it.  It\'s all just mindless battles between giant ball things that shoot and destroy literally everything that they come in contact with.  (I think they leveled a mountain one time...)Overview:+ Boom, Pow, ACTION!-  Not really much elseCharacters:  Similarly, characters in this show are really only heavily focused if they\'re on the frontlines due to the way that the show is structured.  As such, characters who are more or less always in the action like our main characters get more attention, while those who work in the sidelines or behind the scenes don\'t.First, there\'s Qwenther Barbatoge and Havia Winchell, the main characters of Heavy Object. Smart when it comes to engineering and war tactics and idiot when it comes to practically everything else, Qwenther and Havia act as carbon copied clones of one another, with their only differences coming from where each of them come from and what each of them expertise in, these two bumbling idiots really don\'t have much in terms of defining one from another, further solidified from the fact that neither of them really get much character development.Then we have Milinda Brantini, the pilot of the main object of the series, the \'Baby Magnum\'.  As an Object Elite, someone who controls and mans the gigantic ball of death, and a princess of the Legitimate Kingdom, Milinda\'s role as a character is quite...limited.  While yes, she is the pilot of the Object, the amount of time that we dedicate to her and her purpose in this war is staggeringly low when you compare it to how often we see Havia and Qwenther talk about their personal porn collections.  The show doesn\'t put much attention to her (much like pretty much everything else in this series) and as such, makes it really hard to define her as a character.  And that is not a good thing.Froyletia Capistrano is the last character of major importance in this series.  As leading commander over the Battalion that Qwenther and Havia are a part of, Froyletia takes on the role as more or less the ringleader of this group of characters, making sure that every plan goes to order and that they accomplish whatever the plot wants them to accomplish.  Out of all of the characters, Froyletia is the one that gets the most development.  Mostly due to the fact that she\'s the only character to get any time devoted to her backstory, but it\'s still development nonetheless.And everyone else is basically spare blood or just relevant to the plot.  For the most part, they\'re just relevant to the plot and don\'t get any time invested in them whatsoever, but there are like...1 or 2 rare cases (Baa-chan and the Ohoho in this case) that have more to them than just enemy or friendly characters.Overview:+ Character development on Froyletia-  Main characters are static and underdeveloped-  Side characters are basically spare bloodArt: The art for Heavy Object is...mediocre at best.  The animation isn\'t really all that stellar and dips in quality depending on what exactly is being shown in the picture.  In terms of character designs, they\'re decent.  In terms of background, they\'re also, just decent.  In terms of the objects, well, they\'re CGI monstrosities that aren\'t actually as bad as I thought.  And when it comes to water, well, it\'s terrible.  Terrible water is terrible.And because the show has ecchi, I\'m gonna have to talk about that aspect.  (Oh boy.)  Heavy Object has quite a bit of ecchi for a show that\'s not really about sexual aspects.  Due to our two main bumbling idiots being complete pervs and holding hoards upon hoards of porn, and Froyletia having a model body, well, you can kind of see where I\'m going with this.  They poke fun at it every now and then, and it kind of flows with the story.  Sort of.  It\'s not as heavy as it could\'ve been, but they do take advantage of it as much as they can.Overview:+/-  Wavering quality art+/-  Ecchi is present, but not TOO presentSound:  Being a 2-cour series, Heavy Object has two OPs and EDs in order to accompany the respective parts.  The OPs for both sides have rock songs to elevate the feeling of action, when really, they\'re just sort of generic and fade away in a slew of other generic songs.The EDs on the other hand have a completely opposite feeling to them, as they\'re more or less these cheerful and happy songs that really...don\'t match with the feeling of WAR AND DESTRUCTION that this show so often shows us.  Personally, I don\'t find any of these tracks special and are completely skippable since they really have no true merit to them or any real way of standing out.Overview:+/-  Kinda meh OSTPersonal Enjoyment:  Going into this series, I was skeptical.  Mechas aren\'t usually my cup of tea when it comes to anime, and seeing gigantic balls tread around a field firing bullets at literally everything...yeah, I wasn\'t exactly the most keen about it.  (I was kinda pressured into watching it.  Kind of.)  And at the end, well, I can safely say that it was terrible, but not as bad as I thought it would be.  Would I watch it again?  Hell no.  Would I say it should burn in the pits of hell?  Well...no...but kinda.Did I enjoy this anime?This one is a bit half and half, seeing as how the two bumbling idiots were honestly quite entertaining at times.  The sheer amount of antics those two get into on a per hourly basis is sometimes so bullshit you can\'t help but laugh at them.What didn\'t I like about this anime?An entire section of the story was missing.  Because you don\'t get a feel for the politics that go around with the story, the central reason why these gigantic balls of death even fight each other really isn\'t there and it just breaks continuity in a way that it doesn\'t feel enjoyable to watch since the show only plans for what is happening right now, rather than what is happening beforehand and after that.Would I recommend this anime?Like guns?  Like explosions?  Like random fanservice moments every now and then without having to think too too hard as to what is happening now?  Watch Heavy Object.  That\'s about all it\'s worth for.  If not, well, skip it.

If not, well, skip it.  That\'s my personal recommendation, see you in the next one.', 'A couple of weeks ago I started watching all of the 2016 anime that I either missed or put on hold directly after I watched the first episode. So I decided to watch some of the Fall 2015 leftovers that finished in 2016 and Heavy Object was the only one that I haven’t already seen or was a sequel (apart from Brave Beats). I finished it recently so I decided I should review it. So, let’s get to it.Story:Story wise Heavy Object is pretty bare bones. The main premise is somewhat unique since instead of focusing on Object battles it instead focuses on the...main characters Qwenther and Havia defeating a variety of different Objects without using an object and instead using careful planning, tactics and some split-second decisions. Because this premise is filled with infinite possibilities the whole anime is split into different arcs about 2-3 episodes long each focusing on Qwenther and Havia dealing with a different Object. Because of that it could have been a show that got boring after the first half but thanks to the light-hearted tone and funny characters nothing in this show ever drags at all and the episodes fly by pretty fast. I’m glad they do since there are a few episodes were almost nothing happens. There is also a bit of an overarching plot dealing with another group of Object users but it isn’t really that interesting and major stuff doesn’t happen a lot with it. Overall Heavy Object does a decent job in the story department and you get what you would expect from an arc based light novel adaption.Characters:The words run of the mill might come up a lot in this review and never is this more apparent than with the characters. The two main characters Qwenther and Havia not only have very silly names but are also very, here it is again, run of the mill. They are your average action show duo: ones got the brains and the other got the brawn (or to be more specific, the ability to fire a gun). While they may be generic they are never boring to watch. They both have good chemistry with each other and have some pretty funny moments. It’s never a dull moment with Qwenther and Havia which is a good thing since they made a potentially boring anime into an enjoyable one. Other than Qwenther and Havia the only other characters (apart from a couple reoccurring villains) that appear throughout the show are the Object Pilot Melinda and Qwenther and Havia’s strict commanding officer, the crazily named Frolaytia Capistrano.Sound:Contrary to the previous sections of this review, Heavy Object achieves something other than run of the mill in its sound. It achieves above average. This is mainly due to the forgettable soundtrack and first Ending but the main reason is for its dub and the two openings. The openings One More Chance and Never Gave Up by the band ALL OUT were not only a great choice for this anime but they also fit Heavy Object surprisingly well. They are two very good openings and One More Chance is good enough to have a spot in my Top 50 Anime Openings. The second Ending is also nice to listen to as well. Now let’s talk about the best part of this anime in my opinion: the dub. Before I watched this anime I knew immediately that I would watch this in dub not only because it is dubbed by the best dubbing company around, Funimation but it also has a really good voice cast. Justin Briner who is one of Funimation’s newcomers voices Qwenther and does a really good job and he really fits the character. Micah Solusod voices Havia and also does a really great job. It’s also nice to hear Alexis Tipton and Morgan Garret’s voices as Melinda and Hot Fan Service Girl (Frolaytia) respectively. No voice actor does a bad performance in this dub, but that’s to be expected with any Funimation dub and it’s always great to see Funimation using their newcomers so much which makes me excited for any of their further roles.Animation:This is where it goes a bit downhill. Even though this anime is animated by J.C. Staff who are one of my favorite studios the animation in this show isn’t that great. The action scenes are pretty good and the CG isn’t terrible but the show has one of the ugliest and bland color schemes I’ve seen in a recent anime. Bright colors are used but they all feel washed out and are not very pleasant to look at. The character designs are also uninteresting and very bland and simple. Granted the show isn’t unwatchable by any means but it’s just not the best to look at most of the time. So instead of average the animation is slightly below average which is unfortunate since if the animation was nice it would have been another positive to the show.Final Thoughts:Average is the best word I can come up with when talking about Heavy Object. But it’s not average in a bad way since this is a really fun anime to watch. Despite its flaws I had a good time when watching it and while it’s no contender for Best Anime of 2016 it deserves at least an honorable mention since while it does have many minuses, the pluses outweigh it enough you to give this show a watch. It’s a 24 episode thrill-ride with a crazy premise and decent execution.Score: 7Rating: Good main characters Qwenther and Havia defeating a variety of different Objects without using an object and instead using careful planning, tactics and some split-second decisions.

This is strongly emphasized by the setting of military states battling each other with massive ""object"" war machines that require crews of hundred people to maintain, large home bases to set up and billions of units of cash to create then being contrasted with a duo being assigned time and time again to work together (this should never happen), single pilot being assigned to this war machine (common mecha trope, but makes even less sense in...Heavy objects setting), just plain makes so many odd simplifications about warfare while trying to have grim serious world it is weird (Seriously, the objects main guns can easily destroy other objects but satellites/long range missile systems with the ability haven\'t been developed what??)All this boils down to a world that feels very unreal and like it is a mosaic of pieces that don\'t really fit together.Things I liked:- Milinda Brantini, she was cute, I liked the pilot suit designs overall, very lovable girl.- The The sexy secretary girls aka every high ranking female officer in the series. More or less just fan service, though. There could be something said for Froylatia and some others but in the end I don\'t really think that any female character is really well done as a character in the series.

Watched it many times over.  The only thing is I like the music but I wish it was a lot mor intense like Aldnoah.Zero's music.  However it suits it well.  If you like a main character that outwits his opposite in cleaver ways and never actual stupid decisions you will like this anime.  I know, everyone acts like certain anime's like Death note or Code Geass have super smart main characters but I do not think so.  They think to much in the box for having those kinds of power...but in Heavy Object he does not have powers all he has his in knowledge on the Heavy Objects.  Due to this I am never like what are you doing, your a genius just do this it is within the rules of your magic powers.  Beyond that the only other thing is and it is not a complain but it does have a weird shift in some of the arcs later where they get a bit darker.  Do not want to spoil anything but normally shows tend to keep a standard of we show everyone die like in attack on titan, or we only show enemies death, to the no one dies.  Still would rate this a 10 because I just love it that much that I have watched it a couple times now.  I just wanted to mention these couple issues in case others are very dependent on movies or are okay with the start of the violence but would not be okay with it furthering beyond that.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  The main audience though is people that would enjoy watching smart people solve problems while watching that person also panic in distressful situations he should not really be in. but in Heavy Object he does not have powers all he has his in knowledge on the Heavy Objects.

Originally they have their own ambitions they want to achieve but, that soon goes down the drain when they become Object killing specialist. The story is somewhat an interesting take as many military anime tell their stories from the perspective of ace pilots or badass soldiers, in this case though it told through one being a training to be Heavy Object specialist (Qwenthur) and a radio analyst (Havia). This gives it a bit more of an interesting take to the story seeing that Object's in this story are very...much like the Gundam's in those Gundam series, it goes into some pretty deep information about how both Qwenthur and Havia come up with their plans even if most of it is fictional. Another nice factor to the story is the comedy I can not recall how many times I just laughed my head off because of the situations they got themselves into, one moment they could be in a firefight with enemy soldiers then next they're engrossed with the scene of baby penguins. It may sound ridiculous at first but, as you watch more you come to like the comedy and the lengths it goes to ease the tensions. The best I can explain is if 21 Jump Street was remade in Japan but, based on two soldiers and in anime format.The art is pretty good something you should expect from a studio like Kadokawa, the sceneries are done nicely as are the character models. The Heavy Objects however are a bit hit and miss sometimes they can look great mainly in fight scenes (and even then its just above average), it's because of the CGI but then I'm not even sure what I saw was normal animation or CGI. It's like the studio couldn't decide what they wanted to do there would be scenes that looked CGI then they'd look like any typical animation. Even some of the environmental effects such as water and explosives can look weird like out of a video games in many cases.The sound was pretty good, the sound effects of the weapons were nice from the massive howitzer like cannons on the Baby Magnum down to the Indigo laser weapons even to simple assault rifles that the infantry use they sound like they should do. The voice acting was very good, I watched  the dubbed and usually I don't do that unless I'm really behind or just want to catch up on some shows, so in my opinion you won't have any problems with the dubbed version. The opening songs are great both done by the band ALL OUT the tunes are very fitting for the show.The characters in my opinion are really enjoyable I love Qwenthur's snarky attitude when it comes to being a know it all about Object's and Havia's badass attitude to various situations, in many ways they are also similar both want to quit the military as soon as possible to achieve their ambitions, both have the hot's for most women and both just want a easy ride in the military. However it's their two varying attitudes to the situations they get themselves in that makes the two characters work as they're jokes and conversations bounce off of one another as if you were watching just two normal guys in the real world. Milinda (I hope I spelt that right haha) is a likeable character I'm a big softie when comes to Kuudere and Dandere characters so don't be surprised if I praise those stereotypes a lot. She has her serious attitude in fights which sometimes can get her into some pretty heated conversations especially with Juliet and her adorable side when she's just being herself around Qwenthur. I would talk about the other characters more but, I'll just say characters like Froyletta (I hope I spelt that right too) are also enjoyable to watch bringing her own comedic and story value into the mix. There are other side characters however, they either have so little screen time to really get a feel for them or they just die really quickly. And that's one thing this show has a habit of bringing in characters that give you a false perception that they have a bigger role in the story. So get use to either characters dying or just disappearing from the show entirely.Although there are a few nit picky things I have said it is still and enjoyable show to delve into especially for it's characters and set pieces for the story.Overall it is a very good show, it offers a bit many genres such as comedy, mecha, military etc. However if you hate those genres you're not going to like this show. They did seem to leave it on a cliff-hanger so if there is another season I would be to watch it on the other hand considering Heavy Object is an original anime we might not but, one could only hope! much like the Gundam's in those Gundam series, it goes into some pretty deep information about how both Qwenthur and Havia come up with their plans even if most of it is fictional.

The ending is original because they decided to give the show closure instead of leaving it on a cliffhanger.Basically, the entire show is about Heavy Objects waging war on the battlefield. Havia and Gwenthur are made to fight against large meccha objects. There is a mention of human-like objects in production (gundam?) but I don\'t know if the story is going in that direction. The anime wasn\'t able to adapt the source material at the time and I have not read the LN yet so I cannot confirm or deny this and thus can\'t...be a spoiler.Essentially, Havia is a radio analyst and Gwenthur is a designer student. They aren\'t even real troops but are expected to destroy Objects somehow even though nobody has ever done it before. The idea is to either exploit some type of weakness or just get really really lucky. Gwenthur isn\'t even authorized to have a gun because he\'s a ""student"" yet is authorized to carry tons of plastic explosives and fight against massive war machines that can withstand nukes. Army sends him to fight wars and expects him to do great things but he can\'t even be allowed to hold a gun despite risking his life and authorizing use of things 1000x more dangerous than guns. Yeah makes sense.Enough with that gripe. The anime was actually pretty good. I don\'t like meccha or war anime much at all but this one felt a bit unique and I liked it overall. The story became redundant and every time Havia or Gwenthur said they didn\'t want something to happen it\'s like raising flags that it will. Overall the plot is increasingly predictable but still pretty satisfying somehow nonetheless.Music is good, artwork is colorful and vibrant and characters are good. There is a bit of comedy as well.

We no longer have to work, machine has taken over everything. Energy is free, food is free, we even settle on Mars, my god, Aria will come true... Oh wait, damn, I\'m reading the wrong script from Back to the future, shit.Hmm, let\'s start again. In the distant future, world\'s peace is no longer a thing.

I understand their intention was to deny the status of Object in the battlefield but the way they did really downgrades the highly acclaimed dangerous weapon and as a result it is treated as a joke, a no-threat which is ridiculous and not intense.

But this is just not very good, only slightly entertaining.', 'Heavy ObjectLet\'s call this in short. Heavy Objects is about giant balls with guns hammering each other. Interesting, right? Well I could have liked it more. The main problem I can come up with is the fact that it adapts the first parts of the novel by the same name. I know little about the novel, but judging by the story progression in this long 24 episode anime...... well sufficed to say is that the story is not as fast paced as the action. Actually it never really  develops more than the very rudimentary basics of storytelling. At some points of the anime...I was geniuntly  confused about it\'s target audience.Premise 2/3The premise is sort of really vital to me. And as usual the possibilities it gives is what makes me start following the anime. Heavy Object is no exception. It introduces us to a world where the face of warfare was changed by the above mentioned objects. This in turn dislodges the established world geopolitical order. So to say - it gives a Carte blanche to the anime to tell pretty much any story it wants!Overall story progression. 1/4This is where the anime fails hard. And I mean really hard. Pretty much at the start it gave up any idea of developing a cohesive story in favor of random jumping from battlefield to battlefield.I guess this is due to the fact that the author of the novels wanted to prolong them, but having in mind that I judge this as a standalone anime its kind of like amputating its right arm. Instead of a plot the anime relies on action. And that is completely fine - it is an action mecha anime. If I was 10 years old right now a would have been all over it. So I thought this was the sort of anime aimed for kids. And than the bane called fan service kicks in and a realized this is not a kids anime, but rather the leave your brain at the door anime. Which is not by any means a bad thing, but it obviously disappointed me as I was expecting more of an effort.*Spoilers*Ok the idea of wanting to return to the old style of warfare would have been really cool if they gave any sort of solid reason why they would want to. The reason given is that they want individual people to matter again in combat, because nothing says human life matters as whole platoon being mowed down by random machine gun. Actually the anime itself on numeral occasion proves why Objects warfare is so much more preferable. It\'s like they had all sort of plot choices and picked this one that admirably at the start was looking good, but by the end it\'s clearly seen that they had not planned to really explore the idea, but rather used it to create stereotypical antagonists. And please don\'t get me started with the ""I want our country to speak one language so I am going to destroy this random city over here "".  Yep if  you are looking for a story, look elsewhere.Pacing 2/3The pacing is not bad. It\'s an action anime so it is fast. Yet their are some questionable cuts from one location to another that feel needlessly abrupt. And sometimes they stop everything for minutes to talk about something stupid that they obviously thought adds subsistence and gives you a chance for a breather. But in honesty it kind of killed the pacing.Complexity 0/2As above mentioned is lacking. Which is a shame with the interesting world they set up. We are stuck with the protagonists who evidently do not give a damn about how their world works wich is again a shame. Object warfare boils down to them outshooting each and the protagonist miraculously destroying them. Also every Objects has it\'s quirk. Which is nice. Some are multirole others are made to be used in a specific way.Plausibility 1/2Well it\'s also as you would expect. Because it\'s a military anime the said military left their common sense where you should leave your brain before watching this. Nothing says professionalism like sending a student and a radar technician to destroy the strongest military hardware in the goddamn world. I already refuse to hold it against anime the stereotype that only teenagers can save the world. Relations between different countries could have been explored more, I mean 24 episodes, but I am definitely asking something that they never had the intention of doing. For what it is ------- ok.Conclusion 1/4 and Catharsis 0/2Overall the story left me highly unsatisfied. It still has the promise of the beginning mainly because it did not spend it anywhere. It did not had a conclusive ending, because you know novels..... but I am not planning to read the novels on the base of what was shown in the anime and season2 is nowhere in sight(I think). So again if story is paramount and not only a basic filler your gold is not in this anime.Overall Story 3,5/10Characters Presence 1/4Before talking about the individual personalities it pays to say what is the casts presence as whole. Well we have four main characters who admirably have chemistry between them. The minus here is that often they come as alienating themselves due to desire to extend the novel(I\'m guessing). By adapting the beginning novels and the author obviously wanting to save character development for later leads to the main characters feeling underdeveloped and unmemorable for a 24 episode anime.Personality 2/5  and Development 1/5Frolaytia Capistrano - Is the 18 year old general(of course) that leads the unit where the other main characters are stationed. Plus being a general at the good age for a first car she is a female from a noble family that can have only males? She is a female from a family that can have only male children. Repeat yourself that a few times. But when you put aside this by all means masterful development I would have to say that she is by far the most developed one. (Both as a character and.....). She is  a bit sadistic which is fun.Qwenthur Barbotage is our MC. And how should I put it. He is just your basic run of the mill main character. He is painfully average. He\'s obviously smart and capable of magicly dropping plans to destroy the strongest military hardware out there, yet as a typical MC sometimes gets retarded as hell unable to add up 2+2, especially when it comes to Milinda - his romantic interest. And he is a student(of course - they all are not mentioning it again).Milinda Brantini - the Object pilot. She is cute and .... inexperienced in social interaction. She pilots her Object Baby Magnum(cool name) masterfully, but is rather put down by the fact the the MC walks around smashing Objects with his bare hands. She suffered heavily from the ""we want to flesh you out in novel 167"" syndrom. Or at least I hope thats the case, because otherwise it would be an insult to her character. As for the romance between her and Quenthur refer to the novel 167 remark. For now it\'s only used for rather cheap humor(wich I liked, but than again.... it\'s me).Havia Winchell - Well 167 remark again. He is a radio operator and a noble of some sort. He is the bff of the other male MC. And they do have very good chemistry.  But most of the time he is just relegated to following him and making remarks about his messiah tendencies.Supporting characters - ... well I remember only Ohoho(she laughs like that). Yep, but with main characters like this what do you expect of supporting ones.Backdrop 0/2Also character backdrop is mostly non existent and is used ones to establish Quenthur as coming of a decent family.Catharsis 2/4As whole what of the characters I liked is their promise not what they displayed. Admitably the ending was sweet, nice and promising, but was again undermined by the lack of will to move in any way from the established.Characters overall 3/10Character figures 2/3 Backgrounds 2/3 Animation 2/3 Visual Effects 1/3 Overall Artwork 5/8Character figures are basic. Their military uniforms are questionable and weird, but they bothered to change the camouflage pattern depending on the environment so good job. Backgrounds are beautiful and get the job done. Animation and Visual Effects are Ok. I do like the choreography of object warfare and they might as well made the whole anime about the giant balls. Visual effect could have maybe been more memorable as this is an action anime and would have benefited by it. When all put together it\'s solid. It did have a quality drop, but for me was a minor one. Objects look like the tanks I used to draw when I was 7. More creativity would not have hurt them. Making it jump ain\'t creative.Overall Art 5,5/10Voice Acting 3/3 Music Themes 1/3 Sound Effects 1/2 Ending 0,5/1 Opening 0,5/1Voice work is really good and one of the main reason that the interactions between character didn\'t feel completely lifeless. The music and themes were not annoying me, but are forgettable. The sound effects were default at best. The opening and ending do the job, but I skipped the hell out of them.Overall Sound 6/10Overall Enjoyment 7/10Well story and characters are paramount for me. So it\'s logical that I should have hate it. But no it\'s more of a disappointment and I will not hold it against the anime that it did not answer my expectations. It\'s my fault for approaching it wrong. For what it wanted to do(brainless fun) it was a solid job. And I did have fun. The humor was fine (but over relied upon) and the fan service did not make me kill the dude who thought of it(that is really rare). And Object battles are spectacular to watch. So as an overall anime it\'s not that good, but no one said everything has to be Steins Gate - if you know what you are getting in to you can have a ton of fun with it. And a second season can improve it massively.Overall score 4,8125/10 I was geniuntly  confused about it\'s target audience.Premise 2/3The premise is sort of really vital to me. And as usual the possibilities it gives is what makes me start following the anime. Heavy Object is no exception. It introduces us to a world where the face of warfare was changed by the above mentioned objects. This in turn dislodges the established world geopolitical order. So to say - it gives a Carte blanche to the anime to tell pretty much any story it wants!Overall story progression. 1/4This is where the anime fails hard. And I mean really hard. Pretty much at the start it gave up any idea of developing a cohesive story in favor of random jumping from battlefield to battlefield.I guess this is due to the fact that the author of the novels wanted to prolong them, but having in mind that I judge this as a standalone anime its kind of like amputating its right arm. Instead of a plot the anime relies on action. And that is completely fine - it is an action mecha anime. If I was 10 years old right now a would have been all over it. So I thought this was the sort of anime aimed for kids. And than the bane called fan service kicks in and a realized this is not a kids anime, but rather the leave your brain at the door anime. Which is not by any means a bad thing, but it obviously disappointed me as I was expecting more of an effort.*Spoilers*Ok the idea of wanting to return to the old style of warfare would have been really cool if they gave any sort of solid reason why they would want to. The reason given is that they want individual people to matter again in combat, because nothing says human life matters as whole platoon being mowed down by random machine gun. Actually the anime itself on numeral occasion proves why Objects warfare is so much more preferable. It\'s like they had all sort of plot choices and picked this one that admirably at the start was looking good, but by the end it\'s clearly seen that they had not planned to really explore the idea, but rather used it to create stereotypical antagonists. And please don\'t get me started with the ""I want our country to speak one language so I am going to destroy this random city over here "".  Yep if  you are looking for a story, look elsewhere.Pacing 2/3The pacing is not bad. It\'s an action anime so it is fast. Yet their are some questionable cuts from one location to another that feel needlessly abrupt. And sometimes they stop everything for minutes to talk about something stupid that they obviously thought adds subsistence and gives you a chance for a breather. But in honesty it kind of killed the pacing.Complexity 0/2As above mentioned is lacking. Which is a shame with the interesting world they set up. We are stuck with the protagonists who evidently do not give a damn about how their world works wich is again a shame. Object warfare boils down to them outshooting each and the protagonist miraculously destroying them. Also every Objects has it\'s quirk. Which is nice. Some are multirole others are made to be used in a specific way.Plausibility 1/2Well it\'s also as you would expect. Because it\'s a military anime the said military left their common sense where you should leave your brain before watching this. Nothing says professionalism like sending a student and a radar technician to destroy the strongest military hardware in the goddamn world. I already refuse to hold it against anime the stereotype that only teenagers can save the world. Relations between different countries could have been explored more, I mean 24 episodes, but I am definitely asking something that they never had the intention of doing. For what it is ------- ok.Conclusion 1/4 and Catharsis 0/2Overall the story left me highly unsatisfied. It still has the promise of the beginning mainly because it did not spend it anywhere. It did not had a conclusive ending, because you know novels..... but I am not planning to read the novels on the base of what was shown in the anime and season2 is nowhere in sight(I think). So again if story is paramount and not only a basic filler your gold is not in this anime.Overall Story 3,5/10Characters Presence 1/4Before talking about the individual personalities it pays to say what is the casts presence as whole. Well we have four main characters who admirably have chemistry between them. The minus here is that often they come as alienating themselves due to desire to extend the novel(I\'m guessing). By adapting the beginning novels and the author obviously wanting to save character development for later leads to the main characters feeling underdeveloped and unmemorable for a 24 episode anime.Personality 2/5  and Development 1/5Frolaytia Capistrano - Is the 18 year old general(of course) that leads the unit where the other main characters are stationed. Plus being a general at the good age for a first car she is a female from a noble family that can have only males? She is a female from a family that can have only male children. Repeat yourself that a few times. But when you put aside this by all means masterful development I would have to say that she is by far the most developed one. (Both as a character and.....). She is  a bit sadistic which is fun.Qwenthur Barbotage is our MC. And how should I put it. He is just your basic run of the mill main character. He is painfully average. He\'s obviously smart and capable of magicly dropping plans to destroy the strongest military hardware out there, yet as a typical MC sometimes gets retarded as hell unable to add up 2+2, especially when it comes to Milinda - his romantic interest. And he is a student(of course - they all are not mentioning it again).Milinda Brantini - the Object pilot. She is cute and .... inexperienced in social interaction. She pilots her Object Baby Magnum(cool name) masterfully, but is rather put down by the fact the the MC walks around smashing Objects with his bare hands. She suffered heavily from the ""we want to flesh you out in novel 167"" syndrom. Or at least I hope thats the case, because otherwise it would be an insult to her character. As for the romance between her and Quenthur refer to the novel 167 remark. For now it\'s only used for rather cheap humor(wich I liked, but than again.... it\'s me).Havia Winchell - Well 167 remark again. He is a radio operator and a noble of some sort. He is the bff of the other male MC. And they do have very good chemistry.  But most of the time he is just relegated to following him and making remarks about his messiah tendencies.Supporting characters - ... well I remember only Ohoho(she laughs like that). Yep, but with main characters like this what do you expect of supporting ones.Backdrop 0/2Also character backdrop is mostly non existent and is used ones to establish Quenthur as coming of a decent family.Catharsis 2/4As whole what of the characters I liked is their promise not what they displayed. Admitably the ending was sweet, nice and promising, but was again undermined by the lack of will to move in any way from the established.Characters overall 3/10Character figures 2/3 Backgrounds 2/3 Animation 2/3 Visual Effects 1/3 Overall Artwork 5/8Character figures are basic.

It is set in a world where wars are fought between giant mechs known as Objects that are each uniquely built with advanced weaponry. It’s very much a quality over quantity thing, wherein they are extremely expensive and thus only a few of them exist, but because of this they are so powerful that...anything not at their level is considered comparatively useless and thus obsolete. Just the idea of mere foot soldier managing to defeat one was utterly absurd. But that is what Qwenthur Barbotage and his partner Havia Winchell manage to do. And not just once, but repeatedly.This anime is very much dedicated to telling good smaller stories over trying to build up a grander overarching narrative. It’s composed of a series of arcs, each of which is only a few episodes and is dedicated to a single battle that Qwenthur and his unit, the Legitimate Kingdom’s 37th Mobile Maintenance Battalion, participate in. Every one of these arcs has a similar structure. It starts off before the battle is beginning, at which point it foreshadows some feature that will become prominent later, whether it be a certain aspect of the terrain or a certain technical concept. The battle between Objects then begins and things go horribly wrong, resulting in Qwenthur and usually Havia being thrown right into the thick of it. Qwenthur then manages to come up with a genius plan that uses whatever was foreshadowed earlier, often after some quick consultation with other characters, which he and his allies then carry out, resulting in a shocking victory.It doesn’t sound like this has that much variety, but despite that I never found it getting repetitive. This is for a number of reasons. The first is that although the general concept is pretty similar for every single arc, there is a good amount of variety to the individual context of the arc. The side characters involved, the connections of the side characters to the main characters, the Objects involved and the abilities that they have, the geography, etc. are all very different from arc to arc. On top of that things feel are well written, wherein it becomes pretty clear early on that whatever the final plan will be will get foreshadowing early on and it becomes pretty easy to spot that foreshadowing to an extent, but the plans overall are pretty technical so they’re not easy to predict, at least for me, and are thus still interesting when they’re executed. The writing conveys this incredibly well by making very good use of a show and then explain structure most of the time that manages to create a good amount of suspense during the show portion and then convey a pretty strong sense of satisfaction during the explain portion. The writing beyond that is also pretty great, wherein it just in general is paced incredibly well and makes good use of exciting action and hilarious comedy to keep things interesting.To further extrapolate on an earlier point, I would like to emphasize how the cast of characters keeps things interesting. None of the cast is all that deep. They each get some background, but there’s essentially no character or relationship development, so in general they don’t feel all that fleshed out or like they have any sort of character arc. However, despite that there are a lot of characters that are really likable just because of their personalities and how they fit in with everyone else. The prime examples are Qwenthur, Havia, and their commanding officer Frolaytia. Qwenthur and Havia are hilarious. They are constantly throwing out witticism and sarcasm regardless of the situation. They also have absolutely zero discipline which stands out considering that they’re in the army and just makes their entire dynamic really amusing. The cherry on the cake is Frolaytia who actually kind of goes along with them. She doesn’t exactly let them get away with anything, but rather the punishments she gives them are more in line with her sadism than the type of punishments one would get in the military. The entire dynamic is pretty much playful. And it is absolutely hilarious.The same applies to a lot of the side characters. Milinda, the pilot of their unit’s Object, is often listed as a main character, though I don’t really see it as she felt closer to the various other side characters than the trio of Qwenthur, Havia, and Frolaytia. She had as much screen time as them, but it felt her personality wasn’t as strong, and thus she didn’t feel as prominent. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though, as she still fit her role pretty well in that she’s basically a tsundere that is interesting at times but doesn’t overstay her welcome and get annoying. There are lots of other interesting characters too, like mad scientists, combat idols, gravure reporters, and combat maids. None of them have any depth and are pretty flat, but what traits they do have are really strong and come through really well. That combined with how everyone meshes together really well in various ways, friends and foes alike, results in a cast that is holistically really interesting, likable, and feels worth getting invested in.If it wasn’t clear so far, I should emphasize that this anime is a lot more comedy oriented than it may appear at first. Though that doesn’t mean it doesn’t get intense though. Rather, it’s the type of anime that has comedy throughout no matter how intense things may get. It’s not like the narrative isn’t taking itself seriously, as the underlying plot is always solid. However, the writing is perfectly fine with having fun along side that even in absurd ways that may be seen as tonally inconsistent. This is something that’s also found in other works by Kamachi Kazuma’s, such as the Certain Magical Index series, though I think this is the one that takes things the furthest in that regard. To be frank, I really enjoy this dynamic in and of itself. It may result in things not being as deep or mature, but I think it makes things more amusing overall. And on top of that the comedy in and of itself is great too. Especially the portions at the beginning and end of each arc that go all in on the comedy as the proper plot hasn’t started or is already over.I should still note that the anime isn’t completely lacking depth. It does explore some general themes regarding war, though for the most part it’s all pretty superficial. Still, at the end of each arc, it generally felt like it said something. There’s also some pretty good foundational world building. The general concepts behind war being fought almost solely by giant mechs results in a lot of very interesting dynamics to the world, and it touches upon a lot of them though it doesn’t really heavily tackle any of them. It also briefly introduces the four major factions that make up the world and how they differ, with each having a very different set of principles, though as of yet it mostly feels like an introduction as only two of them were shown properly. There’s also some hinting throughout of what the overarching plot will be and some sort of shadowy group in the background that stands at the center of it, though it’s mostly all really subtle hints outside of the last arc, though since the last arc is anime original I’m not sure how valid what is conveyed in the last arc is to the rest of the story in the light novels.On that note, the ending was satisfying enough. The anime is composed of mostly disconnected arcs, and the final arc isn’t any different really. It doesn’t particularly wrap up any overarching plot threads, rather the last arc is the first arc where it feels like there were any overarching plot threads so it may well be seen as the arc that introduces them. Still, it felt like it was a good arc to end on for the most part as it involved a lot of the important side characters from throughout the series and also thematically felt the strongest in trying to say something. Still, it’s an anime original arc so it wasn’t like they were that constrained by the source material so I feel like they could have handled it better as it felt kind of rushed and abrupt in how it ended.The art and animation are both really solid. It uses a lot of CG, but it uses it for things like mechs, planes, etc. which I largely think look perfectly fine with CG and I largely felt the CG used in this anime was perfectly fine. Things like UIs for the mechs and such were also all really well designed. The mech designs took a bit to get used to and originally looked kind of dumb, but after seeing them in action for a bit they really grew on me. The character designs overall I thought were great from the get go even if they are pretty random and contributed to how the anime in general is just a lot of fun. It also felt like the animation team made really good use of them by having a lot of completely pointless animation during explanations and such that added nothing of substance but was just amusing and pleasant to watch. I also appreciated the pretty well made eye catches in the middle of each episode. Both of OPs I thought were pretty hype in terms of audio and visuals, the first especially, though the EDs in terms of audio and visuals I only found decent. The soundtrack was decent enough and fit well but wasn’t particularly memorable. anything not at their level is considered comparatively useless and thus obsolete.

Let it be known that I have not read the light novel this series is based on, and this anime makes a convincing argument that it should stay that way.  There is quite a lot wrong with this series, but I'll break it down into 3 main components:  Setting, Characters, and Medium.  I'm going to completely ignore the fact that this series has the worse naming sense of anything I've ever...come across.  Character names are incredibly ridiculous that it is impossible to take anything that anyone says seriously.Setting:The world that Heavy Object takes place in makes little sense and really hurts the series.  All the nations are broken down into a single linear trait, such as: business, religion, intel, etc...  You'd think this would make each individual nation unique, but it  ends up making them all shallow and non distinct.  Each rival nation could be replaced by a single generic rival country and things would not change much.In the series, Objects are supposed to be all powerful weapons of war that makes every other weapon obsolete.  The show goes to great lengths to make sure this is known and it is supposed to be an undeniable fact in the world they live in. In reality though, the Objects barely do anything and are really easy to defeat, but nobody seems to notice this.  Even after numerous Objects are defeated by the protagonists, Objects are still hyped up to be the most powerful thing on the planet.  Some how, Heavy Objects made the battles between powerful super weapons incredibly boring.  Most of the time they just run around in circles shooting each other accomplishing nothing, while the protagonists do everything else.  Which could be fine, if characters were remotely interesting.Characters:I was unable to find a single character in this show likable and only a few that I thought were fine.  Most of the characters are annoying and incredibly repetitive in their actions.  Qwenther and Havia make lewd jokes while complaining, Frolyatia bosses them around while making sexy poses, and Milinda doesn't do anything.  The characters in no way change over the course of the series and treat each other exactly the same with no development whatsoever.Medium;It is extremely obvious that this series was based off of a light novel and was not an original for anime series.

If you haven\'t, then the best description is that it is a person or thing that can do one thing really well but is average at best in almost every other respect. This is a pretty good way to describe ""Heavy Object"", a military-mecha anime based on light novels written by ""A Certain Magical Index"" creator Kazuma Kamachi. In this case, its one trick is its ""David vs. Goliath"" battles, featuring mere foot soldiers taking down giant superweapons with nothing but brains and whatever tools they have at their disposal, allowing the series to be very entertaining in...spite of itself.Story (6/10):In the not-too-distant future, war has changed. It has become far simpler, shorter and cleaner thanks to giant vehicles known as Objects. As a result of this military upheaval, all of the nations of the world have fractured into four coalitions which constantly wage war on each other, the ""Legitimacy Kingdom"", focused on tradition, the ""Capitalist Enterprise"", which values profit, the ""Information Union"", focused on knowledge, and the ""Faith Organization"", which values religion above everything else. Because of their firepower and integrity, it has been rammed into the general public that the only thing that can beat an Object is another Object, and so losses are determined by whether or not a side still has a functioning Object. All of this changes, however, when two soldiers, named Qwenthur Barbotage and Havia Winchell, rescue Object pilot Millinda Brantini (who is always called the ""Princess"" for whatever reason) and along the way prove a great truth- Objects are NOT infallible. Unfortunately for the trio, this accomplishment results in them, along with their commander Froylatia Capistrano, getting dragged into all sorts of extremely dangerous missions all over the globe, and along the way they learn that, while most view them as heroes, there are others who despise them for disrupting what they see as the ""natural order"".Much like its brother series ""A Certain Magical Index"", ""Heavy Object"" spends a lot of time building its world, usually in the form of exposition provided by Qwenthur himself. The problem is that a lot of this world-building ends up being little more than window-dressing, since the story never really becomes anything more than the heroes moving from one location to the next and stopping whatever threat arises there. Furthermore, the idea that the invention of a single superweapon could completely change how wars work does test the willing suspension of disbelief, which for me is pretty high, since there are many mission types in which the usage of such a massive weapon like an Object would be incredibly impractical. For all the time the series spends talking about the world as it is now, the history of the world and exactly how it got to its current state is barely given more than a handwave, which can be pretty frustrating, to say the least.The various locations can also get quite repetitive after a while, with most of the story arcs being set in various snowy landscapes or jungles. It would have been nice to have at least a couple of episodes set in a city or some other kind of residence, to at least get a clear idea of what civilian life is like in this world. There\'s also a surprising lack of politics involved, which is strange considering the ongoing conflict between four superpowers, with the Legitimacy Kingdom getting the lion\'s share of development in comparison to the other three nations. Ultimately, the story is one that could have been so much more than it is, but instead simply serves as an excuse to pit normal soldiers against giant robots, though the clever tactics they use to take down the Objects does help a little.Art & Animation (8.5/10):""Heavy Object""\'s art style may not be anything you haven\'t seen before, but god damn if the series doesn\'t make the most of it. The character models are all distinct, well-drawn and highly detailed and the environments, while cut and pasted, look very good as well. The series also uses 3-D imagery very well for the Objects, which have a fair amount of variety in their designs, and their interiors look especially great. Overall, I\'ve seen better, but I\'ve definitely seen worse, and this is easily one of the best things about the show.Sound & Dialogue (8/10):""Heavy Object""\'s soundtrack is fairly forgettable overall, consisting mostly generic tracks that, while fitting, tend to blend into the background rather than enhance whatever\'s currently going on. The ending themes are both very forgettable, as is the first opening, and the second opening, while notably better, is ultimately nothing to write home about. On the other hand, the voice acting is great; Justin Briner and Alexis Tipton do highly respectable jobs as Qwenthur and Milinda, respectively, and Morgan Garret and Micah Solusod do just as good jobs as Froylatia and Havia. As a whole, while none of the performances are what I would call ""standout"", there aren\'t any I would call ""awful"" either.Characters (7/10):The characters are not the most engaging, but they are generally likable. First up is the main character Qwenthur Barbotage. As a civilian soldier in training, he generally isn\'t allowed to carry a gun, yet he still manages to the best and most badass character in the entire series. Much of this come from his plans to take down Objects, which are often just as crazy as they are effective. Hell, his balls are evident by the fact that he actually attempted to take down an Object in the first place, even though it had been rammed in that doing so was impossible for a solider, yet alone one who hasn\'t even finished his training. Nevertheless, he proves it can be done, hence his new catchphrase ""Whatever\'s created by man can be destroyed by man"". As for his actual personality, he\'s generally very kind and will do anything for his friends, though he\'s not without his callous moments. He\'s also extremely smart, as shown by the various ingenious plans he employs to destroy the Objects, not unlike Shiage Hamazura from ""A Certain Magical Index"" using wits to defeat enemies much stronger than him. It\'s safe to say that, without Qwenthur, this show wouldn\'t even be possible. On the other hand, I have rather mixed feelings regarding Qwenthur\'s partner and best friend, Havia Winchell, who is my least favourite of the main characters despite having the second largest amount of screentime. Unlike Qwenthur, Havia comes from a family of the nobility, which is evident in the fact that while on a mission, he often wishes he were back at home living his comfortable, luxurious lifestyle, giving me the impression that he\'s just not cut out to be a soldier. Don\'t get me wrong, he does have some redeeming moments, but a lot of the time he just cowers and complains about every little thing and expects Qwenthur to figure everything out, which is especially jarring since he\'s usually the only one of the two who has a gun. Even worse is that he frequently makes sexual advances towards his commanding officer Froylatia, despite it being established in other episodes that he already has a fiancé, the implications of which are never brought up in the series.Next up is Milinda Brantini, though you\'ll rarely hear that name since everyone in the series calls her ""Princess"". She acts as the mecha pilot of the group, piloting an Object known as the Baby Magnum, which, in video game terms, is a jack-of-all-stats. Unfortunately, this means she frequently goes up against opponents who have an advantage over her in some way, forcing her to rely on aid from Qwenthur and Havia to help give her the edge she needs in combat. As far as her background goes, she doesn\'t really have one, to the point that we never even learn where her nickname comes from. Nevertheless, I found myself liking her more than any other character in the series besides Qwenthur, not only for being a badass but also for being probably the nicest character in the entire series (granted, I expected that considering who voices her, but still). Last but not least as far as the main cast goes, we have the commander of the team Froylatia Capandris, who is described as ""heartless"" a couple of times but is actually anything but, as it\'s shown several times that she does care a lot for the people under her command, though she can definitely be harsh with them at times, especially Qwenthur and Havia. She also has a very sympathetic, if somewhat strange, backstory, which helps to explain the way she is and ultimately caused her to endear me more than Havia did, even she ultimately doesn\'t do all that much in the way of action.The supporting cast is decent, but it really depends on what character you\'re talking about. To put in simple terms, for every character that earned my respect or angered me to the point that I was begging to see them get what was coming to them, there was at least one other that really annoyed me or failed to leave any impression at all, either by flat characterization or just not having a lot of screentime. Usually both. Furthermore, I ultimately didn\'t like any of them nearly as much as the main cast (yes, not even Havia), which probably isn\'t helped by the fact that most, if not all, of them don\'t have any prominence in the series outside a single arc, and some of them don\'t even survive a single episode.Enjoyment (7.5/10):For all its many flaws, one thing ""Heavy Object"" definitely does not lack in is thrills and excitement. Seeing Qwenthur and the others come up with all sorts of crazy plans to take down the Objects never stops being entertaining despite the repetitive environments, and is the biggest reason why I was able to watch the anime all the way to the end. That said, being what it is, the show maintains a very serious tone throughout, and the comic relief that is there tends to be nothing you likely haven\'t seen before.Overall:It\'s a good thing that ""Heavy Object"" knows exactly what its strengths are and how to use them, because if it weren\'t for its creative man vs. machine conflicts, it would just be another military-mecha anime with nothing to set it apart from the rest of the pack. It\'s overall a lot like one of those over-the-top action movies that forgoes telling a good story in favour of thrills and spectacle, so if you enjoy those kinds of movies, you will probably enjoy it. On the other hand, if you\'re looking for something with a bit more depth, you\'re better off looking elsewhere.Score:6+8.5+8+7+7.5=37/50=7.4/10 spite of itself.Story (6/10):In the not-too-distant future, war has changed.

After 24 episodes of it, I'm still not 100% sure I've got a decent grip on what this show is, but I'm going to do my best to find something coherent in this.Conceptually, 'Heavy Object' is simple but reasonably unique. The basic concept of Objects, of these huge, indestructible war machines, provides an interesting take on mecha, that is, if nothing else, genuinely unique. The general premise of two soldiers using their skills as an engineer and an analyst to destroy these Objects, that supposedly can't be destroyed by anything other than another object, is cool. The show manages to find...a balance between these feats involving plans that are creative and anything but repetitive, but manage to never feel pulled out of thin air; keep an eye on the little, seemingly unimportant character moments, because they often find their way into these plans. They're a bit over-the-top, but never feel contrived or lazy.The story itself is fairly simple. There's definitely hints of character development scattered throughout, and bits of plot and characters that pop up again later, but generally the 2/3 episode arcs are fairly self-contained, even if they lead on from each other nicely. The characters don't change a huge amount, but they also don't feel entirely static, and they're at least likeable enough that you don't mind too much. The action is very well-done, with good CG (although still often lacking the sense of weight CG mecha fights can, despite the huge, spherical nature of Objects) and the aforementioned interesting solutions to the unique problems the Objects bring our protagonists.All in all, it's a lot of fun. That said, there's more to this...Firstly, I think this is trying to bit a little bit of a parody, or at least a send-up, of mecha and military anime. For one, the tone, despite the premise and stakes, skews fairly light and irreverent for the most part. It's quite silly, and while that does work most of the time, it does also bring in a couple of other issues. For one, the show's just a little creepy with its women. Not even in the normal anime way; the fan-service, while present on occasion, is actually more restrained than I might have expected, with people at least generally keeping their clothes on. It's more that this irreverent tone influences this too; one of the protagonists almost exclusively refers to his female superior officer with various nicknames related to her breasts, which, like, felt tonally consistent I guess, but also just felt weirdly placed and a little distracting. Distracting is definitely the word here; even within a fairly light-hearted show, the weird sexual non-sequiturs just felt like they distracted from the more interesting parts of the show.And, to accentuate that, what the weird sex stuff gets in the way of the most is any thematic or political interests the show has. The show has a weird global political landscape, that feels like a part of its genre send-up; the fairly standard four global superpowers have a amusing literalness about them; the Legitimate Kingdom, the Intelligence Union, the Faith Organisation, and the Capital Enterprise are... on the nose names, for sure. But there could actually have been space for some very interesting satire that the show just never quite realises is there. And this kind of means that any potential themes in regard to its militaries never quite hits. This is either military propaganda or a fantastic anti-war satire, but it's all so muddled I can't quite tell which.But, despite the fact that its weird horniness distracted from the good bits, despite the fact that the whole show is sort of a theme soup, I still had an awful lot of fun with 'Heavy Object'. It's silly, and bombastic, and irreverent, but still manages to be cleverly pieced together, and kept me very nicely entertained. Just... don't think as hard as I did about it and you'll have a good time. a balance between these feats involving plans that are creative and anything but repetitive, but manage to never feel pulled out of thin air; keep an eye on the little, seemingly unimportant character moments, because they often find their way into these plans.

Just... don't think as hard as I did about it and you'll have a good time."", 'A mecha series from the writer of A Certain Scientific Railgun and the animation studio that brought us Food Wars, I had very high hopes for this series, and... it is beyond awful.The show is set in a confusingly fractured world of poorly defined nations who constantly fight for no apparent reason using ""Objects"", spherical ultra-strong mecha-tanks with guns attached to them. The protagonists are an enthusiastic genius student weapons designer named Quinther, his perverted slacker of a friend Havia, and Princess Milinda who has very little in the way of any defining personality traits beyond a few hilarious scenes.Our two male protagonists are...both irritating sexual deviants who constantly slack off of duty and make inappropriate comments about their commanding officer\'s breasts, and who often only succeed in their goals because of sheer luck or extreme plot contrivance rather than actual strategy. They also recieve an excessive amount of plot armour, which peaks in the final episode in which they inexplicably survive their freaking car being hit by a missile, for which there is no explanation. The female characters meanwhile are treated as nothing more than sex objects, and the lack of respect that the protagonists have for them is beyond a joke, especially in one supposedly comical scene in which Quinther gets his CO out of an arranged marriage by sexually assaulting her boobs in full view of her would-be fiancee. I mean, for crying out loud this show is sexist. They even have a team of elite mercenaries in the second half of the show, which is made up of hyper-obedient women in fetishised cat-maid outfits. How is that appropriate gear for battle?With that said, it\'s not like the male characters feel like actual people either though, especially in the first few episodes where exposition is shovelled into dialogue so much that almost everything Quinther says brings the conversation back in some way to the subject of Objects, and he talks more like someone reading from a guidebook than an actual human. These problems could have been circumvented by having a narrator for short scenes like in the similar but far superior series Knights and Magic. I get that this breaks the ""show don\'t tell"" rule, but it enhances immersion if your characters talk like actual people. In Knights and Magic, the details about the technology are given gradually by Ernesti and his allies and foes, and it works because the dialogue feels natural and people don\'t feel a need to talk about things they would have known for years.Then there\'s the problem of the Objects themselves... they look boring. Mecha series primarily exist to be rule-of-cool action first and foremost, but there is no way to animate spheres with guns attached and make the action seem exciting in any way compared with giant robots, suits, and monsters, because you can\'t choreograph the fights or pull any cool camera tricks that will make a sphere look good. The name ""Object"" is also extremely bland and unimaginative, especially given the way mechs in other series are named, like Silhouette Knights (Knights and Magic), Knightmares (Code Geass), Idols (Idolmaster Xenoglossia), Catafracts (Aldnoah.Zero), to name a few. It\'s like they went with the most boring name and design as can possibly be concieved.Another problem is that there is very little in the way of moral ambiguity, given the fragile state of the world. Sure, there are admittedly some very well executed scenes which do cause you to think about who is in the right and who is in the wrong, but those scenes are VERY few and far between. For the most part, enemies are one-dimensional purely evil mass murderers who lack clear motivation or idealogical reason besides being ""evil for the sake of evil"", which given that most of the organisations formed out of conflicts in ideology, makes it feel like a lot of potentially very interesting and ambiguous plot lines were missed out in favour of cliche mindless plot-armoured nonsense.Part way through the series, we learn that Havia has a fiancee from a rival family. She appears once and is never mentioned again, and despite the fact that he acts like a pervert towards every other woman in the show, flirts with ""G-cup Santa"" (actual character name), and very frequently flirts with Frolaytia, we are seriously expected to believe that he genuinely loves her. But don\'t worry, after ne episode her plot line is completely forgotten about and she never appears again. There\'s also a TV presenter woman who was looking for Quinther part way through the series whose life was saved by Quinther\'s father. This woman also gets completely forgotten about after her one episode, making her seem completely pointless.Speaking of pointless, the fact that Milinda is a princess of the Legitimate Knigdom (France in this world) serves NO POINT in the story at all. She is frequently placed in dangerous situations in battle with limited chance of survival, she has her body and eyes modified to make her an optimal Object pilot, she doesn\'t even pilot a particularly strong Object (actually she pilots one of the weakest ones in the entire series). What kind of stupid country would allow its freaking teenage princess to go on such dangerous excursions in outdated technology? It makes no sense!Oh, and speaking of makes no sense, there is a scene in which Quinther accidentally almost kills Milinda by tightening her automated harness to the point that it almst chokes her in the first episode, then doesn\'t even try to save her life, because he doesn\'t want to touch her boobs by accident. For crying out loud, this is you\'re freaking princess\'s life, you asshole. It makes even less sence when you consider that Quinther has no problem grabbing his own commanding officer\'s boobs later in the series, comments ""Wow, what a rack"" about Milinda when she falls on him once, and as we later learn he regularly watches pornography. You can\'t just portray someone as an ultra non-pervert, only to then change that suddenly to make him a pervert. For crying out loud, IS SOME CHARACTER CONSISTENCY TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR, even if it\'s of an unlikable character?Honestly I have about seven or eight more things wrong with this show in my head right now, from its dull soundtrack to its bizarre character motivations, but if you\'re really interested at this point then you are probably insane. This show is a sexist, uninspired, boring mediocrity that fails at action, fails at characterisation, fails at world-building, and just freaking fails. 2/10, not recommended.p.s. watch Knights and Magic, it does everything that this show tries to do only much better and with much more likable and interesting characters. both irritating sexual deviants who constantly slack off of duty and make inappropriate comments about their commanding officer\'s breasts, and who often only succeed in their goals because of sheer luck or extreme plot contrivance rather than actual strategy.

Mecha series primarily exist to be rule-of-cool action first and foremost, but there is no way to animate spheres with guns attached and make the action seem exciting in any way compared with giant robots, suits, and monsters, because you can\'t choreograph the fights or pull any cool camera tricks that will make a sphere look good. The name ""Object"" is also extremely bland and unimaginative, especially given the way mechs in other series are named, like Silhouette Knights (Knights and Magic), Knightmares (Code Geass), Idols (Idolmaster Xenoglossia), Catafracts (Aldnoah.Zero), to name a few. It\'s like they went with the most boring name and design as can possibly be concieved.Another problem is that there is very little in the way of moral ambiguity, given the fragile state of the world. Sure, there are admittedly some very well executed scenes which do cause you to think about who is in the right and who is in the wrong, but those scenes are VERY few and far between. For the most part, enemies are one-dimensional purely evil mass murderers who lack clear motivation or idealogical reason besides being ""evil for the sake of evil"", which given that most of the organisations formed out of conflicts in ideology, makes it feel like a lot of potentially very interesting and ambiguous plot lines were missed out in favour of cliche mindless plot-armoured nonsense.Part way through the series, we learn that Havia has a fiancee from a rival family. She appears once and is never mentioned again, and despite the fact that he acts like a pervert towards every other woman in the show, flirts with ""G-cup Santa"" (actual character name), and very frequently flirts with Frolaytia, we are seriously expected to believe that he genuinely loves her. But don\'t worry, after ne episode her plot line is completely forgotten about and she never appears again. There\'s also a TV presenter woman who was looking for Quinther part way through the series whose life was saved by Quinther\'s father. This woman also gets completely forgotten about after her one episode, making her seem completely pointless.Speaking of pointless, the fact that Milinda is a princess of the Legitimate Knigdom (France in this world) serves NO POINT in the story at all. She is frequently placed in dangerous situations in battle with limited chance of survival, she has her body and eyes modified to make her an optimal Object pilot, she doesn\'t even pilot a particularly strong Object (actually she pilots one of the weakest ones in the entire series). What kind of stupid country would allow its freaking teenage princess to go on such dangerous excursions in outdated technology? It makes no sense!Oh, and speaking of makes no sense, there is a scene in which Quinther accidentally almost kills Milinda by tightening her automated harness to the point that it almst chokes her in the first episode, then doesn\'t even try to save her life, because he doesn\'t want to touch her boobs by accident. For crying out loud, this is you\'re freaking princess\'s life, you asshole. It makes even less sence when you consider that Quinther has no problem grabbing his own commanding officer\'s boobs later in the series, comments ""Wow, what a rack"" about Milinda when she falls on him once, and as we later learn he regularly watches pornography. You can\'t just portray someone as an ultra non-pervert, only to then change that suddenly to make him a pervert. For crying out loud, IS SOME CHARACTER CONSISTENCY TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR, even if it\'s of an unlikable character?Honestly I have about seven or eight more things wrong with this show in my head right now, from its dull soundtrack to its bizarre character motivations, but if you\'re really interested at this point then you are probably insane. This show is a sexist, uninspired, boring mediocrity that fails at action, fails at characterisation, fails at world-building, and just freaking fails. 2/10, not recommended.p.s. watch Knights and Magic, it does everything that this show tries to do only much better and with much more likable and interesting characters.', ""If you didn't want every female character in this show to die in the end, you watched it wrong; especially the princess character. The only character development worth a crap were the two they kept sending on missions. Those were the only ones that were at all tolerable, although, they did worship the personality-less  princess way too much.They could have done so much more developing this world with the tech and circumstances laid out in the beginning. Cool idea, bad writing.Skip this one. You won't miss much.Okay, I guess I have to write a longer review. I am not sure how...long, but there is not much more I can say about this anime.

It basically amounts to ""characters are given impossible task for absolutely no good reason, but then succeed over and over because the story is about them"". Honestly the plot armor of the main characters is thicker than that of the Objects the story is about.With that said, I\'m dropping this hot garbage with the gall to call itself entertainment. The *ONLY* thing that could possibly redeem this show is if the leads realize ""everyone in our country is a goddamn imbecile, lets defect to xyz"" and then they fight for them...against their former comrades. But then, that would actually be interesting, which would be against the producers goal to take a reasonable premise, piss on it, set it on fire, nuke it from orbit, and then salt the earth where it stood. against their former comrades.

I'll never believe that no single soul in the whole world didn't think about different tactics against objects and mc's solutions are unique.Second - this anime ruined the great and surprising relationship between Heavy and sidekick dude (I don't remember any other names). At the start it was clear that Heavy must be better because he's mc. Sidekik dude had little more physical training and weapon skills to compensate. But they were both... same. These two both were equally clumsy, had same interest...in girls. I thought that while Heavy would get object pilot girl, the sidekick guy would end up with commander girl. But nope. Heavy gets a freaking harem and the other dude enjoys humiliating second prize - random girl who is shown for a few seconds on screen with no significant relevance for the plot aside from one episode.

The lighting is accurate and fun, muzzle flashes and art form are good. Body art is not overdone.The audio quality for several versions I\'ve seen including a Blueray at a friends had issues with some explosions sounding clipped. Otherwise most of the sound quality and music is cookie-cutter to mildly enjoyable. The clipped overdone explosions hold it back, and the audo seems too good for real life scenes of scenarios with loud explosions and then casual voices that talk over background unrealistically in an otherwise realism focused show.Characters are fluent. a very late appearing primary antagonist limits the development of all characters.Highly enjoyable overall a must see for mecha lovers like me. Thankfully, delusions of grandeur from the Main characters getting settled in to defeating enemies NEVER set in, a good cliche that was avoided. extremely good perhaps the real reason to watch.

Each character is unique and interesting and I love watching all of them. Both the opening and ending are great. Myurin (Mullin) is so precious and his relationship with Beezlebub is very cute they're like schoolchildren. I can only hope it gets cuter as the couple(s) actually form. The character designs are fantastic and the color palette is so pleasing. I love the contrasting concept of hell and demons being fluffy, pastel, and kawaii. It is a great break from all the heavy shows out there and extremely enjoyable. "", 'Hell is always imagined to be a Dark, Dangerous place full of torturous, tormented filled with savage beings and creatures.Well you can throw all that imagination out of the window when you see what this anime beholds especially for an idea of the Underworld.The anime revolves around a Hell or rather a paradise looking hell  called Pandemonium which is the mix of a bit of ancient and modern age developed setting with the very high element of cuteness, moe and Fluffiness (Yes you heard me) .CharactersMeet our MC\'s Miss Beelzebub who is the supreme demon leader of the underworld who is a air...head, laid back adorable and a pretty teenage looking girl who\'s obsessed with cute things and food with her favorite word being ""MOFU MOFU"" (soft/Fluffy in Japanese description) and her personal assistant/guardian Myurin, who takes care of her persona work matters, makes sure she finishes her work instead of lazying around and is responsible most of the times. Also is a bit of  a  shy Tsundere in nature.Apart from this,there\'s also a special close relation between them which is lingering but is still developing. As Myurin really has admiration and respect for Beelzebub as the demon lord and his boss, but also likes her cute side and adores her secretly and is protective.Also Beelzebub is really dependent on myurin for her work and chores being a bit of a lazy,air head girl but also really values him and somewhere secretly also has a big soft spot for him, which is slowly developing into feelings.This adorable relationship between them keeps being developed with their respective characters throughout the series in a really cute, humorous and heartwarming way, almost like watching young innocent teenagers beginning to learn about love.Also there are relationship developments along with other side character couples too which are really interesting and pleasant to watch too.Besides the MC we have our Side characters who have great enjoyable personalities as well ,for example:Azazel , A manly ripped guy/Former Demon lord who is a bit shy and speaks using placards and secretly also loves Cute things.Berphegor a really sweet, cute shy girl who has big time anxiety talking to others except for beelzebub.Her anxiety means she shakes from fear almost constantly and also has a nervous bladder when she is really frightened and she dashes to the washroom several times a minute.Eurynome A big time Shotacon who\'s love for small boys grow no bounds and has a ability where she can imagine a Grown up guy in his small boy form which is really hilarious especially when she reacts to it.Azeroth another demon lord, who calls himself Beelzebub\'s Elder brother though not related who is a small time siscon, but loves to flirt around with other girls most of the time.Azeroth\'s assistant Sargatans who is has a sadist only towards him, and despite her calm appearance loves punishing Azeroth when he lazes around flirting with girls and punishes him more harshly with wrestling moves when he calls her Flat. Despite her violence she also enjoys cute things but prefers to keep her hobby a secret.Other good characters with interesting personalities are also present,which viewers will quite enjoy.This really simple plot with hell and demon/fallen angel references with these main and side characters with their unique and enjoyable personalities and antics with the element of comedy and cuteness overload and a good bit of romance make for a great relaxing and enjoyable series.Animation and Art.The Animation quality is top notch by LIDENFILMS, with their clear, but elegant and bright pastel color\'s and beautiful  & adorable creations which brings out the cuteness and lighthearted moments of the anime.Sound.The background music with the intro and outro are equally chill, calming & delightful to hear, along with a calm and enjoyable narration in between scenes.ConclusionA soothing and warm series, purely about the happy stuff, a real stress reliever, perfect for all those who are into this type of anime. I personally am and can\'t watch this show without smiling and giving a few laughs and just taking in the cuteness and heartwarming moments.Hope more viewers delve into this show to have a really good and enjoyable time.

Don't go into this thinking you're going to get a detailed story. Because you won't. It is more a story of will they/won't they and with events happening around it. In a fluffy and cute way.There are a few side characters which are lacking, but overall the characters are well written enough for what I expected.The music and sound effects are very fitting to the anime.If you like cute art, lovey dovey characters, feel good anime and pastel colours. Then...this is the anime for you! this is the anime for you!"", 'This series is very light and entertaining. In the beginning, I was not decided if watching the show because I thought it could be average. It is challenging trying to create a cute plot from demons. The first thing that came to my mind was a horned devil with a stick burning others or a bossy demon demanding attention. However, this series exceeded my expectations. The anime is adorable, delightful, tender, funny, and the most importantly it is enjoyable.The series can be considered a satire by some. However, for me, it is just a different vision from the purgatory and cannot be called a...parody. The tender atmosphere and the adorable characters are not to everyone’s taste.  For these reasons, it is common to see trashy scores, and this series is not an exception. Do not let that the rating changes your mind. If you like an adorable plot, with attractive and well-developed characters, then you must try “Beelzebub – jou no Okinimesu mama.”--The story--The story is developed in the hell. It is a cute and charming place instead of the classical hell from other stories where the putrid smell and the deadly atmosphere is around. This place is managed by Beelzebub, a known fallen angel in the demon tales. However, in this story, she is adorable, pretty and dynamic. Since she is hell’s governor, she needs assistants one of them is Myurin (aka Mullin) who helps her in the daily activities such as motivating her, updating the agenda, etc.   Also, we meet an acceptable number of characters with a different background. The plot focuses on the interaction between these characters, and they develop subplots that are tied together well. These characters have a unique role in the pandemonium. For example, Beelzebub and Myurin are in charge of the administration, Astaroth and Sargatanas oversee the finance department. Furthermore, it setups some comedic and romantic scenes that are pleasant to the eye. Lastly, we explore their daily experiences in the pandemonium in this tender slice of life story.Another important aspect is the pacing. The show manages good pacing between the main plot (relationship Beel and Myurin) and the subplots (the connection between Belphegor and Azazel).  All these stories affect the story and add some innocent tone to the outcome.--Characters—I want to praise the series because the character design and development is right, they are appealing. Each character is unique, original and during all the episodes they are dynamic and multidimensional because you can see a growth in their personalities and desires. The characters can be divided into couples depending on their romantic interests.Beelzebub is the pandemonium leader. She is very adorable and cute. She loves fluffy things, and she is a bit shy when Myurin is nearby, but she wants to get his attention.  However, she is a hard worker and is very powerful (just mentioned). I love her outfit design maybe it will be worth for a cosplay.Myurin, he is Beelzebub personal assistant. He has to support her, and he cares about his job and her boss. He worries too much when the work is not done and presses Beelzebub to do it. Deep inside, he is a bit shy and does not know how to approach Beelzebub more intimately.There are other characters such as Belphegor that cannot start a conversation with Azazel or the latter that cannot speak without a board. I cannot write about all the characters, but they have unique traits that complement the other characters and boost plot. All them are very enjoyable and pleasant to the eye.--Art and Sound—The animation is great. However, it is not for all the tastes because they are using a pastel palette and bright scenes with the purpose to highlight the beautiful and adorable traits from the characters and the plot itself. The camera angles cover the most relevant parts and help to boost the plot.The sound is elegant and soft. The director was not seeking to build up the plot with music, so it is more classical, ambient music that goes well with the show. About the OP conveys a charming and happy atmosphere; the ED is good and acceptable, but this season we have better and more catchy songs.--Enjoyment—The show propels the elegance and the surreal part of the hell. It is very different from the usual anime, and it is a plus. It is refreshing, and the plot has coherence. Honestly, I liked the series. It is pleasant and cute. The interaction between the characters is lovely and enjoyable.

Well, this is anything BUT that, and just from the title alone you would mistake for another entry in the Beelzebub series. Instead we get treated to a cast of characters that at best resemble more than just a moe series: characters that embody the naïve hidden love feelings that are mostly one-sided, but hopefully there will be more...than just the fantasy comedy feel to it. (Where\'s the ""Romance"" tag, MAL???)Beelzebub herself as a demon status, she seems at the top of the world, but in fact she loves everything that is fluffy, and her new assistant Myurin is one of the characters I at first quite didn\'t like due to his subversive nature, but eventually his character grew on me that he tries to make everything as smooth sailing for Beelzebub, while growing his feelings for her every single moment. For now the other cast of characters haven\'t had their moments to shine yet, but let\'s see at the end of the path.Art and animation is beautiful, reminiscent of how Liden Films were ONLY good at making Hanebado!\'s animation stand out, and so far it\'s very simplistic but it gets the job done. Sound-wise, it\'s good too, nothing stands out yet again, but it portrays the series as it is to a T.This season had so many hitters, but this series was fallen off to the wayside as the shovelware pile of Fall 2018.

You have been warned.In a hell where the fire and despair is replaced by both cuteness and fluffiness demons rather than engage in intrigue and plots instead struggle over matters of the heart and the feelings that they have towards others as they seek to improve themselves.Based off a popular manga of the same name Beelzebub Jou no Okinimesu Mama which is...better known by its English title of As Miss Beelzebub likes is a romance, comedy and fantasy anime that gives us the rare opportunity to see what will happen if Beelzebub once one of heavens strongest angels after being banished from heaven not only establishes her own domain that she uses to both house and allow angels who like her have taken the path of the demon to live and work out their lives for her but instead of making the land all dark, grim and fiery as other demons would have decided instead modernized it and replaced the dark colors with bright ones and replaced the grim and fatalistic aura with both fluffiness and cute and strong bonds of friendship that exist between the denizens of hell. The idea and concept of hell have always been a subject that interested me due largely to the many varied depictions of it that I have seen across all forms of popular media whether its light novels, manga or anime and video games and as a result I always thought that I seen everything that hell can become. However that changed when I saw the premise for Beelzebub as unlike standard depictions of hell Beelzebub can be said to have done the total opposite as it replaced much of the traditional trappings that hell usually had with concepts that may on first impressions seem out of place but over time prove to be concepts that work surprisingly well when they act in synergy with one another. This creative use of concepts that can be considered the opposite of what hell is usually depicted as and the effects that it had on it made quite the impression on me and was one of the main reasons why I decided to give this show a chance. While the first episode of the series did a great job of introducing the setting and the first of the cast I felt that it was a relatively weak episode that didn’t have the kind of impact that I would have hoped. However, despite this my interest into the series unique premise prompted me to continue on and I was glad to see that the following episodes were much better and that in the end, I managed to watch it to the very end.The overall story for the series follows the life of Beelzebub a powerful demon that despite possessing the power that can be said to allow her to stand on almost equal footing with the demon lord that would have ensured that she align herself with him instead elects to live in a life of peace where both she and the demons that resides within her domain can live their lives peacefully and learn to not just coexist with each other but forge bonds with each other and pass each day in both peace and comfort. The overall setting that Beelzebub makes use of as its main setting is Pandemonium a land that like the overall premise was switched to something that was more in line with the theme of peace and friendships rather than the threat of fiery death and the suffocating feel of despair that traditional hell would have made use off. The land of Pandemonium is a land that can be seen to resemble a fantasy version of a modern-day Japanese town whether in terms of layout and in the types of buildings that are present within the town. However, rather than featuring humans as the main occupants that will be ruled by demons as one would have expected Pandemonium is instead wholly the domain of the demons who instead of taking forms that would showcase the demon race instead take up the form of humans as they live their daily lives. While Beelzebub acts as the overall leader of the land of Pandemonium each of the high-ranking demons that act as her subordinates rather than taking domains of separate lands within the realm instead is assigned to manage one of the many departments that can be seen to perform functions that are vital to the continued smooth running of the land. Despite being reduced to become little more than civil servants I felt that Beelzebub’s restructuring of the higher command echelons of the demon hierarchy was pretty creative as even though there may not be fighting to defend their domain with cunning and spear as department heads they are still fulfilling their role as both leaders of the demons and their liege’s advisors by trading their cunning and skill at arms with honesty and the act of working hard to ensure that the demons that live alongside them can live in relative peace something that I thought resonated well with the series main theme.Joining Beelzebub in this fun and fluffy adventure of maintaining peace within the land of pandemonium while trying to encourage the forging of bonds between demons and make life that much more enjoyable for everyone is a host of characters whose unique personality quirks and struggles to fulfill their liege’s earnest desires all serve to make this tale an amusing one from start to end. These include the serious and dutiful Mullin, the laid back but surprisingly perceptive Astaroth, the cold but surprisingly cute Sargatanas, the quiet but determined Belphegor and the quiet but surprisingly friendly Azazel. Together Beelzebub and her fellow demons in their desire to live their lives in peace and comfort and bond with their fellow subordinates would not just learn to understand themselves more but also come to realize that their subordinates also have a hidden side to them that they work hard to keep hidden from their bosses. In this desire to not just live in a land of peace but also find enjoyment in learning about the hidden natures that are seemingly hidden from them what kind of hilarity would they find and how would these change the nature of bosses and the nature of the relationship that exists between them and their dear subordinates.BeelzebubBeelzebub portrayed by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Comic Girls and Food Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series.  A powerful demon and the ruler of the realm of Pandemonium Beelzebub due largely to the fear and respect that comes from her reputation as being one of the greater demons within the demon hierarchy is often seen by many as someone that’s wise, cool and someone that had a lot of integrity that benefited someone of that rank. In actuality however, things are rather different. From her initial appearances, Beelzebub can be seen to be someone that is carefree, innocent and positive by nature that while kind and hardworking is also seen to be somewhat ditsy in nature with this being shown well in her love of fluffy things and her tendency to mix the less important matters with the important ones. Despite her role as being the overall leader of the realm of Pandemonium Beelzebub rather than being shown to display traits of arrogance and overconfidence that is typically expected of such characters instead is shown to be someone that is polite, caring and playful by nature and rather than treating her subordinates and friends with scorn instead treats them with courtesy, care and loyalty. While often seen as ditsy by her closest friends it can be seen that despite this Beelzebub is someone that is perceptive and understanding by nature and while her insights into specific subjects may be simple at times she can often provide some surprisingly perceptive advice that is able to get to the very heart of a problem that is troubling either her or her friends that hint at the level of perception that she can call upon. Despite her ditsy nature however, it can be seen that Beelzebub can get serious at times and able to project an attitude that is more benefitting of her role as a demon lord. However, this can also be said to be somewhat of a double-edged sword as this while giving her an extra dose of confidence also reveals the somewhat fragile side of her inner self to others a side that is easily hurt if people treat her coldly or she is misunderstood by others. This side of her personality I thought was an interesting one that while resonating well with the series main theme of friendship and bonds also shows that despite being at the peak of the power structure of the realm Beelzebub is someone that still has feelings and insecurities as well.As the series goes on and Beelzebub’s character is expanded upon her personality gradually begins to change. Despite being seen as a greater demon that would be seen by others as being a being that would be capable of doing any type of job it can be seen quite surprisingly that Beelzebub is someone that is seen to have very little knowledge of how things work in the world and indeed seems to lack any sort of practical knowledge that most demons would have possessed. This is shown well during her attempt to take care of her aide Mullin when he was bedridden in which she showed that rather amusingly she not only lacked any sort of cooking skills but also basic food knowledge skills as well something that I felt was not just amusing but pointed at the fact that even greater demons have things they cannot do. While a diligent and hardworking person by nature it can be seen quite amusingly that Beelzebub is someone that has a curiously short attention span and is someone that can easily get distracted by food and as a result requires constant breaks to allow her to recharge. However, while this can be seen as a disadvantage it can also be seen as the opposite as well as once her appetite has been sated Beelzebub can revert back to her usual queen like role that’s not just more focused but also one that projects a sense of confidence and professionalism that’s more benefitting of a leader than her usual ditsy look. At the beginning of the series largely due to the position that she held Beelzebub was someone that kept a careful distance from not just her friends but also from her staff as well due to a desire to keep things professional between her and her advisors and avoid any instances of favoritism among the government. This is shown especially well in the initial relationship that existed between Beelzebub and her aide Mullin. However, while this approach of hers was seen to be effective it also created within her a sense of disconnect between her and Mullin in which besides duties and knowledge that are needed for work, she knew next to nothing about him or the other staffers something that only dawned on her when she sought advice from her friends. While it can be seen to be a protective mechanism of sorts that would stop people from hating her from prying this sense of disconnect also prevented others from trying to know the real you and allow them to better anticipate your needs that would have enhanced the effectiveness of their duties. As a result of this misunderstanding and the revelation that rather than protecting and allowing others to work more effectively she was in fact hindering them Beelzebub’s attitude towards friendship and bonds started to gradually change. Rather than trying to limit the number of interactions that she has with her friends and allies and try to maintain a working relationship with them as she did in the past Beelzebub in the aftermath began to try to not just bond with her allies emotionally but also get to know them on a personal level as friends as well. While allowing her allies to get a better feel on the feelings and moods of their liege this change in attitude in Beelzebub also served well to show the kind of determination that she had developed to enable her to get closer to those that she cares about and be of some use to them in their time of need. The character of Beelzebub I felt was an interesting character whose ditsy and innocent surface personality contrasted well with the focused, serious and queen like nature that she adapts when she’s in that mode. Her gradual development from someone that largely hid her true self from others in a desire to protect herself from harm at the cost of knowing next to nothing about her allies to someone that was not just determined to forge bonds with others but to know them on a personal level when combined with her desire to improve her own skills and knowledge of the world around her I felt was well done and pretty heartwarming to see.MullinMullin portrayed by new voice actor Rikuya Yasuda is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A male demon resident of Pandemonium and the head attendant of the hell realm that assists his liege Beelzebub in her duties Mullin can be said to be at the heart of the command echelons that manage the daily lives of the inhabitants of Pandemonium. However rather than show the kind of arrogance and overbearing superiority that many in his role would no doubt show Mullin instead is shown to be the entire opposite instead. From initial appearances it can be seen that while Mullin can be seen to be a serious, dutiful and responsible person by nature that understands the prestige and responsibility that the role represents within the hierarchy he does not let this fame get to him and cause him to develop any form of arrogance that most would expect of people with such a high role. Indeed, to his credit, Mullin not only resists such temptations but instead fulfills his role with both honor and integrity as while easily nervous Mullin is someone that is able to not just suppress that fear but also show both kindness and care to everyone that he meets regardless of the rank that they have. While shown to be a serious person that approached his job with due reverence it can be seen that Mullin is also someone that was not just perceptive to the needs of his liege but also surprisingly attentive and understanding of the moods that she goes through as well which shows not just his skills as an aide but also the care that he applies to his duties as well. However, while certainly attentive to the needs of his liege it can be seen that Mullin was someone that found it hard to express his true thoughts on matters instead preferring to simply bury them within him. Due largely to his caring and kind nature Mullin was someone that had little trouble in making friends and forging friendships and as a result, he was someone that was seen to enjoy a high amount of trust by both his fellow staffers and the many demon lords that lived within the realm. However, this can also be said to be a double-edged sword as well as it means that when trouble shows up that cannot be dealt with easily his is the first name that would be sought when that happens much to his dismay. At the beginning of the series while shown to have a healthy amount of respect for his liege Mullin was shown to have a seemingly complicated relationship with her. While not enjoying the fact that her actions often had the effect of keeping him on his toes, he nonetheless had a great deal of respect for her and was shown to care about her a great deal as shown when he scolded those that berated her despite his quiet nature.As the series goes on however and his personality is expanded upon Mullin’s personality gradually starts to change. In the beginning of the series as noted previously, Mullin had a rather complicated relationship with his liege that arose mainly from the fact that the true image of his lord was a direct contrast to the version of her that he had seen in the past. Indeed, it can be seen that the effect of this revelation was harder on Mullin because his impression of the version that he saw in the past was what can be said to be his main source of motivation for working in the government as an aide in the first place. As a result of this shattering of his ideal image of his lord Mullin while still very much loyal to her was seen to treat his liege with a degree of wariness and caution as if lamenting the fact that his ideal image of his lord was nothing more than a dream. However, as the series goes on and Mullin gets to both interact with and understand his liege as a person this sense of wariness that he has towards her starts to gradually vanish. While initially taking issue with Beelzebub’s seemingly laid-back nature and the fact that she has a very short attention span as the series went on and Mullin had the opportunity to not just know her as both a person and a ruler Mullin began to realize that while Beelzebub may appear to be ditzy and unreliable on the surface and that she may have a rather short attention span beneath this she is also someone that’s not just kind to everyone that she meets but also approaches each situation calmly trying to divine the best routes that can please not just her and the government but also all of their charges as well. As a result of this realization, Mullin not only realized just how difficult the role of a ruler is but also of just how much Beelzebub herself cares about not just the peace that reigns in the realm but also how much she cares about the well being of her charges. While she can certainly appear to be ditsy and unfocused on the surface beneath this is indeed someone that is determined to do the very best for her people. While still bothered to some degree by Beelzebub’s nature Mullin’s attitude towards his liege gradually starts to soften as he while redoubling his efforts to try and support her in her duties as a ruler also starts to take great care in trying to both understand the feelings that she has towards her various duties but at the same time reinforce any weaknesses that she may have in them as well. While generally maintaining his standard responsible personality trait Mullin as a result of seeing the strain that his liege puts herself under also starts to gradually realize that breaks and relaxation are just as important as being diligent at your job something that I felt contrasted well with his default uptight personality and was a development that I thought was well done. The character of Mullin I felt was an interesting one whose development from a kind, caring but uptight person who hid his true feelings to one that was not just attentive but also openly conscious of the feelings and struggles that are being experienced by others I felt was well done. This development I felt was reflected well in the increased character chemistry that gradually began to form between Mullin and Beelzebub as the bond between the two deepened.AstarothAstaroth portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of Sword Art Online and Food wars fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s allies within the series. A former angel and now a powerful demon that resides within Pandemonium that serves as the realms finance chief Astaroth on initial appearances is seen to be a positive, optimistic and confident person by nature that approaches each day with a smile on his face. A friendly, kind and caring person by nature Astaroth on the surface can be seen to be akin to a playboy which while fitting as a demon lord also serves to make the professional lives of his subordinates a constant struggle as Astaroth true to his playboy persona is someone that is never there when work needs to be done. True to his playboy type persona Astaroth was someone that was not just laid back but also had a nasty habit of not just making poor statements but also come up with random ideas that have the sketchiest of reasons for their implementation. A classic example of such an idea within the series is the bathhouse that Astaroth had built in lieu of the health center that was supposed to have been built. Despite this nature of his that caused many to view him as a fool, it can be seen rather surprisingly that beneath this nature of his Astaroth is someone that is surprisingly perceptive and is able to easily notice when someone’s feelings are out of sync with their usual self. At the same time while noted to be someone that was friendly and caring towards all it can be seen that to a degree that Astaroth is someone that cares deeply about his friends and would try to understand the core issues that are causing them the problems that they are suffering in an effort to help them. This aspect is best shown in the strong bond that he has with Beelzebub and his attempts to help her solve the doubts that she had about her bond with Mullin.While largely retaining the core personality traits that define him as the series goes on and as Astaroth was able to witness first hand how much Beelzebub’s personality has changed as a result of her increasing bond with her aide Mullin Astaroth began to realize that while his current lifestyle of being a playboy was a fun one he was not actually doing much to help his fellow demons unlike his fellow department heads. Indeed, despite being a powerful demon Astaroth in his desire to avoid hard work and responsibility was not just putting a lot of strain on his subordinates but also causing them endless trouble. More importantly, he was also causing trouble for his liege and friend Beelzebub something that he began to realize he had to change. As a result of this revelation Astaroth while not changing much in terms of personality began to take steps to not just improve himself but also make himself more useful to his liege as well. At the same time he also began to realize that despite always slacking off when work is needed to be finished and despite always coming up with ideas that almost always end up failing spectacularly his subordinates  have not just endured this but also worked hard to not just undo the damage but also keep him on track with his duties something that he is shown to be genuinely grateful for and within the series is shown well in the heartfelt thanks that he expresses to his aide Sargatanas. The character of Astaroth I felt was an interesting character that while often used as the series main source of comic relief also proved to be a character that had some interesting development that did well to show that beneath his playboy nature Astaroth was also someone that was not just perceptive but cared deeply about his friends as well. Seeing Astaroth witness the many changes that his liege and friend Beelzebub goes through as she opens up to her aide and the realization that perhaps its time to change his own life as well, I felt was an interesting development of his character that resonated well with the theme that opening up your true self to others is what will enable you to change and improve your life.SargatanasSargatanas portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk Wars and Clockwork Planet fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s allies within the series. A female demon that possesses an icy and forbidding aura about her Sargatanas on initial appearances is seen to be a dutiful, serious and direct person by nature that approaches her role within the hierarchy of Pandemonium with due reverence and professionalism. An honest, cool and collected person by nature Sargatanas serves as chief aide to the head of the finance department Astaroth and due largely due to the laid-back nature of her boss as well as his tendency to skip work and have fun elsewhere is often seen as the shadow head of the said department. While seen to be an effective aide to him due to her professionalism and hard-working nature Sargatanas is also seen as an effective counter to his antics and indeed can be said to be the one person that is able to keep him on track. Despite Sargatanas being an aide, it can be seen rather amusingly that she has no qualms with either physically restraining him or using violence on him to force him to get back to work something that I felt represented well the kind of relationship that existed between the two. Though widely seen as being serious, intelligent and overly loyal to her role as an aide it can be seen that Sargatanas outside of her intimidating nature is also someone that’s intelligent, level-headed and someone that has great foresight. These latter traits while often hard to see by those that don’t know her very well show that beneath her icy and intimidating aura Sargatanas was someone that was not just reliable to her friends and superiors but at the same time can be counted upon to keep the wild antics of her esteemed boss under a tight leash.As the series goes on however it can be seen that while Sargatanas may be a strict and stern person that isn’t afraid of using both intimidation and violence to make her boss repent for his actions that beneath this she also has a softer side to her personality as well. Unlike her default personality in which she is shown to be both icy and intimidating this softer side to her personality can be said to be akin to her true girly self that she tries hard to conceal from others. In this side of her personality rather than show disdain towards things that can be said to be girly such as cute accessories and toys as she would have done so in her default self it can be seen that instead of doing so, she instead displays a surprising sense of adoration towards them that seems out of place for her considering her reputation among Pandemonium. At the same time while showing adoration towards items that can be seen to be cute Sargatanas also displays an interesting sensitivity towards the types of positive feelings that comes from seeing couples enjoy their time together. While seen to be something of an offshoot to her default personality it can be said that this alt personality of hers is something that can be said to be the true face of the character of Sargatanas as while reflecting well on the types of positive feelings that she feels at seeing cute items this personality of hers also served well to show the kind of struggles that she has in balancing her role as a serious and dutiful aide who tries hard to keep her boss in check by any means necessary. The character of Sargatanas I felt was an interesting character that while initially seen to be someone that was cold, direct and not above using force to restrain her boss swiftly developed to not just become a more effective character but also one that had much more emotional depth to her. The contrasting personality’s that exist within Sargatanas I felt was an interesting idea as while her default cold and intimidating personality may be seen by many to be her true self it can be seen that this personality while still representing her effectively within the realm is nothing more than a mask that came out of her desire to not just be effective at her role as an aide but also in helping conceal her true inner self that would cause her great amounts of stress if revealed. Despite being used as nothing but a mask I felt that Sargatanas’s default personality also did well to create a synergy effect with her boss Astaroth as while the two of them are often in direct opposition to each other their personalities I felt matched and complemented each other well despite this and ensured that each of their interactions were equally amusing to see.BelphegorBelphegor portrayed by veteran seiyuu Misaki Kuno of Myriad Colors Phantom World and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s main allies within the series. A former principality of heaven and now a demon that lives within the realm of Pandemonium Belphegor who has been nicknamed Gocchin by her liege is seen from her initial appearances to be a quiet and nervous person that’s easily rattled by the simplest of things. As a result of the social anxiety that’s been plaguing her for some time Belphegor while noted to be a powerful demon is someone that can be seen to have very low self confidence in herself and as a result while not lacking in people who are willing to help her and be friends with her actively tries to avoid such entanglements by fleeing. This unfortunate consequence of her actions however ensured that while often seen as cute by others she was someone that was visually impossible to approach normally. As a result of this seemingly unfortunate personality trait of hers, it's perhaps unsurprising that Belphegor is someone that is not just cautious by nature but also someone that trusts and warms up to others slowly. However, while slow to trust to others it can be seen that Belphegor’s attitude to those that she had truly bonded with is markedly different to her default attitude. Instead of her usual hesitant and nervous attitude that can be said to be her defining trait Belphegor to those that she trusts is shown to be a friendly, caring and considerate person that while understanding the limits to what she can do tries hard to provide advice to her friends whenever she can. This is best shown in her attempts to help Beelzebub try to understand the developing feelings that she has developed for her aide. As the series goes on Belphegor’s personality largely due to her crush on her fellow demon Azazel starts to gradually change. While still retaining her quiet and friendly nature Belphegor as the series goes on gradually begins to make an attempt to not just overcome her meekness and her desire to flee at the moment someone tries to get close to her but at the same time try to gradually open her heart to others and make the feelings that she hides inside them much more visible to not just her friends but also to the person that she loves.AzazelAzazel portrayed by veteran voice actor Satoshi Hino of Boruto and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s main allies within the series. A former member of the Cherub’s and now a demon that lives within the realm of Pandemonium Azazel from initial appearances is seen to be an intelligent, kind and perceptive person by nature that despite his muscular appearance is seen to be someone that is the total opposite of what that appearance represents being both friendly and sociable instead of intimidating and brash as his size would have suggested. While shown to be an intelligent and kind person Azazel is also someone that is noted to be both understanding and considerate of the feelings of others and is always ready to help those that are in need. However, despite his friendly and kind nature it can be seen that Azazel also has somewhat of a complex with his physical appearance as to him while doing well to intimate the occasional troublemaker that he may encounter as part of his job as a watcher this also had the unfortunate effect of causing other people to be in fear of him as well. As a result of this despite the positive and friendly nature that he shows to others, it can be seen that he is not just nervous and quiet but also lonely as well. Due to this, it's perhaps unsurprising that Azazel would as a result treat each of the friends that he has managed to make with both care and consideration and try to help them solve each of the problems that ail them. This is best shown within the series in his attempt to try and understand the problems that Sargatanas had with her problem of being seen as cute by others a problem that unknown to her he also suffers from. In addition to Azazel’s skill at needlework as well as his adoration of cute things one of the more prominent traits that can be said to define Azazel as a character is the fact that he relies entirely on text boards in order to communicate with others in the course of his life something that I felt was quite interesting as while making him stand out somewhat it also showed the depth to which his problem with nervousness has reached within him.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the animation that was used within the series was both bright and clear and made great use of the more positive and cute colors that are within the color spectrum. These I felt not only enhanced the animation itself but also allow it to better show the cute and fluffy nature of the character animations for the series. Setting wise I felt that the bright colors and the unique animation style that was used within the series also did well to show the fuse of modern day and fantasy settings that the series made use of as its main setting by featuring locations and elements that are unique to both settings. While doing well in enhancing the character animations I also felt that these bright colors and style also did well to show the visualization of the various dreams that Beelzebub has within the series. While cute these I felt also featured a surprising variety among their ranks as well. In terms of character designs I felt that the character designs for the series was pretty well done with the uniforms that are own by the cast being a notable aspect as while they were relatively simple I felt that it gave the demons a sense of solidity with each other and at the same time a sense of role within the realm of Pandemonium which contrasts with the traditional depictions of hell that often shows demons as having no established roles within the realm.In terms of music the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Pink Lemonade that was performed by Sangatsu no Phantasia and Akumade Koi Wazurai that was performed by the seiyuu’s of Beelzebub, Belphegor and Sargatanas which was Saori Oonishi, Misaki Kuno and Ai Kakuma respectively. Both of these songs I felt were really catchy and at the same time were cute ones that resonated well with the series main theme of cuteness and the forging of friendships. The series OST I felt while doing an excellent job at providing backing music to the many amusing situations that the cast encounter over the series also had the effect of providing a sense of relaxation to the viewer as well. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Saori Oonishi, Rikuya Yasuda, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Ai Kakuma, Misaki Kuno and Satoshi Hino all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Beelzebub, Mullin, Astaroth, Sargatanas, Belphegor and Azazel respectively. In addition, while I didn’t cover them within this review, I also felt that Aoi Yuuki, Chinatsu Akasaki, Aya Suzaki and Kikuko Inoue also did an excellent job in portraying the support characters of Dantalion, Eurynome, Morrigan and the series narrator respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Beelzebub Jou No Okinimesu Mama was an anime that I really enjoyed and while reception on MAL seems to be rather mixed, I believe that it’s definitely one of the best animes of this season. In my opinion, I believe that its main strong points are its unique premise, entertaining story, well designed and developed characters, creative dream sequences, cute bonding moments and excellent voice acting.The overall premise of the series I felt was definitely one of the series main highlights. While hell has always existed within the realm of media in some form or another most of these tended to show it in a more traditional sense which is a fiery wasteland that has a depressing and oppressing atmosphere about it. While these aspects certainly do represent well an area where purported sinners were to descend to after their death, I felt that this aspect had started to become overused due to the lack of change in its depiction.  As a result of this when I saw the core premise that Beelzebub was making use of, I have to say I was quite intrigued as rather than making use of the traditional depictions Beelzebub not only made use of an entirely new concept but also one that radically changed the concept of hell within the series. Here instead of the fiery wasteland that has become the standard for hell Pandemonium as hell is now referred to as is instead a land that’s filled with not just color but also with cuteness. Complementing well this concept of introducing color and cuteness to the concept of hell was the fact that in this setting as a result of fusing a modern-day Japan with a fantasy setting the powerful demons that would have been akin to demon lords within hell have been transformed into becoming members of a government and acting as department heads. This act of converting powerful demon lords into humans I felt was an interesting concept as it allowed us to not only see what powerful demons would look like if their base personality traits that they had as demons were given human form but also what will happen if they were to both learn off and make use of human-like emotions in their everyday lives. These concepts when paired with the new hell that emphasized positivity and the bonds that it symbolized, I felt took great advantage of the series core themes of friendships, bonds, love and the act of enjoying the peace that reigns.The overall story that took great advantage of this premise I felt was also one aspect of the series that I enjoyed. While the overall premise had the effect of giving the demons of hell not just a human form but also the ability to not just understand the types of positive feelings and emotions that humans would I was curious to see the kind of effects that this would actually have within the demon’s daily lives as they set about fulfilling their assigned roles within the realm of Pandemonium. While the bond between Beelzebub and Mullin serves as the focal point within the series overall story, I felt that the series also took great care to ensure that each of the demons within the series whether they were main ones or support ones within the setting were not just expanded upon but also paired well with their destined other half within the series. This within the series is shown well in the many bonding moments within the series that was not just sweet to see but also, I felt was also developed really well. These bonding moments between the various characters within the series while sweet to see also I felt featured a great variety in them as well as while taking advantage of the base personalities of each demon these moments also took great advantage of the many hidden personal struggles that each of the characters had hidden within them. While these served to make the bonding moments nice to see I felt that they also served to make each moment and the process that goes with it that much heartwarming as the pairs were both able to not just connect with each other but also understand each other on a deeper more emotional level.Overall Beelzebub was an anime that I really enjoyed that managed to not only introduce a relatively new and fun version of hell but also pair that with a sweet and heartwarming story that made use of concepts that can be said to be the total opposite of what hell should stand for. While I enjoyed the overall story, I felt that not all of the characters were used to their full potential with the characters of Dantalion and Eurynome being good examples of this. In terms of final score, I would say that Beelzebub deserves a final score of 9/10. This series is undoubtedly one of the hidden gems of this season that I hope this review would help draw attention too. better known by its English title of As Miss Beelzebub likes is a romance, comedy and fantasy anime that gives us the rare opportunity to see what will happen if Beelzebub once one of heavens strongest angels after being banished from heaven not only establishes her own domain that she uses to both house and allow angels who like her have taken the path of the demon to live and work out their lives for her but instead of making the land all dark, grim and fiery as other demons would have decided instead modernized it and replaced the dark colors with bright ones and replaced the grim and fatalistic aura with both fluffiness and cute and strong bonds of friendship that exist between the denizens of hell. The idea and concept of hell have always been a subject that interested me due largely to the many varied depictions of it that I have seen across all forms of popular media whether its light novels, manga or anime and video games and as a result I always thought that I seen everything that hell can become. However that changed when I saw the premise for Beelzebub as unlike standard depictions of hell Beelzebub can be said to have done the total opposite as it replaced much of the traditional trappings that hell usually had with concepts that may on first impressions seem out of place but over time prove to be concepts that work surprisingly well when they act in synergy with one another. This creative use of concepts that can be considered the opposite of what hell is usually depicted as and the effects that it had on it made quite the impression on me and was one of the main reasons why I decided to give this show a chance. While the first episode of the series did a great job of introducing the setting and the first of the cast I felt that it was a relatively weak episode that didn’t have the kind of impact that I would have hoped. However, despite this my interest into the series unique premise prompted me to continue on and I was glad to see that the following episodes were much better and that in the end, I managed to watch it to the very end.The overall story for the series follows the life of Beelzebub a powerful demon that despite possessing the power that can be said to allow her to stand on almost equal footing with the demon lord that would have ensured that she align herself with him instead elects to live in a life of peace where both she and the demons that resides within her domain can live their lives peacefully and learn to not just coexist with each other but forge bonds with each other and pass each day in both peace and comfort. The overall setting that Beelzebub makes use of as its main setting is Pandemonium a land that like the overall premise was switched to something that was more in line with the theme of peace and friendships rather than the threat of fiery death and the suffocating feel of despair that traditional hell would have made use off. The land of Pandemonium is a land that can be seen to resemble a fantasy version of a modern-day Japanese town whether in terms of layout and in the types of buildings that are present within the town. However, rather than featuring humans as the main occupants that will be ruled by demons as one would have expected Pandemonium is instead wholly the domain of the demons who instead of taking forms that would showcase the demon race instead take up the form of humans as they live their daily lives. While Beelzebub acts as the overall leader of the land of Pandemonium each of the high-ranking demons that act as her subordinates rather than taking domains of separate lands within the realm instead is assigned to manage one of the many departments that can be seen to perform functions that are vital to the continued smooth running of the land. Despite being reduced to become little more than civil servants I felt that Beelzebub’s restructuring of the higher command echelons of the demon hierarchy was pretty creative as even though there may not be fighting to defend their domain with cunning and spear as department heads they are still fulfilling their role as both leaders of the demons and their liege’s advisors by trading their cunning and skill at arms with honesty and the act of working hard to ensure that the demons that live alongside them can live in relative peace something that I thought resonated well with the series main theme.Joining Beelzebub in this fun and fluffy adventure of maintaining peace within the land of pandemonium while trying to encourage the forging of bonds between demons and make life that much more enjoyable for everyone is a host of characters whose unique personality quirks and struggles to fulfill their liege’s earnest desires all serve to make this tale an amusing one from start to end. These include the serious and dutiful Mullin, the laid back but surprisingly perceptive Astaroth, the cold but surprisingly cute Sargatanas, the quiet but determined Belphegor and the quiet but surprisingly friendly Azazel. Together Beelzebub and her fellow demons in their desire to live their lives in peace and comfort and bond with their fellow subordinates would not just learn to understand themselves more but also come to realize that their subordinates also have a hidden side to them that they work hard to keep hidden from their bosses. In this desire to not just live in a land of peace but also find enjoyment in learning about the hidden natures that are seemingly hidden from them what kind of hilarity would they find and how would these change the nature of bosses and the nature of the relationship that exists between them and their dear subordinates.BeelzebubBeelzebub portrayed by veteran seiyuu Saori Oonishi of Comic Girls and Food Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main heroine of the series.  A powerful demon and the ruler of the realm of Pandemonium Beelzebub due largely to the fear and respect that comes from her reputation as being one of the greater demons within the demon hierarchy is often seen by many as someone that’s wise, cool and someone that had a lot of integrity that benefited someone of that rank. In actuality however, things are rather different. From her initial appearances, Beelzebub can be seen to be someone that is carefree, innocent and positive by nature that while kind and hardworking is also seen to be somewhat ditsy in nature with this being shown well in her love of fluffy things and her tendency to mix the less important matters with the important ones. Despite her role as being the overall leader of the realm of Pandemonium Beelzebub rather than being shown to display traits of arrogance and overconfidence that is typically expected of such characters instead is shown to be someone that is polite, caring and playful by nature and rather than treating her subordinates and friends with scorn instead treats them with courtesy, care and loyalty. While often seen as ditsy by her closest friends it can be seen that despite this Beelzebub is someone that is perceptive and understanding by nature and while her insights into specific subjects may be simple at times she can often provide some surprisingly perceptive advice that is able to get to the very heart of a problem that is troubling either her or her friends that hint at the level of perception that she can call upon. Despite her ditsy nature however, it can be seen that Beelzebub can get serious at times and able to project an attitude that is more benefitting of her role as a demon lord. However, this can also be said to be somewhat of a double-edged sword as this while giving her an extra dose of confidence also reveals the somewhat fragile side of her inner self to others a side that is easily hurt if people treat her coldly or she is misunderstood by others. This side of her personality I thought was an interesting one that while resonating well with the series main theme of friendship and bonds also shows that despite being at the peak of the power structure of the realm Beelzebub is someone that still has feelings and insecurities as well.As the series goes on and Beelzebub’s character is expanded upon her personality gradually begins to change. Despite being seen as a greater demon that would be seen by others as being a being that would be capable of doing any type of job it can be seen quite surprisingly that Beelzebub is someone that is seen to have very little knowledge of how things work in the world and indeed seems to lack any sort of practical knowledge that most demons would have possessed. This is shown well during her attempt to take care of her aide Mullin when he was bedridden in which she showed that rather amusingly she not only lacked any sort of cooking skills but also basic food knowledge skills as well something that I felt was not just amusing but pointed at the fact that even greater demons have things they cannot do. While a diligent and hardworking person by nature it can be seen quite amusingly that Beelzebub is someone that has a curiously short attention span and is someone that can easily get distracted by food and as a result requires constant breaks to allow her to recharge. However, while this can be seen as a disadvantage it can also be seen as the opposite as well as once her appetite has been sated Beelzebub can revert back to her usual queen like role that’s not just more focused but also one that projects a sense of confidence and professionalism that’s more benefitting of a leader than her usual ditsy look. At the beginning of the series largely due to the position that she held Beelzebub was someone that kept a careful distance from not just her friends but also from her staff as well due to a desire to keep things professional between her and her advisors and avoid any instances of favoritism among the government. This is shown especially well in the initial relationship that existed between Beelzebub and her aide Mullin. However, while this approach of hers was seen to be effective it also created within her a sense of disconnect between her and Mullin in which besides duties and knowledge that are needed for work, she knew next to nothing about him or the other staffers something that only dawned on her when she sought advice from her friends. While it can be seen to be a protective mechanism of sorts that would stop people from hating her from prying this sense of disconnect also prevented others from trying to know the real you and allow them to better anticipate your needs that would have enhanced the effectiveness of their duties. As a result of this misunderstanding and the revelation that rather than protecting and allowing others to work more effectively she was in fact hindering them Beelzebub’s attitude towards friendship and bonds started to gradually change. Rather than trying to limit the number of interactions that she has with her friends and allies and try to maintain a working relationship with them as she did in the past Beelzebub in the aftermath began to try to not just bond with her allies emotionally but also get to know them on a personal level as friends as well. While allowing her allies to get a better feel on the feelings and moods of their liege this change in attitude in Beelzebub also served well to show the kind of determination that she had developed to enable her to get closer to those that she cares about and be of some use to them in their time of need. The character of Beelzebub I felt was an interesting character whose ditsy and innocent surface personality contrasted well with the focused, serious and queen like nature that she adapts when she’s in that mode. Her gradual development from someone that largely hid her true self from others in a desire to protect herself from harm at the cost of knowing next to nothing about her allies to someone that was not just determined to forge bonds with others but to know them on a personal level when combined with her desire to improve her own skills and knowledge of the world around her I felt was well done and pretty heartwarming to see.MullinMullin portrayed by new voice actor Rikuya Yasuda is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A male demon resident of Pandemonium and the head attendant of the hell realm that assists his liege Beelzebub in her duties Mullin can be said to be at the heart of the command echelons that manage the daily lives of the inhabitants of Pandemonium. However rather than show the kind of arrogance and overbearing superiority that many in his role would no doubt show Mullin instead is shown to be the entire opposite instead. From initial appearances it can be seen that while Mullin can be seen to be a serious, dutiful and responsible person by nature that understands the prestige and responsibility that the role represents within the hierarchy he does not let this fame get to him and cause him to develop any form of arrogance that most would expect of people with such a high role. Indeed, to his credit, Mullin not only resists such temptations but instead fulfills his role with both honor and integrity as while easily nervous Mullin is someone that is able to not just suppress that fear but also show both kindness and care to everyone that he meets regardless of the rank that they have. While shown to be a serious person that approached his job with due reverence it can be seen that Mullin is also someone that was not just perceptive to the needs of his liege but also surprisingly attentive and understanding of the moods that she goes through as well which shows not just his skills as an aide but also the care that he applies to his duties as well. However, while certainly attentive to the needs of his liege it can be seen that Mullin was someone that found it hard to express his true thoughts on matters instead preferring to simply bury them within him. Due largely to his caring and kind nature Mullin was someone that had little trouble in making friends and forging friendships and as a result, he was someone that was seen to enjoy a high amount of trust by both his fellow staffers and the many demon lords that lived within the realm. However, this can also be said to be a double-edged sword as well as it means that when trouble shows up that cannot be dealt with easily his is the first name that would be sought when that happens much to his dismay. At the beginning of the series while shown to have a healthy amount of respect for his liege Mullin was shown to have a seemingly complicated relationship with her. While not enjoying the fact that her actions often had the effect of keeping him on his toes, he nonetheless had a great deal of respect for her and was shown to care about her a great deal as shown when he scolded those that berated her despite his quiet nature.As the series goes on however and his personality is expanded upon Mullin’s personality gradually starts to change. In the beginning of the series as noted previously, Mullin had a rather complicated relationship with his liege that arose mainly from the fact that the true image of his lord was a direct contrast to the version of her that he had seen in the past. Indeed, it can be seen that the effect of this revelation was harder on Mullin because his impression of the version that he saw in the past was what can be said to be his main source of motivation for working in the government as an aide in the first place. As a result of this shattering of his ideal image of his lord Mullin while still very much loyal to her was seen to treat his liege with a degree of wariness and caution as if lamenting the fact that his ideal image of his lord was nothing more than a dream. However, as the series goes on and Mullin gets to both interact with and understand his liege as a person this sense of wariness that he has towards her starts to gradually vanish. While initially taking issue with Beelzebub’s seemingly laid-back nature and the fact that she has a very short attention span as the series went on and Mullin had the opportunity to not just know her as both a person and a ruler Mullin began to realize that while Beelzebub may appear to be ditzy and unreliable on the surface and that she may have a rather short attention span beneath this she is also someone that’s not just kind to everyone that she meets but also approaches each situation calmly trying to divine the best routes that can please not just her and the government but also all of their charges as well. As a result of this realization, Mullin not only realized just how difficult the role of a ruler is but also of just how much Beelzebub herself cares about not just the peace that reigns in the realm but also how much she cares about the well being of her charges. While she can certainly appear to be ditsy and unfocused on the surface beneath this is indeed someone that is determined to do the very best for her people. While still bothered to some degree by Beelzebub’s nature Mullin’s attitude towards his liege gradually starts to soften as he while redoubling his efforts to try and support her in her duties as a ruler also starts to take great care in trying to both understand the feelings that she has towards her various duties but at the same time reinforce any weaknesses that she may have in them as well. While generally maintaining his standard responsible personality trait Mullin as a result of seeing the strain that his liege puts herself under also starts to gradually realize that breaks and relaxation are just as important as being diligent at your job something that I felt contrasted well with his default uptight personality and was a development that I thought was well done. The character of Mullin I felt was an interesting one whose development from a kind, caring but uptight person who hid his true feelings to one that was not just attentive but also openly conscious of the feelings and struggles that are being experienced by others I felt was well done. This development I felt was reflected well in the increased character chemistry that gradually began to form between Mullin and Beelzebub as the bond between the two deepened.AstarothAstaroth portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of Sword Art Online and Food wars fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s allies within the series. A former angel and now a powerful demon that resides within Pandemonium that serves as the realms finance chief Astaroth on initial appearances is seen to be a positive, optimistic and confident person by nature that approaches each day with a smile on his face. A friendly, kind and caring person by nature Astaroth on the surface can be seen to be akin to a playboy which while fitting as a demon lord also serves to make the professional lives of his subordinates a constant struggle as Astaroth true to his playboy persona is someone that is never there when work needs to be done. True to his playboy type persona Astaroth was someone that was not just laid back but also had a nasty habit of not just making poor statements but also come up with random ideas that have the sketchiest of reasons for their implementation. A classic example of such an idea within the series is the bathhouse that Astaroth had built in lieu of the health center that was supposed to have been built. Despite this nature of his that caused many to view him as a fool, it can be seen rather surprisingly that beneath this nature of his Astaroth is someone that is surprisingly perceptive and is able to easily notice when someone’s feelings are out of sync with their usual self. At the same time while noted to be someone that was friendly and caring towards all it can be seen that to a degree that Astaroth is someone that cares deeply about his friends and would try to understand the core issues that are causing them the problems that they are suffering in an effort to help them. This aspect is best shown in the strong bond that he has with Beelzebub and his attempts to help her solve the doubts that she had about her bond with Mullin.While largely retaining the core personality traits that define him as the series goes on and as Astaroth was able to witness first hand how much Beelzebub’s personality has changed as a result of her increasing bond with her aide Mullin Astaroth began to realize that while his current lifestyle of being a playboy was a fun one he was not actually doing much to help his fellow demons unlike his fellow department heads. Indeed, despite being a powerful demon Astaroth in his desire to avoid hard work and responsibility was not just putting a lot of strain on his subordinates but also causing them endless trouble. More importantly, he was also causing trouble for his liege and friend Beelzebub something that he began to realize he had to change. As a result of this revelation Astaroth while not changing much in terms of personality began to take steps to not just improve himself but also make himself more useful to his liege as well. At the same time he also began to realize that despite always slacking off when work is needed to be finished and despite always coming up with ideas that almost always end up failing spectacularly his subordinates  have not just endured this but also worked hard to not just undo the damage but also keep him on track with his duties something that he is shown to be genuinely grateful for and within the series is shown well in the heartfelt thanks that he expresses to his aide Sargatanas. The character of Astaroth I felt was an interesting character that while often used as the series main source of comic relief also proved to be a character that had some interesting development that did well to show that beneath his playboy nature Astaroth was also someone that was not just perceptive but cared deeply about his friends as well. Seeing Astaroth witness the many changes that his liege and friend Beelzebub goes through as she opens up to her aide and the realization that perhaps its time to change his own life as well, I felt was an interesting development of his character that resonated well with the theme that opening up your true self to others is what will enable you to change and improve your life.SargatanasSargatanas portrayed by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Asterisk Wars and Clockwork Planet fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s allies within the series. A female demon that possesses an icy and forbidding aura about her Sargatanas on initial appearances is seen to be a dutiful, serious and direct person by nature that approaches her role within the hierarchy of Pandemonium with due reverence and professionalism. An honest, cool and collected person by nature Sargatanas serves as chief aide to the head of the finance department Astaroth and due largely due to the laid-back nature of her boss as well as his tendency to skip work and have fun elsewhere is often seen as the shadow head of the said department. While seen to be an effective aide to him due to her professionalism and hard-working nature Sargatanas is also seen as an effective counter to his antics and indeed can be said to be the one person that is able to keep him on track. Despite Sargatanas being an aide, it can be seen rather amusingly that she has no qualms with either physically restraining him or using violence on him to force him to get back to work something that I felt represented well the kind of relationship that existed between the two. Though widely seen as being serious, intelligent and overly loyal to her role as an aide it can be seen that Sargatanas outside of her intimidating nature is also someone that’s intelligent, level-headed and someone that has great foresight. These latter traits while often hard to see by those that don’t know her very well show that beneath her icy and intimidating aura Sargatanas was someone that was not just reliable to her friends and superiors but at the same time can be counted upon to keep the wild antics of her esteemed boss under a tight leash.As the series goes on however it can be seen that while Sargatanas may be a strict and stern person that isn’t afraid of using both intimidation and violence to make her boss repent for his actions that beneath this she also has a softer side to her personality as well. Unlike her default personality in which she is shown to be both icy and intimidating this softer side to her personality can be said to be akin to her true girly self that she tries hard to conceal from others. In this side of her personality rather than show disdain towards things that can be said to be girly such as cute accessories and toys as she would have done so in her default self it can be seen that instead of doing so, she instead displays a surprising sense of adoration towards them that seems out of place for her considering her reputation among Pandemonium. At the same time while showing adoration towards items that can be seen to be cute Sargatanas also displays an interesting sensitivity towards the types of positive feelings that comes from seeing couples enjoy their time together. While seen to be something of an offshoot to her default personality it can be said that this alt personality of hers is something that can be said to be the true face of the character of Sargatanas as while reflecting well on the types of positive feelings that she feels at seeing cute items this personality of hers also served well to show the kind of struggles that she has in balancing her role as a serious and dutiful aide who tries hard to keep her boss in check by any means necessary. The character of Sargatanas I felt was an interesting character that while initially seen to be someone that was cold, direct and not above using force to restrain her boss swiftly developed to not just become a more effective character but also one that had much more emotional depth to her. The contrasting personality’s that exist within Sargatanas I felt was an interesting idea as while her default cold and intimidating personality may be seen by many to be her true self it can be seen that this personality while still representing her effectively within the realm is nothing more than a mask that came out of her desire to not just be effective at her role as an aide but also in helping conceal her true inner self that would cause her great amounts of stress if revealed. Despite being used as nothing but a mask I felt that Sargatanas’s default personality also did well to create a synergy effect with her boss Astaroth as while the two of them are often in direct opposition to each other their personalities I felt matched and complemented each other well despite this and ensured that each of their interactions were equally amusing to see.BelphegorBelphegor portrayed by veteran seiyuu Misaki Kuno of Myriad Colors Phantom World and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s main allies within the series. A former principality of heaven and now a demon that lives within the realm of Pandemonium Belphegor who has been nicknamed Gocchin by her liege is seen from her initial appearances to be a quiet and nervous person that’s easily rattled by the simplest of things. As a result of the social anxiety that’s been plaguing her for some time Belphegor while noted to be a powerful demon is someone that can be seen to have very low self confidence in herself and as a result while not lacking in people who are willing to help her and be friends with her actively tries to avoid such entanglements by fleeing. This unfortunate consequence of her actions however ensured that while often seen as cute by others she was someone that was visually impossible to approach normally. As a result of this seemingly unfortunate personality trait of hers, it's perhaps unsurprising that Belphegor is someone that is not just cautious by nature but also someone that trusts and warms up to others slowly. However, while slow to trust to others it can be seen that Belphegor’s attitude to those that she had truly bonded with is markedly different to her default attitude. Instead of her usual hesitant and nervous attitude that can be said to be her defining trait Belphegor to those that she trusts is shown to be a friendly, caring and considerate person that while understanding the limits to what she can do tries hard to provide advice to her friends whenever she can. This is best shown in her attempts to help Beelzebub try to understand the developing feelings that she has developed for her aide. As the series goes on Belphegor’s personality largely due to her crush on her fellow demon Azazel starts to gradually change. While still retaining her quiet and friendly nature Belphegor as the series goes on gradually begins to make an attempt to not just overcome her meekness and her desire to flee at the moment someone tries to get close to her but at the same time try to gradually open her heart to others and make the feelings that she hides inside them much more visible to not just her friends but also to the person that she loves.AzazelAzazel portrayed by veteran voice actor Satoshi Hino of Boruto and Log Horizon fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is one of Beelzebub’s main allies within the series. A former member of the Cherub’s and now a demon that lives within the realm of Pandemonium Azazel from initial appearances is seen to be an intelligent, kind and perceptive person by nature that despite his muscular appearance is seen to be someone that is the total opposite of what that appearance represents being both friendly and sociable instead of intimidating and brash as his size would have suggested. While shown to be an intelligent and kind person Azazel is also someone that is noted to be both understanding and considerate of the feelings of others and is always ready to help those that are in need. However, despite his friendly and kind nature it can be seen that Azazel also has somewhat of a complex with his physical appearance as to him while doing well to intimate the occasional troublemaker that he may encounter as part of his job as a watcher this also had the unfortunate effect of causing other people to be in fear of him as well. As a result of this despite the positive and friendly nature that he shows to others, it can be seen that he is not just nervous and quiet but also lonely as well. Due to this, it's perhaps unsurprising that Azazel would as a result treat each of the friends that he has managed to make with both care and consideration and try to help them solve each of the problems that ail them. This is best shown within the series in his attempt to try and understand the problems that Sargatanas had with her problem of being seen as cute by others a problem that unknown to her he also suffers from. In addition to Azazel’s skill at needlework as well as his adoration of cute things one of the more prominent traits that can be said to define Azazel as a character is the fact that he relies entirely on text boards in order to communicate with others in the course of his life something that I felt was quite interesting as while making him stand out somewhat it also showed the depth to which his problem with nervousness has reached within him.AMVIn terms of animation, I felt that the animation that was used within the series was both bright and clear and made great use of the more positive and cute colors that are within the color spectrum. These I felt not only enhanced the animation itself but also allow it to better show the cute and fluffy nature of the character animations for the series. Setting wise I felt that the bright colors and the unique animation style that was used within the series also did well to show the fuse of modern day and fantasy settings that the series made use of as its main setting by featuring locations and elements that are unique to both settings. While doing well in enhancing the character animations I also felt that these bright colors and style also did well to show the visualization of the various dreams that Beelzebub has within the series. While cute these I felt also featured a surprising variety among their ranks as well. In terms of character designs I felt that the character designs for the series was pretty well done with the uniforms that are own by the cast being a notable aspect as while they were relatively simple I felt that it gave the demons a sense of solidity with each other and at the same time a sense of role within the realm of Pandemonium which contrasts with the traditional depictions of hell that often shows demons as having no established roles within the realm.In terms of music the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Pink Lemonade that was performed by Sangatsu no Phantasia and Akumade Koi Wazurai that was performed by the seiyuu’s of Beelzebub, Belphegor and Sargatanas which was Saori Oonishi, Misaki Kuno and Ai Kakuma respectively. Both of these songs I felt were really catchy and at the same time were cute ones that resonated well with the series main theme of cuteness and the forging of friendships. The series OST I felt while doing an excellent job at providing backing music to the many amusing situations that the cast encounter over the series also had the effect of providing a sense of relaxation to the viewer as well. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether main or support ones. In particular, I feel that Saori Oonishi, Rikuya Yasuda, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka, Ai Kakuma, Misaki Kuno and Satoshi Hino all did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Beelzebub, Mullin, Astaroth, Sargatanas, Belphegor and Azazel respectively. In addition, while I didn’t cover them within this review, I also felt that Aoi Yuuki, Chinatsu Akasaki, Aya Suzaki and Kikuko Inoue also did an excellent job in portraying the support characters of Dantalion, Eurynome, Morrigan and the series narrator respectively.Overall conclusionIn overall Beelzebub Jou No Okinimesu Mama was an anime that I really enjoyed and while reception on MAL seems to be rather mixed, I believe that it’s definitely one of the best animes of this season. In my opinion, I believe that its main strong points are its unique premise, entertaining story, well designed and developed characters, creative dream sequences, cute bonding moments and excellent voice acting.The overall premise of the series I felt was definitely one of the series main highlights. While hell has always existed within the realm of media in some form or another most of these tended to show it in a more traditional sense which is a fiery wasteland that has a depressing and oppressing atmosphere about it. While these aspects certainly do represent well an area where purported sinners were to descend to after their death, I felt that this aspect had started to become overused due to the lack of change in its depiction.  As a result of this when I saw the core premise that Beelzebub was making use of, I have to say I was quite intrigued as rather than making use of the traditional depictions Beelzebub not only made use of an entirely new concept but also one that radically changed the concept of hell within the series. Here instead of the fiery wasteland that has become the standard for hell Pandemonium as hell is now referred to as is instead a land that’s filled with not just color but also with cuteness. Complementing well this concept of introducing color and cuteness to the concept of hell was the fact that in this setting as a result of fusing a modern-day Japan with a fantasy setting the powerful demons that would have been akin to demon lords within hell have been transformed into becoming members of a government and acting as department heads. This act of converting powerful demon lords into humans I felt was an interesting concept as it allowed us to not only see what powerful demons would look like if their base personality traits that they had as demons were given human form but also what will happen if they were to both learn off and make use of human-like emotions in their everyday lives. These concepts when paired with the new hell that emphasized positivity and the bonds that it symbolized, I felt took great advantage of the series core themes of friendships, bonds, love and the act of enjoying the peace that reigns.The overall story that took great advantage of this premise I felt was also one aspect of the series that I enjoyed. While the overall premise had the effect of giving the demons of hell not just a human form but also the ability to not just understand the types of positive feelings and emotions that humans would I was curious to see the kind of effects that this would actually have within the demon’s daily lives as they set about fulfilling their assigned roles within the realm of Pandemonium. While the bond between Beelzebub and Mullin serves as the focal point within the series overall story, I felt that the series also took great care to ensure that each of the demons within the series whether they were main ones or support ones within the setting were not just expanded upon but also paired well with their destined other half within the series. This within the series is shown well in the many bonding moments within the series that was not just sweet to see but also, I felt was also developed really well. These bonding moments between the various characters within the series while sweet to see also I felt featured a great variety in them as well as while taking advantage of the base personalities of each demon these moments also took great advantage of the many hidden personal struggles that each of the characters had hidden within them. While these served to make the bonding moments nice to see I felt that they also served to make each moment and the process that goes with it that much heartwarming as the pairs were both able to not just connect with each other but also understand each other on a deeper more emotional level.Overall Beelzebub was an anime that I really enjoyed that managed to not only introduce a relatively new and fun version of hell but also pair that with a sweet and heartwarming story that made use of concepts that can be said to be the total opposite of what hell should stand for. While I enjoyed the overall story, I felt that not all of the characters were used to their full potential with the characters of Dantalion and Eurynome being good examples of this. In terms of final score, I would say that Beelzebub deserves a final score of 9/10. This series is undoubtedly one of the hidden gems of this season that I hope this review would help draw attention too."", 'This show is SATIRE, from top to bottom.

Scratch that, make that 6 characters as there\'s 3 separate couples in the anime. And none of them get anywhere and it\'s absolutely infuriating to watch them just keep going round and round and acting all tsundere. It\'s basically the romance anime equivalent of a carousel.The characters aren\'t even that interesting....Everyone likes fluffy things and...that\'s it. Maybe this person is a big dude and this girl is a borderline pedophile but that\'s it. In the end, the only thing going for them is their names and designs. But their names are so long that they\'re just forgettable.Speaking of the names, I would finally like to add that the setting makes no sense. Now, a cute version of the underworld is fine, but the author doesn\'t do anything with the premise besides giving the characters cool names. I forgot they were in Hell while watching considering that only 1 character looks even remotely like a demon, everyone was just born there, and it\'s just a normal town. While it doesn\'t completely strip the enjoyment, it just makes me even more perplexed at this series.With that being said, it\'s simply mediocre. The art is really cute and some of the soundtrack is quite nice, but that\'s it. It\'s just another seasonal romance anime that is better as background noise.

SIKE!!!I found it annoying, At first I thought I was going to get some nice character/ plot development. Like it would be real soothing and enjoyable at the same time, something like natsume in terms of feelings.No instead I got stupid and poor taste, clinging to perversion. I not knocking persons who have a thing for them soft, cosy, anime with dull-witted characters. Am just saying this isn't my taste. And I have seen pretty good soft animes but this wasn't it at all.The...art style looked cheap in my opinion. Cute but it was just to washed out for me.I like anime's with substance and 7 to 10 characters. These characters were so lame I started wondering what I was really watching, it was like ewwwwwwww!!!!!! The story was non existent , just pieces thrown here and there. This was just hard to watch, no flow.I can barely describe my distaste for this one. Its just horrible. I understand you want to make the characters likeable and sweet but did you have to make them so unbearable.I felt like it was draining my life force.I was yawning so hard my jaw was hurting, I fell asleep 3 times while trying to finish it.UTTERLY BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! art style looked cheap in my opinion.

We have two protagonists: Beelzebub, the queen of the hell and Myurin, her right hand. While Beelzebub rules the underground world, Myurin gets a chance to become Beelzebub\'s assistant. In the beginning, he thinks this is a great honor and big responsibility but then he realizes Beelzebub is very different from how she seems. First of all, Beelzebub -the highest hell lady- isn\'t a scary, bossy person. She\'s in love with sweet, sleep and all cute stuff -especially fluffy things! Myurin starts to review his decisions but in time,...a romance begins between Myurin and Beelzebub.- In my opinion, the story arc isn\'t ripping yarn at all: same events, same places, same sentences during the whole anime. It almost doesn\'t have a flow. But I didn\'t have big expectations about the story when I started this anime. I knew that is a situation comedy so I didn\'t get disappointed. Yeah, anime doesn\'t give you the meaning of life but it\'s a very good choice for leisure activity -especially after a hard school/work day. But if you looking for escapist adventures I guess this anime isn\'t for you.- When it comes to atmosphere, I can say the main reason why I watch this anime is color palette -besides kawaii characters of course. It isn\'t possible to lose myself in that pastel-toned world design. It\'s very relaxing and cute! (Like kind of ASMR) In these cold days, all you need: a blanket, one cup of a coffee and this anime for spend some pleasant time. 10/10 for visuality! By the way, both the opening and ending are good.- All character names based on mythology and religion (except Myurin, I guess). We all know about Beelzebub but Belphegor, Azazel, Dantalion, Sargatanas, Astaroth and Moloch are demonic names as well. Unlike these names, Eurynome is an ocean goddess in Greek mythology.- I couldn\'t imagine Beelzebub as a kawaii moe girl before this anime but there she is with her all cuteness. Both Beelzebub and Myurin are noobies in romantic relationships and it\'s funny to watch them.  Still, my favorite couple in this anime is Belphegor & Azazel! Belphegor is cute too but she pushes the limits with shyness, this situation makes me -a little bit- annoyed. Thank God she goes to bathroom rarely now! Close-tongued Azazel, playboy Astaroth, dominant Sargatanas, pervert Eurynome, bookworm & sleepy Dantalion and silly Molech... All of them have specific personalities, I liked it.I describe that anime with three words: Soft, fluffy and kawaii! a romance begins between Myurin and Beelzebub.- In my opinion, the story arc isn\'t ripping yarn at all: same events, same places, same sentences during the whole anime.

I decided to give As Miss Beelzebub Likes It because the style intrigued me, the main characters looked cute, and Azazel is there, too. The short of it is that this would have been a nice, inoffensive experience... if Eurynome wasn\'t there.Now, I\'ll explain that in a moment. The general thing about this series is that there isn\'t really an ongoing story;...the characters live in Pandemonium, which appears to be a quaint town rather than a fiery underworld as one would expect of characters from Hell. With that being said, the stakes set in each episode are very low, and the conflicts are usually very simple. If you go in with this expectation, then that isn\'t really a negative.To talk about what I did enjoy - I thought it was very refreshing, if not a bit confusing, that the choice was to make this area of Hell look like a regular small town. *Most* of the characters are enjoyable to watch, though Beelzebub, Mullin, and Belphegor seem to get the most attention of them. I\'m a sucker for pastel color palettes, and this anime executes it very well. I followed this anime at the same time that I was stressing over finals and watching a more serious and sad anime, and it was a calming experience; I would watch an episode before I went to sleep for the night.I also really enjoyed the character Azazel, a strong, tough-looking man who prefers to write rather than talk. He has an affinity for cute things, and those around him appreciate him and don\'t give him a hard time over it (Mullin even calls him his brother!). I was especially amused at the last episode, which I won\'t go into too much detail, but they do a very blatant advertisement. I don\'t wanna ruin the surprise, so you\'ll have to scope that out. :) It was a sweet setting and had sweet characters, and I enjoyed my time watching it.And then there\'s Eurynome.Thankfully, she would not appear for several episodes, so for the first half of the series or so, you\'ll be safe from her. But she\'s coming to make you as uncomfortable as you can possibly be. Characters who are not any of the ""main three"" couples tend to be more one-note and have less time focused on them; in the case of Eurynome, her identifying trait is that she... stalks and fantasizes over young boys. Like, I\'m talking elementary schoolers. She would go on to, at any instance she appeared, remind the audience of her sensual fantasies about nine year olds. Mullin, like anyone would, is shocked and concerned upon learning Eurynome\'s nature, fearing for the children who may be near her, but it is soon played off as a comical beat and he gives a very ""oh, that Eurynome!"" kind of shrug reaction afterward.I would like to say that what bothered me was his initial concern and then subsequent disinterest, but honestly, it\'s the existence of Eurynome altogether that sullies the experience of this show for me. The slow romantic development and the poor excuses the anime gave to make skimpy uniforms for the female characters (we have her boobs out because she doesn\'t like button-up shirts!) were things that I could brush aside, but there was just no getting past Eurynome. Any time she showed up just made me remarkably uncomfortable, and it honestly makes me wonder why she was added in the first place. The story gains nothing by her addition to the cast; this can be argued the same for others, but at least they don\'t, you know, stalk young boys. I can\'t give the show, from my personal viewing experience, any higher than a 6 because of her. the characters live in Pandemonium, which appears to be a quaint town rather than a fiery underworld as one would expect of characters from Hell.

Maybe you just saw the score I gave, but I have my reasons.story 8/10 - The whole story takes place in a unique setting where the devils live. Let's get to the main heroes. Each hero has a unique character. The whole story has a good story and even a good end that is not too drawn.art 10/10- The whole anime has a good artistic style where you can see the effort that was dedicated to the anime. Each bit of animation seems very good and sophisticated.Sound 8/10 - You can not wait for some very complex...music, such as some of the more popular anime, but it also has a spell.character 7 / 10- The characters themselves are not very well written and are simple. Everyone behaves a bit childish. I see lots of attributes made from anime Oushitsu Kyoushi Haine.Experiences 10/10 - This is a very good series and I hope it will have another.

', 'This is a lovely moe slice-of-life with gentle romantic undertones. It takes place in a, um, ""version"" of Hell, which is a peaceful, happy place with an incredibly kawaii ruling class/government. It focuses on Mullin and Bell, as the main characters.The focus of the show is on these moe government officials, their cute and silly antics, and the slowly developing romance between a couple of them. There isn\'t really much action or drama.I\'d have to say that it was not at all like I expected it to be. I thought it would be more on the action comedy side (it\'s in Hell after all), but...the focus is on a relaxed slice-of-life atmosphere, some light comedy, and moe-ness. Hell is just fantasy Japan, which... they could have spiced up a little to be honest.Essentially this show has two main facets: fluffly kawaii and gentle romance.Let\'s discuss the former first. Now, personally, I enjoy CGDCT moeblobs, but that\'s not exactly the situation here. There are a number of male characters, and in fact most the characters are not particularly moe: most of the moe therefore derives from Beelzebub (Bell) and secondarily her friend Belphegor (Gocchin). Luckily, they are mainstay characters. Bell in particular is strong with the kawaii, but outwardly is something like an air-headed kuudere, rather than the more standard easily embarassed kawaii archetype. Internally, however, she loves fluffy things! I have to emphasize this, because I loved it. :) As a Connoisseur of Moe, this helped make the show special for me. A love of fluffiness is indeed a common trait of moe characters, but it is usually incidental in nature, something only reactively and temporarily manifested. This show doesn\'t treat Bell\'s obsession with mofumofu as a temporary gimmick: it actually manages to consistently carry it through the entire show. This is what I call innovation, my friends. Fantastic.Ok, now onto the romance part. I am not a fan of cringey melodrama or stretching out manufactured misunderstandings between romantic interests, so I am happy to report these are not present in the show. There are no explicit, ""followed-through"" love stories/arcs. Instead, a few characters slowly develop some feelings for each other, though some of them do not (or refuse to) recognize the meaning of those feelings. Much of the show is about the characters muddling through their feelings and coming to terms with them. However, I will say that only relatively minor progress in this regard is made throughout the story. The characters are either too pure or oblivious to themselves or others for progression; however, this is not a problem in my opinion, since I am not watching this show for romantic drama. I suspect this may bother some people though. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the romantic interactions between the main characters: Bell does not understand why she feels the way she does, yet she acts with the object of her affection in a very pure manner, which I found quite cute. Gocchin, on the other hand, is aware of her feelings, but struggles to express them - and is also rather adorable.In terms of plot, I would be hard-pressed to say there really even is an over-arching one. The episodes follow some short arc or easily solved problem; however, there is persistence between episodes, and one does see (minor) character progression throughout the season, mostly in the way the characters interact with or see one another. Like many moe shows though, there is no continuous story arc with clear progresson (that\'s by definition slice-of-life, I suppose). Personally, however, I actually like the feeling of stability this gives.For cons, one minor complaint is the fact that the characters are demons in Hell is simply not used.  The idea of moe demons is rather amusing to me, and could have been utilized more cleverly I feel. Think of the standard ""gap moe"" method employed in some shows: wouldn\'t a demon doing crazy things but loving mofumofu things be a great opportunity for some gap moe? Indeed, it is only due to minor, random references that we even remember we are watching demons at all! A missed opportunity.Furthermore, again, the visual setting is basically a mix between fantasy Japan and modern Japan - more ""hell-like"" scenery would have been appreciated. Interestingly, while I usually dislike ecchi tainting my moe, I feel like I would have been ok with it being done more here, in a cultured >.> manner of course: the characters are devils after all. (There is a little bit of ecchi, mostly involving Bell\'s impressive endowments, but it is relatively scarce and peripheral when present; it is mostly used for comedic purposes). Finally, regarding the side characters, I found those outside of Beelzebub, Mullin, Azazel, and Belphegor to be less amusing, sometimes boring or even annoying. Luckily, screentime was primarily devoted to characters I liked.Summarily, along the ""axes of anime"", we have:- Moe: strong, especially mofumofu Bell- Comedy: decent- Drama: nearly none- Action: none- Romance: lots, all in the ""crush"" stage- Harem: none- Ecchi: quite minorOverall, if you need something to smile at, or are looking for a cute moe-moe mofu-mofu show, but a little more on the relaxed and subtly romantic side than a standard CGDCTs show, then this is a good pick.It\'s a little ironic that, if you want to be immersed in a happy stress-free world with kawaii characters, then Hell is the place to go in this case.

If you\'re depressed then this might be the right anime for you as well. Aside from the lowkey yaois which are meant to be a joke(?), this show is spectacular.', 'I didn’t expect to like this series. It looked really boring and gimmicky, and if I had to compare it to other series that give off a similar vibe, like Ore Monogatari or Polar Bear’s Cafe it kind of is. But I like it, okay? I like these saccharine demons a lot. There’s something about this show that sets it apart ever so slightly to warrant writing a review on it. It’s not as good as other iyashikei, slice of life series that I binged over spring break (Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, I’m looking right at you) but it was certainly… something. A good something,...or at least a thing that spurred me to come back after every episode.The art style, for one, is adorable. Each character looks like they could be turned into a plushie yesterday, and yes this includes our more muscular cast members. The color palette is a nice pastel wash that never falters in any way, even in the more grounded and mundane environments. There isn’t really much to say except for the animation which is decidedly lacking in most scenes. There really isn’t much except for excited arm and lip flaps, and the fetsihy-er moments of the show.Speaking of the fetish-y moments oh BOY does this show have a lot of them. How Miss Beelzebub Likes It is basically just a soft, whimsical, pastel-colored trojan horse of fetish porn at the 4-koma author’s discretion. This can’t just be a cute show about cute people who do cute things, no of course not, this is a show about a child-like demon who pisses everywhere when she gets nervous which is all the time. Well, okay, maybe she doesn’t outright pee on the floor but oh boy do we get to see her flustered, embarrassed face while she tries to hold back the proverbial waterfall of fetish porn that is a piss kink. What’s that? Watersports aren’t up your alley? Well what about BDSM? Don’t fret, there’s definitely a character who ties up her boss in all manners of sexual ways. He’s not exactly into, but the show makes it clear that he’s not NOT exactly into it, either. What about pedophiles? Do you like literal pedophiles? Would you like to have a main character who’s explicitly a pedophile? How Miss Beelzebub Likes It has got you covered because we definitely have a pedophile to show you, and she even has a be-stockinged boy to drool over. In its defense, the show actually makes a point to explicitly say that what she’s doing is creepy, wrong, and a crime but it never outright punishes her for being a literal child predator and stalking what she thinks is a literal child. There are a few other ways “How Miss Beelzebub Likes it” has its cake and eats it to in regards to these Problematique~ elements, and one is the pedophile’s (no, I didn’t learn her name and I’m not going to) staunch policy that she believes minors are so pure that they shouldn’t even be touched by adults with ill intent. Secondly, the object of her criminal affections is heavily implied to be a grown adult who simply looks young for his age, similar to our titular heroine.There are other moments of self-awareness as well, like our main boy Myurin chastising one of the other characters for attempting to sneak into the women’s baths in order to get a glimpse of bare skin. It’s outright called a crime, which… yeah. It is, thank you pastel demon anime. And when he does sneak into the baths, the girls haven’t even changed yet and are fully clothed, as they expected something like this would occur. It’s oddly self-aware, and I’m oddly proud of this weird little showIn terms of the characters, the cast is delightful. We have a big strong buff boy who is too shy to speak aloud and sews teddy bears in his spare time. We have a gay, fashion designer demon who’s one of the more level-headed and sensible characters in the show, and his friendship with the chicken-maraca-shaking succubus is underrated and amazing. The straight man of the series is incredibly open minded, patient, and kind. And Beelzebub herself acts like an airhead but is actually just emotionally inexperienced; she’s more than capable at her job. It tends to respect each character’s motivations and inner monologues without struggle, and even characters that are usually the punch lines of jokes, like our fashion designer are given room for a little growth.This show takes a lot of shots at toxic masculinity and how silly the idea is that men can’t admire other men, take time to be soft or caring, and are incapable of coexisting with women in the work environment, without involving spite or harassment. In fact, most of the coworkers this series features get along very nicely with one another. I genuinely don’t have many complaints, expect for the pedophile and her needless existence.The music is wonderful, and the OP is especially great. The ending is your standard back-to-the-status-quo, please read the manga end. There are ups and downs, goods and bads, but in the end I would easily recommend this series to someone who loves a good iyashikei.Actually, watch this show if you have a fever. It’s really calming and you’ll feel a lot better. Not for any other reason than it’s cuteness, but I think that’s a valid reason in itself. or at least a thing that spurred me to come back after every episode.The art style, for one, is adorable.

Their interactions are very cute. I like how she tries and understands and knows what the feeling she is feeling.This is my opinion so its okay if you dont agree with me, this is just my taste in anime. So please do not hate on what anime I like. ', ""As others already mentioned, this was extremely boring and uninspiring. They bait you with some fanservice in the first 1-2 episodes but show nothing of that anymore later on, so even the last bit of engagement it could've generated was just dropped, and to focus on what, you might ask? Cute stuff. Just fluff and giggles. That's about it. No relevant events happen, and there's no development in the main romance (or any other, for that matter), so it ends up being a criminally boring SOL with cute art and a dense FMC.Watching it to the end was physically painful. It's not fun, it's...not compelling, the characters are just flat and boring, and there's - I repeat - nothing interesting going on for 12 whole episodes.

You have to root for so many love stories between every character. Side characters stick out in the best way and you feel so pulled towards them the same, if not more, than the main story arc.

Give this fun, lighthearted, hidden gem a spin!', 'This is probably my favorite anime of all time, and I\'ve watched much more than what is currently noted in my profile. I was interested in the reviews for it and was surprised by regular mentions of Hell. If not for these reviews, I\'d probably leave this element out of my review because in my opinion this anime is not about Hell at all. It became my favorite because it is probably the only one which gives the feel and illistration of secured calm perpetuity. Not much changes from episode to episode because it is not supposed to as the characters are granted eternal existence...in a very rich and stable environment and thus are mostly well, open and easy-going.The characters\' personal tastes and attidudes are different but they are all very uniformic in their benevolancy towards each other and therefore humanistically developed despite some exessive emotions, psychic specifics, outlooks or behavioral patterns. This atmosphere of neverending mutual benevelancy (which, in my opinion, is ""cleaner"" and more stable than tolerance, friendship or camaradery), understanding and unity is what got me to love this work. Then come the fluff, art, music, voice acting etc. which contibute well to the general image, especially the artstyle. I couldn\'t find anything similar to this, but arya the animation (I did not finish the first season as of yet, so I can\'t be sure) and the recent Maoujou de Oyasumi could be closer than most.The reason to choose ""Hell"" as a setting is easy to explain, in my opinion: the author needed a  world for this idea of perpetual well-being, comfort, softness, healthy relationship (on a macro level) and referring to an already existing concept of perpetuity (monotheistic heaven and hell concepts) was a wises choice as it saved a lot on explanations and made the world more solid and grounded. The choice of ""Hell"" other ""Heaven"" was probably for practical reasons as it would less controversial, more attractive to some audiences and allowed characters to be more eccentric and dynamic, but if you\' llook at the Pandemonium it is really not far away from the image of ""Heaven"", constant work and hierarchy aside (even though monotheistic Heaven has a hierarchy). The choice also allowed the author to save some time on character design as he had material to work from.This is the only ""Hell"" I see in this work and it really has nothing to do with the original concept so these two do not link in my mind at all. I see it more like a space of luminous (even pure or innocent), harmonious eternal existance before any fluff kicks in full. The setting is so uniquely well-made, some minimalism and simplicity of the story appear to only benefit it. The creators somehow managed to do a great show, even if they themselves probably did not notice it (it was a really distastefull move to add a promotion in one of the last episodes, even though I love KFC... were they so broke? This creates an interesting mystery. The thing is, the world is crafted in such an aprropriate way, that it can take hits like this gracefully, without the loss of the beauty).

I just needed to kill some time before I could go play games with a friend.Let\'s start this review for an anime that I quite like: As Miss Beelzebub Likes It. In my opinion, it\'s an adorable anime that\'s great to watch when you have nothing else to do. You\'ll get one or two quick laughs here and there, a cute cast of characters, and an epic opening. Let\'s begin!1. STORY: 5/10Okay, since the anime is a slice-of-life slow-burn romcom, there\'s not gonna be an epic overarching plot. Every episode presents the cute slices-of-life of the ruler of Hell ( which in this show...is so cute it seems like heaven ), Miss Beelzebub, and her assistant, Mullin.The closest the show ever got to having any sort of epic story or conflict was when every now and then, Mullin and Beelzebub would be interrupted while they were having a romantic moment. Like I stated above, the series is something I recommend you watch when you have nothing else to do and you just want an excuse to watch some cute demons go about their everyday lives.2. ART: 7/10I\'m a sucker for kawaii art styles, but I feel as if this show takes that concept to a whole new level, which I\'m in love with. All the characters look unique yet feel similar, and they all show their personalities fairly well through their designs. The animation is smooth, playful, and... fluffy. I\'m not joking, the characters look like Dolfie Dream dolls ( only not 3D of course ). The food the characters eat looks delicious and adorable. And the non-human creatures are probably my favorite part of the art. They look like stuffed animals. Overall, I\'m a fan of the art in this show, but I will admit that it\'s nothing too special. Yes, I find it adorable, but if you came to this anime expecting art like Madoka Magica, you\'ll be let down.3. SOUND: 8/10( I\'m assuming that ""sound"" is referring to the voice acting and sound effects. )I have to admit, as of the time I\'m writing this I haven\'t seen a lot of anime, so I don\'t know EVERYTHING when it comes to good voice acting. However, I have to say, the voice acting in this show was pretty good. All the voices match the characters, and the sound effects are close to my kinda ASMR. The squishy-type sounds, the fluff sounds, and the characters eating all sound very nice. Something I could turn on and just listen to while I draw.4. CHARACTER: 7/10If I\'m being honest, I really like the characters in this show. Sure, they\'re pretty generic: the ruler, the flustered love-interest/simp, the stoic leader-type character, the lady-man, the scary-looking dude who\'s actually super nice, the type that tends to cry over EVERYTHING, the shota, and the fangirl.So, yeah, the characters themselves aren\'t ALL that interesting. However, in my opinion, that\'s what makes them so likable. You can always be sure what kinda episode you\'re gonna be watching when you see who\'ll be featured in the episode, and it makes it easier to pick a favorite because they\'re all pretty plain. Into husbando-material Esque boys that look like they came from Ouran? BOOM, there\'s a guy for that. Like the generic kawaii girl who has quite a bit of fanservice? You\'ll love Beelzebub.Overall, the characters aren\'t super deep, and they don\'t really go through any development, but I still like them.5. ENJOYMENT: 8/10I know anime that are pure fluff with a dash of fanservice isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea, but personally, I quite enjoyed this anime. It\'s fun to rewatch when you\'re bored, and it makes you want to live in Hell. ( You\'ll understand after you watch it. ) Both my sister and I quite like this anime, and we both agree Beelzebub is an adorable main character. There isn\'t much else to say for this part... There\'s just this sort of charm the anime has to it that\'s hard to put into words.6. OVERALL: 7/10Overall, I really like this series. Yes, it\'s nothing special, it\'s pretty short, and some of the fanservice feels out of place, but that doesn\'t really bother me. I quite like the concept of demons that look cuter than they should, which is probably why I like this series so much. Like I stated above, it\'s kinda hard to put into words what\'s so charming about this anime, it just IS.That pretty much sums up this review. I hope it was a nice read and that I helped someone =D is so cute it seems like heaven ), Miss Beelzebub, and her assistant, Mullin.The closest the show ever got to having any sort of epic story or conflict was when every now and then, Mullin and Beelzebub would be interrupted while they were having a romantic moment. Like I stated above, the series is something I recommend you watch when you have nothing else to do and you just want an excuse to watch some cute demons go about their everyday lives.2. ART: 7/10I\'m a sucker for kawaii art styles, but I feel as if this show takes that concept to a whole new level, which I\'m in love with. All the characters look unique yet feel similar, and they all show their personalities fairly well through their designs. The animation is smooth, playful, and... fluffy. I\'m not joking, the characters look like Dolfie Dream dolls ( only not 3D of course ). The food the characters eat looks delicious and adorable. And the non-human creatures are probably my favorite part of the art. They look like stuffed animals. Overall, I\'m a fan of the art in this show, but I will admit that it\'s nothing too special. Yes, I find it adorable, but if you came to this anime expecting art like Madoka Magica, you\'ll be let down.3. SOUND: 8/10( I\'m assuming that ""sound"" is referring to the voice acting and sound effects. )I have to admit, as of the time I\'m writing this I haven\'t seen a lot of anime, so I don\'t know EVERYTHING when it comes to good voice acting. However, I have to say, the voice acting in this show was pretty good. All the voices match the characters, and the sound effects are close to my kinda ASMR. The squishy-type sounds, the fluff sounds, and the characters eating all sound very nice. Something I could turn on and just listen to while I draw.4. CHARACTER: 7/10If I\'m being honest, I really like the characters in this show. Sure, they\'re pretty generic: the ruler, the flustered love-interest/simp, the stoic leader-type character, the lady-man, the scary-looking dude who\'s actually super nice, the type that tends to cry over EVERYTHING, the shota, and the fangirl.So, yeah, the characters themselves aren\'t ALL that interesting. However, in my opinion, that\'s what makes them so likable. You can always be sure what kinda episode you\'re gonna be watching when you see who\'ll be featured in the episode, and it makes it easier to pick a favorite because they\'re all pretty plain. Into husbando-material Esque boys that look like they came from Ouran? BOOM, there\'s a guy for that. Like the generic kawaii girl who has quite a bit of fanservice? You\'ll love Beelzebub.Overall, the characters aren\'t super deep, and they don\'t really go through any development, but I still like them.5. ENJOYMENT: 8/10I know anime that are pure fluff with a dash of fanservice isn\'t everybody\'s cup of tea, but personally, I quite enjoyed this anime. It\'s fun to rewatch when you\'re bored, and it makes you want to live in Hell. ( You\'ll understand after you watch it. ) Both my sister and I quite like this anime, and we both agree Beelzebub is an adorable main character. There isn\'t much else to say for this part... There\'s just this sort of charm the anime has to it that\'s hard to put into words.6. OVERALL: 7/10Overall, I really like this series. Yes, it\'s nothing special, it\'s pretty short, and some of the fanservice feels out of place, but that doesn\'t really bother me. I quite like the concept of demons that look cuter than they should, which is probably why I like this series so much.

It's a romantic slice of life about the pandemonium leader in hell and her assistant. The story isn't very deep (as is typical with sol anime) but the character interactions and their romantic growth more than make up for it. While I love most of the side characters introduced in the show (especially Azazel <3<3<3), the one introduced in episode 4 is.. not good. I personally would skip the first part of episode 4 for anyone planning to watch this, as it introduces a character whose main schtick is that she's a hard...worker but likes young boys. It's not taken too seriously and the Mullin plays the straight man/voice of reason, but I still found it pretty uncomfortable.Overall, really cute show with a lot of pastel colors and fun characters, and I recommend watching it! worker but likes young boys.

One of the first things I noticed was how it suffers heavily from the same face syndrome. The characters have such bland designs that I can barely tell them apart and their personalities do not make it better as they are very surface level.This is supposed to be a comedy romance show. It completely failed at that. There wasn’t a moment in the show that I thought this was funny. The comedy was...misplaced and the jokes were sometimes even distasteful. I’m talking about the girl with anxiety who apparently has unlimited urine stored in her bladder and has to go pee every five seconds. This was not funny at all and I even found myself cringe at it. The second character I hated was the lady who was way too much into young boys, and I mean young boys. You can find a kid cute or something, but referring to them as hot and obviously being sexually attracted to that, made me want to vomit. I skipped every moment this lady was on the screen. What was the writer thinking?Beelzebub which was the main character, never felt like one. She blended in with the background, mostly playing with everything fluffy. Nothing much to say about her than she existed.The romance is another aspect I didn’t get about this show. There was no chemistry between the characters as they had no personality. Might also have to do about the fact that I couldn’t give a damn about this whole show. Only finished the show because it was for the anime club I’m in.This was twelve episodes of torture to go through as I was getting distracted by literally anything. It doesn’t grab you, it doesn’t entertain you. It barely does something.Another thing that bothered me was that this was supposed to be hell. You can make hell cutesy and stuff, but at least show that it is still hell that we’re in as I kept forgetting that. Where are the creatures with more daemonic features? I remember vaguely a character with bunny ears, but was there anything else? Don’t remember since this show is very forgettable.There is not much to say about this show than it’s a waste of time.

I'm not saying that many ovas and specials cannot be really good or better, but the My Hero Academia Jump Special is not one of those cases.The story consists of nothing, but special training.  It was kind of fun, but all it is watching the heroes take turns being the victims and saviors.  It's mildly entertaining, but it's not that entertaining. 5/10The art isn't that great.

In the end, it's basically just a side story that didn't necessarily need to be animated.  It's not bad, but it's  not quite ok or good either; it's rather meh.  5/10.

Here's my take on it:STORY [7/10]A brief synopsis: The story basically takes place a couple weeks after the end of the first season. The students go back to the USJ to complete their training with Hero Thirteen, and find out that it isn't as safe and secure as they'd thought it would be the second time around.ART [7/10]The art seems to be the same as the first season, although it did feel a bit choppy in some places and during the battle scenes.SOUND...[7/10]The sound was average and mostly uses the tracks heard during the first season of the anime.

The difference is, they seemed 'dumbed' down this time and not as lively as they were in the first season.ENJOYMENT [8/10]Fans of BnHA will enjoy it due to the fact that we are getting just a little bit more of BnHA while waiting for the second season to air.OVERALL [7/10]Despite its flaws, it was fun to see the characters return again and to also witness their quirks in action. If you watched the first season of the anime and enjoyed it for what its worth, there's no harm in checking out this OVA.

It an odd coincidence that I found this right in the middle of season three, but its extremely pertinent to watch this before the licencing exam arc in season 3. Otherwise, it looks like they had no rescue training at all. Especially Yaomomo's explanation of what to do and not do during a rescue mission had clear connections to Deku's reaction in episode 18 and 19 of season season III.

Again, there's really not too much going on just being at school learning to do hero things joking around with your friends, taking the piss out of the teachers, it's just a normal day of a high school student. Can't really say I'm surprised but I mean it is like their training episode if it didn't get interrupted by the villains. Not really too much I...could say about it like half an episode in actual length, so my opinion on whether or not you should watch it is sure it short, sweet, and it's not going to make or break a series, also it's not adding anything new or special again, hence the name, it's just another episode, boom. And I didn't see any new interactions or glean any new information from this episode it's a basic episode nothing happening. could say about it like half an episode in actual length, so my opinion on whether or not you should watch it is sure it short, sweet, and it's not going to make or break a series, also it's not adding anything new or special again, hence the name, it's just another episode, boom.

This could have been some extra episode made as a secret ending to season 1. I don't see how some people can say this is of such a noticeable lower quality than the rest of the series in terms of just how an episode goes. You know its an OVA and that the stakes don't matter, but that's basically acknowledged by the story itself. 8/10 episodes equate to an 8/10 series and this would basically be in line with that. Key word being would, because my only real negative here is that...this is an OVA that was a bit obscure for a while, and maybe this could be just from where I got it, but the resolution and quality on gogoanime.so, where I usually watch anime was quite lower with mistakes in the translation and the framing of the dialogue. I don't know where it got messed up along the way but it didn't help things.

Cheonnyeon-yeowoo Yeowoobi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2756/Cheonnyeon-yeowoo_Yeowoobi,"['I have to admit that I have a soft spot for anime based on folktales, legends and mythology, with the only proviso being that such references or inspirations are used in an intelligent or innovative manner. While there are many successful anime that have used these platforms as a basis for their plots (Tears to Tiara, My Neighbour Totoro, Miyori no Mori, Mokke, Wagaya no Oinari-sama, etc), there are also some truly awful efforts that are nothing more than pandering to the audience (Kanokon being a prime example).One of the more worthy efforts of recent years is, surprisingly, not Japanese at all. Yobi, The...Five Tailed Fox is a Korean animated movie made in 2007, and directed by Lee Seong-kang (who also directed the critically acclaimed Mari Iyagi), and while the film does have it\'s problems, the end result is pretty good, especially given the penchant for viewers to make comparisons with Ghibli movies.The story follows the life of a five tailed fox (a slight variation on the kumiho, or nine tailed fox), called Yobi, who lives in the forest with her friends, a group of stranded aliens who crash landed on Earth 100 years before.Yobi has lived with her friends for all that time, having been abandoned in the mountain forest when she was a cub. She spends her days wandering, playing, and generally having fun, until a group of children come to the forest on a test of courage.As far as plots go, Yobi begins in fairly well. The first portion of the movie follows a fairly placid progression through the story, with much of the emphasis on Yobi and the aliens, however the film takes a very sudden and unexpected turn to the dramatic. It\'s actually unfortunate, especially as Yobi had a lot of potential, that the plot for the latter two-thirds of the movie is nowhere near as good as the first portion, and this is because the movie loses it\'s focus in a big way.To put it simply, there\'s just too much going on. For a good portion of the movie it seems as though the screenwriter(s) were simply putting every idea they had on paper instead of sticking to the point, and while the movie does make an effort to tie up the numerous loose ends, it ultimately fails to do so as there is simply not enough running time. For a story to be as busy as this one, then it must, by any logical standards, be at least a twelve episode series - not an 85 minute movie.The simple fact is that while the movie has several very interesting paths of development, it would have been better served if the director had chosen one (at a push, two), of those routes for plot progression. It\'s unfortunate that the end result is confusing, and the repeated use of ""conveniences"" simply reinforces this.In terms of art and animation, the movie is at times breathtaking. The artwork especially, is lush, vibrant, and extremely eye-catching in both it\'s detail and composition. There are many moments when the background scenery will cath the viewers eye far more than the foreground action. The characters are designed fairly well, and I particularly liked how Yobi\'s human form (child), still retains the look of a fox due to her age and inexperience, while her adult form just looks wierd. The human characters are all well realised, especially the children, and my gripe (and a minor one at that), is with the design for the aliens as they reminded me of Ewoks more than anything else.The one design that did puzzle me though, was the spirit in the shape of a wash basin.The animation is actually very good for the most part, however there are some occasions where the characters look or act oddly (and no, I don\'t mean during the wierd song about the Sphinx). The movie also makes some good use of CG, and while it\'s generally encapsulated well into the whole, the CG does sometimes stand out because the colours don\'t quite match the rest of the scene.The music used for the movie is very good throughout, reflecting a good range of emotive nuances, and the various tracks used for mood enhancement work well in their respective scenes. The ED is a rather pleasantly melodic ballad that reinforces the bittersweet ending to the movie, and rounds the whole thing off rather nicely.I have to admit that at first I was a little confused given that the speaking language in the movie is Korean (and with me being so used to hearing Japanese), however once I got over that little hurdle, I found the acting to be surprising good. Emotively, the Korean seiyuu are at least as talented as their Japanese counterparts, and the cast portray their roles extremely well, especially Son Ye-jin (Yobi), and Ryu Deok-hwan (Hwang Geum-ee), both of whom do a sterling job with what are effectively the two lead roles (although it does take the movie a while to make this clear).This is actually a rather enjoyable, if at times confusing, movie to watch. Given that the story heavily involves spirits and a forest, I found the distinct lack of an environmental message to be rather refreshing. There are, however, those problems with the plot, in particular the busy nature of the story and the seemingly wilfull use of deus ex machina. There are also several loose ends that never get tied up, in particular why yobi was abandoned, why are there aliens in the story, what the hell is that wash basin spirit all about, etc, etc.Even with the various problems it has though, Yobi is still a good movie, and while it ultimately can\'t shake off all of the issues it has, it does, at the very least, resolve some of them (which is more than I can say for certain other titles).To be honest, I\'m not sure who would actually enjoy the movie more as the whole thing is designed to appeal to children and adults alike. Fans of nature and spirit based anime like Mushishi, Miyori no Mori, Mokke, Mononoke Hime, My Neighbour Totoro, etc (why do most of them begin with M?), may find this to be a pleasing addition to their viewing lists. Fans of mythology and legend (like me), may also want to check this out as, while it deals with what is ultimately supposed to be a nine tailed fox, it is the Korean kumiho rather than the Japanese Kitsune.At the end of the day, even with all of the spirits, nature, antics, drama, and other stuff, Yobi, The Five Tailed Fox is at heart a coming of age story, and not for the humans, but for Yobi herself. The movie makes the point of highlighting the fact that although Yobi is over 100 years old, she is still very much a child both physically and mentally, especially as kumiho can live for over a thousand years.It may have it\'s flaws, and it may not appeal to everyone, but Yobi, even with it\'s problems, is a great example of what Korean animation is capable of, and bodes extremely well for the future of Asian animation.

Its sad though that practically no one knows about this great film. If you are at all into animated movies this is a must see movie! ', ""This Korean film focuses on our titular heroine, Yobi, trying to retrieve one of the aliens she came to befriend from a group of humans and she takes on the form of a human child to try tracking down the alien. Through this task, Yobi comes to bond with the humans she encounters at the school she attends, particularly a boy named Hwang Geum-ee, and becomes conflicted over whether or not she should stay with them as the film progresses.To say that the quality of Yobi, the Five-Tailed Fox is mixed would be a bit of an understatement. On the one hand, Yobi is fleshed...out enough as such where she is rather likeable as a character when she comes to learn more of the humans she stays with, understand them and bond with Geum-ee. Her bonding with him and the other humans is genuine and the movie devotes enough focus on this development to make it engaging and relatable to audiences.On the other hand though, the movie gets into the bad habit of trying to cram in too many plot threads and attempts at symbolism into its 85-minute run. The introductions of the mysterious shadow and the fox hunter created unnecessary attempts at conflict within the movie with villainous characters that could have just as easily not been implemented into the film. Also, the movie's attempts at implanting symbolism involving American Indian and Eastern mythical and religious influences comes across as rather heavy-handed, usually don't lead anywhere and often get lost in the convoluted story developments that take place with Yobi's development and the mentioned villainous conflicts she gets into. Also, I have to feel a bit befuddled over why this movie has aliens in it when a good chunk of its storytelling and symbolism is influenced through Eastern folklore.Overall, I would say my reception to this is a bit mixed. While I did enjoy the focus on Yobi's bonding with the humans at the school she sneaks into, the movie seemed to lose track of what type of story it wanted to tell with its addition of aliens, villainous characters and folklore symbolism that could have just as easily been left out of this film to focus on Yobi coming to understand humans. It's still worth a look if you want to see more Korean animated films, but it would be hard to get into multiple watches of it. out enough as such where she is rather likeable as a character when she comes to learn more of the humans she stays with, understand them and bond with Geum-ee.

Wacky hijinks ensue when the naughtiest alien gets taken by a little girl from the school. Although Yobi is supposed to rescue him, she finds herself getting distracted with the kids and enjoying her life as a human.The story drags often and I skipped ahead in the beginning, but toward the middle, it recaptured my interest...(well, actually I still kept skipping). I think the film tried to juggle way too many plot points instead of just focusing on one. The ending is also bittersweet.Also, if the film would have cut those two annoying dance scenes to that corny song it would have made the film 25% better. This is just a personal peeve, but that song irked me.Characters:The magical aliens friends or whatever were annoying. The whole mismatched crew of them reminded me of Despicable Me's “minions” because they both are only tolerable in small doses.Yobi was fine. She acted like a regular energetic kid, but she fell for Geum-ee, the wannabe comedian, out of nowhere. Well, I will give some her slack, after all, kid crushes don't have to have a reason.I particularly liked the teacher the most. I have a soft spot for the “tough teachers that love their kids trope.”I would have liked to know more about the bossy girl beyond her being a crybaby.Animation:The character designs are generic-looking and bland, but it fits the setting. I don't like the random CGI because it looks out of place in a flat, 2D world.Sound:I liked some of the background music. It was mostly upbeat and somewhat pop or slow and emotional. Nothing, in particular, stands out, though.From what I heard, the voice-acting was good.Conclusion:I did not enjoy this film, whether because I'm beyond the age of the focus audience or it simply was boring. You can watch and make your own verdict. (well, actually I still kept skipping). I think the film tried to juggle way too many plot points instead of just focusing on one.

Fantasy/magic, an isolated character interacting with the \'Real World\' for the first time, a mix of comedy (slapstick and cerebral), drama, aliens, and a ghost sink.I don\'t know if it was the subtle differences between Korean and Japanese animation that threw me, or the fact that they tried to stuff a full, 12 episode TV series (~288 minutes) into an 80 minute movie.  All I know is that this movie didn\'t click for me.Taken separately, each of the plot devices are great....The problem I had was they tried to stuff too many into the movie.  Had they just kept it simple and let the movie be a simple adventure (ala Spirited Away) with subtle messages, I would have really enjoyed this flick.For me at least, there\'s something off about this film.  If I wasn\'t watching it for the 2017 MAL Anime Watching Challenge, I would have probably dropped it.  I\'ll probably revisit later down the road now that I know to lower my expectations.

Damekko Doubutsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/485/Damekko_Doubutsu,"['Anime about ""useless"" animals. What\'s so interesting?Personally I was  amazed of how the tempers of the characters were represented. These tempers are so typical: tsundere & loser; cynic & egoist; clumsy & cheerful; melancholic & laid-back and many others. All these features are distinctive for different types of people (or animals =) ).But they were mixed up, so we can see agressive hare and shy wolf... And of course a great variety of situations whish were created by this delicious mix.Only one disadvantage: this anime is so short!.. ', ""As the name suggests this anime is about a load of useless animals, or shall I say cute people dressed up in animal suits, as cute animals.The episodes are random and there isn't really a storyline.  It is about these animals being useless and dumb and how their lifestyle in the forest.Not much to say about the sounds.  The opening song is cute though.The animations are cute and funny, a rabbit holding a fag isn't your typical child anime.Overall it's not bad for 26 episodes each episode lasting only 6 minutes.  It is just to waste time though, if I was 10...years younger I would really like this anime.  The only reason I downloaded this in the first place was because I thought the animals were cute!

High School DxD Hero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34281/High_School_DxD_Hero,"['From the depths of fanservicy guilty pleasure of hell makes the return of High School DxD Hero. It’s been nearly 3 years since the last time this anime aired on TV and to be honest, it needed a break after the disastrous third season. High School DxD Born left a bad taste in my mouth after seeing how far the franchise has fallen. Is Hero a chance for the show to redeem itself?The fourth season covers the volume 9 and 10 from the light novels. This didn’t come as a surprise as the franchise has a tendency to build more into the story with established...concepts. To say the least, the franchise isn’t afraid of taking the risk to show off its fan service. Straight from the first episodes, we see the characters return with Issei still being a perverted self-proclaimed “Harem King”. It doesn’t take long for the plot to kick off after they visit Kyoto where a new story puts him in conflict with supernatural entities yet again.Following a formulaic construction of the plot, the first half of the show adapts the 9th volume. We meet a fox girl named Kunou and after a misunderstanding, she pleads for Issei and the others to save her mother. The premise of this arc is incredibly straightforward after Issei realizes the responsibility they need to carry to get the job done. However, the arc is perhaps a bit too predictable and lacks the High School DxD-esque quality as the first two seasons. In other words, I must admit that a few of the first few episodes are too forced. The drama is too serious and didn’t make me care about Kunou as much as I had hoped for. On the other hand, there are still remnants of fun value we can see this season. The fan service returns thanks to the naïve personalities of characters like Xenovia and Irina. Even though Rias and the main cast aren’t there, Issei still gets a face of boobs, ass, and skinship. I say this with honesty that High School DxD is one of the few anime that works creatively well with the fanservice. Without it, the show would lose its identity. Luckily, the show does manage to find its way to bring that out again.Covering the 10th volume, this fourth season manages to find itself well on the path of its roots again. By the time you’ve reached over the half the series, the familiar mood will return almost like yesterday.  It also does a clever job at building up the inevitable battles as Ria’s Team goes up against Sairaorg Bael’s peerage. Remember, this franchise began with a concept known a “Rating Games” that has been a central element in the storytelling. This time, the stakes are more about pride to see which team is better. For Issei himself, there’s also some emotional stakes that he didn’t even realize himself. The fact that after three seasons, he’s still dense as a black hole should come as no surprise to viewers. In one particular episode, Rias directly confronts him about her feelings and we get a half-assed response from the guy. This may rub viewers in the wrong way as the relationship between Issei and Rias has been a central focus in the franchise.The Rating Game itself also featured some comedic moments with the press conference buildup and the actual execution. There’s also some exploitation about the rules of the game to get viewers familiarized again. The actual battles felt more or less like a cheesy mix of underwhelming fighting. In fact, I would say most of them are insignificant that even includes Issei’s in the first rounds. The show only has 12 episodes so it limited itself from achieving full potential. To me, that’s a backstabber to fans of the franchise who wants to get the most from the action. Honestly, I think High School DxD’s action elements has always been one of its weaknesses and from season 4, that didn’t change much either. In some of the final few episodes, business picks up more as Issei confronts Sairaorg himself as we see how dangerous his rival really is.One of the biggest changes of High School DxD Hero is the art style. The first three seasons were adapted by studio TNK that fans are familiar with. However, Passione takes the step this time to animate the project. They are perhaps best known for their work on Rokka no Yuuska and more recently, Citrus. I’m not going to lie, it’s going to take some time to get comfortable with it. The character models looks less detailed and cartoonier especially for the main girls. Don’t get me wrong though. Characters like Rias and Akeno still looks busty like the previous seasons. Even new characters like Yasaka gives the impression of a sexy older type. However, it will take time to get used to the new art style as there’s less details on the fan service. It’s still there especially if you watch the uncensored version with the boobs and ass being thrown at your face. The action still feels the same as the previous seasons though so don’t expect anything that will blow you out the water. Character designs in terms of plot direction improved slightly with an improved transformation of Issei. Similarly, character voice mannerism somewhat evolves this season that’s more noticeable in Rias and Issei. She is able to display her personality at best when together with Issei especially during some of their more emotional scenes. The theme songs still feature a mix of action and fanservice theatrics I’m sure fans are familiar with.Well it’s been nearly three years since I’ve reviewed High School DxD. After the break, I think this show manages to step up slightly up to the plate. However, it’s not a big improvement over the third season and more like a step down compared to the first two. The plot is both easy to predict but hard to recall memorable moments from especially in its first episodes. It tests the viewers’ patience for its main character cast especially with Issei’s role. I also have to say honestly that Issei deserved a personal beating from the way he responded to Rias in that one particular episode. Otherwise, I think the fourth season is still worth the watch especially if you’re a diehard fan of the franchise. High School DxD always felt like it’s about having fun with itself.

Only time will tell that possibility!Now... for my review.Art: 9/10Most of the fans really liked the previous art where the TNK is the one who made that! I also liked that art style of TNK but there is some flaws of it. Like the animation for the fights in the previous seasons, Some of those fight scenes were like a GIF or something like those old anime fight scenes. The thing that I like in TNK\'s were the character design, They are absolutely stunning!Now for the Passione, since they are the one...who are doing this fourth season, I know there are some of you who has a struggle getting used to the art style but try looking at the bright side of it.I will tell you the some good sides of this change:Character Design: They\'re using the current character design of the Light Novel. They are really cute for me! Getting used to it will take some time but I assure you they have the reason for this change.Animation: The animation for this season is top notch compared to the previous ones, Just compare the fight scenes of this one to the previous one, Look how amazing the animation of this season! Also the Ecchi scenes are so fluid this time! Stiffness of the Previous is now gone.Old is ""Gold"" but evolution will not take place without ""Change"".Character: 8/10I know the focus of this series is Issei but did you notice that some of the characters in the shadow in the previous seasons is now on the spotlight! The relationships of this season will shock you and also a stepping stone for our harem king?! Maybe? That\'s for you to find out!Sound: 10/10I have simple reason for this. The sound and OST were the same of the Previous Seasons with some new ones but to hear the classics again is priceless! Also, The Opening were catchy and I fell in love in the Ending Song.Story: 9/10I love how they pour some of their budget just to retcon the abomination of Season 3, Really... You will never see an Animation Studio like that everyday, An Animation Studio that will make an EFFORT to make other studio\'s mistake straight again. So... I would like to rate Passione\'s EFFORT 10/10!Now, They are following the Vol. 9&10 of the LN but some of the abomination of S3 is making an effect this season so some things will also a little bit confusing for those anime-only. That\'s why I rate the story 9/10.Enjoyment: 9/10The humor of this anime will be the same for me even though they changed the studio, nothing beats the humor it gives for me! It maybe sounded a little bit biased on my side but that\'s how I felt while watching this season. so I\'m being honest here. :)Overall: 9/10I\'ve watched countless Action/Ecchi/Harem/Romance animes out there but this one is one of the best for me! The girls of this series were just perfect, Hyoudou Issei is like a dense type MC of a Harem series but he has reasons for it, Unlike those other MCs that are so dense af out of nowhere.

SEE YOU AGAIN IN THE NEXT SEASON OPPAI DRAGON!!!', ""BoobiesSweet, now I got your attention.All right, if you are into High School DxD, you’re gonna like this. If you are not, then why are you still here? If you haven’t seen it, then go watch the other seasons first, otherwise you’re going to be clueless.In fact, for those who have mostly forgotten, I’ll give a 4-sentence summary of what previously happened(Then I'll immediately get into the review.):Issei has the Sacred Gear of Red Dragon Emperor DDraig. He has become a demon of the Gremory Household, most of which consists of girls who are attracted to him. Already he’s gone up against numerous...villains, having his powers developed to the point of many different abilities, including control of a mecha suit. (Juggernaut being the unstable but powerful version, as can be seen in the recent special “Taiikukan-ura no Holy”.)(Characters)To be honest, I’m not surprised the girls are into Issei. He’s got a heart of gold, is loyal, brave and goofy. And a bumbling pervert. Which is fitting for a series this fond of boobs. (Also makes for a funny character flaw.) All of the girls have felt empowered by him at some point in previous seasons, and personally, I kinda like him too. Although, I have to admit that their attraction to him sometimes gets turned up to near-absurd levels you only see in ecchi harems. Whether that’s a bad thing or not depends on you and how you interpret the Rule of Sexy (“It doesn’t really have to make sense as long as it is sexy.”).Since most of the character development has been done in previous seasons, they don’t really get much in Hero. They are still the same however, as they should. Issei is still lewd but nice, Asia is still cutesy, Akeno is still teasing, Koneko is still kuudere and Rias is still Rias. As for the minor characters, there are only a few who are getting considerable screentime. One of them being Rossweisse, since she’s relatively new here. Then there are the antagonists, one of them stemming from the clusterfuck that is the Khaos Brigade and who is underdeveloped. The other one is Sairaorg Bael, who is pretty cool, being someone without powers becoming strong by training and who feels the need to prove himself because of this, and whose character is pulled off well enough. Anytime when the characters do get fleshed out a little it can make for endearing moments, which is probably one of the reasons people like the series.(Animation)Now, the biggest concern that I have heard from those who are into DxD, is that the animation has changed. Particularly the character designs, which have been simplified. Since apparently BorN wasn’t quite the success, the series has gone from TNK to relatively new studio Passione, who then used an artstyle of their own. Some people may have found the design change difficult to accept.However, simplifying the design has somewhat worked in the shows favour. By doing this, it has become easier to animate, and it gives the characters a softer look. (Being a fanservice show, having them look softer… might definitely work in favour of the show. The women are also quite voluptuous.) On top of that, it manages to blend in nicely with the general atmosphere and style of the show.On the other side, it doesn't have great animation per se. While it does look fine overall, with bright colours and decent fights, occasionally there are small issues like characters without shadows, awkward walking animation or facial expressions or something that just doesn’t look that smooth. It can be distracting, but it doesn’t necessarily have a large effect on the overall quality, since most of the parts that need to look good, look good. So yeah, mostly some fights and fanservice.(Story)Quick summary: “Issei and some of the characters go on a Kyoto school trip, and there are a bunch of fox-youkai over there. Something is going on with that.”Two episodes in, and I began to see that it was fast-paced as heck. There can be little time to breath in between scenes, and sometimes I would forget what just happened. However, the story isn’t that complex, so it’s not too hard to follow. As usual with DxD, the story isn’t anything impressive, but still just engaging enough to keep you watching and when combined with the characters, it actually makes you care.(Sound)Ok, so DxD still has a soundtrack that fits with its style. This being the nice beats and bittersweet melodies. When this music gets played under a scene, it tends to fit the tone and not be overshadowing anything, while being turned up a notch when the moment calls for it. The OP and ED songs are nothing special really, although the ED has some memorable visuals. Not to say that these are bad, since they are pleasant to listen to. As for the voice acting, the people are just doing their job and are doing it well.(Enjoyment/Overall)The series manages to do what sold it in the first place. For most of us, this would not only be the sexy fanservice, but also at least two or three likeable characters and an even more likeable protagonist, a story that manages to be engaging, and just overall decent animation and soundtrack. High School DxD is kinda silly, but knows what it is and has a lot of charm. This season itself is not necessarily better than previous seasons, but not much worse either. For most of the time, while it had some small issues, it was entertaining. And finally, that is what counts the most. villains, having his powers developed to the point of many different abilities, including control of a mecha suit. (Juggernaut being the unstable but powerful version, as can be seen in the recent special “Taiikukan-ura no Holy”.)(Characters)To be honest, I’m not surprised the girls are into Issei. He’s got a heart of gold, is loyal, brave and goofy. And a bumbling pervert. Which is fitting for a series this fond of boobs. (Also makes for a funny character flaw.) All of the girls have felt empowered by him at some point in previous seasons, and personally, I kinda like him too. Although, I have to admit that their attraction to him sometimes gets turned up to near-absurd levels you only see in ecchi harems. Whether that’s a bad thing or not depends on you and how you interpret the Rule of Sexy (“It doesn’t really have to make sense as long as it is sexy.”).Since most of the character development has been done in previous seasons, they don’t really get much in Hero. They are still the same however, as they should. Issei is still lewd but nice, Asia is still cutesy, Akeno is still teasing, Koneko is still kuudere and Rias is still Rias. As for the minor characters, there are only a few who are getting considerable screentime. One of them being Rossweisse, since she’s relatively new here. Then there are the antagonists, one of them stemming from the clusterfuck that is the Khaos Brigade and who is underdeveloped. The other one is Sairaorg Bael, who is pretty cool, being someone without powers becoming strong by training and who feels the need to prove himself because of this, and whose character is pulled off well enough. Anytime when the characters do get fleshed out a little it can make for endearing moments, which is probably one of the reasons people like the series.(Animation)Now, the biggest concern that I have heard from those who are into DxD, is that the animation has changed. Particularly the character designs, which have been simplified. Since apparently BorN wasn’t quite the success, the series has gone from TNK to relatively new studio Passione, who then used an artstyle of their own. Some people may have found the design change difficult to accept.However, simplifying the design has somewhat worked in the shows favour.

It is easily one of my favorite anime franchises and has consistently been a good watch. Unfortunately, this is not the case for High School DXD Hero. After three years of waiting, I daresay that it would have been better for the series to have stayed dead. That\'s how bad it is.[""Too late. 3 years too late.""]First of all, let\'s discuss the smaller elephant in the room. This sequel took 3 years to be aired. I\'m well aware of the complications that occurred during its production. Transferring a popular franchise to another studio must be a lot of work. Unfortunately,...I, as a viewer, do not care WHY my long-awaited anime is trash. I only care that it IS trash. Oh yeah, did I tell mention that this season is TRASH?[The bigger elephant]The artstyle change was jarring to say the least. The fans all collectively prayed to Michael-sama asking that he forgive the studio. They probably thought: ""Hey, maybe they softened up the coloring to make the animation more fluid or something."" Nope. Not the case. I cannot get over how bad the art is this season. The models are off. The characters look ugly. Hell, sometimes it looks like they didn\'t even try.Let\'s use a screenshot for reference. You, reader, go to 4:14 in Episode 8 and tell me what is wrong with that image. For those of you who are too lazy to do so, I\'ll tell you. Issei isn\'t even looking at the character who he\'s supposed to be looking at. In fact, he isn\'t looking at anything. This is absolutely pathetic- and no- it isn\'t a one-off occurrence. This type of shit happens all throughout this season. How does a show come out looking this rushed after 3 years of waiting?[Why? Fucking why?]Why did this season turn out so shitty? Why did it take three years? Why did the studio bother releasing this trash? Well, I can answer all of these questions as I have before. The anime community is shit. Everyone here is willing to accept whatever is put in front of them citing ""exclusivity"" as an excuse for their undying support. It\'s like paying to eat trash because food is scarce- but the food isn\'t scarce, you just couldn\'t be fucked to ask for it. Consumers should demand quality from the producers. Obviously, these studios only care about money- that\'s why this shoddily-assembled piece of filth was released. That\'s also why you NEED to demand more from studios. Shows that notoriously don\'t have a 2nd season will likely suffer the same fate as this show. As the studio executives hear fans desperately crying for ANYTHING to be released as a sequel, what are they to do but take those idiots up on the offer?I can\'t stand that this show has a 7.49 rating. ""Hey, boss, these idiots took the bait!"". Yeah, this community did take the bait. Fuck it all, man. I, as a viewer, do not care WHY my long-awaited anime is trash. I only care that it IS trash.

Now, ok , this sequel has a different studio and it\'s under studio Passione, it may have a new character designer but the thing about this sequel was instead of moving forward with Issei\'s relationship with Rias, it rather took a couple of steps backward. Also the relationship of the guy\'s harem has taken a new twist were the harem itself no longer competes for the guys affection.The only thing that hasn\'t change was the guy\'s...""OPPAI"" rant, that was rather annoying that there isn\'t an episode where you won\'t hear the word ""OPPAI"" and what\'s worst was they even added child porn in it by doing a children\'s song about, you\'ve guess it ""OPPAI"". The addition of a loli Ravel only adds to this anime\'s child porn shit, the story may have been different but then again, it was still the usual when we have Issei being this ""OPPAI"" Dragon was at first up against Cao cao and his posses and the later Sairaog who was just picking a fight and as usual it\'s up to Rias\' posses to deal with them just like in season 1, in fact it was more like a repeat of season 1  which I have to say the season 3\'s story plot was much better than this sequel . On the fanservices, nothing has change there is the usual panty service , boob service , swimsuit service and the usual onsen service, so frankly this sequel was still the same shit but different illustration so here were my ratings:Story- Poor 3: Basically the story plot was almost like that of one part from season 1 to one part of season 3, where this sequel has become bad to worse.Art-Mediocre 5 : Cu\'z despite of having a different illustrator, the usual fanservices where still there, and by this time one would have been watching the uncensored version, and at the same time  hounds would be going bananas over it.Sound- Very Good 8: That was for the opening theme where it really does fit one element of this story plot ""SWITCH ON, SWIIITCH OOOOON!""Character- Pathetic 1: Since Issei\'s relationship with Rias has taken a couple of steps backwards and he\'s no longer this harem king wanna be despite of those girls throwing themselves on him in their birthday suits.Enjoyment-Dreadful 2: I feel like that I wanna go there in Japan look for the people who made this sequel and give them a BOOOSTOOOOO amount of whooping in their asses.Overall-Pathetic 1: Well by the looks of it another sequel will be in the making when we see Azazel having a secret, that he doesn\'t tell Rias and her lackeys. So the question is ""When?""

So the question is ""When?""', 'What\'s with the high rating here? This series has clearly fallen from its predecessors.Issei still happens to be that ""rash"" MC which I\'ve come to be annoyed by. If anything happens to his friends no matter how trivial, especially matters of the sexual-related sort, sends him off into a flying rage. Because, this happens to be his two states - ""Oppai"" or a "" crazy-angry"" nutter. Moreover, whenever he\'s bombarded with these ""oppai"" the other female characters undress and jump after him. These scenes used to be funny - not anymore. The charm and the reason I enjoy the ecchi genre is because of...the rarity and sex appeal, however, situations like these happen so frequently its irritating. Some of their internal problems happen to be extremely stupid and dragged on(MINOR SPOILERS FROM S2/S3)- like the one where Rias wants Issei to call her by her first name, this has been going on since around season 2. Get with it! But the most irritating thing here is the cringe, the stupid expression on Issei\'s face when he sees a women\'s breast or when the characters get some armour or something of the sort - proof that the animators are focusing on making it cool rather than focusing on the overall picture because apparently to the marketing department the audience happens to be a bunch of high-libido 11-13 year old who like to see something cool and want to see a screen full of boobs, right?I\'d rather give it 5 out of 10 but Akeno and Koneko happen to be my favourites so I\'ll give it a 6. This is just for S4 but seeing the series overall, and harem being one of my favourite genres, I\'ve seen way, way better harem animes that this one.(Sorry for the spelling errors, if any; my keyboards going through a bit of a problem because of which I\'ve written this several times already, and it has gotten a bid tedious so I stopped focusing on spellings.) the rarity and sex appeal, however, situations like these happen so frequently its irritating.

Some of the differences from the previous 3 seasons are1) The characters look different for example they have a little bump around their triangle shaped chins in some scenes that makes the chin look crooked, the shadowing on the characters faces looks different too, the scene where Rias was naked in bed in the end of episode 1 next to Issei her leg looked huge from the side view.2) In some scenes the detail on the characters is so bad that it looks like a little kid drew them.3) Issei is made to act more like a cartoon character in season 4 by puffing out smoke from his nose when he gets aroused, getting more nose bleeds, and making goofy perverted faces when hes aroused which makes him seem like a much less of a heroic character with epic dragon armor and more of a goofy pervert who got into a very lucky harem position.4) They keep introducing new villains in each episode and then talking about ""past fights"" they had with Issei but their completely new characters that were not shown in seasons 1-3, they should introduce the characters properly instead of trying to cut corners and reference fights that never happened in the previous seasons of the anime or at least werent shown in the anime version of the show (without reading the light novels or manga).5) The intro and outro videos arent as epic or sexy as in seasons 1-3, they seem more generic.Honestly it feels like im watching a completely different anime instead of the High School DxD I grew to love over Seasons 1-3, I own the Limited Edition Funimation releases for the previous 3 seasons but im not sure if I will buy Season 4 or not, I wish they would have kept the same studio that made the previous 3 seasons. It feels like when you follow a show for a long time and grow to love the characters then the next season comes and you find out that the Director changed some of the actors who you grew to love for people that look similar to them in the hopes that the viewer wouldnt notice the difference in actors and keep watching the series, well High School DxD the fans have noticed and we\'re not happy. to a new studio for season 4.The change is studio is very apparent in the art style, animation quality, and scenes for the new anime, and it honestly doesnt feel like im watching the same anime that I grew to love over the previous 3 seasons.

I was so thoroughly disappointed by Born that I almost didn\'t even bother with Hero, and the new art style/character redesigns brought me right to the edge of abandoning ship five minutes into the first episode. But I endured, and I haven\'t been so glad of anything since I realized I can take concubines in CK2.This art style suits the concept of DxD way better than the old one, although it took getting used to. Rounding of faces and the drastic increase in boob sizes are obvious changes right out of the gate, but improvements in movement frames, character...expressions, and increase in color contrast make it a much richer experience. Switching studios really allowed this series to turn 360 degrees and walk away from the total shitshow that was Born.Besides mammoth expansion of honkers, Issei\'s growth as the Titdragon melds well with better jokes and more interesting characters, as well as taking the narrative away from a ""big bad evil"" and refocusing on a tighter problem to solve.

Switching studios really allowed this series to turn 360 degrees and walk away from the total shitshow that was Born.Besides mammoth expansion of honkers, Issei\'s growth as the Titdragon melds well with better jokes and more interesting characters, as well as taking the narrative away from a ""big bad evil"" and refocusing on a tighter problem to solve.

As mentioned its my subjective opinion and I know  a lot of people love the new animation and character design but seeing the ""new"" Asia nearly made me cry.How could they ever possibly fuck up that hard. The artwork from the previous 3 season was beautiful and now I cant even watch the first few episode without hating myself and this world. I am deeply ashamed to be called a...human; just like those fuckheads who ruined Akeno, Asia, Koneko; matter of fact they fucking ruined every single character.I will torture myself through this season but I can guarantee I will not enjoy it. If u dont want to get eye cancer, I would recommend u never even bother to watch season 4.

Thanks for reading!', ""First off, I am a light novel reader, and I love how we get a great adaption, but this season could of been better and my closing notes will detail why.Story 6\\10Before I get crucified, I find volumes 9-10 which this series was covering the most boring while reading. I was also getting used to all the changes because of a new studio so it was hard to be engrossed as well. Since season 3 was not fully cannon and missed a ton of important parts, they had to skip a lot so some things were skipped in order to keep cannon which confused every...anime only watcher I talked to, and it was annoying for me too. Examples also being the rating game Sitri VS Gremory.Sound 8\\10 not including old tracks 4\\10The OST of high school dxd is great, but this season added hardly any new tracks and the weakest op and ed. I give dxd 8\\10 overall on sound but judging season 4 tracks alone its bad.Character 9\\10Not really much to say here but the faithfulness to the light novel helped the characters which we all love but some like xenovia just seemed utterly off but thats just one thing. If you are here at 4 season you know the characters are great.Art and animation 3\\10Man on man did the art style start a flame war, I saw it divide the fandom. I think the new art style is okay and if it was just the art I had a problem with, I would give this a higher score but we will get to the animation in a second.They switched up character designs, my waifu akeno looks derpy and the full changes they have done to characters turned me off the most as it did with others but some look fine with the new art style like asia, rosweisse and others and some like Akeno and Rias look worse. The old animation by TNK looks more mature and the fanservice in the last seasons made it look as if all the characters chest looked different and different body types, now the boobs look almost the same.The animation is bad, if it was good I would give this a 7\\10 and say I am just not a fan of the new art style and leave it but its bad. The facial expressions are done horribly, lots of standstill images, choppy at times, action looks like something from ten years ago and fight scenes were choreographed better in the past. Character designs as well as them using a 3d painted background while exploring kyoto in episode 3 or 4 which looked awful. Animation was bad and with getting used to the utterly 180 art style changed that took away from the show. Part of me wants to give this a 2 almost.Enjoyment 5\\10Honestly, this season did not have me looking forward to the next episode at all unlike the other seasons of dxd, the art style changed took time to get used to and I still do not like it since many people were drawn to the gorgeous art style of TNK and we get this boring plain art style thats not fun to look at all. The facial expressions I noticed right away like others and once you noticed it, you can't ignore it. If you do not know what I am talking about count your blessings because you will notice it next time you see it or rewatch it. Rating game was not as fun as others as well as this was the most boring parts of the LN for me. I will say that dxd is one of my favorite animes of all time, but I really can't care too much for the anime at the moment so I may stick to just reading it. With the flame wars and backlash on this season however I don't think we might get a season 5.Overall 6\\10I wish this season was better, I really do. I even prefer the non cannon season 3. The art style divided the fandom and I would even go as far to call the fandom more toxic than its ever been. The reason we have a new studio is because TNK was not following the LN properly so the series got handed over to passione, the studio that really should not have it out of all studio's I could think of. anime only watcher I talked to, and it was annoying for me too.

The first season was a good stepping stone to the series, applying all the world building as well as Hyodou\'s weaknesses to set us off, though the fanservice vs. tension did get in the way but nonetheless the first season was getting used to balancing it. ""New"" was dove in deep...to it\'s supporting characters, from Yuuto to Akeno as well as expanding the world building of the underworld and heaven in the process. BoRN was expanding even further on the the fact that legends and myths are REAL in High School DxD\'s world thus they become allies and villains set out to do their plans just with some rocky character development here and there especially from Hyoudou himself and now in Hero well...Ohh and LA is Team Akeno by the way anyways carrying on...Because of the retcon Hero immediately did, LA DID welcome it as LA was indifferent to BoRN\'s ending as it DID come out of nowhere but was melodramatic as all hell in the process, Hero\'s beginning fixed that to say the least.So from that Hero leads into the ""Kyoto arc"" as well as the ""Rating Game with Sairaorg Bael"". The Kyoto arc leads into the previous villain in a previous season of Cao Cao voiced by Kosuke Toriumi, the leader of the Khaos Brigade as well as new characters Kunou voiced by Sora Tokui a kitsune youkai trying to find her mother which the Occult Club (Second Years anyways) finds while on their field trip to Kyoto. To say the least the Kyoto arc feels similar to BoRN\'s structuring of plot, where a large threat arrives and where Hyodou and the gang needs to stop them from enacting their plans in the process, LA was fine with the Kyoto arc and was it was presented as well as the character development and improvement to the Second Years\' power dynamic (plus the addition of screentime to Roseeweisse  to sub in for Akeno..well LA anyways), plus the villain of this arc IS such a huge threat that links in as to why they are in Kyoto as well as their plans that involved Kunou\'s mother and linking all this together was great, that and a mystery of a mass groping incident which has links to Hyodou\'s growing power. ALL in all, Kyoto arc was decent and reflecting the previous season\'s callbacks and structuring.If Kyoto arc was reflecting BoRN\'s great points, then the Rating Game with Sairaorg was a better version of the first season\'s Rating Game. See this arc was focusing on three things, Hyodou and Rias\' relationship and development to Sairaorg as a character. Hyodou and Ria\'s relationship by all means was ALOT of people\'s problems which was encased by Hyodou\'s denseness to Rias\' advances especially in BoRN but Hyoudou is such a harem seeker and wants to help anyone as possible (harem or not) that this kind of mindset gives a gaping hole on Rias which Rias\'s outburst was warranted, she was more or less feeling left out because she was ""President"" in Hyoudou\'s eyes. To that, LA knows what most of you will say that ""Hyoudou is and ALWAYS dense, he doesn\'t change"", actually Hero and by extension from the start of the second season, though he has the perverseness to him, Hyoudou did grow through all his fights he encountered and learned from that to being the best fighter and protector to the Rias family in the process...he DID grow and move on but with the lingering guilt and fear he still has on the first season which Hyoudou by the end of this season...he moves on and finally he finally takes the hint and thus Hyodou FINALLY does and say to Rias after four seasons! The main focus however does go to Sairaorg and he\'s quite different from the many ""blanket evil characters"" Hyodou has meet and his backstory and his goals are VERY similar to Hyoudou himself. Sairaorg by all means has alot of similarities to Hyodou, being a powerful character but is currently unrecognized by the underworld and Sairaorg wanting to gain his notoriety and his family pride back and will do anything for his family (mainly to do with his comatosed mother and wanting to revive her), his not a black or white villain but more like he\'s the friendly rival to Hyodou and someone Hydou wants to strive to be and maybe even beat which is what the climax for Hero leads up to for this arc.Ddraig this season does gets development in the form of Hyodou\'s powers growing exponentially by the means of Hyoudou speaking to the predecessors of the Red Dragon Emperor and this only improves in the world building front but more on Hyodou\'s increasing power and sometimes his beliefs conflicting with his predecessors and seriously considering all the powerful rivals and villains Hero gives us, you KNOW Hyodou grows crazy strong this season to keep up with them. Yes because of this, Hyodou is the only one to stop many of the threats in Hero by the end of all this, but Hero did at least manage to make use of it\'s cast and make screentime for them in terms of battles at least as powercrept Hyodou is. Hyoudou also gets titled as the Boob Dragon and even has his own children kid shows in the underworld due to his notoriety in the underworld and considering High School DxD\'s nature of fanservice in even some of the most tense moments, yes even this becomes a plot point, tonal dissonance sure, but it\'s within the nature of High School DxD to do this...at least for us to breathe in a ways when the batshit crazy battles that does happen.On speaking of the Boob Dragon, well Hero doesn\'t screw around with it\'s fanservice, though if your watching it censored...then....your missing out on some of the fanservicey moments what with Hydou\'s continuously expanding harem trying their luck with Hyodou in the process. Watch Hero uncensored if possible as Hero is unbashed about it\'s fanservice but it\'s to the fourth season...seriously FOURTH, it\'s to be expected.With that, well the animation studio had another change, from TNK to Passione and well ALOT of people didn\'t like the new polished and sleeker character designs but LA was fine with it because at the very least the animation was consistent even it\'s more batshit crazy battles. Passione did a very good job all things considered, from the newer character designs, great battle animation and decent backgrounding reflecting the previous seasons.Voice acting, well LA\'s bias to Shizuka Ito as Akeno but her screentime was VERY small to say the least. but with the original voice cats back again as well as some new ones like Sora Tokui as Kunou and Asuka Nishi as Ravel Phoenix, but LA would most probably give MVP to Yoko Hikasa as Rias this season not by sheer screentime but Rias went through ALOT of stuff this season even during the Kyoto arc and that Yoko Hikasa just really did a great job once again reprising her role as Rias and giving us great range. Overall with the huge cast of characters new and old, the voice cast of High School DxD was expectedly great.Hero seemed to have learned from it\'s previous season\'s mistakes while at the same time greatly improving on it\'s strengths in the process, from Hyodou and Rias\' relationship, giving us high stakes and new settings while keeping the nature of High School DxD in the process and finally giving us something of a satisfying ending in which it can definitely lead to something more in another season if possible but if not, still allowing Hero to be a great installment to the series. In terms of seasons, LA did find Hero to be better than New, but it\'s on par or maybe even surpassing BoRN because Hero just hit all the sweet spots in terms of characters and plot in which BoRN couldn\'t hold out by the end but still did good on it\'s characters.ALOT of people watch High School DxD for the ""plot"", but High School DxD Hero clearly shows it can be much more than that. to it\'s supporting characters, from Yuuto to Akeno as well as expanding the world building of the underworld and heaven in the process. BoRN was expanding even further on the the fact that legends and myths are REAL in High School DxD\'s world thus they become allies and villains set out to do their plans just with some rocky character development here and there especially from Hyoudou himself and now in Hero well...Ohh and LA is Team Akeno by the way anyways carrying on...Because of the retcon Hero immediately did, LA DID welcome it as LA was indifferent to BoRN\'s ending as it DID come out of nowhere but was melodramatic as all hell in the process, Hero\'s beginning fixed that to say the least.So from that Hero leads into the ""Kyoto arc"" as well as the ""Rating Game with Sairaorg Bael"".

But this shit. Season 4, legit 180 turn in the completely wrong dimension. Here are some reasons why.Reason 1: THE ACTUAL GOOD CHARACTERS ARE GONE FOR LIKE 4 EPISODES- Rias and Akeno are my favorite, but I am forced to endure 4 episodes in a row...with their fucking bath cameos, know I like them and all but I prefer watching their interactions with Issei and I am sick af of watching them fucking complain that he is gone.Reason 2: Issei... I dont know when the fuck you are ever going to learn from your fucking mistakes. Like, jesus how many more fucking times we gotta do the same shit. Some guy kicks ur ass, you ask for boobs and then u get powerful. I understand that thats the whole premise of the show. But for fucks sake this is their fourth season if we are throwing the whole fucking plot out the window at least have some character development.Reason 3: I was drained by the time I was on the tenth episode, I was already pissed with the whole ""oh why doesnt he call me Rias thing."" like bitch just fucking ask him. I know that in the finale she said ""Oh I didnt have the courage""... like hello, you pressed ur fucking naked ass body against him the first fucking time you met him yet you cant have the fucking courage to legit just ask him to call you by your frucking name. Like hello what kind of fucking monstrosity does that entail.In conclusion, prepare to see the biggest fucking ball drop in terms of disappointment when you watch this season. Like if it werent for the confession at the end and the nice epsiode 1 that we had, I wouldve flat out given this shit a goddamn 3 like it was that fucking horrible. Whoever took High School DxD needs to get a boost right to the goddamn nuts cause they just fucking cucked the rest of us into the next goddamn dimension. with their fucking bath cameos, know I like them and all but I prefer watching their interactions with Issei and I am sick af of watching them fucking complain that he is gone.Reason 2: Issei...

"", 'Note: I watched this series in the English dub, I have read the light novels, and I’m taking episode 0 into consideration for this review.Coming off the back of a 3 year break from the disastrous butchering that forced the author to retcon the events of S3 in his DxD DX series, High School DxD Hero is the fourth continuation of the light novel series. DxD is regarded as one of the best ecchi series out there with its raunchy ecchi scenes, great cast of characters and their dynamics, very good storytelling and worldbuilding to compliment it. Taking the helm of the anime’s production is...a relatively new studio called Passione, and that means a new director, new music, and most noticeably, a new character designer. Just how well did they faithfully adapt the series?Before the season started, a special that aired as season four’s episode 0, for a very important reason. In the third season of DxD, TNK decided to make several altercations to the story and the order of its events and the novels themselves. The order of the novels that were adapted were 5-->7-->6, and what’s worse is that they tried to fit all three of those volumes into just 12 episodes, cutting a lot of content, character development and dialogue, and some important fights, narratively speaking. This episode acted as a tool to retcon the final four episodes in order to put the series’ narrative back on the right path for future adaptations, as the what the final 4 episodes could have done is put the series on an entirely different path. As a fan of the novels, I was very pleased to see the new studio fixed up the mess of the previous’, probably at the request of the author himself. Although this was fixed and follows the novels really closely, there was a lot of relevant information that was never adapted which played into this season, with the events being mentioned a few times (like the Sitri vs Gremory rematch or Beelzebub improving Issei’s evil pieces). To fully experience the series and to actually understand what went on, I implore you to read volumes 5, 6 & 7, they’ll definitely be worth your time if you’re interested in the series and its story (which is great btw).DxD Hero aired right after episode 0, which the series adapted volumes 9 and 10 of the light novel series, which splits the season into two, having 6 episodes to focus on each event. Volume 9 focuses on the trip to Kyoto and the fight against the Hero Faction. When Issei arrives at Kyoto, he and his friends get into a fight against Kunou in what is a misunderstanding. They then run into the Hero Faction, who are plotting to summon Great Red. This fight and victory against the Hero Faction gave them the opportunity to form an alliance with the youkai. Featuring the youkai adds a lot of depth into the series’ worldbuilding since there are many different mythologies that are featured within this story, it’s unique in its attempt to feature western and Japanese religion and mythology as a plot point, as it’s hardly been done before in any medium. Although the plotline and objectives are easy to follow, it’s still enjoyable to be able to see the events unfold and lead into the next part of this season.Volume 10 takes up the second half of Hero, which entails the rating game battle between Rias and Sairaorg’s groups. Rating games are an essential part of devil culture in this franchise, as it can determine status, power, and wealth within their society, and it’s a great way for the author to pit characters against each other in different battles with specific sets of rules in place. The fight between Rias and Sairaorg is also where this season shines. The highpoint of this series is the final battle between Issei and Sairaorg where emotions ran high and as both of the character evolve throughout the fight, leveling up to more extreme levels of strength. And of course, after a long wait of four seasons, we finally get to see Issei confront his feelings and confess his love to Rias, which I think many shippers would have enjoyed dearly. Both volumes are loaded with info, and that made the speed of the show very fast, it flew through a lot of content in a short amount of time. If it were me, I would’ve spent an extra episode or two, maybe for each novel, to slow things down in order to get used to and flesh out the newly introduced characters and for more time to develop the story. But that’s the cost of only being 12 episodes long.This might be an issue with the previous three seasons as this season felt different compared to them, but this season was actually able to capture the essence and feelings of the novels better than seasons 1-3. Passione was actually able to present the turmoil and PTSD that affects Issei since his death at the hands of Raynare, unlike TNK. In the anime, it may seem like Issei takes too long to decide on what to do, and to go for the move, which might seem typical of a male harem protagonist. But what Issei was actually feeling was fear and regret, being afraid of being harmed again or having the situation backfire. Unless you’ve read the novels, it’s nearly impossible to figure out that Issei was still strongly affected by the events of season 1. You might complain about how this season doesn’t feel like true High School DxD, but I think the first 3 seasons weren’t true to the novels to begin with. Maybe it has to do with how the series was written which may be hard to translate fully into motion picture, but this season was able to hit the mark in its faithfulness to the source material, and I’m overall impressed and pleased with the results.One of the most noticeable changes, and most argued among many fans of this series, is the change in art style. When TNK fucked up and the author got mad, he changed studios in preparation for the next season of DxD, and with that change in studio comes a change in personnel, like director, animators, and character designer. Whilst I liked the old style, and I will miss it a lot, due to the fuckup of S3, we need to accept the changes and move on. What I liked with the change in art is the background designs, as I think they are a million times more visually pleasing and aesthetic than before. A lot of attention to detail is put into the details of drawings, be it of the cities (like Kyoto) or somewhere naturey (the scene with Azazel and Sairaorg after the game), I found them to be a great upgrade to the visual aspect of the series (they make the series brighter and pop out of the screen more).One of the more important changes is with the character designs since the characters look less sharp and more rounded. What I think the character designer was trying to achieve was to match the designs in the novels and their covers as closely as he can, and I think he did quite well, and I quite like the changes. Even if the faces looks kinda fat around the cheek areas and hair not being as sharp as they originally were, this is one of the changes that’ll stay around for a very long time, so it’ll take a while before mostly everyone including myself will get used to them. The females still look as busty and sexy as they did before, so I’m pleased they didn’t do anything to the aspect that makes the series as popular as it is now.The animation in this series isn’t known to be all that good, as it’s often janky and gif-like. Though that couldn’t be said the same about Hero. This season’s animation is a big upgrade, it’s actually decent compared to an average show. Passione put in the effort to make the fights seem more explosive and flamboyant with more frames per second to make the characters’ movements more dynamic and flexible. Since the character designs are easier to draw, the animators were able to do more with what they have at their disposal and focus more on the fights, which are a big aspect of this series. Overall, the fluidity of the animation and character movements were good.Characters are an integral part of this series, as it follows Issei’s journey to becoming a high-ranking devil and the harem king. Even as we’re 4 seasons in, this series continues to churn out new and unique characters from newly revealed factions and mythologies. This series also focuses on the development of Issei resolve and his relationship with Rias. The new characters features the likes of Sairaorg’s team, Kunou and her mother, the Hero Faction, Hades, dragons and dragon kings, the rating game champion, Rosenkreutz, and many more. These characters all have different personalities and powers, so it’s always interesting to see how they interact with each other and with Issei and the others.This season also focuses on the growth of Issei and his relationship with Rias. Since the beginning of the series, Issei has been scarred by the memories of his death at the hands of Raynare, which made him hesitant in most romantic or perverted situation he’s thrusted in. This made quite a few fans complain about him being a pussy for not being able to take advantage of the situation he’s in, or for being as thick as lead, but Issei suffering from his PTSD is overlooked by most anime-only fans since it wasn’t really touched on at all throughout the first three seasons. How many of you knew from the get-go that Issei was suffering from PTSD and that he refrained himself in most sexual situations because of his fear of being betrayed or rejected? It’s only thanks to the efforts of the other girls who reassured Issei that something similar to Raynare will never happen to him again and that they all love him that Issei is able to finally overcome is fears and find it in himself to confess to Rias. I don’t think the previous seasons of the anime gives that fact justice, so I think Passione did a great job of stating the fact of Issei having PTSD (before he got over it), even without having used too much of Issei’s inner monologue and thoughts.The music made the show more dramatic than what I thought it would be, though I have no complaints on that since this is a different outlook on the novels compared to TNK. The music fits quite well with the romance/ecchi scenes, the really deep and emotional moments, and the fights between characters and their hyped up moments. I enjoyed the disco/techno themed OP, but I don’t have anything to say about the ED except for it’s sexy visuals. Overall, I think the music did its job well.I enjoyed this season a lot. As I’m still disappointed about last season’s butchering, as a light novel fan, this a really good adaptation of the story, probably on par as my favorite season alongside seasons 1&2. I watched this in the English dub, and I can say for sure that this series’ comedy gets amplified from a 50 to 1000 thanks to the scriptwriters of the dub. This is a well-crafted and top-tier dub that most people can thoroughly enjoy watching, as the jokes and witty one-liners translate and suits this series really well, and I think this dub trumps the previous three seasons’.You might be hesitant of the changes in the art style since the studio who’s now making this show has changed, but don’t let that deter you from experience what the novels are truly about. You might find the ecchi nice to see, or the story fascinating and intriguing (though that’s probably ruined because of season 3), or you might find the English dub a blast to watch. Whatever the case is, if you like this series or ecchi and harem shows in general because you’re a degenerate like myself, then you’ll definitely enjoy this season. Now it’s hopeful wishing for season 5 to come out soon rather than never (as volumes 11 and 12 are the best in the series).Overall score: 8/10 a relatively new studio called Passione, and that means a new director, new music, and most noticeably, a new character designer. Just how well did they faithfully adapt the series?Before the season started, a special that aired as season four’s episode 0, for a very important reason. In the third season of DxD, TNK decided to make several altercations to the story and the order of its events and the novels themselves. The order of the novels that were adapted were 5-->7-->6, and what’s worse is that they tried to fit all three of those volumes into just 12 episodes, cutting a lot of content, character development and dialogue, and some important fights, narratively speaking. This episode acted as a tool to retcon the final four episodes in order to put the series’ narrative back on the right path for future adaptations, as the what the final 4 episodes could have done is put the series on an entirely different path. As a fan of the novels, I was very pleased to see the new studio fixed up the mess of the previous’, probably at the request of the author himself. Although this was fixed and follows the novels really closely, there was a lot of relevant information that was never adapted which played into this season, with the events being mentioned a few times (like the Sitri vs Gremory rematch or Beelzebub improving Issei’s evil pieces). To fully experience the series and to actually understand what went on, I implore you to read volumes 5, 6 & 7, they’ll definitely be worth your time if you’re interested in the series and its story (which is great btw).DxD Hero aired right after episode 0, which the series adapted volumes 9 and 10 of the light novel series, which splits the season into two, having 6 episodes to focus on each event. Volume 9 focuses on the trip to Kyoto and the fight against the Hero Faction. When Issei arrives at Kyoto, he and his friends get into a fight against Kunou in what is a misunderstanding. They then run into the Hero Faction, who are plotting to summon Great Red. This fight and victory against the Hero Faction gave them the opportunity to form an alliance with the youkai. Featuring the youkai adds a lot of depth into the series’ worldbuilding since there are many different mythologies that are featured within this story, it’s unique in its attempt to feature western and Japanese religion and mythology as a plot point, as it’s hardly been done before in any medium. Although the plotline and objectives are easy to follow, it’s still enjoyable to be able to see the events unfold and lead into the next part of this season.Volume 10 takes up the second half of Hero, which entails the rating game battle between Rias and Sairaorg’s groups. Rating games are an essential part of devil culture in this franchise, as it can determine status, power, and wealth within their society, and it’s a great way for the author to pit characters against each other in different battles with specific sets of rules in place. The fight between Rias and Sairaorg is also where this season shines. The highpoint of this series is the final battle between Issei and Sairaorg where emotions ran high and as both of the character evolve throughout the fight, leveling up to more extreme levels of strength. And of course, after a long wait of four seasons, we finally get to see Issei confront his feelings and confess his love to Rias, which I think many shippers would have enjoyed dearly. Both volumes are loaded with info, and that made the speed of the show very fast, it flew through a lot of content in a short amount of time.

Season 4 is outstanding and before watching this I didn\'t have big expectations but how foolish I was to think like that...Studio Passione despite changing the art style managed to give this show some substance, created a fitting emotional atmosphere  for exposing the character\'s bonds, a better presentation for the characters and managed to give more screen time to one of the most badass characters Azazel. Another reason to check this season out beside Azazazel is Sairaoug and goddam he is one of the manliest characters from this show! Why? Because like others who rely on sacred gears and...other stuff this man fights using his bare fists and his overwhelming fighting aura..A man with honor ,a man of his word who respects his opponents  giving everything he has during a fight!Issei and Rias\'s bond in this season goes beyond master servant and they finally managed to get to a starting point in their new relationship....And what I like and always will love from this anime are the girls who aren\'t like those stupid stereotypes who say ""Die"" or ""Baka"" after the main character sees them naked or half naked in contrary the girls are the ones who almost jump on Issei(Lucky bastard...) with their beautiful shaped breasts who will make any man jealous.....As for the characters\'s traits no worry this season keeps up the good tradition and you will see your beloved Xenovia keeping up the good work in making babies with the red emperor, Koneko healing Issei wounds , Akeno sucking the poison from his body and etc...The story is not something overwhelming or outstanding it\'s the typical power-up main character who fights the other power-up characters but in this season their are some moments who give a good reason  Why and for Who Issei is fighting . Is enjoyable so what do you want more? Plus the beautiful girls will put a smile on your face after a bad day....There are some emotional moments in this show that  gave me a nice surprise, some fights were predictable but damn  enjoyable I won\'t deny that. The ""Emperor Boob"" stuff was kinda out of place sometimes but I am glad it didn\'t ruined the heartwarming moments and the emotional atmosphere created around the characters. I think what I liked the most from this season is how this show managed to go into Issei\'s mind during his fight with Sairaoug depicting his thoughts, emotions and reasons for why is he standing there.Give it a try and don\'t listen to those rumours about the art style being bad in contrary for me the new  art style  made characters like Xenovia, Irina, Asia and Koneko look better than their previous designs....This show is damn enjoyable and the fanservice is done well and this is coming from someone who doesn\'t watches this kind of shows but appreciates what this season has accomplished so far! other stuff this man fights using his bare fists and his overwhelming fighting aura..A man with honor ,a man of his word who respects his opponents  giving everything he has during a fight!Issei and Rias\'s bond in this season goes beyond master servant and they finally managed to get to a starting point in their new relationship....And what I like and always will love from this anime are the girls who aren\'t like those stupid stereotypes who say ""Die"" or ""Baka"" after the main character sees them naked or half naked in contrary the girls are the ones who almost jump on Issei(Lucky bastard...) with their beautiful shaped breasts who will make any man jealous.....As for the characters\'s traits no worry this season keeps up the good tradition and you will see your beloved Xenovia keeping up the good work in making babies with the red emperor, Koneko healing Issei wounds , Akeno sucking the poison from his body and etc...The story is not something overwhelming or outstanding it\'s the typical power-up main character who fights the other power-up characters but in this season their are some moments who give a good reason  Why and for Who Issei is fighting .

Of course not but what matters is having fun, right?Music 6/10:The first opening is very good and has other very good songs but nothing out of the ordinary in my opinion.Animation and art style 7/10: The animation is not the best I\'ve seen but it\'s enough to be pleasant, the art style from the 1st to the 3rd season is very good I really like that old style, the fourth season at the beginning I even thought about dropping the anime because of the change but then I started to like it.9/10 Enjoyment:If it\'s the best anime I\'ve ever seen? Not even close but it\'s one of my favorites despite all its negative aspects was the anime that motivated me to like anime again, and I\'m very grateful for that.The battles are very emotional except for the 2nd season.Finally, I\'ll give a note to all seasons:season 1 8/10season 2 7/10season 3 9/10season 4 8/10Overall 9/10Thanks for reading and I highly recommend it if you think you might like the anime. point, I really like the expectation that the anime gives us of seeing the protagonist become the strongest demon and all the problems and adversities that come along make everything even more exciting.Although the fights are a little obvious it\'s just how anime works most of the time the protagonist wins, anyway the fights are amazing.9/10 Characters:In my opinion the strong point of highschool DXD, all characters have a well explained backstory that is often what gives rise to events throughout the story (spoiler) such as the death of the yuta ""family"", or the attempt kidnapping koneko\'s sister or even akeno\'s father.But my favorite character is without a doubt the character Issei (protagonist), fun, hardworker and fighting spirit.The most well written character?

Yet hero seems adamant about falling short of expectations set by its predecessors.*I AM NOW GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW SHITTY THE BREAST DESIGN IN THIS SEASON IS*As i watched through this season of Dxd, it is obvious that the new director/art director is probably a virgin that have not seen boobs in real life. Note this has nothing to do with the new art style despite my preference for the older style. This is extremely noticeable when you compare Akeno from Born...to Hero; for some reason, the team decided that her breast wasnt big enough and have to bring it to the point of those in hentai. The breast and physics animation is comparable to that of Shinmai Maou no Testament. If you have no qualms with how breast are shaped there, you\'ll have no issue with this season.*I AM DONE TALKING ABOUT BREAST DESIGNS*Art style has taken a new change which made me thought that the studio would be able to play this into their advantage and have more fluid animation/ jiggle scenes. I was wrong. Despite the soft designs and character marking, animation is comparable to that of season 1\'s choppy cuts. This new art style is a waste on this studio and its directors.Story wise, dxd has been going downhill since season 3 whereby there have been wasted opportunity to create exciting conflicts between the protagonist and adversaries. For this season, there are 2 main arcs, Hero factions in kyoto and the Bael family arc. Both arc are extremely detached from one another whereby consequences from one seems to play little effect to everything outside the dxd universe. There will be several instances where you may question the rational behind the character\'s actions (ie issei firing a beam at Cao cao for the sake of ""landing a hit"") and be given no resolution. The main attraction of the action aspect of dxd was its ""chess"" game and how underdogs/weaker forces are able to turn the tide. This season follows the same generic yelling motion as end of ""born"" by having Issei asspull a win because they\'re the good guys. Issei has also grown more powerful that his allies including kiba which downplays all interesting strategy that season 1 had.Issei has grown to be the protagonists that i really dislike in anime. The sort that always talks about perverted stuff but when put into the situation, rejects it for reasons(???).

The characters though lost a lot of appeal to me as they all seem to be the same facial expression wise.New  season[img]https://mei.animebytes.tv/f7d9f48354cb0607ed9192a26796d867aa4d1ec0e6d02f41022636b21536afc7.png[/img][img]https://mei.animebytes.tv/015cef75b5ebca665a06a4393d0091add309178fe84de2322c8e1a028d4816ca.png[/img]I stand tall and say we all appreciate that we have a season 4 I would go as far as to say we are thrilled to have it.  But could the new studio have not followed the art style that was already there with maybe a few tweaks here and there. Someone commented as well that if the art style had been like this since the start that no one would be complaining; and I say that is a very true statement but it\'s not. To switch the  style so dramatically for the 4th season is a turn off for a lot of people even if this is more representative of the LN. I have not read the LN so the anime is my reference point; at that the first 3 seasons are my reference point, so this is a shock to my eyes. Could the new studio not just have done Ep zero in the old art style and recant what the LN intended?[img]https://mei.animebytes.tv/eee0c9c5d5d50da5924cee10a04006e734299583de4991f6880b5a3aa5483786.png[/img][img]https://mei.animebytes.tv/ff787c94d896cb827a17e06deb4296667ae3e719816f3a163bf54a6143bebd52.png[/img]OMG this is not getting any better.

The studio just does not cut it.', ""to start with this is my first review and sorry for my bad British writing.Story: I waited for a long time to watch 4th season of this anime beacause I loved this anime but the new study failed so hard to keep it good like the old study that after seeing that Issei had a fricking oppai song ( that made me feel so much cringe and it was my  top 1 of feeling cringes list), I thought okay I will give a chance and watch more maybye it will be still good but after seeing that he has alot of fricking fans...and he named himself oppai dragon that I died of cringe,rated this anime with 1 point and left this anime, but a couple days later I again started to watch this season and gave another chance yet after a couple episodes he started to having even fricking president summoning power to touch her boobs and summon all of the fricking perverted energy that was op but made me again feel so much cringe so I gave this story 2/10 points.Art: I prefere more of the older art than a new art beacause all of the characters looked sooo fricking good but now Rias is looking like she was a zombie or smth like that and had a fever of -30C, and collors were more better than now but it is still kinda good so I give 5/10 points.Sounds: Sounds hasn't changed at all and I prefered alot, and all of those sounds are made on point so I give 9/10 points.Characters:  all of the characters I liked alot more the older ones than the new ones beacause Issei is now so  fricking lame, Koneko that punched alot Issei was more funnier than now, Rias was so badass. But there is also Akeno and Asia they  haven't chnged so I give 3/10 points .Enjoyment: There was so much cringe that I didn't at all enjoyed even the slightest, characters from interesting and good started to be lame and at a point where I wanted to just stop watching and hang myself so I rated it 2/10 points.Overall: 4/10 points and he named himself oppai dragon that I died of cringe,rated this anime with 1 point and left this anime, but a couple days later I again started to watch this season and gave another chance yet after a couple episodes he started to having even fricking president summoning power to touch her boobs and summon all of the fricking perverted energy that was op but made me again feel so much cringe so I gave this story 2/10 points.Art: I prefere more of the older art than a new art beacause all of the characters looked sooo fricking good but now Rias is looking like she was a zombie or smth like that and had a fever of -30C, and collors were more better than now but it is still kinda good so I give 5/10 points.Sounds: Sounds hasn't changed at all and I prefered alot, and all of those sounds are made on point so I give 9/10 points.Characters:  all of the characters I liked alot more the older ones than the new ones beacause Issei is now so  fricking lame, Koneko that punched alot Issei was more funnier than now, Rias was so badass.

Nice looking 12 episode anime for action, lewd ecchi lovers!!Seeing the fourth season of High School DxD Hero, I saw its modern new artstyle, which caught my eye, making me watch all of the three previous seasons of it. Forcing myself to watch the first three seasons was excruciatingly painful. The first two seasons were painfully annoying to watch and bear, as there was so much netorare,...sexual undertones, outright underlying rape and dark scenes. Combine that with useless MC issei, you get a show where you see a useless kid get carried and watch him suffer and the girls around him to suffer in the darkest ways possible. Over the first two seasons, he barely progresses and gets any more powerful to do anything worth watching. He is actually useless whenever a real problem arises. It was painful to watch and I kept skipping every 5 seconds because it was too painful to see the characters I want to succeed and be useful, be absolutely useless.However, Born and Hero (3rd and 4th season) changed this. First, in Hero, issei ACTUALLY does something. He ACTUALLY is powerful enough to beat up the bad guys, win over the girls and keep them and not be completely useless. There are times when he is so dense and dumb it is painful, but every anime has this, and can be looked over, PLUS, it is not as major as it was before. He makes up for it.The show actually became... ENTERTAINING. Before, I would say the first seasons were barely entertaining, only in the Final 12th episode where issei can finally beat the shit out of the bad guy. The ecchi is good, and well placed on the most part. Before, in the first few episodes, the ecchi was terribly placed. Ex: Asia is dying and we are expecting a tear jerking scene, only to see her fucking boob hanging out for no good reason. It just has boobs in every scene for the sake of having boobs. It\'s not good ecchi, cause it just removes all the effectiveness of the plot. However, in hero, there is less random ecchi in fights, UNLESS iseei is going to power up by touching boobs or using this DRESS BREAK ability, where the ecchi is actually contributing to the plot and adding humor, not making boobs hanging out at terrible times just to have boobs in the scene.Art... now this can be contriversal. Many people liked the first 3 seasons art, claiming it to be ""mature"" and ""more detailed"". I honestly think that in 2018, that artstyle would be outdated. There is hardly any anime today that looks that way anymore, it looks... ""old"". Personally, I don\'t really mind, but I can say that I am definitly a fan of the new art. Looks more easy on the eyes, the girls are more cute, but definitly less ""mature"". The ecchi and lewd scenes are still nice and boobs are still there and well drawn ;).The animation... is well typical, nothing amazing but gets the job done, looks nice for action anime.plot/characters... well this is contriversal. Honestly, if you are watching high school dxd, it prolly isnt for the plot but for the ecchiness. Nonetheless, Issei actually progresses as a character and so do the others. There is romantic relationship development in this season between issei and rias, which is nice, but only in the last episode sadly. but honestly, issei is the only annoying character out of them all, but not as annoying as last 3 seasons. He is bearable now.There is actually a plot somehow. Honestly, if you don\'t look too deep into, as this is an ecchi anime, it is kind of cool and mostly just there for drama and fighting and action scenes. Kind of like naruto or one piece or shounen plots, just there to make fighting scenes and action and adding more girls to the never ending harem.ty for reading :D sexual undertones, outright underlying rape and dark scenes.

And that says a lot.This is a series of reviews of the High School DxD franchise. In this review I add my previous comparisons. Because season 5 isn’t out yet I make this review a conclusive one.As a vivid DxD fan I’m disappointed in season 4 “Hero”. The new animation style was so weird and I couldn’t get used to it. The girls felt more bland and dead. Somehow they knew to remove the main focus (boobies and sexiness) and went all out...for a plot which actually didn’t matter in the first place. If you like High School DxD, you know exactly why you like it. It seems season 4 killed most of the likeable aspects.Likes and dislikesWhat I liked about High School DxD Hero, well not much actually. This show has betrayed itself and backstabbed its fans. But here are some positive aspects. The anime closely follow the main story line of the manga. I didn’t read the manga but I know that the way of telling a story is important to let a manga live. DxD Hero focused so much on plot building that they actually turned it in a generic shonen anime, so if you’re into that, go ahead.The jokes however are not all bad. On top of that they introduced a more interesting side character Sairaorg. The new moves booblingual and the old move dress brake are still amusing and are actually being used tactically. That was a nice surprise.Sometimes I got some goosebumps and the show knows how to hype me up, but only for a bit.What I disliked in the previous seasons is that Asia just ruined every moment with Issei and a girl and acted as a big cock block. Luckily that kinda stopped in this season. Koneko became cuter and I’m rooting for her to become a full blown cat girl. They added Senko to the harem (you can also see her boobies).What I disliked. Well to be frank, the whole show. Okay this sounds a bit harsh, I had minimum enjoyment so that actually a plus. What made DxD so great in the previous seasons? It’s surprisingly mature art style, the girls who loved and doted him and of course boobies. So producers AT-X decided to throw all of that out.They overhauled the animation style which turned out to be bad. Rias looks droopy and uninteresting now. Whenever there’s much action or a fight, the screen gets a dark shade over it. This looked like the quality was dropping and the movements weren’t fluid. That was disappointing when AT-X animated Interspecies Reviewers where the action was good.As I said before, plot development got prioritized and that lead to character neglection. They forgot that the plot develops around the characters and not the other way around. The reactions felt scripted and not genuine. And heavy plot development doesn’t fit in the style of High School DxD.Lastly I think that all the characters became to cheesy. They’re lines became generic and predictable. Studio Passione may be corrupted by modern anime.Lastly I have some “what the fuck” moments while watching season 4. Is the whole oppai dragon show a joke? Meant to be funny? Well no. You Issei was much more funnier while being a lucky pervert. NOT A FUCKING KIDS SHOW.Story wiseIf you’re looking for more plot and shonen battles DxD Hero is more your pick. This show is not bad if it would be a standalone anime, but this season lives in the shadow of the previous seasons (especially 1). The development went fast so there wasn’t unnecessary dragging or fillers. It went so fast that they just skipped over some character development like that form Koneko or Kiba their new powers. The actions of the main characters follow up logically so they didn’t screw up this part. The only downside is that so many thing are going on at the same moment that the whole plot feels messy. It is like real life where you have multiple things going on and it feels messy.This isn’t exactly a romance anime but to see a character as dense as Issei just shocked me as a veteran weeb. To not know what Rias wants and just think “oh she care about us all” sounded so stupid. That was a disappointing fact to see after 4 seasons.Animation/artI’m going to say this again. The animation was shit. There were to many Dragon ball standoffs and less awesomeness going on. In the previous season you could feel the awesomeness in every move or transformation from Issei, well that’s gone. There’s also a weird filter which makes movement blurry and the whole screen more dim. The immersive feeling is gone with this new animation style.Sounds and VAVA wasn’t super bad and the music stayed the same but it was way less subtle. It just kicked in or disappeared. This also happen in previous season but it was way more natural. I’m still glad that they didn’t use awkward sounds effects like some showsSpecial side notes or comparisonsSeason 5 is confirmed and I’m looking forward to it. I hope the new development between Issei and Rias finally takes off and that the other girls gets their fare share without Asia being bothersome.Last wordIn the end it felt like I watched the show as obligation to finish the series rather than for enjoyment. I sat there with half a smile. It was funny yet not amusing. The action was somehow neglected. Familiars are entirely forgotten. They better make up for it in season 5 and show some boobies.Thank you for reading this all, this is my first allout review. for a plot which actually didn’t matter in the first place.

The way the new studio definitely brought down the quality of this beautiful series which I used to enjoy for the plot and fan service.the new animation has made this show not feel as dramatic and interesting as it used to. TBH I missed the oppai and art style which brought a lot of flavour to the show.Honestly, this season is as if someone got some bleach and forced it down my throat after a good expensive meal.The previous series of this show was much better, I recommend watching all those and stopping here. ', 'I don’t really do reviews but I’m gonna start with this so why not. Short and sweetSo this season I found unsatisfactory with the ending of dxd hero. Not rewording at all. I found they over hyped the final fight.The art style I didn’t mind but I do prefer the old one. But still not to bad it’s somthing I recon will grow on u as u watch the season. Art 8.3I really liked the plot and character progression and this season didn’t disappoint with that. it adapts the LN pretty well. Even though I thought it felt a little rushed. Plot 9.0Notes...to know After watching the previous season u will find this season focused more on the romance between Issei and rias even tho it was a slight cringe.this season really over did the secret gear so I didn’t really like that sorry to sayBut I will still love the show and hope for a season 5 and sorry if I brought the show down but from the other season it didn’t stand up to them. overall I still recommend this show it still has lots of strong points so thanks for reading to know After watching the previous season u will find this season focused more on the romance between Issei and rias even tho it was a slight cringe.this season really over did the secret gear so I didn’t really like that sorry to sayBut I will still love the show and hope for a season 5 and sorry if I brought the show down but from the other season it didn’t stand up to them. overall I still recommend this show it still has lots of strong points so thanks for reading', 'Season 4: Great SeasonI’ll admit, the art style did change and the characters felt off at first. AT FIRST. I didn’t know what happened, so I was being ignorant and biased. I didn’t like this season at first. But after rewatching it, it started to grow on me. When I learned about the studio change, I was able to accept season 4 more.This season is actually better than season 3 in terms of plot, source material, and development. Art style, it’s debatable with who you’re talking to. I like the designs on most of the characters. Rias, Xenovia, and Kiba took some time, but it’s...not AS BAD as everyone is making it out to be. Animation was actually better than all three seasons. While episode 0 retconned the ending of season 3 and the current studio didn’t do what the old studio did, the Juggernaut Drive sequence is more visually haunting and threatening, and the action sequences in this show does have weight to it.The villains are interesting in this season. The Hero Faction is an interesting concept to be depicted as villains, and they’re set up for what’s to come next season. Sairaorg is an interesting foil/ally to Issei and Rias, and I like how the second half of season 4 was an Rating game rather than another villain finale.The world-building keeps on coming. Issei develops more into a man, but still a pervert. I did like how they sidelined Rias, Akeno, And Koneko to give Asia, Xenovia, Irina, and Rossweisse time to develop within the story and with Issei. Ravel’s re-introduction to the cast was unexpected, but I understood it after reading light novels 11–12.Best Moments: Issei vs Sairaorg; Issei’s time with Asia, Xenovia, Irina, and Rossweisse; Kyoto Bridge and Town Fight; Issei and Rias helping Sairaorg’s mom; Sauna Scene; Akeno, Koneko, Asia, Xenovia, and Irina comforting Issei; Rating Game; and Issei and Rias kiss!This is just me, I prefer the new art style because I feel that the characters in this show does look closely to being real and the animation is actually better. I do think that they could try mixing the old animation with the new animation for Rias, Xenovia, Kiba , and Vali. Maybe Great Red and Tannin too, but just for size. I’m not hung up on art styles, so I can accept what’s being given. not AS BAD as everyone is making it out to be. Animation was actually better than all three seasons. While episode 0 retconned the ending of season 3 and the current studio didn’t do what the old studio did, the Juggernaut Drive sequence is more visually haunting and threatening, and the action sequences in this show does have weight to it.The villains are interesting in this season. The Hero Faction is an interesting concept to be depicted as villains, and they’re set up for what’s to come next season. Sairaorg is an interesting foil/ally to Issei and Rias, and I like how the second half of season 4 was an Rating game rather than another villain finale.The world-building keeps on coming. Issei develops more into a man, but still a pervert.

It has been about 3 years since the last season and with that came a new studio moving from TNK to Passione. This was due to the last arc of s3 (when Loki pretends to be Issei and eventually makes Issei fight Rias, you know the part that felt really irrelevant and seemed like filler) well the author didn't like that and decided to change studios (or at least...that's how I understand it). This means a completely new art style. Honestly, I'm not really a fan of it, if it had been Passione this whole time (s1-4) I might not have disliked the art style so much as I'd be used to it but oh well, I have heard this art style is much closer to the light novel/visual novel.Story:In terms of the art being much closer to the novel the same goes for the actual story. The story is a lot closer to the novel and in this anime adaptation they include 2 different mini arc's. The first arc is a school trip to Kyoto and the second arc is a rating game between Rias Gremory and her cousin Sairaorg Bael, I won't say what happens in either because I'm trying to keep spoilers to a minimum. Unfortunately, this season involves too much plot and not enough 'plot' but more on that later.Sound:The same soundtrack as all other seasons excluding the new opening and ending in which I must say the op is a cracking good songCharacters:I'll start off by saying Akeno is best girl and in this season i wouldn't be surprised if she had 10 lines total. They have now included Ravel Phoenix as a student at the school so she is included a bit more, however, she is supposed to be partnered (i cant think of a better word) with Koneko which I feel was mainly for the comedic value (which was minimal at best). In the Kyoto arc it is based around Issei's relationship with Asia, Xenovia, Irina and a girl they meet in Kyoto called Kunou who is the main focus of the arc. After returning from Kyoto it is mainly based on Issei and Rias's relationship.Summary:If you came here for comedy, you will not find it here, this season is much more serious about itself and focuses more on plot then 'plot'. Unfortunately, Highschool DxD is known for its over the top inclusion of 'plot' and to try and change what it is best known for now, I'm not sure is the greatest of ideas. If you are a fan of any female that isn't Rias, you will be disappointed, the only character development is Rias and Issei. Issei has the IQ of a pencil, he has no idea of any female characters feelings towards him (classic harem main character) however, like a pencil he doesn't have the mental capacity to do anything himself but if somebody helps him he is pretty useful. One thing I must give props for are the fights especially the fight in the final 2 episodes. All in all, it seems like Passione are taking this a lot more seriously then it should be, the main character gets powered up by poking and seeing boobs.TLDR: Not funny, not unfunny. Too much plot, not enough 'plot'. Too much Rias, not enough of every other female character. Passione is taking a series made for memes and turning it into something serious. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. If the series works, don't go changing it. that's how I understand it). This means a completely new art style.

I will say that the change in character texture and art is a little bamboozling but in time you get used to it. This serious took a turn into the following manga so which then brings in the ultimate fan service which is to bad and is quite comical how they bring it in but the fact that they kind of changed what happened in the season before hero made me a little upset it doesnt change it all to much but it was...just enough for me to say WTF are you serious. The way they brought the characters up and developed them was pretty spot on not gonna lie. I feel as if this season though was kind of thrown together in a way of terms. Certain events happen that they dont talk about much towards the end which kind of threw me off but it was still enjoyable to watch dont get me wrong. Just wish they would of focused more onto the bigger matter at hand instead of saying oh this is important and then jumping into something else acting like that event I mentioned earlier didnt happen. They ended this season off with a massive hit though! So watching all the way to the end wont disappoint!What am I getting at here you might be asking?Well what I'm saying is minus the slight change in story line from season 3 to make up for the change in season 4 it's a pretty good season to watch by yourself of course hahah unless you and whoever you are watching it with is comfortable seeing this together but anyways!!! Its chalk full of action and fan service which makes it pretty damn good to see in full just enough for me to say WTF are you serious.

You'd think they'd have a blast, school trip, onsen fun. Trials of courage and all that? Hah, well hello there Red Dragon Emperor or do you mean 'Grabbin Dragon'?Issei gets into more **** and eventually falls out with Rias. Because Issei just can't seem to bring himself to call her by her name and keeps calling her President. Baka! "", ""The surprisingly highly regarded guilty pleasure show, (the fans can confirm) makes another return after a long time break, this time with a new studio.The past seasons were mostly fine with the second season being of great status, this season had a huge potential from what we've seen from the clatter of events in the third season, but hey, if this sounds familiar, think about what season three was to season two. It didn't greatly deliver on its predecessor's promises but it was okay. And then comes High School DxD Hero promising with something even greater than the last one, will it deliver? I question...myself at the beginning, I knew I had to watch it sooner or later, but the pay off was as oblivious as one's vision on a moonless night.- Story (7.2/10):Much like the other seasons, fanservice is a massive chunk of nonsense, pills amoung pills stacking up on top of each other, but on some rare occasions, a faint aroma of a spicy plot can be felt.Unlike the other seasons, High School DxD New was a magnificent one story wise that set up a pretty high standards for its successors to surpass, but that has got to yet happen, but with the work of the miracle worker, the Boob Dragon (I know it's weird for newcomers), anything is possible, they just don't have to underestimate what good character development can produce.Following the events shortly after the previous season, but unfortunately not covering a really good arc that has appeared on the source material, a rating game between the Gremory and Stiri households, there we get to see Saji going all out revealing on his new abilities, and oh boy those were some exciting ones. That aside, they really should have included it on this season, but all we got were some references that left most of the anime-only-fans confused.This season consists of two main story arcs, the first half of the season covers the main cast (mostly, excluding a few) going to a trip to Kyoto where they get involved in some crazy mess that has them fight against a monstrous organization that claims to have enough power to destroy the gods. They have to rescue a kidnapped fox with nine tails (sounds familiar enough? trust me, there is more of this). It wasn't really all that exciting, but we get to at least see Issei figuring out how his powers work, and improving on them.For me at least, it all was around the second half of the shown. that was the closest it can get to reach the second season's hype for it was probably the most entertaining rating game on display. Where the Gremory team gets to fight one of the Bael family, Sairaorg, a yet interesting character with a lot to him than we thought at first. I can at least say that this season had a storytelling compared to that of the third season, which I think was good.- Art (7.8/10):As I've mentioned before, a new studio is handling High School DxD for now, that's Passione if you're interested. And with new teams and workflow comes new animation techniques and quality.For me, I was so used to the old studio's way of doing thing that I genuinely had trouble recognizing some of the characters, most of them look a lot different, be it the color contrasts change or generally the design, but it's not something that concerning, a couple of episodes should be enough to get you used to it. Aside from the art style being like a damn stranger, the animation was a huge step up. It works very well with the new art style, everything looks more fluid and impactful.Something I really disliked here was that apparently, every single girl in the cast had an increase in her cup size, and it was disturbing, I wasn't prepared for a busty Asia. Somethings just have to stay the way they are.Body proportions aside, some faces really looked very unnatural and unattractive, like my dude, Kiba, like, where did it go wrong fam? he was a freaking handsome pill of paths and now he can barely hold a natural facial expression.- Sound (7.8/10):For the most part, both the opening and the end theme songs are likable, even from the first exposure. Differently better than the second season's second opening, that shit can never be recovered.The voice acting is just at its best, I can't imagine what process they go through to have Issei say some ridiculous stuff while maintaining a serious tone of voice. the shouting and everything was epic and emotional, I'm just glad they didn't have a different team do the voice acting, that would have been a demonic disaster.Something that really puts me in the most for some Juggly effects are the excellent soundtracks, no matter what you change, please don't replace those. They have stuck in with the show from the beginning till this late on, they even left a landmark on my memory, the show wouldn't be the same without them.- Character (8.0/10):Finally, some actually good characters to look at too. Along with some other characters that we previewed in the last season, Sairaorg proved to have a lot of depth to him, his motive and backstories, everything makes you root for the guy. And for you Rock Lee lovers, this is a character that you will treasure.For once, Issei and Rias had some focus on their relationship and treats. Seriously, Issei is completely a different person, one that can control his emotions and realize his mistakes very quickly. And Rias isn't just another character that's just there for either comic relief, of extreme fanservice. She even managed to be the necessary switch for Issei's power at this point. and the two finally made up a solid relationship by the end of the show. Issei and some others have never been so close to being high ranking devils, it's all for the fifth season to answer.- Enjoyment (8.3/10):We all know what sort of guilty pleasure enjoyment we get from this. And as a Sage once said, “there are two kinds of actions in this show”, if you don't get what that quote says, then you're only inches from going to heaven.I love fanservice as much as the next guy, but it can get annoying, out of place, and just look bad and cringy. And there is a lot of cringy in this season, some might say, it's the first time High School DxD has been this cringy. But that doesn't obscure the good parts.Storywise, the hype was real, especially on the second half, you could barely contain yourself from watching those oddly satisfying punches and finishers.- Overall (7.8/10):Again, if you already caught up with the first three seasons, don't pass on this one. You might not like the new animation, but the story and fanservice are at least still true to itself. And seriously, if you don't care enough about the characters, there are new ones that are just as good if not better. But if you're just fed up with the franchise, I trust that the trilogy can hold up as a great guilty pleasure show on its own. myself at the beginning, I knew I had to watch it sooner or later, but the pay off was as oblivious as one's vision on a moonless night.- Story (7.2/10):Much like the other seasons, fanservice is a massive chunk of nonsense, pills amoung pills stacking up on top of each other, but on some rare occasions, a faint aroma of a spicy plot can be felt.Unlike the other seasons, High School DxD New was a magnificent one story wise that set up a pretty high standards for its successors to surpass, but that has got to yet happen, but with the work of the miracle worker, the Boob Dragon (I know it's weird for newcomers), anything is possible, they just don't have to underestimate what good character development can produce.Following the events shortly after the previous season, but unfortunately not covering a really good arc that has appeared on the source material, a rating game between the Gremory and Stiri households, there we get to see Saji going all out revealing on his new abilities, and oh boy those were some exciting ones.

The art looks very stiff-y too, and the art isn't great as other seasons. If you haven't read the light novels you will be left confused when it starts. Season 3 apparently didn't follow up well and had non canon mixed in. I had trouble caring for certain characters that were introduced, and the girls of Gremory feel unimportant to the story. The story focuses on Issei, and Rias so if you...want the Gremory girls to get some spotlight in development it doesn't happen in this season as often. Asia gets the most development out of the Gremory girls. I didn't find enjoyment to the story because I was confused, and didn't understand certain details. I only had some enjoyment due to nostalgia for the Gremory girls, and Issei. The sound is serviceable nothing special though. want the Gremory girls to get some spotlight in development it doesn't happen in this season as often.

So much good, but also so much bad at the same time... welp... lets jump into it... Also, this is coming strictly from an anime only standpoint, i have not read any of the LNs.STORY:7Well what can I say... Its good but its not great. The story is much more different from the last three seasons, and honestly its not what I would like to see. So, at this point, theres almost two reviews of the story. One one hand, as a standalone plot, its...good. Its really not bad. It has moving parts, a coherent storyline, a resolution, a epic fight, and some interesting mechanics. But... as a standalone plot, its not great. It was somewhat boring, predictable. It lacked any sort of plot twists, and it was too short to serve as a good plot. To me, this story felt more like a prequel than anything, a set up for a future story.Now, the second review of the story is in relation to the previous seasons. And in relation to those seasons, It falls short by quite a bit. What made the previous seasons so great was the epic ratio and balance between storyline and ecchi. And this season, season 4, is just not as good at balancing that ratio. There was almost no ecchi, none of the trademark ecchi that was present in the previous seasons. As much as story purists will hate this, the ecchi was what made the last three seasons enjoyable, and those last three seasons knew it. This season however, does not. There was a definite focus on the story and the plot, which alone is not a bad thing, but it is distinctly not HSDXD. The atmosphere was different, it lacks the flair of the previous seasons. The fanservice. The comedy. The ecchiSo Overall, a bit lackluster. Its a good story, but its not great, and its not very Highschool DxD.Art:6Alot of people were ambivalent about this. And I am too. I still am. But again, this section is also, two reviews. Firstly, as a standalone season, the art is mediocre at best. Sure its good, but its not as good as it could be. Its not HD, not sharp, not crisp. The animation is off, slower, not as fluid, and too.... bland. It lacks detail, lacks passion. The Character designs are also still off, not as good as the original that we all know and love.Secondly, in relation to the previous seasons, the art falls very short. The previous seasons had art and animation that was almost second to none. The accuracy and sharpness were top notch. The images were clear. The animations were also great. The attention to detail, especially background was much better than this season.So overall, not good. And not as good as the last three seasons.Sound: 8If theres one thing that did plateau its the sound. The soundtracks in the anime are just about the same as the ones from before. There is certainly a nostalgia factor, and the sound is good, but its just good, sadly. Its not amazingly better. VAs were same so no comment there. And the OP/ED were good, pleasing to hear, so again, no comment eitherCharacter: 7Again, much ambivalence. The characters were not that good. Overall not much character development. The new characters that were introduced were cool, but were not integral at all to the storyline, and all just fell into typecast characters. Nothing original, nothing innovative. As for the main characters themselves, again no character development. I guess Issei got some, but then it was so rushed it still felt half-assed. So good, but not great.Enjoyment: 8Its only this high because of the nostalgia factor. It is the newest and latest season of Highschool dxd. And although my review so far has been quite scathing, I still did enjoy this season a bit. But purely as the next installment of the Highschool DxD franchise.Overall: 7This entire anime could be summed up as ""Good, but not Great"". And it really is that. I wish i could have given it better marks. Hell I wanted to give it better marks as an ecchi enthusiast. But damn was i disappointed. I hurts me to say this, but this anime is distinctly NOT Highschool DxD. It has no notable comedy, no appreciation for the ecchi, and the art was just lackluster. Mathematically, as usual, Id say its like a 2 for story, and a 2 for enjoyment, plus 3 for it just being a HSDXD season 4? unfortunately disappointed and not impressed.Peace good. Its really not bad.

I hurts me to say this, but this anime is distinctly NOT Highschool DxD. It has no notable comedy, no appreciation for the ecchi, and the art was just lackluster. Mathematically, as usual, Id say its like a 2 for story, and a 2 for enjoyment, plus 3 for it just being a HSDXD season 4? unfortunately disappointed and not impressed.Peace', 'Highschool DxD is probably the best anime ever made. Despite peoples need to hate on anything ecchi on mal, this show continues to prove them wrong. How you ask? Because the main protagonist gains his superpowers from boobies. Need I say more? Probably one of the only shows I ever cried during a fight. The art style is refreshing while not tainting the classic look of highschool dxd. Issei is probably the best protagonist of any anime ever, unlike other spineless harem protagonists like Deku who freezes up the second he sees titties, Issei is forward and upfront with all women about his affinity for...all things oppai. All in all, I give high school DxD Hero, a 5/5. A true masterpiece. all things oppai. All in all, I give high school DxD Hero, a 5/5. A true masterpiece.', ""Hello,I want to start by saying I was coming into this 4th season with sense of this will suck, but to my surprise it wasn't as bad of a transition as I thought it would be.Knowing that there was a studio switch it kinda turned me off but it wasn't all bad. I've heard a lot of people complaining about this anime due to the story not moving forward enough. I would disagree this new studio has to pick up and try and make it their own on a 4th season which can be a lot to ask for.It did take a few steps back...on some of the plot but also turned it back and explained why they took the steps back and made it a bit more serious instead of childish. I do hope for the next season they can do something to make people feel its better but I don't believe they can.To me a lot of the hate for this anime is that people look too much into fan service or try to make it the next serious main stream anime, but this genre of anime isn't meant for everyone.Hope this helps. :D on some of the plot but also turned it back and explained why they took the steps back and made it a bit more serious instead of childish.

Sure it may not be for everyone but this is a hit or miss-  it does resemble the light novel much more than what TNK has done and looks more modern in general, but the inconsistency in the character design is very apparent- feels a bit rushed. Sometimes the faces on Akeno or Rias look weird and chibi-like, and Kiba does not look like Kiba at all. I'm probably being a bit too harsh but its just my opinion....Now on the good side of things, the story and character development is amazing and consistent throughout the series. The fight scenes are epic and enjoyable to watch. And many questions I was gonna ask are answered in this season. Soundtrack is good and the overall story is fantastic. I'm highly anticipating for the next season to come! Now on the good side of things, the story and character development is amazing and consistent throughout the series.

I'm highly anticipating for the next season to come!"", ""If you want to continue the show as a laughing gag, be my guest, I did too and I laughed and enjoyed it, however, I got attached with Rias and her love for her literal revived dead friends and the whole family she created and stayed for the main character; who surprisingly made me laugh too much. Anyhow, **DON'T TAKE MY REVIEW AS 100% AS I WAS ONLY STATING IT IN A PERSPECTIVE IF YOU TAKE THE SERIES SERIOUSLY AS I DID.** I was quite tired in Season 4 as in comparison to previous seasons I felt it was lacking... a lot.--------- The art style...is okay, even though it was a weird change considering the original season 1, 2 and 3 art style that just changed into a forced eyes anime art style all of a sudden but it doesn't bother you till like 4 episodes in. I'm assuming the company who made it changed some artists but I wouldn't know, I just watch anime.- Season 4 introduced some characters I hadn't seen [like new villians] which put me a little off, as well as the school president whom Rias knows well as the other original demon house seems to not appear and I really liked what the blonde sword guy [i forgot his name] and the school president's right-hand woman would have between each other.[this could be my fault as I had stopped watching the anime for a good 3 weeks, but put me a bit off.]- Rias seems more... low-key just babyish? In season 1 she was super assertive and liked Issei and this was shown throughout seasons 2 and 3 but in season 4 she's just been laying low, practically frolicking after Issei like a chicken [like most of the cult LOL]. Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating the show because I'd recommend it, but it's just weird to see Rias not as assertive... at all. She's literally acting like a tsundere without addressing the problems to Issei or creating a little more drama, she kinda just walks away from everything [expecting that Issei is going to use his brain to click everything].- Besides Rias and Issei, the rest of the characters literally don't do anything to contribute to the story [either because the people who made the series had already put so many different characters and can't do much anymore as it would be too much or because they already had to some extent in previous seasons]. The characters might as well be background characters as they were just, the same: shove boobies in Issei's face to get his attention [more on this in the last paragraph]. Asia seemed to be more assertive in season 3 however her remaining in her innocent nature FOR 4 SEASONS STRAIGHT was just pointless, as well her ability is almost never used or ever upgraded and the pet she got in one of the seasons never ever appeared ever again. Xenophia and the angel girl are just weird as hell, the angel girl is a random character who's in to kinda show the status of heaven [like hell has demons and heaven has angels] while Xenophia is... just all the time trying to have babies with Issei which was funny the first two times, but got sickening afterward. Akeno had an amazing backstory and honestly, I expected her to fight for her love for Issei however with Rias being her owner, she kinda just let her take him which was understandable, but still disappointing. Koneko is the same, good background but since Rias is the whole owner she gave him away. Gasper is just adorable, wish we saw him upgrade his powers too, same with the sword dude who I forgot his name.^ see how the problem is everyone is dull and boring and not doing anything interesting while the main love interest [Rias] is acting like a child? Tsundere's are hit or miss for me however you would think a girl with lots of power and the owner of literal demons would be super assertive to get what she wants; especially someone as important as a love interest despite the casualties and in the 4th season she acts like a fucking baby.- I got introduced into the series from seeing a nine-tale mother fox being saved by Issei while Akeno, Rias and Koneko were somewhere else (the strongest characters just laying back - being boring.), to then some ALMOST sex scene between Rias and Issei to him being a dumbass and not seeing she loves him and she got offended by getting called president again to everything being on edge all the time as if he's walking on eggshells then it was normal in the rating game?? what kinda tsundere double twist am I watching? It's weird mainly cause so much happened and I don't know if I missed anything or I saw the wrong episodes in order but till I finished I got confused, a lot. I had no idea what was happening.- The last, and most dramatic part yet: the number of boobs. No, it's not that there isn't A LOT, actually there's too much. I was watching an episode and all of a sudden the angel childhood friend is trapped in a closet with Issei while Asia fainted after kissing Issei with Xenophia still being fucking weird and wanting to have a child with Issei, what the hell??? Then when Akeno and Koneko heal him *(i understand Akeno from previous seasons but Koneko???!?!?) then all of a sudden Asia joins in, then Xenophilia, then the angel girl-- just, I SAW LIKE 12 BOOBIES!!! It was too much. Especially after having seen so many boobs from the last season and the whole series being related to boobies... yeah.still would recommend this 10/10 for the laughs and memes, don't regret it - just don't watch season 4 unless you want to gauge your eyes out with the tsundere stuff. is okay, even though it was a weird change considering the original season 1, 2 and 3 art style that just changed into a forced eyes anime art style all of a sudden but it doesn't bother you till like 4 episodes in.

( Mainly cause many animes not my cup of tea. ) But High School DxD definitely had me pumped and excited for each following episode.The genre for High School DxD is so very interesting for me, it definitely has a lot of sexual non-pg scenes. But that's what makes the anime so satisfying to watch as an audient. It is a mix and match of Action, Comedy, Love stories, and Sexy stuff. Which I personally think matches very well together.The characters are mostly very well developed. There isn't anyone that's not thoroughly explained. Rias,...Akeno, and Issei are very well-developed characters with rich characteristics you can't find anywhere else.Overall an awesome anime with blazing hot characters. That will satisfy you as a watcher.There was a slight change in their graphic design, but overall still one of the best animes I've ever watched Akeno, and Issei are very well-developed characters with rich characteristics you can't find anywhere else.Overall an awesome anime with blazing hot characters. That will satisfy you as a watcher.There was a slight change in their graphic design, but overall still one of the best animes I've ever watched"", 'I stayed a long time and I waited for the season to end and watch it; except for the first episode which was a remake. And after a DxD marathon I was speechless. It was a bestial season. It exceeded all my expectations ... if I start to calculate by what percentage it exceeded my expectations it gives me an error: ""System Error"". As I said in the first episode, that remake totally disappointed me and I thought this season was going to be awful. The biggest disappointment is the modification of the graphics that I haven\'t gone through completely yet, that is, the graphics...from the previous seasons were much better than the ones from season 4. Also in the first episode I thought it focused too much on Issei\'s perversity; even though it\'s one of the themes of the anime in the remake, it emphasized that too much. And to make a remake at the end of season 3 - as if destroying the thread of the story, not to mention that in the remake was removed the part where Rias is possessed and sent to the Dimensional Abyss. If I think about it, maybe that was the purpose of this remake, the transition to the new graphics - which I don\'t approve of, and the removal of the part of the story that I just said. Hmmm ... did the author change his mind about his own stories ??? All this for this remake of the first episode that is not worth 5 my opinion. But even if it\'s a bad part it must be mentioned. But thanks to this episode for me the whole season was much more bestial.No more remakes, let\'s go back to season 4 proper.The story: exceptional. We have first of all the introduction of a new species on which a few episodes focus during the visit to Kyoto. This marks the difference in years between the members of the Gremory family, this will be much more visible in season 5. And at the same time we see the evolution of the hero that I will return to later. Also let\'s not forget the Classification Game, the action of the season after all. And the most beautiful part of the story that is in the last episode, and what I personally expect from the first season, the confirmation of the love between Issei and Rias, that is from both of them and the acceptance by the other members of the family. So the story is gorgeous. Reaching the character. I\'ll leave the heroes behind.The new Youkai species: clear connection with the anime Naruto: The Fox with Nine-Tails and Orochimaru [who hasn\'t seen him watch the episodes with the trip to Kyoto again]. And this is not the only connection with an anime, Dragon Ball is another anime that is referred to, even in season 2 was the first reference, the appearance of Bikou, the descendant of Son Goku, according to Azazel-sensei. And now we see in person Son Goku (the official name DxD: Sun Wukong) and the great dragon Yu-Long. Also in the action in Kyoto appears the antagonist of the season: Cao Cao, the leader of the faction of Heroes, the representatives of the human species more precisely. We will hear about them again in season 5, considering that they are really the antagonists of this anime, and not Vali and Ophis, their goal is Great Red. The heroes on the other hand led by Indra [another reference to Naruto] have a more diabolical purpose, we are not sure which gift we will find out in S5, and Issei is the one who stands in their way, as is normal. Yeah ... for me, Vali and Ophis are no longer bad boys. Next!Sairaorg: who gave us the action of the season in the Classification game. A demon without demonic powers, but with a great and noble, beautiful purpose. All he does is for his mother and the family he represents, in short all he does is to upset those who did not believe in him, something like: ""look at the fools I am your heir: the strongest demon young man"". Even if he fought Issei, we can call him a protagonist of this season, after all he is one of the good boys. And to be serious is very bad, especially since he has the lion from Greek mythology with him.Ravel Phenex: introduction to the world of people for the future member of Issei\'s team. Plus her family supports her love for Issei [especially her mother].Ghenshirou Saji: I had to remember the pawn of the Sitri family, after all, he is the master of the dragon Vritra, one of the Five Great Dragons, which you now completely master.Irina Shidou: the most perverse angel I\'ve ever seen, she also gave in to Issei. And finally we reached the Gremory family!Rossweisse: More interested in the demons\' financial facilities and the only one who is against Issei\'s wickedness. It is quite powerful considering how many spells it sends on enemies at the same time.Xenovia Quarta: She looks much stronger with the new Durandal, although her personality has changed a little, she is still just as perverse around Issei, maybe even more so than in the past.Gasper Vladi: he also shows in the Classification Game that he is a man from the Gremory family, not to mention how acclaimed he is.Asia Argento: who has no problem declaring his feelings for Issei, plus we finally see the long-distance healing he trained for.Koneko Toujou: besides healing the hermit, it seems that she also reached level 2 just like her sister, besides: does it seem to me or do I raise Koneko\'s breasts ?????Yuuto Kiba: besides the Holy Demonic Sword, he also reached Balance Break. The strongest knight fully deserves promotion.Akeno Himejima: and received a promotion although in the classification game he did not manage to do too much.Venelana Gremory: Rias\' mother is the first to question Issei about her feelings for Rias.Sirzechs Lucifer: although he is one and the leader, at least I think so, of the Four Devils / Satan depends enormously on Issei considering the policy that depends on the game of Classification.Rias Gremory: we finally reach Princess Purple. To be honest, he was a bit absent from the action this season. It was the center of the love story more. Poor of her how much she endured until the fool of Issei and declared love. But in the end he got what he wanted: Issei to declare his love and call her by name.Ddraig: It seems that the great Heavenly Dragon has problems with depression because of Issei, the Oppai Dragon; interesting cough and that Issei meets with former users of Ddraig and the best and helps him discover his potential.Issei Hyoudou: The hero of the series seems to have matured a lot. During the battle of Kyoto he behaved like a King coordinating others. As a preparation for the future, although it seems that his power comes from how perverse he is :)))). But that\'s him. In the Classification Game he reached another level. Plus he can change his armor and abilities depending on the type of piece for which he promotes Knight, Tura, Crazy and the one finally discovered by the Queen, which has the color of the Gremory family and Rias: purple. And finally he got the promotion to Demon Superior. Now he can make his own team. And he managed to make his brain slow to realize that Rias loves him and finds the courage to declare his feelings. We finally have the happy ending of a love story I\'ve been waiting for since the first season, but our hero is more stupid and it took him 4 seasons to do that. Clearly we will also have a season 5 that I can\'t wait: to see Issei\'s team, new enemies and how the love story with Rias works. Finally, Issei becomes a real hero as he should be.In short season 4 ??? Note 100 without problems. Superb! from the previous seasons were much better than the ones from season 4. Also in the first episode I thought it focused too much on Issei\'s perversity; even though it\'s one of the themes of the anime in the remake, it emphasized that too much. And to make a remake at the end of season 3 - as if destroying the thread of the story, not to mention that in the remake was removed the part where Rias is possessed and sent to the Dimensional Abyss.

I can't say that it wasn't good, but it was certainly weaker than the first three. The battle scenes were still absolutely amazing and I give massive credit to the producers for that. The effort was put into each season to make sure that that was consistent and I am so thankful that they made sure that was the highlight of everything.The house of Gremory is too full. There's harem and then there is completely unnecessary and over the top expression. I mean, I know that they want to highlight boobs. They already had enough by...the middle of season 3. It is a total detractor at this point. Even though they don't show as often in this season, what does show is absolutely ridiculous.I would still suggest seeing it, especially if you've seen the first three, but it's definitely one you can put off if you want to go watch something else first. the middle of season 3.

Of course though there is some arc that were skipped, but in my opinion this is fine because the series turn out well overall.For me the great thing about the series is that the opponent that MC have to fight doesn't always have to be a villain that...try to take over the world kind of shit. They kinda in the rival position for MC so it's pretty lightweight to watch. For this season the main enemy is Cao Cao and Sairaorg, both fell in the rival position where there is no death during the battle. try to take over the world kind of shit.

Coming back two and a half years later to watch DxD Hero after having branched out my anime horizons far beyond their ecchi and harem roots and having heard some pretty mixed reviews about this season, I didn\'t know how it would hold up. Well, this season exceeded my expectations and I had an absolute blast watching it, to me it\'s every bit as good as its predecessors.Story, 6/10 (Good)I\'ve never been one to hold story and character development to too high a standard in ecchi/comedy/harem anime or...any other genre that isn\'t meant to be taken super seriously. That said, High School DxD is well ahead of the pack in the story department when it comes to these kinds of anime. Its quality world-building and ability to generate hype have kept me consistently interested in seeing what\'s going to happen next for four seasons and I totally want more! That said, don\'t go expecting an intense narrative with rich thematic depth from this show, just have fun going along for the ride.Characters, 8/10 (Excellent)If being pandered to with waifus and fanservice isn\'t at least part of the reason you\'re watching High School DxD, then you\'re not part of the target audience and this show likely isn\'t for you. If that IS part of the reason you\'re watching, then High School DxD won\'t let you down. Most of the girls in this show are high quality waifu material and Issei is far more likeable than most harem protagonists and very easy to root for. He does have an internal/emotional conflict regarding his relationship with his harem (mostly Rias) in this season that feels a little forced. While this was a minor annoyance, it honestly wasn\'t that big a deal for me though.Art and Animation, 7/10 (Very Good)I honestly wasn\'t bothered by the art style change much at all. It is only slightly inferior to the older seasons, so slightly for me that it was inconsequential. The girls\' character designs are still gorgeous and we still get to see boobs in pretty much every episode. One advantage High School DxD has over other harem/action shows is just how well-animated and well-executed its fights are. The fights in DxD are on par with those of a fairly high quality battle shounen both visually and in terms of how hype they are.There are a good amount of anime where I can see really hype fights and while High School DxD is great in that department, there are definitely shows that surpass it. There are also a handful of shows that match or surpass DxD in the fanservice department, though it\'s definitely elite-tier in that regard. But I can\'t really think of a better show I could watch if I wanted high-quality full frontal anime titties AND really hype fights in the same show. DxD is the best show I know at that and this season is no exception.Sound, 7.5/10 (Great)The music here is as good as previous seasons, I don\'t really have much to say about it. I do have to say, however, that the English dub for High School DxD is one of the best there is. Unless you\'re someone who\'s completely opposed to English dubs, I\'d strongly recommend watching the dub for this one. This season might just have the best dub yet, the VAs definitely had fun with this one and they\'re part of why the humor in this season is amazing. Actually, I don\'t remember laughing this much at any of the previous seasons! There was a moment where Issei told one of the villains, ""I\'m gonna make you eat your words like a teen doing the Tide Pod challenge"" (or something along those lines, the point is they referenced fucking Tide Pods, holy shit) and I fucking lost it.Enjoyment, 8.5/10 (Excellent)I had an absolute blast watching this season. It was a magnificent, well-balanced blend of fanservice, hype, and comedy and while I can say with confidence that there are at least a few shows that do it better in each of those individual categories, High School DxD is still pretty top-tier in all of them and it has a distinct charm that makes it a must-watch for anyone who loves those things.Overall, 7.5/10 (Great)High School DxD is really good at what it does and knows what kind of show it is. While I know it\'s not for everyone (I mean no anime is really for EVERYONE, but this applies doubly to fanservice -heavy shows) and even some of the people that like it think its quality has been inconsistent across its four seasons, I had tons of fun watching this season and it revitalized my love for the series and got me back to my anime roots of watching dubbed harem anime.

Never change, High School DxD, never change.', ""at first, the change in art style was extremely hard to get used to. i'm ngl, i almost stopped watching entirely because i felt the whole DxD series was now ruined.I was wrong.both the original and new art styles have their charms. you would be extremely stupid to drop one of the best ecchi series in all of anime for something as trivial as art style. ok, well, if the art style was god awful then I understand, but DxD hero's art is NOWHERE near terrible-it's just a change. changes just take time to get used to. if you need reassurance, by the 3rd...or 4th episode, I already forgot that the art style changed lol. if you enjoyed the previous seasons you'll enjoy this season too; don't let the art style convince you otherwise.lets talk about plot. just kidding, obviously, you didn't come here to read a review about plot; it's a damn ecchi anime. but, DxD does have a good plot (for an ecchi) and it is expanded in DxD hero. like the previous seasons, it was good, nothing outstanding, nothing terrible, but that's perfectly fine for an ecchi anime. I'd even say that because there's a plot to follow (not saying its ground-breaking or out of this world) and it's relatively pretty decent, it makes DxD enjoyable, even for those who aren't really a big fan of ecchi. happy watching.also, asia & akeno >> everyone else (no this is not up for debate). or 4th episode, I already forgot that the art style changed lol. if you enjoyed the previous seasons you'll enjoy this season too; don't let the art style convince you otherwise.lets talk about plot. just kidding, obviously, you didn't come here to read a review about plot; it's a damn ecchi anime. but, DxD does have a good plot (for an ecchi) and it is expanded in DxD hero. like the previous seasons, it was good, nothing outstanding, nothing terrible, but that's perfectly fine for an ecchi anime.

Admitted even then it's vastly sub par to the original series but in the end it can be over looked for the simple fact that it means more episodes and the story continues.  I Over all I have thoroughly enjoyed the series and recommend it to anyone even vaguely interested.  Start at the beginning, watch the earlier seasons the animation is far superior, even if it is not true to the manga why can we not do both? Why is the animation by...far worse yet now since its true to the manga its considered a better season?  The anime story was good on its own merits, as someone who never read the manga, the manga may as well have never existed my enjoyment does not hinge on it.  The animation reminds me of cell shading and that was a horrible invention all the way around, just made things look like d rank movies, like companies grasping for money on products they know are crap but think will sell to suckers. far worse yet now since its true to the manga its considered a better season?

From allies I would pick Kunou, who is has fox tail, when transformed and then Yasaka, she\'s Kunou\'s mother and she has big boobs. From antagonists I would pick Cao Cao, member of "" Hero"" faction, which consists from humans using sacred gears. Plus we see some previous Red dragon emperor users ( that\'s Issei\'s boosted gear). We still get so much new characters, even in season 4.Character progression: 6/10Overall not much happens, some bonding, Issei\'s getting stronger, but relationships are pretty much same, yes I know Issei get kissed by Rias in last ep. won\'t change my mind.Story: 8/10Pretty solid actually. 1st half of story is about school trip and fighting Cao Cao and 2nd half is about rating game against Rias relative Sairaorg and unlocking some new powers. I know it\'s pretty crappy description, but overall it was really good stuff.Story progression: 6/10Calling someone you love "" buchou aka president"" all the time and when she wants to bang you is stupid in general and it\'s stupid manouver to avoid sex and I won\'t take argument he has trauma from season 1, these kinds of excuses are in low end Ecchi. If you ever read my DxD New review you\'ll know why it\'s 6 only. Overall story is straightforward with some small side stories, so I don\'t have any problem with it.Villains: 4/10Cao Cao: 4/10 he doesn\'t really have any background regarding past, he\'s leader of Hero faction and not much of his personality is shown yet. He possess one of Longinus gears, that are super rare gears ( Issei and Vali Lucifer have their dragon gears, which are also Longinuses). I would rate him higher, but I don\'t see him much as a villain, I see him more like a someone who has holy crusade and is aiming to destroy devils, angels and fallen angels, that can be understandable, because those factions had a massive wars and were using humans in late stages, so his goal as a whole cannot be seen entirely as villainy.Girls: 10/10Ok, there are 8 girls, who are considered as a main characters ( by MAL), so this was pretty easy decision, Ravel joins harem, she\'s blond and medium breasted, then I\'ll include Yasaka, even though she\'s a side character and not harem member, she\'s big breasted milf.Sound: 8/10Pretty decent, I think previous openings and endings were better, but these are still good.So overall rating of Highschool DxD Hero is 7/10 exactly.

And was thinking that this serie would be great as the last of them. Well by suprise it wasn't really that perfect.Story 6: Well...its was a good story. Only there wasn't really a structure. For example they fight against a boss. Then a weird boss is coming up. He doesnt die. and then there is a tournament (sorry for my english btw). Its was for me a little bit confussing. And it took me some time to realize it.Art 6: They changed the art style. The prequels were different then this one....Is it bothering me? A little bit. Akeno and Xenovia has changed alot. For me in a bad way. But Akeno and Rias changed in a good way. The other artwork was just fine. Only characters changed alot.Sound 8: Great ending and opening. Not much to say.Character 7: Instead of the artwork. I did enjoy every character. Some more then others. And i'm really glad that Kiba got a more serious role in this serie. But still the harem king is the greatest character. (What do i wrong in my life?)Enjoyment 7: I did watch in some days because of work etc. But I did enjoy the serie. Not the greatest but good enough.Overall 7: The 7 is for me more the change the producers has made. Its bothers me that some of the perfect chars for me. Xenovia for example has changed in a bad way qua art. But i'm happy that some shadow characters has come more in this serie. Do you need to watch it? Well if you watched the series or prequels. Then you will maby agree with me. But some people are accepted and enjoys the new art style. Its fun to watch and well....Boobie dragon fan boy is here (^_^) Is it bothering me? A little bit.

Then you will maby agree with me. But some people are accepted and enjoys the new art style. Its fun to watch and well....Boobie dragon fan boy is here (^_^)"", '*****May Contain Spoilers******Oppai Dragon!Here we go, another season of Highschool DXD based on the light novel with the same name.  This time around the season was created by Passione studios, which also produced the popular series Citrus earlier this year. I happen to have found both shows enjoyable. I look forward to future installments by this series.Story:Highschool DXD is a echihi, romance, harem, action, comedy and ecchi anime (Yes, I put that twice on purpose) fallowing the life of your typical average guy Hyoudou, Issei. Who in previous seasons started high school at  Kuoh Academy. He very quickly gets hit on and starts...dating a fellow freshmen who happens to kill him once the date is over because she is fact a fallen angle. Issei is what in this world is known as a ""sacred gear"" user and she killed him to try and gain back the favor of god. Issei is then reincarnated by Rias Gremory a devil from the famous house of Gremory (you can find that this is an actual devil name in biblical text). He also happens to have the sacred gear that happens to house the famous red Welsh dragon Ddraig\'s spirit. This basically allows him to boost up power and wear a super awesome dragon armor set that is really badass.In this world religion, weather considered mythological or not is real and has been hiding itself among normal humans. Issei and his group are basically reincarnated devils and serve there master who unlike the ones we find in the story has a good heart and doesn\'t really want to hurt humans. They live mostly normal lives except when factions and armies that seeks to destroy any type of demon, devils, or monsters, shows up and threatens everyone. In which case they fight to defend themselves and those they care about.(This series is super long and surprisingly complicated so I\'m going to narrow it down to this season now)In this new season Issie and the gang head to Kyoto on a field trip. They are of course excited to be going on this trip together and take a break from the rating games and the constant attacks from the Chaos Brigade. This trip is filled with a lot of funny scenes (Especially when Issie\'s perverted nature gets loose and causes innocent victims to commit acts of basically sexual harassment). Which is quickly brought to an end after the yokai or Kyoto attack because their leader a kitsune has been kidnapped by the Chaos Brigade. Once misunderstandings are correct the group agrees to help save the entrapped spirit fox once her location has been found. SURPRISE! They were attached first and they finally meet Coa Coa, head of the brigade and wielder of the holy spear that pierced christ. The group works together to save the captured yokai from being used to open a portal to summon Big Red (Big ass dragon god).Once the cult narrowly defeat the brigade (though not for good) the second half of the season revolves around the next rating game against Bael, Sairaorg, Rias\'s cousin. This leads to the more action side of the story. Along with more romance and drama as they finally dig deeper into Rias and Issei\'s relationship. The season ends with Issei obtaining a brand new power and him finally admitting he loves Rias.My annalists of the season is that although everything in the anime went the exactly the same as the light novel. They kind of ruined it by either slowing or speeding up the pace of the story. The first half with Kyoto was very pushed forward considering so much was suppose to go on plot wise and story wise. The studio decided to instead pour more into the ecchi and comedy. Then they change it up during the second half twice. First spending a great amount of time with Issie and his problems with commitment since his first babe shanked his ass. Then they speed through some of what was the best fights in the whole series in the light novel int he rating game against Sairaorg. I know they were dealt this hand by the previous studio on where they decided to leave off but they really should have either extended the season to 24-25 episode or made the two half\'s two separate seasons.Characters:Unfortunately the same thing I stated about the pace of the story can be said about the characters and their development. They were smart to add in the subtle scenes that would down the line be vital to future relationships such as the Rossweisse and Phenex, Ravel scenes but then they down played extremely important characters plot developments such as Azazel. I had no issues with the rest of the cast because they were portrayed perfectly but you can\'t just up the comedy and nudity like the plot is not important cause I\'ve read this shit and it IS important.Animation and Sound:I read a lot of complaints regarding the new studio taking a much lighter approach tot he animation. I however, disagree. The light novels art is exactly in this style and it makes it much better for the type of unique pitch that DXD tries to portray. The character do look younger, hello? They are high school students? Ta fuck you expect you fucking pedo pervs? I mean come on that was just stupid, most people were crying because they couldn\'t jack off to Rias without feeling like a pedophile. While she technically is a teenager in high school (though she is a devil).I was also happily surprised to learn that Passione isn\'t half bad at fight scenes. Especially the highly anticipated fight against Beal and Coa Coa. I can still tell that they are not 100% use to it but they seem to be working towards better action in the future. I think if they continue to pick up the series the fighting scenes will continue to improve.SWITCH ON, is really good opening. I found it catchy in a way and it really fit the tone of the season. The song also has a meaning to the season. This is when everyone starts to realize that whenever Issue touches Ria\'s breast that he gets a power up. Hence the name ""switch on"" Rias being the ""Switch Princess"".Conclusion:I\'ve enjoyed this anime since it first came out for many different reason. The main one is that the writer had the balls to take all forms of religion and make an actually decent story out of it. Then instead of making it super serious which would have probably ruined the entire thing he added in the ecchi and nudity to the elements of his story. It\'s funny, you can really get to like the character and the story while appreciating the world that they live in. I often sometimes wonder similar to the world we live in religious wise. That all religions are real not just one. I would recommend this show for anyone who has an open mind and likes a bit of pervy nature on the side. My only real complain.....I hate the fucking censoring SET THE BOOBS FREE!!!!!!Ranking: 8 dating a fellow freshmen who happens to kill him once the date is over because she is fact a fallen angle.

Harem + Uncesored Oppais + Oppai dragon + A good story = THE BIGGEST N U T. But hold on a second, High School DXD’s studio changed???? NANI???? HOW WILL I ENJOY MY UNCENSORED OPPAIS NOW HUH? HOW WILL I ENJOY PRESIDENT RIAS’ MENACING BUT SEXY FACE? Those are the questions that are maybe running through your head right now. Don’t worry my friend, follow along and I will explain to you why this season is worth your time.Animation and art: 7/10OHOH would...you look at that! I started out with the most important part didn’t I. Ima answer the main question right away. Are there still a good ammount of boobs? Hell yeah my friend. It’s there and It is glorious. Boom. Done. I’m kidding, now to actually talk about the animation and art, It took me about 2-3 episodes to get used to it but honestly It is alot better than I expected. Most of the characters in my opinion looks better considering how they made them look alot more moe. I’m actually kinda glad that it’s a change of pace as the third season was getting quite boring. Now why is my score a 7/10? Well you see, Rias is not meant to look moe. Not at all. It really made me feel like the true Rias is gone. BUT as the season progresses you will get use to it and then you’ll see a cuter and more loving Rias. So don’t let that discourage you from seeing itStory *SPOILER WARNING* : 7/10The story kinda splits into 2 arcs: The first one is where Issei and some of the team members go to Kyoto for a class trip. Ofcourse sh*t does go down when they are there but Issei does gain new powers. Specifically, he is able to transform his dragon suit to match different evil pieces. Nothing special. On the second arc, which is where Rias’ and Issei’s relationship actually start developing, They participate in a Rating game against the Sairaorg guy (you know the guy that really wanted to fight Issei and was kinda nice in the third season.) Issei does win but in the process had the courage to confess to Rias (which was FANTASTIC). He also almost gets laid but he called Rias, president so she got mad and just left him naked in the sauna 0.0. The final episode is what we’ve all been waiting for and that is Issei proposing to Rias one on one. The ammount of emotions flowing through me in that scene was too much to write down, so I hope you see it for yourself TvT. I’m so happy TvT.Music and sound: 7/10Considering how a different studio handled the anime, the music and sound were on point. It definetly still had a High School DxD vibe to it. Though If I’m not mistaken They did reduce the extra noises for the boob bouncing. Otherwise everything same sameOtherthoughts:Though I feel like this season was great and I enjoyed it alot more than season 2 and 3, I feel like it might be the last High School DxD season we’ll get or we won’t get another one until years later. The season ended on a good note so maybe continuing it isn’t really necessary to the studio. I’m not really sure. Its just what I’m guessing. We haven’t heard any about a new season either.Conclusion:Overall If you like High School DxD like me, I high recommend watching it, Don’t let the animation discourage you, I personally did complain about it in the beginning but found it to be as entertaining if not more. Well I wish who ever reads this the best of luck, and Have a wonderful and amazing day/night. you look at that! I started out with the most important part didn’t I.

The first three seasons were adapted by the TNK studio and I prefer their style so much, the characters had so many more expressions on their faces, moreover the eyes are very different, although it is pleasant, personally I do not arrive to support it, it's a pity the story and even the tone of the voices can not go up that point.Finally the story is good but on this point also the old seasons was above.Not to spit on the work of the studio Passione, the faces are missed. However I think that...Sairaorg or Issei's Balance Breaker are both successful and their animations and fights (overall) are really good work. Sairaorg or Issei's Balance Breaker are both successful and their animations and fights (overall) are really good work."", ""I have reviewed and consecutively watched all three previous seasons so in this review I'm operating that you've also seen them and have read those previous reviews, otherwise this isn't going to make a ton of sense.The first immediate standout change this time around is the new studio and new animation style. It doesn't look wildly different, but you can tell it isn't the same. Changing studios, especially after many years, is simply an inevitability in this industry and ultimately you just have to ask yourself 1. Does it look SIMILAR, even if not identical? and 2. Does it look GOOD, even if I like...the other way better? and in this case the answer is yes to both. In fact, I may even prefer the new look to the previous! It doesn't hurt that all the ladies are even bustier than before this season...As seasons have rolled on I feel this anime has moved a bit away from comedy and goofy, over the top gags and more towards focusing on battles and super ultra mega abilities, which is a change I personally don't care for, and certainly this particular season felt story light and battle heavy as a whole, including the final three episodes being almost nothing other than combat. I will never get tired of seeing attractive ladies with big boobs, but towards the end this show started to feel like simply a battle anime with boobies rather than something charming or something with any depth. Perhaps it's simply a consequence of watching all four seasons consecutively, but it did finally start to feel a bit repetitive and like it was wearing out its welcome. It felt like they ran out of places to go with the plot and their solution was simply more enemies, more powers, more combat. As a whole, character development and plot advancement were quite weak and minimal in this fourth season.My understanding is that there will be a FIFTH season in the coming years. If so, I'll watch it. Nevertheless, my favorite season of this show was the first one and I wish they'd kept it on a smaller scale as it was back then rather than adding more and more characters, more and more bad guys, etc. Overall I enjoyed the series and am glad I watched it, and it should please fans of the genre, but it won't go down as an all time favorite for me.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7-8PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7-7.5 the other way better? and in this case the answer is yes to both.

The easygoing Issei and his harem of anime tiddies just has a certain... charm about it that I can\'t really seem to find anywhere else. After the horrible 3rd season, studio Passione has taken on the job of ""fixing"" the DxD storyline, by adding an alternative (true to the light novels)...ending to Season 3, effectively rendering the last 3 episodes of TNKs version obsolete. This was, in my opinion, the best thing they could have done, seeing as the ending of Season 3 left very little to work with for future adaptions.Now, Season 4 is not without its flaws. The art style is... weird. At first I absolutely hated it, but now, after 6 episodes, it\'s really starting to grow on me. The characters look more ""childish"" for sure, but that kinda fits the setting a little bit better, at least in my opinion. It is, however, definitely something you\'ll just have to get used to if you are planning on watching the new season.The story so far really isn\'t anything to write home about either. Issei and his friends go on a school trip to Kyoto, where they run into trouble. That\'s pretty much the gist of it. There is some other stuff happening ""behind the scenes"" too, if you will, but I won\'t really go into that seeing as that would be spoiler territory, and chances are some of you might not have seen all of the recent episodes.The ecchi part is still very much alive and kicking, with every episode featuring at least one ""sexy"" scene. After all, High School DxD would not be High School DxD without the ecchi, and I\'m happy to report that Passione seems to understand this. And on top of this, the new season also fleshes out the relationship between Issei and Rias even more than before, so if you are a Issei x Rias fan you are going to be very satisfied with the way their relationship is handled here.The music of DxD has always been one of its strong-points, and the new season does not disappoint on that front either. The OP is catchy and enjoyable, and the ending song gets the job done too. I really don\'t have anything else to say about it, the music is alright, nothing special but alright, and that\'s pretty much it.Overall, I\'d say I was positively surprised by the new season of High School DxD. The story, albeit predictable, is interesting enough to keep your attention, and Issei and the gang has lost none of their charm, and are still enjoyable to watch. And at the end of the day, isn\'t that exactly what we\'ve come to expect from DxD? Some light-hearted humor, ecchi scenes and well-animated fights? ending to Season 3, effectively rendering the last 3 episodes of TNKs version obsolete.

And at the end of the day, isn\'t that exactly what we\'ve come to expect from DxD? Some light-hearted humor, ecchi scenes and well-animated fights?', 'DXD is one of those anime that despite the years always takes place in my ""heart"" and after watching this season, only one sentence comes to my mind: look how they massacred my boy. I cannot comment on how the last two seasons relate to the novel/manga, because I have not read this one, so I will skip the aspect of compliance with the original completely and just focus on my own feelings about the production itself. As this is the 4th season, I will skip the plot summary (not that there is anything to summarize). All you need to know:Rias Gremory is a powerful...descendant of a noble line of demons, a lady and a great love of the protagonist;Issei Hyoudou possesses extraordinary powers, a pervert, a freak, but idolizes Rias;Rias\'s team is almost all women who owe Issei something and try to pick him up in an intrusive way;The first and second seasons were the quintessence of the genre for me. The best harem / ecchi / romance ever created, and I dare say that other creations of this type, created after the first seasons of DxD, were inspired by them. However, is it only me who has the impression that the next seasons are like from a different parade? Changing the look / animation to an incomparably worse one does not help to raise the note. Let\'s face it, the series owes its success to the characters of Rias, Akeno, and Issei himself, who have been so handicapped over the past 2 seasons that they are almost entirely different characters. Rias from a lady, with remarkable persuasion abilities, with a mature view of the world and people, has turned into a girl who is not quite emotionally clever and it is terrible. Akeno turned from an intriguing woman who could confuse your head to an annoying girl with a wanton. And the Emperor himself, with his idiotic nickname, became simply an idiot in the pure sense of the word.There were a few pluses over these twelve episodes, such as mixing in different faiths (gods: 9-tailed, Indra, Greek pantheon), but that\'s about it. Unfortunately, these advantages seem to be a fate to me, because the last anime with this idea (gods of all faiths as anime characters), namely DanMachi, also wasted its potential after season 1 and even such an interesting world does not solve the plot\'s pointlessness.If I were to evaluate this season as a separate creation (definitely a more objective approach), there aren\'t many positives anyway. The appearance is poor and it gets worse in the later episodes. The music is bland, there is not a single melody in the anime that is memorable. The plot is a conglomerate of some moderately related events. The characters simply lack the fifth stave. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it a maximum of 3 - there are much better productions.However, judging it with sentiment and undisguised sympathy for the heroes from before the ""twist"", I will put 4 on this scale - if you are wondering about the whole series, watch it, but if you are a random guest here, skip this season. I\'ve been tired of the title from its premiere until now, and it\'s sad that I have wasted this time. descendant of a noble line of demons, a lady and a great love of the protagonist;Issei Hyoudou possesses extraordinary powers, a pervert, a freak, but idolizes Rias;Rias\'s team is almost all women who owe Issei something and try to pick him up in an intrusive way;The first and second seasons were the quintessence of the genre for me. The best harem / ecchi / romance ever created, and I dare say that other creations of this type, created after the first seasons of DxD, were inspired by them. However, is it only me who has the impression that the next seasons are like from a different parade? Changing the look / animation to an incomparably worse one does not help to raise the note. Let\'s face it, the series owes its success to the characters of Rias, Akeno, and Issei himself, who have been so handicapped over the past 2 seasons that they are almost entirely different characters. Rias from a lady, with remarkable persuasion abilities, with a mature view of the world and people, has turned into a girl who is not quite emotionally clever and it is terrible. Akeno turned from an intriguing woman who could confuse your head to an annoying girl with a wanton. And the Emperor himself, with his idiotic nickname, became simply an idiot in the pure sense of the word.There were a few pluses over these twelve episodes, such as mixing in different faiths (gods: 9-tailed, Indra, Greek pantheon), but that\'s about it. Unfortunately, these advantages seem to be a fate to me, because the last anime with this idea (gods of all faiths as anime characters), namely DanMachi, also wasted its potential after season 1 and even such an interesting world does not solve the plot\'s pointlessness.If I were to evaluate this season as a separate creation (definitely a more objective approach), there aren\'t many positives anyway. The appearance is poor and it gets worse in the later episodes. The music is bland, there is not a single melody in the anime that is memorable.

It's often comedic, with relevant jokes and well witted writing. The comedy aspect (Besides being the closest thing to hentai in mainstream anime) is its silver lining. Especially since the story seemingly goes no where. My other main peeve with the High School DxD series is that every season he seems to gain some immense power and get even stronger, and make it seem like he has peaked, then in the next season he peaks again.Either way, if you are looking for a good, comedy / Harem...with very well done battle scenes, High School DxD proves its worth again. with very well done battle scenes, High School DxD proves its worth again."", 'Let me tell you that I loved this season of high school dxd! It was very entertaining and the story pulls you in. All the antics between Issei and the rest of the group are funny and entertaining like in the previous seasons but under that there’s deeper meanings and things going on. There is a lot of character development with all the characters and a big part of that was Issei gaining confidence with himself around women which comes into play near the end of the season. I came to love all the characters even more and maybe love the new characters characters even...more. In particular I loved Sairaorg, he’s such a good character. We also get to see more of Azazel and he’s awesome as well. The series almost has two parts and both are awesome even though I liked the second ark a little better. Later in the season Issei has to start thinking of how he feels about the president and all the other girls and how they think about him. The relationship drama is very entertaining and I’m glad to say it ends in a great way. How? You’ll have to watch and find out. The fight scenes are all on point and visuals are good. I know the art style change is kinda weird and I was unsure about it myself but I got used to it quickly and even came to like it, in my opinion it didn’t take anything away from the show. Another thing I noticed while watching was how good the sound track was done, absolutely amazing. I thought the sound track was one of the best things about this season so listen with headphones. The last two episodes were especially good not just in the sound department but in general, it makes me so excited thinking about them even though I’ve already seen them. The soundtrack those last two episodes was amazing and made the fight scenes soooo good, the final fight was epic and went down to the wire, and we Isseis relationship with a certain someone takes a big step which is very exiting and heartwarming. Overall I think season 4 is all we liked in seasons 1-3 and more so if you liked those seasons I think you will definitely like this one. One of my favorite anime’s ever and all we can do now is hope for a season 5, hopefully soon! more. In particular I loved Sairaorg, he’s such a good character.

If we compare this season to the last one we can see that some character designs have improved but some have been drawn in a way that the character is not portrayed. Rias Gremory is a good example since her cocky grin in this season has just turned into a cute smile. Akenos face has changed drastically from a sisterly atmosphere to a more adorable atmosphere. The characters that have improved with the character design this season, in my opinion, will be Asia, Koneko, Issei. Issei's face has been more...fluid in this season and Asia and Koneko have become more adorable. The story this season still has the same spirit as the other seasons. I think the story of this season has actually improved compared to the last season though it is not perfect.  I will not explain the faults of the story since it will be a spoiler. I honestly think people have bashed this season too harshly when they have not watched the whole thing. The art style has destroyed some characters atmosphere, I will not deny that but the voice actors still make the characters just as enjoyable and the story is still the good High school DXD stuff so please go try and watch it to the end, otherwise I think you will be missing out on the series. fluid in this season and Asia and Koneko have become more adorable.

That is, Issei progression in interesting aspects of the devil world, the romantic plot, and the ridiculous comedy. Like I mentioned for the 3rd season, the worldbuilding has got too messy, with too many places and fighters to keep track of that are also poorly introduced (we never really hear about any aspect of the devil world way in advance, rather, only when...we\'re about to have a related mission). The fanservice remains the same, the comedy too, although the school context is pushed to the side more and more which is a shame. As a final villain of the anime Sairaorg is decent and for once I didn\'t skip through his parts (despite skipping through all the other characters\' fights excluding Issei). It might also be the fact that I knew that it\'s the final battles and a major turning point in the series. I wasn\'t a big fan of Issei\'s trauma with Yuuma coming out of nowhere (starting from the 3rd season and continuing into this one) that made him scared of opening up and admitting his feelings. I get that he was cursed and whatever (although I\'m pretty sure it was showed to be removed eventually), but it\'s not really meaningful ""trauma"" if it\'s never brought up after the fight with Yuuma and only brought back now that we need a dramatic reason for Issei\'s hesitation. In the end, Issei\'s confessions were very satisfying, I\'ll admit, after a pretty long journey/chase (that was a little childish with both of the teens fidgeting so much when it was obvious their feelings are mutual) and of course that\'s the path that had been built for them from the first volume. It should stay like this in my opinion, but I know that in the novels Issei does continue pursuing his harem which is a shame. Overall, the romance aspect is obviously shallow and scripted, and the characters involved are stereotypical, although at least Issei and Rias do make it believable. As in, it\'s not inconceivable that these characters would fall for each other, and the voice actors do a good job in conveying emotions, too. Speaking of the novels though, I got attached to this series for some reason, but clearly the reasons were not proper, because as much as I wanted to learn about the rest of the story (after finishing the anime), I couldn\'t bring myself to read the novels as they lacked visuals. I guess that proves the essence was the babes, but to be fair to the author, bringing the dialogue to life in text only is not quite the same as having an animation or at least some voice acting to go with it. we\'re about to have a related mission).

I couldn't recommend it to anyone other than young men, who will most likely atleast enjoy the constant nudity. But that shouldn't put everyone off. The series starts off seeming peverted, but as it progresses it starts getting soppy, cutesy, and romantic. AND SO WHAT? It's a boy's show, meant fro boys at that kind of age where hot girls and breasts are all that matters, and in that area, IT WORKS! i guess? There really isn't much to expect from a show like this. It's got the one thing someone may possibly want and need. ANIME TITTIES. AND...THERE'S ALOT OF THEM HERE. The main point of criticism I have is in the writing. Some of the dialogue, well, its pretty embarassing, but on the whole it's fine. And I couldnt help feeling that the plots could be better. That many things about the demons weren't explored enough as much as I wanted them to be. In fact, the writing goes out of the way to include something to with boobs or whatever, but I guess that's what the exploitation genre is all about. Some battle sequences were good, and the interactions between the main character and his friends were hilarious. I enjoyed it; not for everyone, but you're into this sort of thing, why not give it a go. THERE'S ALOT OF THEM HERE. The main point of criticism I have is in the writing.

Unlike the first three seasons that were done by TNK, this season is by Passione. The reason for this is presumably that TNK took too many liberties with their adaptation to the point it became kind of hard to follow the source material, which ended up pissing off the original author. Thus, this season is by a new studio who...were instructed to follow the new source material more closely.As such, the first major difference is in terms of story telling. What is essentially the zeroth episode of this season actually picks up the story at the climax of the third season and straight up retcons the episodes after that because it would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to continue following the light novels while keeping them. Following that, this season has two arcs, the first in which they face off against the Hero Faction in Kyoto, and the second in which they compete in a rating game against the powerful Sairaorg. There were some instances where they basically force fixed issues in previous seasons, such as in important events being revealed through flashbacks or just kind of sort of info dumped in passing that were conveyed better in the light novels I believe. Still, overall it seemed to flow decently enough and if the roughness in this season is enough to get things back on track in following the light novels then these issues are trivial.The bigger issue, and one that isn’t really something that can be fixed per se, is that following the light novels more closely has issues of it’s own, mainly pacing. The only area that is paced as well as previous seasons, maybe even a bit better, is the action, where Issei and the rest of the cast continue growing just as well and the action overall is just as cool as the previous seasons. On the other hand the plot moves very little in this season compared to previous ones and it doesn’t feel like all that much happened. There’s also very little progress in character arcs and relationship arcs, wherein only Issei and Rias progress and only about as much as in the TNK original arc that got retconned out of the previous season. The previous seasons adapted the core light novels at a similar pace at a rate of two volumes per season, but TNK rearranged things, brought back side stories and even important events from later volumes, came up with their own mini filler type scenes, and skipped over things.The end result is that the pacing in previous seasons is just far better than the pacing on this season which felt noticeably slow by comparison. This season may be following the light novels more closely, but the anime and light novels are very different mediums that are consumed very differently, and thus what works for one doesn’t work for the other. Still, at the the end of the day, it is important to follow the source material as close as possible, so I don’t blame Passione for not having things like the plot or character arcs progressing faster than they did in the light novel like TNK did. Still, I think the anime would have benefited from having the pacing on the original source material overall being faster but adding in more filler type scenes just for it to feel like there was more stuff happening. The comedy and such is still really solid this season, but adding more would have definitely helped. The action too has always felt like it needed to be fleshed out more so that too would have helped.The second major difference is the art style. The quality is similar, but with different strengths and weaknesses so it’s somewhat of a mixed bag. After getting used to it, I like the color pallet and character designs more than previous seasons, though it did take a bit of getting used to. In terms of quality though, it felt like it had a harder time pulling things off. When it looks good I think it looks better than anything in previous seasons, but at the same time when it doesn’t hit that mark it has a lot more potential for looking kind of off, which happens quite a bit more than in previous seasons. I think part of that may be due to the animation, which felt a lot more fluid but also more prone to just looking kind of strange. Still, all in all, if I had to pick between the two, I’d pick this style over that used in previous seasons, though it would be somewhat of a difficult choice.In terms of other production values, this season continues the trend of having decent enough OPs in terms of visuals and songs, but with the EDs being what truly shine in both regards, so it’s nice to see that that hasn’t changed. The soundtrack felt like a noticeable boost over previous seasons though. This season also brings back eye catches which look great and really highlight how amazing the new art style can look. were instructed to follow the new source material more closely.As such, the first major difference is in terms of story telling.

Unlike a certain other show that also is harem, shounen, and slightly Isekai, the reception for Highschool DxD is almost always positive, whether its because of the almost-but-not-quite hentai content, or the mediocre yet good succession of events.StoryFrom what I understand, this season adapts chapters 9 and 10 of the light novel, and this time, it doesn\'t have any anime-exclusive shenanigans that is prequel season had. While I did not read the light novels myself, the plot of this season followed a steady line that I would be sure to see as almost parallel to the light novels. This is far better than what its prequel season pulled, and it was definitely a step up from the chaos that was High School DxD BorN. Once again, this anime doesn\'t fail to ""explore"" every corner of the possible shenanigans our hopelessly dense pervert MC can get into. The first half of the season brings us another girl in our Harem King\'s growing consort while also adding to the Boob Dragon\'s growing arsenal of godlike powers. Standard harem/shounen anime shenanigans, a rather predictable yet necessary buildup for the second half.The second half is, of course, a Tournament Arc, in the form of a Rating Game with Rias\'s family vs. Sairaorg Bael & Co. This is supposed to be the buildup that the entire season was beelining for. Yet it fails to deliver. Not only are characters that are supposed to be god-powerful, such as Akeno and Sairaorg\'s Queen immediately downsized, Sairaorg was built up to be so powerful that It actually came to a surprise to me that Issei was even able to take him on. This imbalance in the tournament arc left my brain imminently confused. Honestly, it could\'ve been better.Art & SoundDefinitely the most noticeable change with the series, with Passione (Sairaorg, i know you\'re Bruno Bucciarati, but really?) taking the reins for animation. The new style overall gives a more cartoonish look for our crew, with a tradeoff of more glowy and brighter animation. I personally felt like Passione didn\'t do as well in terms of animation quality, there were multiple times where the character\'s reaction didn\'t line up with the VA\'s lines, and the overall cartoonish look makes the characters look a lot younger than they actually are, which is a VERY BAD thing for an anime that has the MC touching boobs every five minutes.The OP is just what you\'d expect for a shounen opening, upbeat, dramatic, and gives you everything you need to know about what will happen to the series in a few clean minutes. The music choice was well done, but still felt a bit cliche.CharactersThis is the part that draws the most people in: Your typical harem, but cranked up to eleven. Let\'s do a roll call:The MC who\'s denser than a neutron star, checkThe Submissive Master, checkThe Ara Ara Oneechan, checkThe Innocent Cinnamon Bun, checkThe Knight who wants Kids for power, checkThe One other Guy who\'s there but is chill about it, checkThe Flat Loli, checkThe Trap, checkThe Irresponsible and Easily Influenced Teacher - this one\'s new, but still a checkSo, now that we\'ve seen the cast, what do we do? Where normal harems hit the brakes, this anime paid for the whole speedometer, so they\'re gonna use it. The MC has a gauntlet that needs to charge up, coincidentally, he\'s also a boob-loving perv. What do we do? GIVE HIM BIG DICK ENERGY. Oh yea, if its not plot and its ""plot"", you can be sure that the girls are getting to know our MC real well.However, amongst all that bliss, our MC still has one ultimate goal, make Rias Gremory his. and it\'s that bit that is the cornerstone, the central pillar, and the ultimate flagship of character development. The process by which the MC lets go of the trauma that got him into this mess and learn to acknowledge risk and reward is what this entire fandom has hoped for since meeting our two characters. And the way they delivered makes it that much more satisfying, ending the series off on a much higher note than the other previous seasons, and making me truly hyped for Season 5.Overall, this is a great anime if you have a clogged nose and plenty of blood to lose.

It was a complete DISASTER! The art style was okay, it\'s the quality is one of my issues. The storyline was HORRIBLE! The characters are CRAP, and the villains are TERRIBLE! JUST TERRIBLE! Hell, even the writing was also TERRIBLE!The story was just AWFUL! The characters are treated like CRAP!High School DxD: Hero was a complete waste of time! This anime is the WORST season of 2018 and a total piece of garbage! I cannot stand it!High School DxD: Hero gets an ""F"". Final Rating: 2/10. ']"
Digimon Adventure 02,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1313/Digimon_Adventure_02,"['A while ago I made a review on Digimon Adventure, explaining why I found it to be one of the best kids shows out there, one that had smartly developed plot and characters, great soundtrack, good animation, and overall superb enjoyment not just for kids, but for young adults as well. I also said that a 7.78 score was way too low for a series that achieved something as great as developing each character propperly, have the characters arc influence in the main story arcs and present mature themes to little children without being too dark for them. And so the expectations for Adventure 02...were far too high; I wish I could say as well that the score (currently 7.34) is also low, that the series is the great sequel Adventure so much deserved. Sadly, it is not, 7.34 is the score this sequel deserves, if not lower (even into the 6s zone). Why is that? Let\'s see:Storywise: The storytelling is not bad, but much has changed, including the pace; Digimon Adventure had 5 story arcs, each 10 to 14 episodes long, which allowed it to move at a pace that never felt too quickly or too slow, each arc started and ended properly. Here... not su much; we have 3 story arcs, one of 21 episodes, then one of 17 and the last one of 12 episodes. We find some filler episodes in the first one, some ongoing character problems on the second (I\'ll fill that in the next section) and a rushed and convulted final arc that tries to make up for what is kind of a lagging season by bombing us with too much material that never gets developed (Demon, for instance).Now, don\'t be fooled; despite all its flaws the storytelling is still enjoyable, there are still mature themes around and the air of greatness of Digimon Adventure, however the flaws are too notorious and the characters also dragg it down, but I have to admit that they are all thought through, none of them comes out of thin air (give or take the final arc) and they all get somewhat their propper ending.The plot is not as good as the first Digimon series, but the potential is there. Now, why wasn\'t it fully used? Mainly, characters problems.Character: Here is where Adventure 02 just outright failed. Remember how amazingly outlined the characters from the first Digimon series were? Remember how they were just broadstrokes that got developed into fully fleshed out character and how amazing was that the crest of each character represented the very scent of how they were? Well, Digimon 02 mainly hopes you forgot about all that.We still have our main 8 characters from the first series, but 6 are downgraded to supporting roles, while 2 remain and 3 new character join (one more joins lare on). Now these 3 characters are the main trouble of Digimon 02.Daisuke (aka Davis): he is arrogant, he is reckless, and he is a good guy deep down, we have our most stereotypical hero! Of course, that wouldn\'t be a trouble with the propper character work, but here there is... none. There is no background to explain Daisuke\'s personality, whereas in Adventure we had backgrounds for each character. We know he has issues with her sister, but that never gets developed (not to mention we never get to know his parents). As the series goes forward Daisuke changes and matures, for no apparent reason; granted, being in the digital world fighting monsters does change people, but Daisuke\'s change really came without propper building up. He passed from annoying to tollerable, but mainly he was just plot fodder. But he is not nearly the worst character.Miyako (aka Joley): now here is a character that mostly everyone will hate! Why is that? Miyako is all talk and no action. She is energetic and sometimes you picture her as the optimistic one, but as soon as she get into the real danger she freaks out and it takes her about 5 minutes of screen time to realize she has to fight. As the series progress her character is mostly ignored and she is left with her characteristic energetic self and food lover life personality, with no development whatsoever or any background at all.Iori (aka Kodi): Want someone as annoying as Miyako? Iori might be the one. He is rigid and barely makes an expression, if any. Unlike the previous two, this character does have a background which is not only in sync with his personality, but actually linked with the final arc and despite being kind of interesting, the character himself remains the same for about the whole show, with no actual changes and nothing more than his usual poker face.Takeru (TK) and Hikari (Kari): They came from the previous series, so everything should be ok, right? Sadly no; both Takeru and Hikari are mainly ignored in this series. Takeru has about 3 good character moments in the show in the first arc, and then acts as plot fodder later on. Hikari is... well, I wouldn\'t know, she really doesn\'t fullfil any function here, give or take going to the dark sea world or supporting the rest on battle.Ken: Here is a character that actually got good treatment; he is given a nice background which is consistent with his personality, he is conflicted, and while shy he is mainly likeable for showing the brave to move forward and attone for his wrongs. He is the only one that actually gets good character moments and a character arc that is mainly involved in the plot. Sadly 1 out of 6 doesn\'t make the cut for good character treatment.Music: Gladly, the OST from the previous series remains here with the addition of some more tracks made just for this one, which are good. The opening theme, while not as amazing as the one seen in Digimon Adventure, is actually pretty good, both endings are also good, and the tracks that plays in the new evolutions moments are quite nice (specially the one when jogress evolution is made). So, yeah, still a 10 if you ask me.Enjoyment: For all its faults and failures in the character department, I still think I like this Digimon series. It has some very bad moments that made me ask myself ""why am I watching this crap?"" Followed by some very glorious moments that kept me on the edge of my seat and reply ""Oh, yeah. That\'s why"". Sure, if I had to grade each episodes, most of them would be on the range of C to B-, but there would surely be straigh As in the ways, but sadly some Ds or Fs too. As a whole, the enjoyment is fair: you get some very clunky, cheesy and boring moments, but you also get profounds and exciting ones (thank you BlackWarGreymon! And Taichi and the rest too for that matter), and as such the enjoyement is in thin line between fair and good.Stray observations (funny facts and bits of information I got while watching the series):-Did you know that originally Adventure 02 had 64 episodes, but the order got cut to 50 somewhere around the way because of low rating? Now we may understand why the finale felt so rushed.-There was supposed to be a rivalry between Daisuke and Takeru, but that gets forgotten at some point and then Daisuke just ignores Takeru; and they want to make us believe they are friends...-Daisuke and Ken, Miyako and Hikari, all got some good character moments and emotional pep talks previous to achieving jogress evolution. Takeru and Iori got it by having Takeru tell Iori ""have faith: well, that escalated pretty quickly-Demon (being sent to the dark world in episode 45): ""you\'ll regret this"". Apperantly this was set up for Digimon Adventure 03, which you know ended up being tamer so... no, they never regreted it. Besides, what was his purpose in the first place? We\'ll never know.-Ken (in episode 42): ""por favor déjeme entrar"" Ken, tu español no es malo, de hecho mejor que el de mucho japoneses, pero no deja de ser raro escucharlo.-Best character: BlackWarGreymon, surely, as he is a sympatetic villian at first and then a tragic hero. His arc is also the high point of the series, as he wonders for the meaning of life; he surely got the best character treatment, closely followed by Ken.-Worst character: Miyako, surely, clossely followed by Iori.-Daisuke (in the finale) ""I want to have a ramen shop!"" Ken: ""I never knew about this"". Nobody did Ken, and nobody even cared.-Award for most forgotten character from Adventure: Mimi, somehow the writers though sending one of their most developed characters into USA would make the cut. They were wrong. Also, I think Sora was pretty much forgotten too.That\'s it for now!

If you are yet to see the first one though, There are things you need to know from the prequel before you see this one..', 'I\'ve watched both Adventure and Adventure 02 back when I was a kid (I believe both were the English versions). Less than a week ago, I\'ve started re-watching. All 104 episodes. Here are my findings, hope you find them helpful:Characters:No matter how you look at it - you\'ll compare it to the first season. Where the first season had 8 original characters, all with an amazing background, unique in every way, this series simply does not have the same amount of effort put into it. Daisuke is even bolder than Taichi was, to the extent of you wanting to smack him in the face. Big...time. The same with Veemon. He\'s like Daisuke, and thus, annoying as hell. Didn\'t grow to either one of them.As for Miyako - wow. She\'s even more annoying. She\'s that one girl that nobody really hates, but has no real friends around her either. Comes from a family that runs a convenience store. Not really much to add here.. her Digimon is okay though.Iori. Iori, Iori, Iori-kun.. back then, I thought Takeru was a crybaby and rather holding the team back. But this guy? Wow. His Digimon is somewhat okay, he reminds me a bit of Tentomon, but a little more childish and adding -dagyaa behind everything he says.Takeru. Takeru sure has grown up. He\'s gotten used to fighting, protecting people, he\'s someone you can rely on. Patamon hasn\'t changed either. Both in a good way.Hikari still is the same sweet girl she was back then, only a little bit more mature. Back in Adventure, Taichi said that ""she was a person that really didn\'t care for herself, always sticking out for others"". That quality seems to have been flying away in this series. Even though that\'s the case, she\'s still likeable.Ken - well. I don\'t like him. Imagine someone torturing all of your friends, to the extent of almost dying, and then having him join your team because he was crying in a desert. Yeah. THAT kind of guy.The story:Well, yeah. A Chosen Child that thinks Digimon are just ""data""-segments that have no feelings, and thus abuses them? With evil rings? And with a whip he hits his partner with? Okay. The story after the Digimon Kaiser-era (which took up 25 episodes if I\'m not mistaken) grew a bit. Not a lot, just a bit.I immediately resented the bit where Veemon came out of his Digimental, and instantly knew what to do. ""YELL DIGIMENTAL-UP YOU BLOODY IDIOT, I DON\'T HAVE ALL DAY!"" is basically what it came down to. Where the original series was about the actual adventure, finding out what to do, where to go - this series has it all laid out before them.The art:It was still okay. Not that impressive, but good considering what year it came out in. Design of the Digimon.. well.. to be honest, I quite resented the Pegasus/Sphinx types that Patamon and Tailmon Armor-Evolved into.  BlackWarGreymon and Parrotmon were Digimon that shouldn\'t have been introduced any further. Parrotmon had its charm because it was, well, just there when the original Digidestined saw it fight.Sound:The music was great. Well thought-through, just like the first series. Music, sounds, nothing to say about those but good things! :-)Overall:I enjoyed the series, even though there were enough things that bothered me. The biggest of them all was the following:Remember how in the first series Digimon died all over the place? They wiped out Devimon without a second thought. That happened in the 13th episode. In the new series, the thought of having to ""destroy""/delete Digimon, first occured in episode 40. And even then, when it finally came down to it, all new Digi-destined didn\'t like the idea. Honestly, someone is trying to kill you, but hey, let\'s not try to kill him back? That annoyed the hell out of me big time.I still give the series a 7/10, mainly for the reason that the old Digi-destined (Taichi, Yamato, Sora, Jou, Koushiro and Mimi) were having a well formed role throughout the whole series. Don\'t get me wrong - if you\'ve watched the first season, I highly recommend you watch this one, just don\'t get your hopes all the way up. time. The same with Veemon. He\'s like Daisuke, and thus, annoying as hell. Didn\'t grow to either one of them.As for Miyako - wow. She\'s even more annoying. She\'s that one girl that nobody really hates, but has no real friends around her either. Comes from a family that runs a convenience store. Not really much to add here.. her Digimon is okay though.Iori. Iori, Iori, Iori-kun.. back then, I thought Takeru was a crybaby and rather holding the team back. But this guy? Wow. His Digimon is somewhat okay, he reminds me a bit of Tentomon, but a little more childish and adding -dagyaa behind everything he says.Takeru. Takeru sure has grown up. He\'s gotten used to fighting, protecting people, he\'s someone you can rely on. Patamon hasn\'t changed either. Both in a good way.Hikari still is the same sweet girl she was back then, only a little bit more mature. Back in Adventure, Taichi said that ""she was a person that really didn\'t care for herself, always sticking out for others"". That quality seems to have been flying away in this series. Even though that\'s the case, she\'s still likeable.Ken - well. I don\'t like him. Imagine someone torturing all of your friends, to the extent of almost dying, and then having him join your team because he was crying in a desert. Yeah. THAT kind of guy.The story:Well, yeah. A Chosen Child that thinks Digimon are just ""data""-segments that have no feelings, and thus abuses them? With evil rings? And with a whip he hits his partner with? Okay. The story after the Digimon Kaiser-era (which took up 25 episodes if I\'m not mistaken) grew a bit. Not a lot, just a bit.I immediately resented the bit where Veemon came out of his Digimental, and instantly knew what to do.

Don\'t get me wrong - if you\'ve watched the first season, I highly recommend you watch this one, just don\'t get your hopes all the way up.', ""Compared to the first season, this second season of Digimon Adventures is a step down in quality quite heavily. With exception to Ken, the new characters lacked the depth and problems that the first season kids experienced. This is especially a problem with new kid Davis, who is portrayed as a hot-blooded act-before-thinking boy who doesn't get much fleshing out nor any problems that he must overcome thus making him feel quite shallow as a character compared to much of the main Digidestined. The sad part is that Davis is made the leader of this generation's Digidestined, for better or for worst. The older members...of the first generation Digidestined are shafted to supporting roles whose their only roles in this series are to aid the current generation in explaining or advancing parts of the show's plot. About the only kudos I can give for characters in this series comes from Ken's developments where we learn of his tragic past and his efforts to reform by joining the Digidestined.The plot for this series isn't much better off either. Digimon Adventure 02 has a more light-hearted mood with nearly half of it focused on the Digimon Emperor arc and having a decent amount of filler. While the idea of the Digidestined taking on a human threat is a unique approach to this series, Ken's not as convincingly threatening as early villains like Devimon and Etemon since we seen the stakes faced by the Digidestined raised higher in each later arc for the first season and many of the villains weren't hesitant to take lives. Things got a bit too scaled back with convincing threats in this season. The large length of the Digimon Emperor arc actually causes problems for developments in later episodes of this season as the show tosses in multiple plot developments that are either sloppily introduced, abruptly resolved in the span of a few episodes or rushed through to seemingly force the series to another desired point in its plot. The series also suffers from wasted potential in what it could have introduced or expanded upon with several plot elements that were tossed in such as the Dark Ocean, Kari's unique powers and the Daemon Corps. Regrettably, these plot elements were instead just tossed in as filler and either were never focused on again or were quickly brushed aside. It looked like this season wasn't sure what kind of plot it wanted to deliver with how its later episodes are all over the place with developments. I don't even want to get started with how the series pulls off its final three episodes that reveal who the true enemy threat is and the abrupt happy ending it plays up.Otherwise, the visuals and other aspects to the plot are about what you would expect of generic titles: average artwork, reused animation clips, plain character designs, the run-of-the-mill 'evil' Digimon villains, Digimon being beaten to a pulp before their partners gain the power within to defeat villains and so forth.Even if you're a Digimon fan, I wouldn't waste my time trying to look into this second season to Adventure. The Digimon Emperor arc got too dragged out thanks to having several episodes worth of filler and this results in later episodes being a mess with their developments thanks to having several plot threads being tossed around that are awkwardly handled in their resolutions. Not to mention that other than Ken, the new Digidestined children lack the solid depth and development that the first-generation group underwent in their ordeals.

The only minor complaint for me of season 2 was that some of the kids of se1 has been replaced, though i had no idea what the story was about this time, except that digimons wil be used alright. It really had a more darker, less kidfriendly tone the further the plot revealed itself , slight psychological mindfucks, digimon enslavement, what the real purpose was of the digiworld ect ect. for the animation and the music it stayed and kept the things that se1 had thanks to its...popularity and ofc the dancemusicOP-ED. a lot of things came as sort of a suprise to me like any other kids that watched it back then, and talk of the day. it was certainly one of the best enjoyable t.v shows i had seen in a while next to DBZ and Pokemon! popularity and ofc the dancemusicOP-ED. a lot of things came as sort of a suprise to me like any other kids that watched it back then, and talk of the day. it was certainly one of the best enjoyable t.v shows i had seen in a while next to DBZ and Pokemon!', ""STORY: 9/10Digimon Adventures 02 contiues 3 years after Taichi, Yamato, Sora, Mimi, Jyou, Koshiro, Takeru, and Hikari travelled to the digital world for the very first time. The series starts with 3 new chosen children, Daisuke, Yolei, and Iori, who get a new digivice model which was sent flying from the computer after Taichi touches the digimental with the crest of courage on it. These new digivices allow the new children to not only open the gate to the digital world anytime they please, but they also allow for a new type of digivolution, the armor digivolve. But these three are not the only ones...who get new digivices, but also Takeru and Hikari from the first season. The chosen children team up in the first half of the series to fight against the evil Digimon Emperor, whose not only a human boy genius but is also another chosen child, Ken Ichijouji.ART: 7/10The artwork was not amazing but wasn't too bad either.SOUND: 8/10The music was pretty good but not as much as the first season.CHARACTERS: 7/10Daisuke: He is the crazier and more annoying version of Taichi.Yolei: I have one word to describe her...annoyingIori: Nothing comes to mind but boring.Hikari: Has matured from 01. But is still the same sweet girl who would go do anything for anyone no matter the cost for her. Not a bad thing. Actually this adds a bit of depth to her character.Takeru: Honestly I see him more as the new leader than Daisuke. He's gotten more mature, has gotten guts, but also has brains. He is also still affected by what happened to Angemon during their first battle with a major enemy in Adventures 01, which adds some depth to his character.Ken: He is by far my favorite character in Adventure 02. Even though you start of despising him with every being, after Wormon's death and his realization that the digitalworld isn't a game, his charcter really starts to shine brightly. This new character depth comes from his backround story and honestly he is the only new character who I care about in this season.The only problem I have with Ken is the fact that the stupid writers decided to do part of his backround story as a game called Tag Tamers instead of an OVA or I wouldn't of even minded an extra episode based on the first time he entered the digital world.ENJOYMENT: 8/10I found this season quite enjoyable. The story was kept me pretty interested but there were a few episodes that were pretty boring too.OVERALL: 8/10Even though there were some things I did not enjoy, it was still overall a great season and I would definately reccommend you give it a watch. Its probably better if you haven't seen this season to watch the first season as well as the first 2 Japanese dubbed movies. The first English dubbed movie contains the first 3 Japanese Dub movies cause they were all a half-hour long. who get new digivices, but also Takeru and Hikari from the first season.

The digital world is inhabited by digital monsters called Digimon. Unlike Pokemon, they have more than 3 stages: Infant (In Training), Baby (In Training II), Child (Rookie), Adult (Champion), Perfect (Ultimate) and Ultimate (Mega) with the first being the names of the Japanese dub and the latter in English.This series introduces a new ways of evolution and one additional new stage that in this series can be considered somewhere between Child and Perfect called Armor. Basically...it can\'t fit to the traditional Level system like the previous forms which can lead sometimes to weird things when it comes to power scaling Digimon.Like the previous season, the children get Digimon partners that help them develop and do the fighting.  Each having a unique personality. In the living world they stay in their In-Training II level and in the Digital World they are in their Rookie state.Unlike in the previous show, the children can go in and out the digital world with their upgraded Digivices whenever they desire.Another upgrade over its predecessor is the addition of more variety of soundtracks for evolution. The previous types of evolution have the old soundtrack but Armor Evolution, Jogress aka DNA Evolution and Ultimate Evolution have their own unique soundtrack.Digimon Adventure 99 was known for its great use of its protagonists. Sadly 02 can’t live up to the quality writing of its main cast.Daisuke aka. Davis is basically a goofy version of Taichi aka. Tai. He starts off as a naive kid who is brave but over the course of the series he also worries about others taking their feelings in consideration as he was the first to be willing to trust someone who turned a new leaf. In short he has both Taichi’s and Yamato’s aka. Matt’s crests from the previous season and gives his take on friendship and courage. His weakness, however, is that he can be clumsy and has a crush on Hikari aka. Kari.V-Mon encourages Daisuke often and shows a lot of personality. They are similar but often he feels embarrassed being part of Daisuke’s stupid plans to impress Kari. However, he has complete trust in Daisuke in fights even if it happens to be misplayed from the viewers perspective. He is one of the strongest members as he has the most evolutions.Miyako aka. Yolei an energetic nerd. However, despite being experienced with computers and helping out a lot with Koushiro aka. Izzy who has the crest of knowledge, she is associated with love and purity aka sincerity. Crest that don’t seem to fit her selfish, greedy and cheeky personality.Hawkmon is polite and has a cool design. There aren’t much notable interactions between these two.Iori aka. Cody is the deepest character of the original new members. Despite being the youngest, he is skilled in kendo and can defend himself when the situation calls for it. His father who used to be a police officer died in an accident during the line of duty before the start of the story which shaped his black and white view on the world. Over the course of the series, his world would start showing more tones of grey which leads him to help reform an antagonist to the side of good.Armadimon is a goofy armadillo who has some of the wildest evolution. Sadly he doesn’t contribute much to Iori’s character besides getting new evolutions out of them.From the previous season, two other characters get upgraded Digivices and work as guides for the new members. Them being Hikari and Takeru who grew up.Takeru aka. TK is more self confident unlike in the previous season and his knowledge sometimes end up helpful. Also some experiences from the previous season show a side not seen by TK so far and despite his on the surface cool self, there is a side of him that can’t forgive anyone who abuses the power of evil.Patamon didn’t change much from the previous season. Sadly he can’t use his old forms for most of the season due to various cases the show used to power down the old cast. However, he did get an armor evolution and later get a Jogress evolution.Hikari aka. Kari was the last introduced member in the previous season and pretty much a deus ex machina. In this season she has an actual personality being a curious child and showing the most amount of emotions ironically. However, she is often the victim of being dragged into weird dark worlds with creepy images leading to situations the other members have to safe her. Luckily that doesn’t happen often.Her partner Tailmon aka. Gatomon got powered down losing her holy ring putting her power down to child level despite being an adult level digimon. But she does get new evolutions that help her out in fights. In the previous season she used to be an antagonist and the deepest Digimon partner. In this season not much of her personality shines except when she meets the ghost of her best friend and someone she hoped to never see again.While 02 lacks good protagonists, it makes up for great antagonists. Some of which set the standards for many future Digimon antagonists to date.Ken the Digimon Kaiser (or Digimon Emperor) is an evil chosen child who uses the Dark Spirals and Rings to enslave all the Digimon like Devimon did in the predecessor. But unlike Devimon, Ken is far more effective. He builds towers that unable Digimon to evolve to the next level unless they use Armor Evolution making all the former cast members Digimon useless. He upgrades his gadgets when he sees there is an issue in them and even goes as far as building his own Digimon partner Chimeramon aka. Kimeramon. Ken has a tragic past where he used to be overshadowed by his overly skilled brother. Once that brother died, he took that role in the family becoming a new prodigy to the point anyone else looked inferior to him including his own parents. Seeing him rise, develop and fall is one of the most interesting story arcs not  being successfully replicated by other Digimon series yet.His real partner Wormmon is supporting him despite knowing what he is doing is wrong. He hoped some day that the kind Ken he befriended with would one day return. There is a great character arc between these two when Wormmon has to make a harsh decision in order to protect Ken.While he lacks Armor Evolution, he still ends up getting one of the strongest evolution in the show.Arukenimon and Mummymon are a duo of villains similar to Team Rocket. They are henchmen to a bigger villain but until that gets revealed, they work effectively creating powerful digimon using the Black Towers that were meant to seal the power of evolution. They end up creating one of the deepest Digimon characters in the show.BlackWarGreymon is visually just a black pallet swap of the original WarGreymon. Created by Black Towers, he is considered an evil Digimon. However, being mightier than his creators he disappears in the hopes to find the real reason he exists. This leads to him fighting the protagonists very often and his overwhelming power leads him often the win. It is very interesting to see what his search for meaning leads too.Oikawa is an adult man who desires to go to the Digital World and is willing to do that by any means possible. He has a traumatic past losing the only person who shared his love with the Digital Creatures who was Iori’s dad. He is really clever using various means to distract the protagonists from the main goal and even making them fight his enemies, the Deamon Corps who came to the world of the living creating chaos. Despite being a mere human, he uses his knowledge and assets well to get what he wants.However, there is a reason why 02 isn\'t as good as it could be. Rather pretty mediocre.After the Armor Eggs ended their purpose, we still didn\'t see the old kids using their Digimon to beyond Adult, but instead the new kids got Adult forms themselves and the show introduced a new evolution mechanic. So the show introduces cope outs to prevent the old cast coming with the latest evolutions and overshadow the new cast. But they will get some back for some nostalgia trip.And more and more restrictions were put in and adults have all forgotten about Digimon.And like with Tamers, 02 tried to tie in the Wonderswan games to excuse why Ken got evil. Ken\'s backstory got more and more confusing with many plotlines being dropped. The Dark Ocean plot went nowhere because Toei found it too depressing but aired ""out of respect"" the episode that confused everybody. Deamon Corps were, while powerful, filler villains that only filled the runtime like how MetalEtemon only existed as a sacrificial villain for Jou to make the non-Ultimate owning kids relevant somehow.And the old kids rarely did anything of value and the parents besides exceptions like Iori\'s were pretty much irrelevant.Female characters are meh unless we include Arukenimon. Miyako is selfish and hyperactive like a female Daisuke. She is  more useful than Sora and Mimi but her role can be replaced by Koshiro in several situation. Hikari is less active than in Adventure despite being here since the beginning this time.As a show where monsters fight each other, Digimon fights at the start aren’t that impressive. However, just seeing the different forms and the emotional struggles needed to archive the forms are usually worth it where the lack of good choreography can be looked past. There is a reason why many evolution, especially when they first appear, will stay with you. As the show progresses, the fights and budget improve. There will be a lot of recycled animation and the evolution to Child and Adult states seem rather lame. Like mentioned earlier, the new forms get a kickass soundtrack unique to them.Armor evolution is upgrading the Digimon for fast travel or other purposes.Jogress or DNA Evolution is an evolution method where two Digimon merge into one more powerful one. However, each Digimon gets a set partner they can perform it with and nobody can chose who their partner will be. However, fusing Digimon is still cool.There is the use of CGI for certain evolution which normally would be a turnoff, but since Digimon are digital creatures, the evolution scenes are tolerable and give the show a unique identity as many later Digimon series will use that concept for their transformation scenes.While Digimon is a kids show, it can be off putting or flat out scare the viewer as it goes on since the enemies can be deviant and scary.Digimon can reincarnate but only in the Digital World. Digimon drying in the living world cannot. And one human will outright die in his show.Digimon 02 is decent. It struggles to live up to the standards set by 99 and doesn’t take advantage of its old cast well to guide the new cast. However, it has amazing antagonist with lots of grey in them and are used as examples for future Digimon Villains yet to come out. it can\'t fit to the traditional Level system like the previous forms which can lead sometimes to weird things when it comes to power scaling Digimon.Like the previous season, the children get Digimon partners that help them develop and do the fighting.  Each having a unique personality. In the living world they stay in their In-Training II level and in the Digital World they are in their Rookie state.Unlike in the previous show, the children can go in and out the digital world with their upgraded Digivices whenever they desire.Another upgrade over its predecessor is the addition of more variety of soundtracks for evolution.

But unlike Devimon, Ken is far more effective. He builds towers that unable Digimon to evolve to the next level unless they use Armor Evolution making all the former cast members Digimon useless. He upgrades his gadgets when he sees there is an issue in them and even goes as far as building his own Digimon partner Chimeramon aka. Kimeramon. Ken has a tragic past where he used to be overshadowed by his overly skilled brother. Once that brother died, he took that role in the family becoming a new prodigy to the point anyone else looked inferior to him including his own parents. Seeing him rise, develop and fall is one of the most interesting story arcs not  being successfully replicated by other Digimon series yet.His real partner Wormmon is supporting him despite knowing what he is doing is wrong. He hoped some day that the kind Ken he befriended with would one day return. There is a great character arc between these two when Wormmon has to make a harsh decision in order to protect Ken.While he lacks Armor Evolution, he still ends up getting one of the strongest evolution in the show.Arukenimon and Mummymon are a duo of villains similar to Team Rocket. They are henchmen to a bigger villain but until that gets revealed, they work effectively creating powerful digimon using the Black Towers that were meant to seal the power of evolution. They end up creating one of the deepest Digimon characters in the show.BlackWarGreymon is visually just a black pallet swap of the original WarGreymon. Created by Black Towers, he is considered an evil Digimon. However, being mightier than his creators he disappears in the hopes to find the real reason he exists. This leads to him fighting the protagonists very often and his overwhelming power leads him often the win. It is very interesting to see what his search for meaning leads too.Oikawa is an adult man who desires to go to the Digital World and is willing to do that by any means possible. He has a traumatic past losing the only person who shared his love with the Digital Creatures who was Iori’s dad. He is really clever using various means to distract the protagonists from the main goal and even making them fight his enemies, the Deamon Corps who came to the world of the living creating chaos. Despite being a mere human, he uses his knowledge and assets well to get what he wants.However, there is a reason why 02 isn\'t as good as it could be. Rather pretty mediocre.After the Armor Eggs ended their purpose, we still didn\'t see the old kids using their Digimon to beyond Adult, but instead the new kids got Adult forms themselves and the show introduced a new evolution mechanic. So the show introduces cope outs to prevent the old cast coming with the latest evolutions and overshadow the new cast. But they will get some back for some nostalgia trip.And more and more restrictions were put in and adults have all forgotten about Digimon.And like with Tamers, 02 tried to tie in the Wonderswan games to excuse why Ken got evil. Ken\'s backstory got more and more confusing with many plotlines being dropped. The Dark Ocean plot went nowhere because Toei found it too depressing but aired ""out of respect"" the episode that confused everybody. Deamon Corps were, while powerful, filler villains that only filled the runtime like how MetalEtemon only existed as a sacrificial villain for Jou to make the non-Ultimate owning kids relevant somehow.And the old kids rarely did anything of value and the parents besides exceptions like Iori\'s were pretty much irrelevant.Female characters are meh unless we include Arukenimon. Miyako is selfish and hyperactive like a female Daisuke. She is  more useful than Sora and Mimi but her role can be replaced by Koshiro in several situation. Hikari is less active than in Adventure despite being here since the beginning this time.As a show where monsters fight each other, Digimon fights at the start aren’t that impressive. However, just seeing the different forms and the emotional struggles needed to archive the forms are usually worth it where the lack of good choreography can be looked past. There is a reason why many evolution, especially when they first appear, will stay with you. As the show progresses, the fights and budget improve. There will be a lot of recycled animation and the evolution to Child and Adult states seem rather lame. Like mentioned earlier, the new forms get a kickass soundtrack unique to them.Armor evolution is upgrading the Digimon for fast travel or other purposes.Jogress or DNA Evolution is an evolution method where two Digimon merge into one more powerful one. However, each Digimon gets a set partner they can perform it with and nobody can chose who their partner will be. However, fusing Digimon is still cool.There is the use of CGI for certain evolution which normally would be a turnoff, but since Digimon are digital creatures, the evolution scenes are tolerable and give the show a unique identity as many later Digimon series will use that concept for their transformation scenes.While Digimon is a kids show, it can be off putting or flat out scare the viewer as it goes on since the enemies can be deviant and scary.Digimon can reincarnate but only in the Digital World. Digimon drying in the living world cannot. And one human will outright die in his show.Digimon 02 is decent. It struggles to live up to the standards set by 99 and doesn’t take advantage of its old cast well to guide the new cast. However, it has amazing antagonist with lots of grey in them and are used as examples for future Digimon Villains yet to come out.', ""When I was a kid, I didn't get the chance to watch the whole first season because I discovered it late, so you can say that this part is the first I watched and I liked it a lot.

At least, only two of the main characters from the old show are actually main characters in this one. Unfortunately, they have the same problems from before as well.TK, although grown up a little too much, acts young a lot and Kari again is little miss Jesus with how perfect she is. Really, she seems to do nothing wrong with how caring she was. The other characters pretty much ether don’t grow, don’t change, or something around that until they hit a certain point and by then, I had lost interest in them. I think part...of this was because that they seemed to be made to be the embodiment of two characters from the older show.Davis is supposed to be Tai and Matt, Cody is Izzy and Joe, and Yolei is supposed to be Mimi and Sora. The only character that actually grew is Ken and actually, he replaced my favorite character, even if he was the bad guy for half the season almost.The two that really never stood out to me was Yolei and Cody. They just really didn’t have much screen time and seemed like the whole show could have just left them out and let it be Davis, Kari, and TK as the main characters.Now, Yolei feels like she was made as the exact opposite to Mimi in the first season. She had many brothers and sisters and was rather poor, but yet she kept whining and complaining like Mimi so it only sent a message to me that no matter what, girls will become bitchie no mater what… not the best to send to young women. With Cody, there really wasn’t anything to talk about.The voices are so off. I really don’t know who decided to have these characters sound the way they do but its worse then the first. T.K. sounded like he hit puberty faster then anyone else. His voice was not the voice of a young kid but of a much more teenage adult style.

Suffering from one of the worst reputations in the franchise, it is infamous for removing many of the elements that made its predecessor a hit, for having an erratic second half as a result of creative differences in the writing team, for ruining one of the fan-favorite ships, for ruining the appeal and respect of one of the fan-favorite digimons, and for a...questionable epilogue that left many fans with a bad taste in their mouths. Being the original series one of my all time favorite shows, this one is naturally among one of my personal biggest disappointments, although this only became this way after rewatching it as an adult (right after finishing rewatching the first one), since, for better or worse, I remember very well I actually had a very good time watching this continuation as a kid. I remember very well how I glued myself to my old CRT TV screen every day after school when it was about to start and how I begged my parents to buy me the expensive action figures, which in the end, is a fact I like since it acts as a proof that enjoying as a grown-up an anime first watched as a child is not only due to nostalgia, like it is commonly argued these days.Being it a direct sequel, it comes as inevitable to compare it to its predecessor. One of the main reasons that made Digimon Adventure an stand-out when it comes to children’s anime was that it chose to put the focus in the characters, their exploration and relationships instead of the cool action sequences and the light humor like it is the case in most kids’ anime or kids’ TV programming in general. All of this is just thrown away in 02 with the new gang of digi-destined kids. First, it already comes as strange the fact that there “has to” be a new generation of chosen children, leaving the old ones sidelined for supporting roles and automatically making them “not really that special” anymore, devaluing their status, though it comes as understandable when remembering that their arcs had already been closed in the original and creating them new issues to deal with just because a new series had to be produced could have felt somewhat exhausting and/or repetitive. But what is not understandable, is that, if the idea of a new generation was to keep things fresh -and with the exception of only one- the newly introduced kids had not received the same treatment as the original cast did when it comes to making them fleshed-out, fully-realized characters, lacking motives, backstories and/or personal struggles or fears to overcome, thus turning them into uninteresting characters from a substantial point of view. For kids this may not be a problem, but for adults the story is quite different. They do not face tests, they do not undergo any growing-up/learning process like the first generation did (what had been the true heart of the first series); they’re just there to accomplish their mission of defeating the bad guys. It doesn’t help the fact that two of them, Yolei/Miyako (an inferior version of Izzy/Koushiro) and Cody/Iori (an inferior version of T.K.), are simply too boringly designed with not a single trait/quirk that could have made them at least likeable characters to follow in the journey, and what could have at least made up for their lack of depth, like it was actually the case with Davis/Daisuke (the new generation leader and Taichi’s kouhai), whose adorably explosive, brash and happy-go-lucky personality made of him at least an entertaining character to watch. Even the experienced members of the group, T.K. and Hikari, don’t play major substantial roles besides supporting the new members in the digimon battles, which was especially unfortunate for Hikari considering she had been the least-developed member of the first generation due to her late entrance in the group and the one that had the largest potential.This state unfortunately is also extended to the new digimon-partners. One of the other hits of the first one was that in relation to the creatures of the show, the writers treated them more than just the accompanying, obedient pets used as the battle weapons and cared to give them more meaningful roles. And again, except for only one (Wormmon), this is also a merit thrown away in 02. While in the first one the digimon-partners had a relevant voice, morally supported their respective kid-partners in their growing-up/maturing processes and even had to learn how to get along with each other, understand each other and build a good, constructive relationship in order to accomplish their missions, this time the new team of creatures of the new generation well, are precisely just that: the accompanying, obedient pets used as the battle weapons; there is literally nothing else to say about them. Design-wise, they also do not fare much better. Unlike the original cast of creatures, they virtually lack any sort of distinctive, interesting personalities, and/or strengths, weaknesses and anxieties, which ultimately turned them into dull, unmemorable creatures the audience was unable to ever care for and/or feel anything for. Lastly, and more importantly, it was a shame to see how the whole purpose of the original series was forgotten too: to make their digimon-partners evolve and become powerful enough to defeat the enemies in turn, the kids had to first learn a lesson and work upon their personal virtues represented by their crests; digi-evolving didn’t come at no cost, it had to be earned. 02 throws away that valuable spiritual connection between the digimon and the kid where the powering-up of the former was tied/conditioned to the character growth/psychological evolution of the latter, by making the digimons instead digi-evolve either just because an object allowed it (armor evolution) or because the kids decided it was time to do so (DNA/jogress evolution), making clear that the focus this time shifted from character development and teaching life lessons, to the action sequences and selling more toys. There’s even a submarine-shaped main digimon, literally!One of the aspects where this sequel did improve upon the first one, was the characterization given to the enemies. However, this improvement was unfortunately spoiled and could not live up to its full potential thanks to a general lack of narrative focus and creative differences that will be explained later. In the first series, all the villains were digimons and most of them weren’t characterized beyond the basic evil guys who seeked world domination (I say most because there were two better elaborated). Now, things got more interesting since, despite the still-presence of some cartoonish villains (Arukenimon and Mummymon), there are three main ones that do get more meaningful backgrounds and motivations and do provide more meat and maturity to the show (making up for the lack of character exploration of the children), with two of them in this occasion human beings (no enemy in the first one is a more sensitive, morally complex human being): Ken Ichijouji (the “Digimon emperor”, and later sixth member of the new digi-destined generation) and Yukio Oikawa. The former, an insecure, lone-wolf boy with a tragic past who uses the digitalworld as a form of escapism and personal fulfillment by enslaving and hurting the digimons (and who later must redeem himself for all the pain he caused and learn how to fit with and trust the rest of the team); the latter, a misunderstood old man with an unsatisfied childhood dream, and the third one, BlackWargreymon, an artificially created digimon with the capacity of thinking and having feelings that develops an existential crisis and wanders through the digitalworld looking for answers. Unfortunately, none of the arcs of these villains is executed in a satisfying manner neither are they convincingly tied together. As interesting as Ken’s backstory is, the show fails to capitalize on it by making his merciless actions result of only being infected by an evil spore and not because of genuine “inner demons”, and never “truly” mean when we learn that he had always thought that the digimons were not real in the first place. The show also never really knew what to do with BlackWargreymon and his existential crisis, eventually became a hurdle to the writers, and in the end, they simply decided to get rid of him with a disrespectful “goodbye” type of resolution. Finally, the value of Oikawa’s story was sharply lessened after being pushed into the background with the introduction of the far less interesting last enemy towards the end, completely ruining his “now this is really the main one” condition. Despite most of them being more basic and cartoonish, at least all the villains of the first series were executed effectively with no unsatisfactory conclusions.Which brings us finally to the core failure of the series: the fact that its storyline is simply a straight, big fat mess. 02 suffered heavily from creative differences, studio meddling, poor planning and a general lack of agreement in what story to develop. After the first arc (the digimon emperor arc), which had already been way longer than it needed accounting for 45% of the whole show (an excessive amount when remembering it was only an introductory arc to present the new chosen children, their new digimon-partners and the new digi-evolutions), the story never really picked a clear direction, never found a clear north, never knew where it wanted to get from the start, meandering from plot point to plot ploint without ever properly delving deeper into any of them in particular. It starts developing -or announces the intention to develop- many plot threads at once, each fighting for the show’s attention with none of them really “winning”, without concluding any of them well with a good pay-off, solving in a quick and questionable way some (Destiny Stones and Daemon) or even simply dismissing others without explanation (the Dark Ocean and Dragomon), which ended up being unexplored, worthless elements. In order to give a minimal sense of coherence, the writers tried to tie everything together conveniently resorting to making most of the introduced villains simply being used or manipulated by the following one, from Ken Ichijouji to Yukio Oikawa, but it wasn’t an useful tactic since the damage to the watching experience had already been done and the mess had already exceeded its no-return point. There was never a sense of a tight structure, it seemed like the plot was being written by two (or three) different writing teams who never knew what the others were writing, and as a result no plot thread was well-developed neither concluded, the chances of taking advantage of the potential of every of the (well-characterized) introduced enemies were missed as mentioned before, and obviously, this also resulted in the audience losing its interest in the way since it was never clearly told what or where to put its attention to. In addition to the narrative department, it doesn’t help that, unlike the first series where not a single episode was irrelevant or was not contributing to the story progression, 02 does include a lot of fillers during the first arc that do not add anything relevant and are completely skippable, so we have an overly long first half where not much was going on and a second one where too much was going on but didn’t last accordingly long enough.As if all this wasn’t already enough, 02 features other bothering and/or disappointing story elements that do not help its cause:•\tArmor-digievolution:  if the reason the first generation could not fight against the digimon emperor was because the control spires inhibited the normal digi-evolution, what exactly prevented them of using the digi-eggs and armor-digievolve then? Nothing. They didn’t do it just because the writers/producers wanted (or needed) to introduce a new generation and give them the whole spotlight.•\tNew digivices (D3): the new generation has new digivices that are the ones that allow their digimons to armor-digievolve, while the first generation doesn’t.  Again, why couldn’t they just give the first generation those new devices instead of selecting a new gang for that matter? And where did they even come from? Who or what crafted them this time?•\tCrest-inheritance and characteristic colors: the first generation had 8 members while the new one 5 (later 6), with 2 of them repeating their roles (T.K. and Hikari). The new generation had to inherit the virtues of the first one, but since T.K. and Hikari already had their own (hope and light), this meant that 3 members were each going to receive 2 of them, so we have 3 members with 2 and 2 members with 1, which made no mathematical sense. Why then couldn’t they bring in 3 other members? And why couldn’t T.K. keep his own characteristic yellow color? Because Iori/Cody was going to be now the new yellow child? But why would Cody be the yellow child if he inherited the crests of knowledge and reliability, being none of them the yellow ones?!•\tDigitalworld anyone? It was baffling to notice how the rest of the humanity, being now fully aware of the existence of the digitalworld, was always behaving quite normally, as if they had never ever seen anything particularly odd. Why wouldn’t they want to know more about it? How could it be that it was not even a topic of daily conversation? They all saw the digitalworld, a whole new dimension, in the end of the first series, and now they were acting like nothing happened!•\tDigital Park: the D3s allowed the kids to now easily come and go from the digitalworld at their own will, whenever they want. This automatically meant both that the tasks in the digitalworld the new kids had to deal with were not going to be as tough and arduous as the ones of the first gang were (who never had the possibility to return home to comfortably rest in their beds by the end of the day), lessening the stakes, and that the digitalworld was no longer a difficult, far place to reach and walk in, lessening its value. They even go there to have picnic days!•\tChosen children worldwide: for what? So now it turns out that our special group of 8 children of the first series wasn’t really that special, since there were other chosen children in other parts of the world. Seriously, why? It only served to ruin the privileged status of the first gang and the whole concept of being a “chosen children”, which was supposed to mean something truly special.•\tAnd last, but not least, some blatant plot-holes and inconsistencies here and there regarding the crests and the roles of the first generation, but there’s no need to go in full detail with them.There’s also not much point to talk in detail about art, animation and music as their quality is about on-par with the original. Character designs, backgrounds and color-palette follow the same style, though part of the surrealist sense of the backgrounds is lost now. There’s not much difference in terms of animation quality (budget is still limited), it reuses a lot of the great tracks composed before but doesn’t forget to add new ones as well, and while the opening “Target” and the new digi-evolution sequences themes “Break Up!” (armor-evolution) and “Beat Hit” (DNA/jogress evolution) are legitimately awesome and blood-pumping, they aren’t as memorable and iconic as “Butter-Fly” and “Braveheart” respectively were.All in all, it’s hard to see the second installment of the Digimon series as a competent and worthy one, to the point of even thinking that it probably would have been better no sequel at all. The show is just pure wasted potential from any angle you can look it from. It never knew how to capitalize on all the plot-threads it introduced (Ken Ichijouji, Dark Ocean, Dragomon, BlackWargreymon, Destiny Stones, Sacred Beasts, Daemon and Yukio Oikawa); its convoluted nature after the digimon emperor arc led to some of these ideas to be developed and concluded in disappointing and/or questionable ways and others to be simply abandoned, failing to engage the viewer with a thrilling, well-constructed narrative unlike the first series. There are also too much story-elements that don’t make sense or are too convenient, starting with the fact that nothing stopped the original team to use armor or jogress digievolution, so a new team was not really needed in the first place. It’s also hard to understand how, if the main reason that made the first series stand out as a kids-oriented series was the focus put into the characters, their development and life-lessons, with the inclusion of dark themes adjusted to children’s sight, this had been removed now with this new team being totally underwritten and far less interesting and endearing than the first one, who were now only there to defeat the villains without going through a personal growth and learning journey themselves. As a result, 02 failed to be a rewarding, entertaining experience, which wasn’t able to replicate the same captivating sense of adventure, mystery and wonder the original enjoyed and to provide well-earned, memorable moments like the original did. It’s pretty telling of the bad execution of the new stories when the most enjoyable moments actually came from the cute “slice-of-lifey” parts of the original gang which was now playing supporting roles!If they were not going to have the intention of doing something more substantial with the new protagonists and their new digimons, in that case it would have been much better not to introduce them at all. The show could have been better off by just keeping the first cast and only introducing Ken as the 9th child. By also developing more Hikari, who didn’t have much participation in the first one due to her late entrance, with a story related to learn how to become independent of his overprotective brother and her tendency to be swallowed by darkness, and even T.K., who despite not being a crybaby anymore, was still affected by the divorce of his parents and feared being abandoned. By delving deeper into Ken’s redemption process and his childhood trauma after realizing all the pain he had caused to the digimons. By also never introducing BlackWargreymon with whom they never knew what to do in the end, and making Daemon the final villain instead of the boring one finally shown. By never introducing the international chosen children, who never contributed with anything significant besides devaluing the special-status of the main characters. And finally it also would have been definitely a much better (and natural) idea to make the main plot revolve around the global reaction of the rest of the world to the newly discovered digitalworld, exploring more about it, its nature and the roles of the chosen children, with a more coherent, gripping storyline, instead of focusing it in the personal goals of a particular human being.Being the first Digimon series one of my all-time favorite shows, it’s pretty evident how much of a disappointment rewatching its sequel was, to the point that, despite liking some aspects of it (like the explosive, fun personality of Davis/Daisuke, the new generation leader and watching how the first one is now living their early teen years), I prefer pretending that it never really existed. In addition to all its structural narrative issues and others, Digimon Adventure 02 looks more like a show designed to promote and sell merchandise with action-packed sequences instead of bringing to the screen a well-built, meaningful storyline. While this works for kids, with all certainty it won’t be the case for adults who want to see more than that. Nevertheless, it is precisely for this reason that despite being quite a flawed sequel, there’s no need to be too harsh with it either. After all, it’s still decent, or perhaps more than decent entertainment for kids (the demo it was always targeted to) who are mainly going to pay attention to the creatures, their designs, evolutions and battles, like I myself did when I was a kid. I would not have liked it back then if this weren’t the case. Strictly speaking, from an adult-perspective, 02 is deserving of a 4/10, but considering that for its target audience it’s more like a 6/10 or even 7/10, I’ll be giving it an extra point. However, if you happen to be over the age of 12 or at most 13, just watch the original Digimon Adventure and watch this one only out of curiosity, or alternatively just skip it entirely and move to the third entry of the franchise, Digimon Tamers, the first one to take place in a different universe with a different set of characters, and to many Digimon fans, the best entry of the whole franchise from a critical standpoint. 5/10. questionable epilogue that left many fans with a bad taste in their mouths.

It doesn’t help the fact that two of them, Yolei/Miyako (an inferior version of Izzy/Koushiro) and Cody/Iori (an inferior version of T.K.), are simply too boringly designed with not a single trait/quirk that could have made them at least likeable characters to follow in the journey, and what could have at least made up for their lack of depth, like it was actually the case with Davis/Daisuke (the new generation leader and Taichi’s kouhai), whose adorably explosive, brash and happy-go-lucky personality made of him at least an entertaining character to watch.

Lastly, and more importantly, it was a shame to see how the whole purpose of the original series was forgotten too: to make their digimon-partners evolve and become powerful enough to defeat the enemies in turn, the kids had to first learn a lesson and work upon their personal virtues represented by their crests; digi-evolving didn’t come at no cost, it had to be earned. 02 throws away that valuable spiritual connection between the digimon and the kid where the powering-up of the former was tied/conditioned to the character growth/psychological evolution of the latter, by making the digimons instead digi-evolve either just because an object allowed it (armor evolution) or because the kids decided it was time to do so (DNA/jogress evolution), making clear that the focus this time shifted from character development and teaching life lessons, to the action sequences and selling more toys. There’s even a submarine-shaped main digimon, literally!One of the aspects where this sequel did improve upon the first one, was the characterization given to the enemies. However, this improvement was unfortunately spoiled and could not live up to its full potential thanks to a general lack of narrative focus and creative differences that will be explained later. In the first series, all the villains were digimons and most of them weren’t characterized beyond the basic evil guys who seeked world domination (I say most because there were two better elaborated). Now, things got more interesting since, despite the still-presence of some cartoonish villains (Arukenimon and Mummymon), there are three main ones that do get more meaningful backgrounds and motivations and do provide more meat and maturity to the show (making up for the lack of character exploration of the children), with two of them in this occasion human beings (no enemy in the first one is a more sensitive, morally complex human being): Ken Ichijouji (the “Digimon emperor”, and later sixth member of the new digi-destined generation) and Yukio Oikawa. The former, an insecure, lone-wolf boy with a tragic past who uses the digitalworld as a form of escapism and personal fulfillment by enslaving and hurting the digimons (and who later must redeem himself for all the pain he caused and learn how to fit with and trust the rest of the team); the latter, a misunderstood old man with an unsatisfied childhood dream, and the third one, BlackWargreymon, an artificially created digimon with the capacity of thinking and having feelings that develops an existential crisis and wanders through the digitalworld looking for answers. Unfortunately, none of the arcs of these villains is executed in a satisfying manner neither are they convincingly tied together. As interesting as Ken’s backstory is, the show fails to capitalize on it by making his merciless actions result of only being infected by an evil spore and not because of genuine “inner demons”, and never “truly” mean when we learn that he had always thought that the digimons were not real in the first place. The show also never really knew what to do with BlackWargreymon and his existential crisis, eventually became a hurdle to the writers, and in the end, they simply decided to get rid of him with a disrespectful “goodbye” type of resolution. Finally, the value of Oikawa’s story was sharply lessened after being pushed into the background with the introduction of the far less interesting last enemy towards the end, completely ruining his “now this is really the main one” condition. Despite most of them being more basic and cartoonish, at least all the villains of the first series were executed effectively with no unsatisfactory conclusions.Which brings us finally to the core failure of the series: the fact that its storyline is simply a straight, big fat mess. 02 suffered heavily from creative differences, studio meddling, poor planning and a general lack of agreement in what story to develop. After the first arc (the digimon emperor arc), which had already been way longer than it needed accounting for 45% of the whole show (an excessive amount when remembering it was only an introductory arc to present the new chosen children, their new digimon-partners and the new digi-evolutions), the story never really picked a clear direction, never found a clear north, never knew where it wanted to get from the start, meandering from plot point to plot ploint without ever properly delving deeper into any of them in particular. It starts developing -or announces the intention to develop- many plot threads at once, each fighting for the show’s attention with none of them really “winning”, without concluding any of them well with a good pay-off, solving in a quick and questionable way some (Destiny Stones and Daemon) or even simply dismissing others without explanation (the Dark Ocean and Dragomon), which ended up being unexplored, worthless elements. In order to give a minimal sense of coherence, the writers tried to tie everything together conveniently resorting to making most of the introduced villains simply being used or manipulated by the following one, from Ken Ichijouji to Yukio Oikawa, but it wasn’t an useful tactic since the damage to the watching experience had already been done and the mess had already exceeded its no-return point. There was never a sense of a tight structure, it seemed like the plot was being written by two (or three) different writing teams who never knew what the others were writing, and as a result no plot thread was well-developed neither concluded, the chances of taking advantage of the potential of every of the (well-characterized) introduced enemies were missed as mentioned before, and obviously, this also resulted in the audience losing its interest in the way since it was never clearly told what or where to put its attention to. In addition to the narrative department, it doesn’t help that, unlike the first series where not a single episode was irrelevant or was not contributing to the story progression, 02 does include a lot of fillers during the first arc that do not add anything relevant and are completely skippable, so we have an overly long first half where not much was going on and a second one where too much was going on but didn’t last accordingly long enough.As if all this wasn’t already enough, 02 features other bothering and/or disappointing story elements that do not help its cause:•\tArmor-digievolution:  if the reason the first generation could not fight against the digimon emperor was because the control spires inhibited the normal digi-evolution, what exactly prevented them of using the digi-eggs and armor-digievolve then? Nothing. They didn’t do it just because the writers/producers wanted (or needed) to introduce a new generation and give them the whole spotlight.•\tNew digivices (D3): the new generation has new digivices that are the ones that allow their digimons to armor-digievolve, while the first generation doesn’t.  Again, why couldn’t they just give the first generation those new devices instead of selecting a new gang for that matter? And where did they even come from? Who or what crafted them this time?•\tCrest-inheritance and characteristic colors: the first generation had 8 members while the new one 5 (later 6), with 2 of them repeating their roles (T.K. and Hikari). The new generation had to inherit the virtues of the first one, but since T.K. and Hikari already had their own (hope and light), this meant that 3 members were each going to receive 2 of them, so we have 3 members with 2 and 2 members with 1, which made no mathematical sense. Why then couldn’t they bring in 3 other members? And why couldn’t T.K. keep his own characteristic yellow color? Because Iori/Cody was going to be now the new yellow child? But why would Cody be the yellow child if he inherited the crests of knowledge and reliability, being none of them the yellow ones?!•\tDigitalworld anyone? It was baffling to notice how the rest of the humanity, being now fully aware of the existence of the digitalworld, was always behaving quite normally, as if they had never ever seen anything particularly odd. Why wouldn’t they want to know more about it? How could it be that it was not even a topic of daily conversation? They all saw the digitalworld, a whole new dimension, in the end of the first series, and now they were acting like nothing happened!•\tDigital Park: the D3s allowed the kids to now easily come and go from the digitalworld at their own will, whenever they want. This automatically meant both that the tasks in the digitalworld the new kids had to deal with were not going to be as tough and arduous as the ones of the first gang were (who never had the possibility to return home to comfortably rest in their beds by the end of the day), lessening the stakes, and that the digitalworld was no longer a difficult, far place to reach and walk in, lessening its value. They even go there to have picnic days!•\tChosen children worldwide: for what? So now it turns out that our special group of 8 children of the first series wasn’t really that special, since there were other chosen children in other parts of the world. Seriously, why? It only served to ruin the privileged status of the first gang and the whole concept of being a “chosen children”, which was supposed to mean something truly special.•\tAnd last, but not least, some blatant plot-holes and inconsistencies here and there regarding the crests and the roles of the first generation, but there’s no need to go in full detail with them.There’s also not much point to talk in detail about art, animation and music as their quality is about on-par with the original. Character designs, backgrounds and color-palette follow the same style, though part of the surrealist sense of the backgrounds is lost now. There’s not much difference in terms of animation quality (budget is still limited), it reuses a lot of the great tracks composed before but doesn’t forget to add new ones as well, and while the opening “Target” and the new digi-evolution sequences themes “Break Up!” (armor-evolution) and “Beat Hit” (DNA/jogress evolution) are legitimately awesome and blood-pumping, they aren’t as memorable and iconic as “Butter-Fly” and “Braveheart” respectively were.All in all, it’s hard to see the second installment of the Digimon series as a competent and worthy one, to the point of even thinking that it probably would have been better no sequel at all. The show is just pure wasted potential from any angle you can look it from. It never knew how to capitalize on all the plot-threads it introduced (Ken Ichijouji, Dark Ocean, Dragomon, BlackWargreymon, Destiny Stones, Sacred Beasts, Daemon and Yukio Oikawa); its convoluted nature after the digimon emperor arc led to some of these ideas to be developed and concluded in disappointing and/or questionable ways and others to be simply abandoned, failing to engage the viewer with a thrilling, well-constructed narrative unlike the first series. There are also too much story-elements that don’t make sense or are too convenient, starting with the fact that nothing stopped the original team to use armor or jogress digievolution, so a new team was not really needed in the first place. It’s also hard to understand how, if the main reason that made the first series stand out as a kids-oriented series was the focus put into the characters, their development and life-lessons, with the inclusion of dark themes adjusted to children’s sight, this had been removed now with this new team being totally underwritten and far less interesting and endearing than the first one, who were now only there to defeat the villains without going through a personal growth and learning journey themselves. As a result, 02 failed to be a rewarding, entertaining experience, which wasn’t able to replicate the same captivating sense of adventure, mystery and wonder the original enjoyed and to provide well-earned, memorable moments like the original did. It’s pretty telling of the bad execution of the new stories when the most enjoyable moments actually came from the cute “slice-of-lifey” parts of the original gang which was now playing supporting roles!If they were not going to have the intention of doing something more substantial with the new protagonists and their new digimons, in that case it would have been much better not to introduce them at all. The show could have been better off by just keeping the first cast and only introducing Ken as the 9th child. By also developing more Hikari, who didn’t have much participation in the first one due to her late entrance, with a story related to learn how to become independent of his overprotective brother and her tendency to be swallowed by darkness, and even T.K., who despite not being a crybaby anymore, was still affected by the divorce of his parents and feared being abandoned. By delving deeper into Ken’s redemption process and his childhood trauma after realizing all the pain he had caused to the digimons. By also never introducing BlackWargreymon with whom they never knew what to do in the end, and making Daemon the final villain instead of the boring one finally shown. By never introducing the international chosen children, who never contributed with anything significant besides devaluing the special-status of the main characters. And finally it also would have been definitely a much better (and natural) idea to make the main plot revolve around the global reaction of the rest of the world to the newly discovered digitalworld, exploring more about it, its nature and the roles of the chosen children, with a more coherent, gripping storyline, instead of focusing it in the personal goals of a particular human being.Being the first Digimon series one of my all-time favorite shows, it’s pretty evident how much of a disappointment rewatching its sequel was, to the point that, despite liking some aspects of it (like the explosive, fun personality of Davis/Daisuke, the new generation leader and watching how the first one is now living their early teen years), I prefer pretending that it never really existed. In addition to all its structural narrative issues and others, Digimon Adventure 02 looks more like a show designed to promote and sell merchandise with action-packed sequences instead of bringing to the screen a well-built, meaningful storyline. While this works for kids, with all certainty it won’t be the case for adults who want to see more than that. Nevertheless, it is precisely for this reason that despite being quite a flawed sequel, there’s no need to be too harsh with it either. After all, it’s still decent, or perhaps more than decent entertainment for kids (the demo it was always targeted to) who are mainly going to pay attention to the creatures, their designs, evolutions and battles, like I myself did when I was a kid. I would not have liked it back then if this weren’t the case. Strictly speaking, from an adult-perspective, 02 is deserving of a 4/10, but considering that for its target audience it’s more like a 6/10 or even 7/10, I’ll be giving it an extra point. However, if you happen to be over the age of 12 or at most 13, just watch the original Digimon Adventure and watch this one only out of curiosity, or alternatively just skip it entirely and move to the third entry of the franchise, Digimon Tamers, the first one to take place in a different universe with a different set of characters, and to many Digimon fans, the best entry of the whole franchise from a critical standpoint. 5/10.', ""I watched digimon adventure 02 when I was still a kid, I did enjoy it very much. After I grow up, and rewatching it, I can't believe that it had a bunch of flaws in it. Let's go into it...Story: 5/10Being connected with 1st adventure series, the story involves about digimon kaiser, who make rampage on digital world, torturing digimon becoming his servants. New chosen children had to stop him for what he did. The story of kaiser become connected with the next villain and more. My problem is, the story had a LOT of annoying plotholes, especially on the dark ocean episodes. It's cliche,...didn't make sense at all. It tended to be darker but it failed, more like a useless filler. It was nice to see the connection between the old villain with the next one until the last villain, making it become clear about the controversies.However, the ending of the episode is just not what it should be. I was disappointed for the ending. But overall, the story is okay-ish, degraded from the straightforward adventure 1.Characters: 8/10Despite of huge plotholes, the characters are more or less good, except the main character. It had fair enjoyable moments between characters, sometimes are annoying. And it had a few good teen drama.Daisuke was just an annoying generic typical shounen main character. He's the most annoying of all, he tends to be more anime-ish character. Even though so, he did a few best job especially in before last episode. Maybe that's what I can only appreciate him for.Takeru was a crybaby on adventure 1, but he get developed well in adv 2, becoming much level-headed and not being crybaby anymore. Despite being nice, there's a time when we can see his anger because of something traumatic of him. It had a burden of not being able to overcome the trauma. But eventually he could do it well.Ken, the former kaiser, was unexpectedly first a villain which later become the protagonist, but apparently, he's not that evil and tyrant. His back story were very sad and making it sympathetic. Deeper psychological problem goes to him. After being freed from being kaiser, he only thought that he's not forgivable, and just being depressed. Fortunately, he eventually can overcome that feeling and become developed really well.Iori is a kid with more level-headed person. He had a trauma of being left by his late father because of accident in his job as an officer. Somehow, he's still being childish and couldn't control his emotion well. He did developed well eventually, despite not much changes of him. Things got more complex with Iori when he found the truth of his father's relation.The rest of characters are good just the way they are. However character like Miyako seemed annoying, despite she had done some best job in a few moments. I have no comment for Hikari, but she's just so so. Most of old chosen children had developed well too.The villains are much better than cliche adventure's. They have their own reason of why they become the bad one. I really appreciate that the series can made the watcher being sympathetic for the villains. However, the last villain was a degradation, and not enjoyable.Music: 9/10As usual, digimon series are very well-known of their epic music. Opening was catchy enough, ending was nice as well. Soundtracks are good enough, but the thing that I really like was the insert songs. Break Up and Beat hit are epicness, fitted the evolution scenes really well. Bokura no Digital World was so good and memorable.Art: 8/10I have no comment for the general art, but they did really well with the 3D CG evolution scenes especially for imperialdramon.Enjoyment: 8/10I still enjoy it as if I was still a kid, but it went down quite a bit when I found the big flaw on the plot. But I enjoy the characters very well also the epic insert song.Overall: 7/10Despite the degradation of the plot of the story, it still did well. However, I can still think that a connected story or second season of same story of digimon isn't that needed. Thanks for reading my review. didn't make sense at all.

Thanks for reading my review."", ""(This review contains some negative thinks, if you wouldn't want to know, then don't read this)Truth to be honest, I've never watched 02 before last May 2013, but I knew all of the character since I've ever seen all of them once.Dare if I say that I give 5 to characters? Yes, I did.Gosh! The characters were so so soooo bad! I even can't understand how could this show turn to be like that! From a very good quality, to be a bad one. Although I still can't understand how could Daisuke turn to be the leader meanwhile Takeru and Hikari were having more...experience than him, and I can see that Toei tried to make Daisuke 'shine' among the rest. I can't and will never understand their reason.The most annoying thing is of course, jogress. Again, I can't understand how could Daisuke and Ken's jogress can turn to be the best one. To make him shine? Yes I think so. More so, even though I can accept Daisuke-Ken and Takeru-Iori's jogress, but still, I'll never ever ever ever accept Hikari-Miyako's jogress. It's not only because I was expecting for (Takari fans is here. Sorry.) Takeru-Hikari's jogress, but I think Hikari and Miyako's jogress was too fast. Slapped to each other and jogress? I think it was very funny. But so, I think it can be better if Takeru-Hikari jogress together. It's not because I'm (sorry) shipping those two together, but I think they have a lot of history that the rest don't have, and Takeru has been together with her longer than Miyako did.My annoyed reached maximum once I watched the crappy and fail epilogue. (Warning: Epilogue spoiler).It was very VERY funny to beat the final boss only by mentioning your future, and so, why should their Digimon be there then? Indeed, it was taught us that every people has their own bright future, but unlike 01, I think they were told us in a wrong way. Another thing is, even though they mentioned Ken-Miyako as a canon couple, and we can see from Sora-Yamato's kids, but I think Takeru-Hikari are the one that deserved to get mention and being a canon couple like them. It wasn't funny if they're not got a  mention just because the viewer had known that they would be together, even though I've known that they're actually together.I do really really HOPE that they won't repeat the same mistake again in later Spring, since I was hoping a good show (ex: Dark Ocean) and some of good scenes about the interaction between each others. Not to mention that I need an official announcement about Takeru-Hikari's relationship, since they were my ship before I even knew what ship meaning was, lol. experience than him, and I can see that Toei tried to make Daisuke 'shine' among the rest.

Before watching this, I knew it could never be as good as the original one. I was right, and I decided to write a review hoping to benefit you all.Story: Well, the series is four years after Adventures 1, and three new digidestined are introduced. I was excited to see the previous eight children at the beginning, but the series seemed to revolve around the new digidestined. It would have been great if Adventures 2 was all about the grown up digidestined ready for another mission to save the world. However, even...though these new characters werent as good as the previous, the series still had potential. unlike adventures 1, which has 5 sections with different enemies, this series is mainly split into two: the fight with the digimon emperor, and the one with Arukenimon and Mummymon. The episodes concerning the digimon emperor are sort of the sam as the clash with devimon, where the only difference is that a human is controlling digimon, with dark rings/spirals instead of gears. After that its all Digidestined clashing with Arukenimon, where the plot thickens and becomes better and better. The DNA digivolving is pretty cool, but I prefer the way Digimon could digivolve into ultimate. The finale of the series was unexpected and naive. The writers seemed to have create the ultimate enemy, Malomyotismon, yet they end up destroying him by children\'s dreams? I was expecting Omnimon to finish the job or some new DNA Digivolving. And the way the series ended was also pathetic, where every child had a digimon. It was better to keep it to the digidestined.Art: art was pretty good, the digimon were still monsters and not cute cuddly animals like in the digimon movie. Nothing to criticizeSound: I always wish the series could decide the voices and lines of the digimon from the beginning. Like Digmon saying ""drill of power"" and ""drill of knowledge"" interchangeably.Character: The new digidestined are nothing compared to the original. Cody nags alot and Yolei is annoying. Davis is fun but still, nothing like Tai. Also, they hesitate to destroy the digimon, which was something never mentioned in the first series and was a total bummer. It was surprising that the digidestined have been killing digimon for 54 episodes and in this new series, its ""not right"" because they ""have a heart"".Enjoyment: Despite it being sort of a ""different"" series, my favorite series ever was Digimon 1 and seeing characters from there in Digimon 2 was awesome. I enjoyed many scenes of the series, and I liked the soulsearching of Ken, and how the old digidestined gave advice and help to the new ones.Overall: I enjoyed this series, and despite its flaws, everyone who has seen the first series must see this. The show went downhill after this. though these new characters werent as good as the previous, the series still had potential. unlike adventures 1, which has 5 sections with different enemies, this series is mainly split into two: the fight with the digimon emperor, and the one with Arukenimon and Mummymon.

Nothing to criticizeSound: I always wish the series could decide the voices and lines of the digimon from the beginning. Like Digmon saying ""drill of power"" and ""drill of knowledge"" interchangeably.Character: The new digidestined are nothing compared to the original. Cody nags alot and Yolei is annoying. Davis is fun but still, nothing like Tai. Also, they hesitate to destroy the digimon, which was something never mentioned in the first series and was a total bummer. It was surprising that the digidestined have been killing digimon for 54 episodes and in this new series, its ""not right"" because they ""have a heart"".Enjoyment: Despite it being sort of a ""different"" series, my favorite series ever was Digimon 1 and seeing characters from there in Digimon 2 was awesome. I enjoyed many scenes of the series, and I liked the soulsearching of Ken, and how the old digidestined gave advice and help to the new ones.Overall: I enjoyed this series, and despite its flaws, everyone who has seen the first series must see this. The show went downhill after this.', ""The rating system on here is trying to tell me that by ranking something a 4, it means I think it's 'Bad' and that's not really the case, but I like 02 less than Adventure and, critically speaking, Adventure is only a 5, so... you do the math.When it comes to the sound and the animation, 02 has pretty much the exact same flaws as its predecessor. Add to that that season two's characters weren't nearly as likable, and the story gets a bit sloppy after the halfway mark. That said, this is another crucial part of my childhood, and I did still really...enjoy it.Critically speaking, it doesn't hold up quite as well as the original, but it does still hold up. enjoy it.Critically speaking, it doesn't hold up quite as well as the original, but it does still hold up."", ""---Dcm18's quick reviews---Story: 7 (Not that great, I was expecting much more)Art: 7 (Mediocre animation, good designs)Sound: 8 (Solid, good OP)Character: 6 (Major flaw - the new chars sucked)Enjoyment: 7 (Meh not bad)Overall: 7.0 (Worse than it's great prequel, still good though) "", ""ENG: Digimon is an anime with great potential and deserved to have a second season. Well, not this specific. Comparing this sequence with the first anime is seen that the production team did not give a deserved attention, creating a lazy story! First of all, as  a sequence, then all the events occurred in the first anime must be respected, correct? Well, some of them, but others do not, for example: part of Japan has seen the digidestined and the whole world has seen that digiworld exists, and no one cares to know about the digiworld and what can affect in the real world....Besides that, all the characters have a normal life after all the events of the first anime and no one in the world goes after them to seek clarification. Speaking of digidestined, the new ones are very basic, but they are not bad. The real  problem is (and even serious) to put almost all the old digidestined (6, to be more exact) as simple supporting in this new story (they do not even seem to care about the digiworld and digimons anymore, they care more about their lives personal, only in some cases do they appear). Speaking of history, oh my God! (Many episodes nothing important happens ! It seems a lot of filler) It's a set of adventures that are not so challenging and without excitement. The new villains (with the exception of the emperor digimon) are very uninterestin ( especially Oikawa) and others are recycled (lack creativity when it comes to creating them).At least the animation (including the new digievolutions) are very cool ,as well as sound, which is in the same quality as the first digimon series.PORT: digimon é um anime com grande potencial e que merecia ter uma segunda temporada. Bem, não essa em específico.Se comparar essa sequência com o primeiro anime é visto que a equipe de produção não deu uma atenção merecida a ele, criando assim, uma história mais preguiçosa! Primeiro de tudo, como é uma sequência, então todos os acontecimentos ocorridos no primeiro anime devem ser respeitados, correto? Bom, alguns sim, mas outros não, exemplo: parte do Japão viu os digiescolhidos e o mundo inteiro viu que o digimundo existe, e com isso ninguém se preocupa em saber sobre o digimundo e o que isso pode afetar no mundo real. Além disso, todos os personagens tem uma vida normal após todos os acontecimentos do primeiro anime e ninguém do mundo vai atrás deles buscar esclarecimentos ou informações.Falando em digiescolhidos, os novos são bem básicos, mas não são ruins. O problema mesmo é ( e grave até) colocar quase todos os antigos digiescolhidos ( 6, para ser mais exato) como meros coadjuvantes nessa nova história ( eles nem parecem se preocupar mais com os digimons e o digimundo, eles se preocupam mais com as suas vidas pessoais, somente em alguns casos eles aparecem). Falando na história em si, que coisa estranha viu! ( muitos episódios não acontecem nada de importante! Parece episódios filler) É um conjunto de uma aventura pouco desafiante e sem empolgação. Os novos vilões ( com exceção do imperador digimon) são bem desinteressantes ( principalmente o Oikawa) e outros foram de certa forma reciclados( faltou criatividade na hora de criá-los). Pelo menos a parte da animação (incluindo as novas digievoluções) estão bem legais, assim também como a parte sonora do anime, mantendo a qualidade do primeiro Digimon.

This is because the head executives meddled too much in the making of this series and hired two writers who had different ideas as what to do with the series. As they couldn\'t agree on anything, the result was quite a lot of filler episodes to reach that target of 50...episodes long. The first story arc, the digimon emperor, lasts for about half of the series, so it feels too stretched out and thin. Also, the ending of the series seems to be tagged on as a way to bring the series to a definite close. The last battle in the series is against a villain that appears only in episode 48 of 50 for crying out loud! But I haven\'t even gotten to the worst part yet. Davis.Davis is the most disappointing character in the whole series. He\'s hot-headed, rash, stupid and just plain annoying. He has no character development whatsoever. The Davis in the first episode is exactly the same as in the last. He has no demons of his own, and so we don\'t seem him face any emotional or personal battles at all. Not to mention, the voice acting behind him is irritating as well. Davis just seems like the guy that\'s been thrown in there to make the show look ""cool"" to attract an audience.However, this series\' one saving grace is Ken. For anyone that doesn\'t want spoilers, skip the following paragraph.Ken has the most explored personality and background and we a shift in character throughout the series. At the beginning, he\'s the evil digimon emperor, an evil, merciless character who enslaves digimon and makes them battle for his amusement. But, as he realises the pain that he\'s caused, we see him become more humble, and ashamed of the mistakes he\'s made. There\'s an entire episode, ""Genesis of Evil"", that\'s dedicated to him ""finding his heart"" where we discover where the darkness inside of him came from and this is some of the best character development in the series. Slowly, he learns to be kind and gentle again, and he learns to trust the other digi-destined and joins them in their battle against evil as he tries to forgive himself for the horrible things he\'s done. The only other character in the series to have any other real emotional turmoil is Cody, who\'s father died while on the job as a police officer.Overall, this series isn\'t really a must watch for a general anime fan. There isn\'t anything special about the series and there are a lot of problems with the lack of plot and character development. However, if you\'re a long time digimon fan like I am, you\'ll probably enjoy the series anyway as it does feature appearances from the original digi-destined from the first series, even if they do sometimes seem like cameo appearances. It\'s not a great series but it still has the same comedic charm that the first one did, even if it doesn\'t live up to the expectations set for it. episodes long.

Seriously, first she looks like a christmas tree, then she looks like she fell asleep in a hair dryer. Sry, but that was a little to much for my taste. OK, now that that's out of the way, let's start the review:To be honest, every time I watched it, I could never really decide on what to make of this season. Twice I thought I never even finished. The shifts in tone and story make it almost seem like two separate seasons. But let's start with the first half:The Ken...story arc was always one of my favourite story arcs. It shows how human some people can be even under the most inhumane circumstances and how manipulation and despair can drive people into near insanity. I really favour Ken in the first half, because he is actually an antagonist with purpose. In flashbacks you see, that he didn't start of as an antagonist but as a nice young boy with a huge premise. He fell because his despair took over and started to control his actions. This is, what made him so fascinating in comparison to the antagonists of the first season. They were purely meant to be evil, Ken on the other hand has a reason for his behaviour. It would be even stronger, if they would have explored it more. But for what it is, it's pretty strong.The second half of the series we sadly return to the regular Digi-formula. Bad guy is bad and does bad guy things, and for what reason, well, because. At least this is what you get until the end, were the truth behind his actions is revealed. You don't get behind it unless you have hindsight from watching the season before. The shift in tone is so drastic, that I thought I didn't even finish watching the season,... twice. When I started rewatching, I never could even tell what happend in the second half. When I reached the halfpoint I usually think, oh, that seems familiar until I realize, that I actually did finish the season. It actually is so forgettable, that you almost overlook, that it contains a very strong story, i.e. the story of Black Wargreymon. It is one of the strong points of this season, because you see and feel the dilemma that enshrouds this poor soul. And it gets even better, when you see all this search for rhym or reason and purpous being discussed with Agumon. But yet it could have been analyzed more, but we had a basic good vs evil story to shoot so what the heck. The climax also couldn't be more sentimental and clichéed. I don't want to spoiler to much so I keep it very basic, but it is a little to much even for my taste. And then the ending: After Adventure 01 seeing those charaters all grown up, all those connections build, those deep and affectionate friendships... Actuallly, it would have been better, if they wouldn't have shown anything instead of what was shown. A lot of people had problems with this ending, because a lot of outcomes were really unexpected and undesired. Sry, but why build up those deep feelings and bondings when they go nowhere, At least not in the way, everybody wants them to go? Those last 5 minutes, they didn't ruin only the second season but the whole adventure arc in total.After raging about the story I could start raging about the characters. Let's start with the well drawn characters,... um... well, oh yeah, the characters from the original series. But actually, it's more of a nostalgic value that is present rather than really interesting characters. It's nice to see how they are doing now after the timespan of 3 years. But actually all the strong points of these characters have been reduced to mere shadows. I mean of course, there are new characters to show and develope, and those characters are, well, how do I say this, mediocre at best. They seem to be cardboard cutouts from the characters of the first season. You've seen those characters, those characteristics, those motives and those backstories. Davies represents Tai and Matt, Yolei represents Sora and Mimi, Cody represents Issy and Joey, T.K. and Kari are, well not really T.K. and Kari. Kari became the boring clichéed, well, girl, I guess and T.K. became kind of grown up, but in a kind of way that's kind of out of charakter. OK let's say Davis and T.K. are quite interesting characters, they overtook the places of Tai and Matt. Davis is very heart warming and sympathetic. And yet his design, well, in my opinion from Tai to Davis it's a downgrade, but that's just my opinion. I like fancy hair desing more than the basic buzz cut. Nevertheless he is hartwarming and generally nice, sometimes stupid but has his heart in the right place. The only thing I find really enoying is his exaggerated affaction for Kari. You always saw Kari and T.K. have a special bond and he never really fitted into this scheme. I'd rather not go into more detail with Kari and T.K. if I want to avoid rage mode. T.K. on the other hand seems to be more rational and less emotional. He has his moments but he grew up te become very calculating and quite contradicting to his character of adventure 01. You could argue, that the events of 01 made him that way and yet it's still a little out of place. He still seems a little boring, because he is so basic and chichéed, even though he is one of the interesting characters of the series. The best character has to be Ken. He has the most interesting backstory and he has a lot of screen time to flash out his inner struggle and his misunderstanding of the Digimon and the worlds both digital and real. He still keeps your interest and is the only thing to pull you through the transition episodes between the two story arcs. Yet as soon as this is over, the interest value decreases pretty much, wich is a shame, cause he started of with a lot of promise.The Digimon are, well, without true characteristics, except of course for Black Wargreymon. He actually still keeps your interest high when the other part of the story falls flat. But I talked about him already, so no need to repeat myself. The other Digimon, except for Wormon, are, how do I phrase it, just there. Wormon is very passionate and shows his deep affections for Ken. He is the reason he snaps out of his rage so he shows purpous.The antagonists... basic. Nothing special, rather boring. But I already talked about it as well.One point that sticks out and is always a favourite part of each series is of course the music. The songs are all memorable. Once you started watching a seasons, good luck getting those songs out of your head. Wada Kouji really had a good feeling of what sticks and what describes the mood and set up of a Digimon series.To sum it all up now, I can say, it's basic, but still enjoyable. It doesn't stick to long except for these songs. The story is mediocre but that's for Digimon standards so the standards are pretty high. The characters are here and there enjoyable but on the whole quite forgettable. And the ending kind of ruins it all, for the set up expectations that everybody wanted to see and hoped to become true where not fulfilled at all. Yet it was nice to see the characters from the first season you learned to love all grown up.So my final conclusion would be, that I definately recommend this season yet keep your expectaions low to avoid disappointment. story arc was always one of my favourite story arcs. It shows how human some people can be even under the most inhumane circumstances and how manipulation and despair can drive people into near insanity.

Where every one of them are in high school except for Takeru and Hikari which are in greade 5.This season actually has a 3 part stories. This season actually feature 2 new evolution. Armor evolve and jogress evolvearc 1: The story feature 4 new characters.

But that is mostly what stopped me from rating this lower.I never knew this anime was so heavily edited...I have been reading the wika pages of this season and apparently there is an original version that I guess is just the subbed version. They made a lot of changes that I did not think was necessary.But what...really bugs me about the second season is that while the new kids seemed to quickly embrace and took to being in the digital world and fighting battles, they seemed really disconnected from each other before and after the digimon emperor arc.There is a lot of angst than there was in the first season and this whole ""you killed a digimon, you are a bad person"" holier than thou attitude crap in nearly every episode is pathetic. They punch each other a lot because they have a lot of dumb melt downs and they are not really fully connected/bonded with their digimon like the original seven were.Another thing I found to be tiring was all the digivolving. I enjoyed it the first season but this season I found it happening too much. There were too many stages and even then they were not strong enough. It would make for a good show if it weren\'t so constant. really bugs me about the second season is that while the new kids seemed to quickly embrace and took to being in the digital world and fighting battles, they seemed really disconnected from each other before and after the digimon emperor arc.There is a lot of angst than there was in the first season and this whole ""you killed a digimon, you are a bad person"" holier than thou attitude crap in nearly every episode is pathetic.

It's another anime from the Digimon franchise, and this time it's called Digimon Adventure 02. Now, I know what you're thinking, 'Another anime about kids with digital monsters? Haven't we seen this before?' But fear not, my dear viewers, for Digimon Adventure 02 has a few tricks up its sleeve.Set three years after the events of the original Digimon Adventure, this anime follows a new group of children who team up with the original DigiDestined to save the digital and real worlds from destruction. Along the way, they encounter new Digimon partners,...powerful enemies, and some familiar faces.While Digimon Adventure 02 may not have the same nostalgia factor as its predecessor, it still manages to deliver some solid action and adventure. The characters are likable, the animation is impressive, and the story is engaging enough to keep you invested.But if I were to attempt it, I might say something along the lines of, 'Well, isn't this just a jolly good anime with its mix of new and old characters, exciting battles, and all-around digital goodness? It's almost enough to make me want to dust off my old Game Boy and relive my childhood.'Overall, I'd give this anime an 8/10. While it may not be groundbreaking, it's still a solid addition to the Digimon franchise and an enjoyable watch for fans of the genre--------------------------------------Well, well, well, apa yang kita punya di sini?

The main plot was good, and very tight, with little deviations into slice-of-life or romance and few slower episodes, which means I was consistently interested from start-to-finish. It had a darker tone compared to the original Digimon Adventure, and while i\'m not one to say ""DARKER=BETTER"" (I mean, I really like Cardcaptor Sakura) in this case it worked to the show\'s benefit as it provided a lot of interesting episodes, such as the (allegedly) H.P. Lovecraft-inspired Dark Ocean stuff, or Ken\'s backstory.The dialogue was...less cringe-worthy than the first season, as the over-reliance on bad puns (at least in the dub) was either reduced or I just got used to them (might be a little bit of both), and a good amount of the humor I found funny, which I can\'t really say for season 1. By the same token, there was a good number of genuinely moving moments. The fight scenes were nothing special, but were fine.There were still a number of problems which prevented me from giving it a higher grade. I did not like Davis, though I might be biased because in the dub his voice was very strained and constantly cracking, which I found very annoying.  In addition, while the majority of the show ranged from decent-good, very few episodes went above that. A big factor was that like the first season I found the animation and art largely mediocre, and that put a damper on it in a lot of ways. A lot of the fight scenes weren\'t as exciting as they should be, a lot of intense scenes were nowhere near as intense as they should be, and there were very few scenes which looked particularly cool.But overall, it was a good season. Anyone who liked the first season should like this one as well. less cringe-worthy than the first season, as the over-reliance on bad puns (at least in the dub) was either reduced or I just got used to them (might be a little bit of both), and a good amount of the humor I found funny, which I can\'t really say for season 1.

Anyone who liked the first season should like this one as well.', 'The original Digimon Adventure stands, in my somewhat biased and nostalgic opinion, as one of the best kids shows and kids anime of all time.  Deep, well written, with a fun environment and great, developing cast of characters, not to mention awesome creature design, and a far more ambitious sense of scope than it really needed.  So as a kid, when 02 was announced?  I was hyped.  We were getting a whole new season, and if Digimon had taught me anything, it was that when things move on to the next stage, it\'s just bigger and better, and usually has more...spikes.Well.  02 has spikes, I guess.Simply put, 02 is a show that is badly overshadowed by its predecessor, and that stands both for in general, and for the characters in the show.  It does what so many ""sequel"" anime do - adds new gimmicks, more flashy character designs and powers, but fails to actually develop the characters or the story with any degree of finesse.  I\'m looking at you, Yu-Gi-Oh, when I say this.  And Dragonball GT.  Is Armor Digivolving cool?  Absolutely.  Jogress/Fusion Digivolution?  Sure!  But I need more than that, actually, and 02 isn\'t really inclined to give it to us.One need only take a look at the main cast of this season.  Our original chosen children, with the exception of Takeru and Kairi, have ""aged out"" of being protagonists, and it is, admittedly, fun to see them a couple years more mature, having changed their look and style a little bit.  It would be better, though, if we got to follow the characters we love instead of these guys, though.  Daisuke, Miyako, and Iori - or Davis, Yolei, and Cody if you prefer - aren\'t horrible characters, necessarily, but they\'re far weaker than the ones whose shoes they\'re stepping in, and 02 could not make that all the more apparent if it tried.  The entire story of the season is based on them fitting the legacy that\'s been left for them, with Daisuke inheriting Tai\'s courage and Yamato\'s Friendship, Miyako inheriting Sora\'s Love and Mimi\'s Purity, and Iori getting Koushiro\'s Knowledge and Jou\'s Sincerity.  Except none of them are as good as the characters they are taking the place of, and when they\'re getting the screen time and emotionally-tied powerset of two previous characters, you\'d think that might at least mean they get twice the development and growth, right?It doesn\'t.We see the cast of the first series struggle, grapple with real problems, grow and flourish as they come to terms with things like what love really means, what it means to be a leader, or a hero, a big brother or a son or a dozen other things.  Our hero and rival butt heads over two different ideas of family and taking charge, our main heroines start as contrasting ideas of femininity that soon become fast friends who respect one another deeply, and even our kid sidekicks get a ton to do.  Daisuke in episode 1 and Daisuke in episode 50 of 02, though?  Basically the same dumbass.  An endearingly well-meaning dumbass, sure, but I don\'t feel like he\'s actually learned or changed in any meaningful way.That goes for all of them.  Really the two characters with the strongest arc this time around are villains, with our first arc enemy of the Digimon Kaiser, Ken Ichijouji, suffering a massive fall from grace, a brutal awakening from his ""middle school syndrome""-induced sociopathy, as he realizes that he\'s been living a cruel child\'s dream to hide from his real pain.  Now that\'s good stuff, but he\'s side-lined compared to Daisuke and Iori and Miyako who, simply, don\'t do a lot.  There\'s Black WarGreymon, too, a manifested symbol of darkness, literally brought to life out of the corruptive influence of a Dark Tower, who has to learn what it means to actually have a soul and be alive, and is far and away one of the most memorable arcs of the entire show, but it\'s only a few episodes and late in the game.Instead, 02 is more content to show off fun Digimental evolutions and the way that their main characters use their powers, or introducing villainous gimmick after gimmick from dark rings, to dark spirals, to dark towers, to dark spores.  And while Digimon Adventure has a slightly rote ""new enemy pops up with More Power"" dynamic as well, as is typical for kid friendly action shows, 02 couldn\'t be more transparently by the books, not to mention the sometimes inexplicable appearances of villains like Demon just to, well, show up and make trouble it feels like.So with the story and character stripped down to bare parts, you\'re left with what Digimon always was.  A somewhat cheaply animated show designed to sell toys and video games, and while again, 02 has some really stand out moments of animation and ambition - the jarringly weird but fantastically atmospheric HP Lovecraft pastiche in the Dark Ocean will always linger with anyone who watches this season - it only feels all the more cut and paste and by the book because it doesn\'t have story beats and character work like Adventure to make up for it.Ultimately, 02 is a disappointing follow up to an unexpected and underappreciated gem.  A show shouldn\'t take so much time reminding you how much better that the old cast was than the new one, either - especially if they\'re just going to ruin it at the end with this, the first (for me) and worst of the ""and then they grew up and had kids"" epilogue.  It sticks badly in my craw, and has only gotten worse after seeing Harry Potter, Naruto, Bleach, and a dozen more do the same, though I\'m not sure any have made me more upset than this incoherent mess.No wonder they go in a different creative direction for Tamers, and I\'m excited to see how that one holds up.  And at the end of the day, 02 is a perfectly fine show.  It\'s still Digimon.  Your beloved characters are here, the monsters are fun and interesting, and while the story is by the book, it\'s competently told, with probably a stronger all around villain roster than Adventure had, besides.  But all it really is is yet another kid\'s anime capitalizing off media buzz, and it\'s predecessor, to fill air time and make a buck.  If you go in just wanting 50 episodes of kid-friendly lightness, you\'ll be content.  Just don\'t expect anything more. spikes.Well.  02 has spikes, I guess.Simply put, 02 is a show that is badly overshadowed by its predecessor, and that stands both for in general, and for the characters in the show.

Gatchaman Crowds Insight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21039/Gatchaman_Crowds_Insight,"[""There are two kinds of sequels in the anime world - ones that are made because the writer has more story to tell and one that’s made to cash-in on the original. And whilst this new Crowds anime played out like the latter during quite a few points, the little man inside my mind always kicked that possibility to the curb whilst saying “Cash-in on what, exactly? It didn’t sell great, it’s not popular on MAL, and had so many production issues it’s a wonder people fell in love with it at all”. Unfortunately, another man who lived in my mind responded with “why exactly...does this sequel exist then? What is it being insightful of? It feels more like a side-story in the vein of Gat Out of Hell rather than a continuation of what Crowds created”.I don’t know what happened from there on out, but let’s just say the word “clusterfuck” might have a new picture in the dictionary soon enough. So you’ll have to excuse me if this review isn’t very coherent, but Nakamura anime are tough to summarize in general - unless it’s Tsuritama, in which case we can easily summarize it as coherent whilst also easily summarize it as being awful - so I doubt more than two guys are going to give me shit for this.So sometime after Hajime absorbed Berg Katze into herself and caused the Crowds system to be widespread, popularity for the current state of things has declined and a mysterious organization called VAPE is causing havoc around Japan. However, things become even more complicated when an alien named Gelsadra (or Gel for short) crash lands on the planet, near a girl named Tsubasa who ends up becoming a new member of the Gatchaman on the basis that she’s basically Hajime 2.0. I don’t exactly have a good grasp of what happens afterwards, so let’s just say that VAPE’s entire purpose is to show that the current system is flawed without making much of a struggle after that’s done, causing the prime minister to resign and Gel to run for his position. From there on, the show becomes a load of idea-slinging as Tsubasa and the other characters do their best to maintain order despite Gel having a personality that makes Steve Carell’s stupidest roles look smart.Gatchaman Crowds has never been a very subtle show, but that’s not exactly a valid complaint because The Simpsons wasn’t exactly Cowboy Bebop during its time either. What is a valid complaint is the feeling of “hey, haven’t we already done this?” that a lot of the show goes through. Too many of the themes are recycled from the first season or are so similar that it makes no difference, and because the show is mostly focused on the characters trying to maintain things rather than fix things this go-around (there’s literally no main villain in Insight and anything that could pass for one is more an annoyance than a threat), there’s a giant lack of urgency going on in the proceedings. Which probably wouldn’t be too bad by itself, but Crowds’ lack of compelling answers to the issues that it raises hasn’t been fixed either, and the issues it raises are stuff people have talked about multiple times by now. Yes they’re still relevant, but a good story would do its best to hammer in why it’s still relevant.Does Insight do this? Maybe, but the show lost me around the last third and it wasn't exactly holding my attention before then either, so I wouldn’t be able to tell you either way. All the logic-bombs at the expense of actual story or action that didn't end anticlimactically were more alienating than Ghost in the Shell’s long cold philosophical jargon, and it got to the point that I was no longer a participant in its world, basically becoming Paiman with even less understanding of the situation. I couldn’t tell you what Tsubasa contributed to the story either other than being Gel’s best friend. And I couldn’t tell you what the significance of the Kuu-samas were beyond presenting a conflict that the characters had to solve, although I will say they weren’t the least bit threatening and I can’t recall them affecting much to begin with.Action was never the point of Crowds, actively rejecting it as a solution whilst using technology and words as an alternative to defeating Lord Zedd, and I respect that. But we have so many western cartoons that deal with all this social satire stuff now in the exact same manner, and they do it way better in terms of getting to the point whilst also being funny to boot. Remember when I said that Prison School felt like a South Park episode that felt stretched out to more than ten times the length? Insight is a Rick and Morty episode that feels the exact same - although aliens have been done in South Park as well.In fact, the finale of Insight reminds me of the finale of Rick and Morty’s latest season in terms of the final resolution and how the latter was executed so much better. Without spoiling too much, in both finales, an important/beloved character makes an important sacrifice in order to allow the people they love to have a better future amongst their alien brethren in order to end their seasons on an emotional note. However, whilst Rick and Morty decided to let the visuals and overall direction speak for the event's impact itself, Insight ruins it by having the entire final episode dedicated to explaining the sacrifice and what it accomplished despite the fact that I clearly got the idea in the episode prior. And I didn’t even think it was that much of a sacrifice since the show hasn’t exactly established its universe as one where characters suffer any permanent damage unless having to live with Mamoru Miyano’s voice for the rest of your life is considered your personal hell. I’ll give it points for being something new in the Crowds universe, but that’s like praising the most controversial scene in Man of Steel by saying “at least it did something differently to The Dark Knight” and nothing else.Look, I like the core idea of Crowds fine. But at the end of the day, I just don’t see why this sequel needed to exist. It didn’t fix the problems I had with the first season (bar not being as ridden with production issues) and it didn’t follow-up on anything said season set up, coming off more like an expansion pack rather than a vital part of the Crowds’ canon. Doesn’t exactly help that the characters just aren’t any fun here either. The two new leads did as much for me as a CD drive attached to my television set, mostly because they felt like rehashes of previous characters. And the returning characters’ annoying traits really get exemplified when they’d rather examine the story rather than contributing to it.Seriously, what the fuck happened to the Hajime from the first season? The one who was always taking charge and leading humanity towards the brighter side of life despite all the complaints directed towards her attitude? The Hajime in this anime is nothing but talk, with half her old self transferred to the new girl and the other half sailed into space. does this sequel exist then? What is it being insightful of?

Just a quick note: this is my first time writing a review on MAL and English is not my first language, so excuse my poor mistakes and grammar.Either way, let\'s go!Story - 7As a few others noticed, the second season took a rather different route than the first - Gatchaman Crowds had more of the ""heroes fight the bad guys"" kinda thing going on while Gatchaman Crowds Insight had  more of a ""people debate on whether to do one thing...or another and the heroes step in from time to time"".

The OP is one of the catchiest I\'ve heard in a while - WHITE ASH (the artist who performed the OP in the first season) did a splendid job.Character - 6While the characters were enjoyable (both design and personality wise) and quite believable, after watching the first season (which had one of the best character developments in my opinion), this seasons characters were a bit disappointing. There was some development, but it wasn\'t as big as in the first season.Enjoyment - 9As i said, this show could be enjoyed even without getting too deep into the story, thanks to the amazing animation and music. The comedy was still there, action could be found at times - it\'s a fun series to marathon (even with the rather emotion-wrecking end).

The results are more mixed than last season.  Part of the problem is that it feels like the first several episodes spend a lot of time twiddling their thumbs and not really going anywhere.  The Gatchaman are famous now, they got a new member, a friendly alien has shown up, and it doesn't feel like much happens with them for a while despite there being a new enemy.  Then it feels like they rush into the major event that drives...the rest of the series, and it feels really contrived and oversimplified.  I know any series like this tackling something like that is going to be a little bit, and I've see criticism of the last season along those lines, but it feels like it's done poorly enough that it really takes away from the impact of what they were trying to say.  However, the last 1/3 or so finally gets back into the swing of things and is the sort of thing you wanted out of a followup to CROWDS.  It's just a shame it takes so long to get there.

Dont get me wrong, the issues addressed in this are very relevant in the modern world, and it really hits back home to us audience. However, despite the good plot, it was a disappointment to me because of the introduction of the empty, superficial and disgustingly irritating new main character, Tsubasa.Seriously, I cannot even bear to call her Hajime 2.0! She is so immature and useless, and yet she tried to do stuff her own way, screw things up for everyone and including Geru. On top of this, even after...she realizes her mistake, she doesnt have the GUTS and CAPABILITY to deal with the troubles she herself caused! And Hajime, who was attempting to stand aside and watch over her junior warmly, also probably (just a speculation) trying her best to deal with Katze in her body (which I cannot imagine to be an easy task no matter how she did it), has to risk her life in order to clean up the mess Tsubasa created. At the very least, when Hajime tries to do things in a different way from others, there was a reason behind it and she was always able to solve the problems (when there actually was one) herself. So, I just cannot bring myself to recognize Tsubasa as Hajime 2.0.It is a real pity because to me, whether the characters are lovable and interesting enough to catch my attention is often more important than the plot elements itself. Despite the good plot, the character Tsubasa stops me from rewatching the anime again as her character is just that physically and mentally revolting to me.However, I still love the original characters, including Hajime and Katze. OMG i love Katze and Miyano Mamoru does an awesome job as usual voicing this character. Throughout the anime, I find myself calling for Katze to come out once again in order to destroy the world and Tsubasa LOLOL.So well, my personal opinion on this, it is okay to watch it the first time, but I cannot bear to rewatch this anime DESPITE the other cute characters like Katze cos of one irritating character. It is a real pity. she realizes her mistake, she doesnt have the GUTS and CAPABILITY to deal with the troubles she herself caused!

It is a real pity.', 'If you\'re here, presumably you\'ve already watched season one. Gatchaman Crowds Insight is a suitable extension and an improvement on what\'s established in the first season.As in season one, Hajime is privileged as the character with the perspective that seems to be ""correct"" in the end, but it takes her a lot of time, deep consideration, and input from the people around (or... inside of her), whose views conflict with hers at times, but she values nonetheless, in order to figure out the correct course of action.Gatchaman gives us a character to look up to in Hajime. Her admirable traits: her open mindedness, thoughtfulness, sense...of responsibility; her belief that views that contradict hers have their own merit, that conflict itself is good (as long as it doesn\'t lead to unnecessary violence); her belief that the sides of people that they\'re ashamed of, their darker thoughts, their ignorance and stupidity, their fears and selfish desires, also have a place in the intricately woven fabric of human social and psychological reality. These views represent a complex ontology that her can-do, optimistic attitude and charming, goofy sense of humor totally belie. Or maybe it\'s not all that complex. Maybe it\'s quite simple. I don\'t think you need to read Republic or Phenomenology of Spirit to believe in the value of having a dialogue, or of the confluence of and struggle between clashing opinions; or even of finding some kernels of truth buried in discarded or disproven ideas. Her creativity and optimism let her stare humanity\'s darkness, foolishness and misery in the face and come up with a productive solution to the problem she faces, one that doesn\'t merely try to ignore those facts of human nature or sweep them under the rug.Hajime embodies a formula for having a true sense of self worth, self awareness and personal responsibility, and it\'s through everyone trying to be a little bit more like Hajime, a little more aware and honest, that the experiment of democracy is most likely to succeed.Speaking of ""the experiment of democracy"" that\'s just the type of apparently boring and stuffy, but deeply pressing subject that Gatchaman touches on and dissects with its vibrant cast of characters, each with a unique voice and contribution to the conversation. The viewer hardly realizes as the series progresses that they\'ve waded knee deep into the conversation, too. The show asks: should technology be banned if it can be used for evil? Can\'t all technology be used for evil? How can we regulate its use? Should we regulate its use? Does democracy work at face value, or in this post internet, media saturated era of information inundation and political propaganda, do people need to be more conscientious about how they act on their political concerns? What are the responsibilities of politicians and media entities? Maybe we have to be the ones to take some responsibility, instead of casually leaving it up to others with more power or authority to decide everything for us.Gatchaman Crowds (Insight) offers truly piercing insight into the nature of our social reality, the power of the Image, and how our relationships with each other and to images are mediated by increasingly powerful communications technology. How easy it is to just take the path of least resistance, give into peer pressure and marketing, and create a dictator or a hegemony through our passivity and willingness to let others decide for us. In this regard, in its cultural critique, it belongs somewhere in the lineage of Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost in the Shell: SAC, and Paranoia Agent. Few series characterize our problems and conditions so plainly, and manage to make a compelling story around them, to boot. Insight contains refreshing suggestions about how we should approach this bizarre life at its core.(Spoilers ahead)The climax of this season features a simulated battle between humanity\'s chosen heroes, the Gatchaman (I mean humanity literally voted that Gatchaman should save the day however they so chose) and a ""villain"" they\'ve created, a supernatural dictator humanity inadvertently granted permission to commit unwitting genocide by constantly choosing the path of least resistance and voting thoughtlessly based on whatever the popular consensus was in their immediate social circle.The spectacle of the villain\'s defeat is enough to satisfy humanity, but the violence of its defeat disturbs them, as they recall that their ""dictator,"" a kind, sensitive alien named Gel, has really just all along been doing exactly what they asked for, and at his heart is just a boundlessly generous and optimistic being with no ego of his own.The fascinating thing about this climactic battle is that to some extent, though we are clued into what\'s really going on at moments (as we don\'t have reason to really believe the Gatchaman squad would kill Gel if they could avoid it; we last saw them seeming to prepare to hatch a scheme, the details of which are unknown to us; someone in the audience during the fight says ""Where\'s Hajime?"") we really have no idea if we\'re really watching Gel\'s ruthless, violent assassination at the hands of Gatchaman.Because of Tsubasa\'s love and allegiance to both Gel and Hajime, when she loses resolve and defends ""Gel"" in the middle of their fight, it could just as easily be Gel or Hajime. In this scene, we are in the same position (more or less) as the spectators watching the fight on TV or on the internet. WE are watching this fight on TV or on the internet. We also are wondering ""Isn\'t this going too far,"" perhaps second guessing if ""Gel"" is really Gel, feeling that there\'s something unnatural about the violence the Gatchaman are dishing out, but of course not anymore capable of learning what\'s really going on than the audience in the anime.It turns out just the simulated battle, the apparent assassination of Gel, is enough to force us to confront our true nature and think more deeply what we really want, what we really think is best for humanity beyond our immediate fears and desires. As the audience in the series wakes up to this realization, perhaps the audience watching Gatchaman Crowds Insight wakes up to it as well. This sophisticated manipulation and involvement of the viewer is another one of those things that makes Gatchaman Crowds and Insight so special in the field of contemporary anime, and makes Kenji Nakamura such a standout showrunner. of responsibility; her belief that views that contradict hers have their own merit, that conflict itself is good (as long as it doesn\'t lead to unnecessary violence); her belief that the sides of people that they\'re ashamed of, their darker thoughts, their ignorance and stupidity, their fears and selfish desires, also have a place in the intricately woven fabric of human social and psychological reality.

I keep questioning myself as I’m watching and finished the series. Well, the plain answer will be getting a power and protecting people from danger or some evil that come to us. It’s a good answer but, is that what heroes really need to do? Or is that hero’s responsibility to do that job? Of course, you can argue that they have superpower that beyond human capability but to me, even without superpower, we can be heroes.Gatchaman Crowds/ Gatchaman Crowds Insight totally show me a different perspective view about heroes, what kind of opinion, characteristic and their justice in each main...character. When I start watching this series, it gives me a vibe like “Mawaru Penguindrum” since they are using symbolic like poem, riddle and arts to express the explanation for viewers.The story:At the beginning of the story, the story seems kind of boring since it needs to introduce some new characters and events but eventually lead us to an un-expecting development. When I’m watching the series, I always set my brain into thinking mode since event itself will blow your mind sometimes. What I like about Gatchaman is not about their power, but the relationship between the character and their power since their transformation portray their personality. In my opinion, the story and character development are one of the best traits in the series.The animation:To be honest, the animation is not their strong point but I would rather say the animations are pretty decent with a detail of each character, the CGI and the transformation of each character. They really did a good job handling fighting scenes and to make it look more intense.The OST and music:Well, the anime are about heroes so of course you would expect a theme of heroes like power rangers, kamen rider, ultraman or something like that. The soundtracks are good to hear and some of them are pretty much intense. The OP of this anime is what makes the anime much more interesting like “Crowds” in Gatchaman Crowds. If you listen carefully, the lyrical is nonsense and too messy like “crowds”, I believe it means to tell us that world of Gatchaman is mixed with story, characters and the event that will become ‘crowds’.The conclusion:Gatchaman Crowds/Gatchaman Crowds Insight is one of the anime that makes me do a lot of thinking while watching the series and that makes me really like about it. I do enjoy the series although I need to digest a little bit to fully understand the series, but I can tell you, Gatchaman will try open your mind to make you think a little bit further and shows another different kinds of heroes and what kind of perspective that makes someone as a heroes. Beside all of the thinking, I think you will like the series in terms of their fighting and their character development since they are some events that make you exciting.

At the beginning Gelsadra is making out to be the best prime minister Japan's people has ever seen, listening to all their request. Thus starts the unification of mentality within people, as everybody agrees and supports Gelsadra.This ultimately backfires with Kuu-sama making an appearance. Kuu-sama is the representation of fear of isolation. This in turn, forces those with different ideas unable to voice their opinions.There is an uneasy...atmosphere, with the fear looming over many people of Japan.

From my point of view the second season was less confusing than the first', ""Even when you watch a lot of stuff, it's rare that a show comes along that just hits you exactly where it needs to, to just capture you in a very specific way. I hadn't quite realised it when I finished the first season, but about halfway through 'Gatchaman Crowds insight', I realised that this was one of those shows.Of course, the broader details of what I loved about the first season carry through; as a tokusatsu fan, this show pushed all those buttons perfectly, including adding a couple more phenomenal costume designs, and the action was just as top-quality as the first season. I...love the overall style of the show, too; its slightly psychedelic colour pallette and general approach to set design reminds me of lots of shows that put it in good company; the Monogatari franchise and Kiznaiver are the two that immediately spring to mind. And the sequel's OP is just as much of a high-octane earworm as the first one.But, like the first season, it's the finer details of the story that tie it all together and elevate it to impressive heights. 'insight' is just as dripping with thematic weight and complexity as the first season, and I actually think it's going to take a little while for me to really process all of the themes and ideas found across these two seasons. It expands on so many of the societal ideas that I found so fun to see in the first season, simultaneously validating the core of the show's themes while giving room to give those ideas a truly critical eye. It's a timely story in a lot of ways, exploring ideas of mob mentality and online culture in ways that, while taken to an absurd extreme, feel incredibly relevant to the world we're in now, while never feel preachy, and while giving a truly balanced, nuanced view on the issue that I wouldn't have expected from a goofy superhero show.And, like the first season, the person tying it all together is Hajime Ichinose, who has thoroughly cemented herself as one of my all time favourite anime protagonists. Like the first season, she's the heart of the show, and her hyper-optimistic mindset, the way she always thinks the best of everyone in every situation, despite all evidence saying otherwise, is something I feel like people could genuinely learn from. But this season continues to add to that, matching that optimism and open-mindedness with an always surprisingly measured and thoughtful approach to the situations she's in. Genuinely, and I don't recall ever saying this about a character, she is someone I would aspire to be more like. And, like the first season, it's her who pulls the threads together to give this show, both seasons of this story, one of the most thematically successful and satisfying climaxes to a story I've seen in a long time.This is the sort of show I want to write essays about. It's a show that I probably will. It's a show that captured me in a way I didn't expect it to, and which I feel comfortable giving pride of place in my 'nines' list, the works I consider to be my favourites, the shows that connected to me in a way most don't. I've loved every second of this ride, I'm a little sad to be done with it, and I'm glad I finally gave it the time to give me that opportunity.Gatcha! love the overall style of the show, too; its slightly psychedelic colour pallette and general approach to set design reminds me of lots of shows that put it in good company; the Monogatari franchise and Kiznaiver are the two that immediately spring to mind. And the sequel's OP is just as much of a high-octane earworm as the first one.But, like the first season, it's the finer details of the story that tie it all together and elevate it to impressive heights. 'insight' is just as dripping with thematic weight and complexity as the first season, and I actually think it's going to take a little while for me to really process all of the themes and ideas found across these two seasons. It expands on so many of the societal ideas that I found so fun to see in the first season, simultaneously validating the core of the show's themes while giving room to give those ideas a truly critical eye. It's a timely story in a lot of ways, exploring ideas of mob mentality and online culture in ways that, while taken to an absurd extreme, feel incredibly relevant to the world we're in now, while never feel preachy, and while giving a truly balanced, nuanced view on the issue that I wouldn't have expected from a goofy superhero show.And, like the first season, the person tying it all together is Hajime Ichinose, who has thoroughly cemented herself as one of my all time favourite anime protagonists. Like the first season, she's the heart of the show, and her hyper-optimistic mindset, the way she always thinks the best of everyone in every situation, despite all evidence saying otherwise, is something I feel like people could genuinely learn from. But this season continues to add to that, matching that optimism and open-mindedness with an always surprisingly measured and thoughtful approach to the situations she's in. Genuinely, and I don't recall ever saying this about a character, she is someone I would aspire to be more like.

I sometimes wonder if a more realistic...setting would've helped conveying the statements Gatchaman Crowds makes better.After having watched the pre-season Episode 0 for this season, I was hyped up to finally see some more fighting and action but also here I got disappointed. It's just that like in the first season things only start to really spice up towards the last third of the season. It's sad, because the Gatchaman have all been getting their unique abilites and I even liked the designs of the Gatchaman suits a lot, yet you barely get to see them in real action.There is also absolutely zero background story about the Gatchaman or JJ in this season either, which I would really have appreciated. But in the end many questions regarding the Gatchaman and what JJ has to do with all of this still remain unanswered.But I don't only want to sound like I'm hating this anime, because it has it's strenghts aswell. The soundtrack is amazing and easily one of my favorite ever. And also character-wise I fell in love with some of the characters. The different ideals of Rui and Rizumu clashing together was really interesting to watch.In the end Gatchaman Crowds: Insight is fine. It can sometimes feel like a bit of a copy pasta of the first season and doesn't answer some questions I would've liked to be answered but it's still a enjoyable show that picks up some interesting themes, even if sometimes for my taste, a bit too silly. setting would've helped conveying the statements Gatchaman Crowds makes better.After having watched the pre-season Episode 0 for this season, I was hyped up to finally see some more fighting and action but also here I got disappointed.

GJ-bu@,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21635/GJ-bu,"['When watching a special or an OVA, a general idea that pertains to many anime that have these sort of things, is to give us, the fanbase, a little story or ""extra"" set of moments that we can laugh at and enjoy.  For sights like our very own MAL, it gives us an extra thing to add to our list to prove that we\'re watching more anime, as a singular special or OVA counts as something in our list.  Today, I will be reviewing a very interesting and fun OVA anime that is very dear to my heart.  GJ-bu@.Story (7.32/10):...Let\'s be honest here.  If you\'ve watched GJ-bu, you\'re pretty much going to expect the same thing here.  For those who don\'t know, GJ-bu is an anime series revolving around the club activities of the GJ club, which basically boils down to doing absolutely nothing in a room while they idle their precious high school lives together drinking tea and talking.  The only real difference that this OVA makes, is the fact that it takes place in New York rather than in Japan.  With such an ordinary and absolutely boring plot idea, why is this even good?  The reason, my dear readers, is comedy.Comedy is what GJ-bu is about.  It excels in its branch of mindless banter and interactions within the characters so well, that it can basically harvest pure comedy gold from the words of these characters.  This sole reason is why GJ-bu is loved by many people and truly the only reason to even watch this series.  The comedy of this OVA pertains to its parent story\'s roots, and continues this trend by adding new jokes, and occasionally reusing the same gags from the original series that is surprisingly still hilarious to watch.Aside from that, the OVA does what a lot of animes don\'t do, and that is, completely finish the story.  The OVA uses its timeframe to continue on the story from the original series, giving it a very nice and quite adorable ending.  While this part of the OVA isn\'t exactly something that screams pure comedy gold like the majority of the actual series does, giving it a rather melancholy feeling as a whole, it still plays its part in the OVA and gives it a nice end to series.The pacing wasn\'t rushed as was quite consistent all the way through, there\'s nothing wrong with that there.Ultimately, I feel quite satisfied with the story.  As mentioned before, the OVA gives an end to the series altogether, and gives off the very sweet and happy message of remembering and treasuring the moments that are most precious to you.  While I would\'ve REALLY liked a second season, I must confess, that this series was put to rest quite peacefully.Overview+  PURE COMEDY GOLD+  Steady Pacing+  Reuses its gags tastefully+/-  Rather cheesy ending (This is half and half on good and bad points.)-  Bland plot ideaCharacters (8.88/10):  The cast of GJ-bu just screams comedy.  It genuinely screams comedy.  Without any changes to the main or supporting cast, fans can rejoice at the fact that their favorite characters in the series will without a doubt return without any problem or issue.What I like about these characters, is the fact that they all have a branch off of a general anime troupe that differs them from everyone else that can be classified in that way.  Each character has their own personality, their own gags, and are quite easy to get attached to because of just how fun and colorful they are.Another thing is the fact that GJ-bu is a character driven anime for the most part, focusing more on the dialogue and the interactions between characters rather than the story itself.  Because of this, the characters can and are put into a situation that puts the comedy idea in the backseat, putting character development and the future ahead as the focal point.  It really makes the series a lot more serious than one might think.  And to a viewer that really treasures on how much of a comedy gem this show is, it makes my heart flutter.Overview+  Extremely fitting cast+  Good supporting characters to meld into the cast+  Character development placed well+  Likable personalitiesArt and Sound (7.89/10):  As far as art is concerned, the style doesn\'t really change very much throughout the entire OVA.  It stays rather constant in its normal ""moe"" style, where the characters are drawn in a very bright palette, with crystal-like eyes that make the characters cuter than they actually are. (even the guy.)Occasionally, they still use the fun chibi animation that has also persisted throughout the series, and brings the memory of the original series back together.From a sound aspect, the music is for the most part pretty average.  The songs are definitely very nice to listen to and not jarring or generic to the extent of sounding unoriginal, but compared to many other tracks, they\'re not as memorable.  Nice to listen to, but not that something that would stick in your head for days upon end.Overview+  Consistent art style+/-  Moe style art.  (Good or bad depending on your tastes)+/-  Good soundtrack, but not memorablePersonal Enjoyment (9.54/10):  I have a saying when it comes to certain anime, and that is the fact that there are some anime, that I feel that I enjoy more than the average person should.  This is one of them.  After finishing the original GJ-bu, I was quite saddened to see an anime that I consistently laughed at end so soon.  But when I saw that an OVA was going to be made, everything changed...The OVA retained the charm and the valor that its parent story had to the highest degree.  It doesn\'t disappoint in any way, and I throughly enjoyed it all the way through.  I had fun laughing at the pointless banter, the reintroduction to the overused gags of the show that I loved so much, and ultimately, had a very pleasant experience watching this anime again.  While I was sad that the anime is essentially finished with no second season in sight, I can\'t help but think that is the reason why I enjoy this series so much.While I am sad, to see such an enjoyable series come to end in its OVA, one thing to keep in mind is to know that the good things in life never disappear until their gone.Overall Score: 8.42/10 Let\'s be honest here.

I enjoyed it, but it sort of felt like a waste considering they contained themselves to the classroom. I know it's not like this is the first time it's happened (remember the school festival they didn't actually show?), but I still sort of wish it showed them going out and sightseeing.The second is both funny and a bit more serious. It showed the potential GJ-BU had as a non-comedy series. This makes me wonder something; why didn't they expand the story or characters more in the parent series? They've...shown they are capable of making a series which can seamlessly transition from funny to serious. Keeping it all contained to a single room feels like a waste of potential. Perhaps they just wanted to play it safe. Ah well. The ending wraps up the series nicely enough.Anyways, GJ-Bu@ is an enjoyable addition to its parent series. It gives you one more chance to see the characters you love and provides a reasonable amount of closure to the series while also making you want more. It's a shame this series didn't get a season 2. Between the junior GJ club and the original one, there's a lot that could go on.I'd recommend this to anyone who liked GJ-BU. shown they are capable of making a series which can seamlessly transition from funny to serious.

Gekai Elise,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54632/Gekai_Elise,"[""The beginning starts out realistic, where a Dr. Aoi gets isekai'd. BUT This isn't your usual terrible isekai. It is so much better.As the story progresses, Gekai Elise becomes a heartfelt and authentic journey of a young lady proving to people that she can become a surgeon. Despite her previous life flaws, Elise demonstrates with her knowledge and skills that she is a better person and puts her doctor skills to help people in need.What makes Gekai Elise unique is there is real healthcare knowledge used in the anime, and there is great progression and character development between Elise and the characters around...her throughout the series.The series is realistic and there is no over-sexualizing characters, which is a huge plus.I would definitely give Gekai Elise a watch if you enjoy a girl boss proving people wrong and a relatable but not cliche plotline. her throughout the series.The series is realistic and there is no over-sexualizing characters, which is a huge plus.I would definitely give Gekai Elise a watch if you enjoy a girl boss proving people wrong and a relatable but not cliche plotline."", ""I will be honest, this was a disappointment.I read the story (multiple times) and I was looking forward to see it happening in an anime, but they butchered the story and the characters a lot resulting in an incoherent and messy story that could've been soo much better.If I had to describe how this anime feels, then I would see it feels like watching a Hollywood adaptation of a beloved anime.Look, the new story isn't bad. It's passable.But is that what you want from an anime?I do recommend this anime simply because it's pretty unique, but I recommend reading the story more. "", 'Gekai Elise is a Medical Romance anime that is has Double Reincarnation + Time Loop.We have our main character Elise who was reincarnated in modern world after being executed in her first life. We learn that she was definitely not a gift. She did have very bad attitude and was obsessed with idea marriage with the Prince. In this life she had a loving family and easy life but after reincarnation her life was not easy. In this life she became a very famous doctor but sadly she died again (Luck is not on her side as we can see) after this she is Reincarnated...again to her first life before the execution and bad thing happens. So in this life she decided to become doctor too but she has a big problem in her way and it’s a marriage with the prince that supposed to happen on her 18th birthday. We see how she became a doctor in this world’ how she uses her knowledge ‘ people mostly don’t believe in her and try to sabotage her too because she needs to become Queen.In this anime there are a lot of problems. Firstly I’m gonna talk about the Genre of this anime that is very poorly shown:Romance, we have more than one love interest but with none of them there is a enough connection for us to be called Romance or for me at least. But my biggest problem is the main love interest Linden (her fiance the Prince) this man is dull as a stick. He didn’t do NOTHING almost all of the Anime. Most he can do is sometimes is to go next to her to talk…But even this talks are unnecessary as fuck for the whole Anime the only think this man know about Else is that she loves eating sweets and she is try to become a doctor. That’s all he has zero idea what type of a person she is almost all of the Anime and the anime wants me to ship them…. Then give me a reason? There are some situations that was puts Elise in danger or be a wall between her and her dreams. He didn’t help her at all even I feel he can help her he dont. I cant this man makes me angry and the worst part the other two man are 10 times better than him. One of them is smart and the other one is brave and funny.The sad part is the second problem is the main character Elise. She is your typical Mary Sue. She can’t do wrong she doesn’t have any flaws. Everybody loves her , she is perfect at everything. Watching a character without flaws in a universe that she needs to struggle and prove herself in the hard way is exhausting. Even when she struggles it not because of her she always right and gonna came clean from everything without a problem. Not only that she doesn’t have an interesting character. She just smart and that’s allThere is some medical and logic problems too but I’m not gonna talk about them or it’s gonna be too long.Is there any good parts? Kind of her relationship with Graham and Julian was nice too see and I think I can count that her try to prove herself too whole kingdom while no one believes her at the start was nice to see.The animation was nice nothing that gives the wow effect but its suits the anime but when you look at the original design of the characters they look pretty dull especially her brothers somehow.In the end I dont recommend this anime there are a lot of better historical romance with good female characters. again to her first life before the execution and bad thing happens.

It has a severe misunderstanding of what the medical world is like, and paints an overly simplistic view.Our MC can do every type of general and specialized surgery. She also goes around telling people she will save them with absolute certainty, never mind the risks of surgical procedures (or the nuances of treatment outcomes not being effective). All of her surgeries are 100% effective, and we are even told at various points in the first episode that all of her surgeries are successful and cure the patient.Elise is driven, optimistic, and hard-working so...she is not unlikeable, but her character does feel a little shallow/flat. Overall, none of the characters really stand out, and the world they are presented in is also lackluster.This anime is probably fine for a young shoujo demographic (e.g. tweens) and can actually serve as positive representation (we have so much media with OP male doctors, it's good for young girls to have something to look up to/aspire to be). As an idealized character, Elise is not a bad role model for young girls. she is not unlikeable, but her character does feel a little shallow/flat.

Elise is an interesting character and starts making her way into the medical field in the past. It excited me to think of what was to come. However, the medical part of the story isn\'t well developed, the characters feel a bit bland, and there are no interesting challenges for her.Elise is instantly good at everything medically, which makes sense, but only to an extent. It would have been more entertaining for Elise to have to adjust to the less modern medical...field, with things to overcome such as not having modern medical equipment, or proving medical treatments are effective before she goes ahead with them. The medical side of the anime is by far the most interesting, but Elise\'s lack of growth and apparent ""all-knowing medical goddess"" -ness makes it feel a bit flat.As for the being the queen side of things, we start with some interesting political input from the main character, which would be cool to explore further, but instead, there\'s lots of screen time spent on rather boring scenes like being at a ball. I\'d personally much prefer if they were to spend less time on noble life, and if there was focus on her engagement for it to be focused on her political opinions and solutions she would implement in the slums to prevent famine or plagues, and how she would prove this is a good idea.As far as the romance goes, it kind of feels forced. There isn\'t much chemistry between the main couple, and I\'m sorry to disappoint but nearly every guy falls in love with her. Her brother is overprotective too, in that weird reverse harem way. The characters that like her don\'t have a personality anyways. It\'s kind of disappointing to see this premise force so much attempted romance into the plot when thats not really what we\'re here for. Romance is fine, but maybe try to keep it to one or two characters. Just my opinion, as an avid romance enjoyer, this feels kind of badly done.But the show is enjoyable. At the very least its more interesting than most reverse harems, or isekais, but it\'s left me disappointed because it had so much potential and was let down a bit. field, with things to overcome such as not having modern medical equipment, or proving medical treatments are effective before she goes ahead with them.

If you are looking for a period drama/romance, this is not it. If you are looking for a villainess/reincarnation story, this is not it either. This show squanders its many ingredients and shows no signs of life throughout.There are not many medical anime shows out there (to my knowledge), so I was really excited for this one. Unfortunately, the medical aspect is seriously lacking. I am not a medical professional so I cannot comment on realism, but I can say that the medical problems and solutions feel very simplistic. Elise makes some observations,...rattles off medical terminology like she is reading off of Wikipedia, identifies the condition, proceeds to administer treatment, and then the patient is fine. The whole process is very “A to B to C”, like a detective finding a bloody knife on a corpse, taking fingerprints from the knife, and then arresting the culprit by matching those prints. It may be true that all the details are indeed accurate, but they make for dull viewing.Elise is 100% correct in her diagnoses right off the bat and 100% successful with her treatment; there are absolutely no uncertainties, complications or mistakes. Even a genius doctor like Elise should not be able to see and predict everything, unless she has the all-seeing eye (like in Parallel World Pharmacy), and it would have been satisfying (and expected of a doctor) to see her adapt to unexpected developments and even learn new things. There are no other doctors that provide much help or insight, either; Elise does it all herself. Everything is neatly wrapped up in a matter of minutes, and there is no real challenge or tension. I cannot shake the feeling that very little thought was given to how doctors actually work and what they go through; what is important is that Elise healed them, and that is it.An interesting twist to the medical aspect is the setting, which looks like 19th century Europe. I was curious about how Elise, who has knowledge centuries ahead of the times, would deal with the outdated science and culture. The show does almost nothing with this, except having other characters marvel at Elise’s knowledge. To my (untrained) eyes, most of the facilities, tools, and practices look basically the same as the modern-day ones, and Elise never has any real difficulty producing results or convincing others. I expected some doctors to not even understand what she is talking about, but that is never the case. Also, Elise never really makes an effort to hide how she knows so much, and everyone just accepts it and moves on. The patriarchal nature of the field of medicine at the time is very weakly hinted at but is not a factor in Elise’s career. There are so many missed opportunities to create some interesting challenges for Elise.This shallowness extends to the broader, non-technical aspects of a doctor’s work. The biggest pet peeve of mine is when Elise promises her patients that “she will save them,” on more than one occasion. Elise, a seasoned veteran from the modern day, should know better than to say something like this, but I can chalk that up to dramatic flourish. However, the show still does not really dig into so many other topics in this field that are ripe for drama, such as her relationship with co-workers, her relationship with patients, educating people and bringing about change, tackling ethical dilemmas, how she handles the stress, exhaustion and responsibility, and more.The show does not even do a good job of characterizing Elise outside of her medical skills. On top of being a medical genius who can do no wrong, she has no character traits other than how kind and hard-working she is and... how much she likes sweets. She has no character flaws or weaknesses to speak of, and she is constantly validated and praised by everyone around her. The main love interest does not have a personality either, which makes the romance side of things a non-starter. During most of their stock-standard interactions, Elise is barely even aware of him. Other characters get little to no characterization and have almost no impact on Elise’s journey; they either stand around in awe of her talents or feebly try to hold her back before they are steamrolled or are won over. The show also tackles palace politics, centered around Elise’s status as a noblewoman and the prince’s fiancée, but these developments turn out nonsensical and only a mild inconvenience in the face of Elise’s overwhelming genius and kindness.The double-reincarnation setup in the beginning is interesting, but Elise draws so little from her modern-day life that it seems like the only reason for this setup is to impart medical skills on the main character in what otherwise would have been a simple “re-do” story. Also, Elise’s “villainous” past is the source of her desire to help sick people as a form of penance, but this is somewhat unconvincing when her exact crimes are left very vague and have almost no repercussions on the present anyway.The closest comparison to Elise that I can think of is Sei from The Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent (also voiced by Yui Ishikawa). Sei received criticism for being an overpowered, bland character, but she at least had a desire to learn, the pressure to grow into her role, and a shy demeanor. Elise is a vaguely likable lead, but her complete lack of personality or quirks fails to make the character very engaging or sympathetic.Yui Ishikawa and the other voice actors simply do not have much to work with here. The music, visuals, animation and direction are barely passable and do little to elevate the lifeless storyline and wooden characters.There are so many things to talk about in this review, yet there is so little to be said about each of those things. Elise is a doctor, but she is so good at fixing everything so quickly that she might as well have been a magical healer. Elise is a “villainess” reincarnated from the modern day, but that ends up such a minor detail that she might as well have been simply an extremely gifted doctor from 19th century Europe. Elise is too bland a character, surrounded by non-characters and non-threats, to develop any sort of romance, drama or intrigue effectively.This show has been a major disappointment, and the more I think about it, the harder it is to come up with any redeeming qualities. The most positive thing I can say about the show is that it is good-natured and inoffensive. It also deserves some recognition for tackling the topic of medicine in the first place, which I would like to see more of. If you are starving for anything medical/healing-related, you may get some enjoyment out of this. If you’ve completely run out of wholesome, female-led romance/dramas to watch, this may pass the time. Otherwise, this one is an easy skip. rattles off medical terminology like she is reading off of Wikipedia, identifies the condition, proceeds to administer treatment, and then the patient is fine.

No matter your gender, age, it is a gem that's rare to come by. I am truly biased by having read the manhwa and loved it so much, however that would only make me all the more frustrated if I saw that the anime adaptation wasn't on par with it.It isn't her second life, it's her third, Elise is given a second chance at her first life after redeeming herself during her second. In her first life she had everything to be happy and made everyone miserable, the empire became a living hell. In her second life she had nothing,...no family, no money, other than her studies, she was determined to save as many as possible and redeem herself from her mistakes from her 1st life.In her third life, she is simply grateful and everyone around her sees her maturing to the woman they always wanted and deeply down believed her to be. She was loved, as she changed to meet their expectations, it was well received and praised upon.She hesitates a lot and tends to phrase all her knowledge from modern era in a way that best fits the context she's in, to not create a reality clash that's too big.Out of all isekais that tend to be higly repetitive, superficial, sexualize women and lack emotional momentum, this one is the most meaningful for me, as while all the others use the knowledge they have for selfish reasons, for revenge or whatever, she uses it to save people and in crucial moments, for selfless reasons. Even if it means putting herself in a tight position, she's totally committed to her cause and confident in her medical skills. no family, no money, other than her studies, she was determined to save as many as possible and redeem herself from her mistakes from her 1st life.In her third life, she is simply grateful and everyone around her sees her maturing to the woman they always wanted and deeply down believed her to be.

What makes this one cool is that Elise is given another shot at life in her original world AFTER being isekai’d to Earth. This allows her the unique experience of combining both her original life’s knowledge and the medicinal skills she gained on Earth making for a really fun watch.Now, there’s going to be some party poopers who say the show isn’t accurate or realistic in its portrayal of some medical stuff and to that I’ll agree, but it’s ultimately anime not grey’s anatomy. I’m not watching...this for 100 percent accuracy. The fact we’re getting a show that handles medicine and doctors in a somewhat realistic manner in a fantasy world is so cool. I’m so used to healing magic or fantastical herbs being used in the treatment of patients, but to get a story that relies on legitimate surgery and medical analysis to treat people is a treat. While not a doctor myself, my sister and several other family members are and we had a blast watching this together.Elise faces a lot of challenges in her original world due to her awful personality before her reincarnation as well as the sexist nature of the medical field. Like in the real world in the 18-19th centuries, medicine is a male dominated field and she struggles to gain acceptance of her peers, even having to disguise her noble background for a time. She also has to convince the king that she’s better suited to be a doctor than his son’s fiancé. This plot point I thought was a little dumb because these surely aren’t mutually exclusive.. but I enjoyed seeing her prove both he and the kingdom as a whole wrong, earning the respect of royalty and established doctors alike.It’s a small cast, mainly focusing on Elise, her fiancé, his brother and her mentor, but I did enjoy them for the most part. I actually think the little brother, Mikhail got fleshed out a lot better than the fiancé. If I had to pick a criticism, it’s that Linden needed more screen time. I understand it’s a long running Manwha, so for these 12 episodes he probably just wasn’t a big character in the source. But it does feel a little odd because you can tell the story wants him to be important, and you just can’t quite care that deeply about him yet.Speaking of Manwha, Gekai Elise is part of a great trend of Manwha adaptations. It seems surreal to be getting this many lately and I love the diversity that they bring to the medium. Different types of writing and settings are really what we need. There’s so much cool stuff coming out of Korea lately.The art in the show looks really good. You can tell the author was heavily influenced by traditional shoujo art. The animation isn’t the best, but it rarely is in these villainess shows so that’s no shock. Overall, the production is solid from top to bottom.Gekai Elise is just really fun to watch. Yea, the story isn’t too developed right now, but just seeing Elise save lives and break through social barriers, with a tinge of romance was more than enough for me. I can’t get enough of strong independent female characters who are determined to make their dreams a reality and this is one of the best of the bunch.Gekai Elise gets a very strong 8, out of 10. this for 100 percent accuracy.

I can forgive inconsistencies and some poor plot and world-building, but I can only suspend my disbelief for so long. This show is an insult to anyone with any knowledge of medical practices, history, fantasy, etc. Buckle up folks. Time to dissect this trash piece by piece.Spoilers in case you actually want to watch this. You\'ve been warned.Doctor protag is the best doctor in the world apparently and gets called to Germany to perform some surgery on someone because she\'s so incredible and is a polyglot too. On her way though plane-kun crash lands and somehow she and all...the other passengers survive, many of whom are in critical condition. She proceeds to successfully treat or perform emergency surgery on every single one of them.Here\'s where my first and second major problems come in. After finishing treating the passengers, we find out that she herself sustained a severe abdominal wound and dies after succumbing to blood loss and falling dramatically out of the broken airframe. So she somehow managed to, first, successfully treat every single passenger in that plane with just the plane\'s first aid kit and a piece of broken glass for a scalpel, no proper surgical tools, all while, second, bleeding out through a massive abdominal wound without any hint of suffering or difficulty on her part. Makes sense. Moving on.She then gets isekai\'d back to the same world that she was originally reverse isekai\'d from, making this essentially a reverse reverse isekai. In her first life she was a brat who treated her family and virtually everyone around her poorly. Here\'s problem number 3. In her newly reborn self with all her memories from her past two lives, she has a near complete personality change from her original self. Nobody questions this sudden extreme personality change for very long and quickly accepts her new behaviour.Problem number 4. She decides that to avoid the future that ended her first life, she\'s going to become a doctor and fix all this world\'s problems. Naturally, she\'s challenged on this by several people throughout the story that I\'ve seen so far, but all of them quickly relent before long despite being effectively blindsided by this newfound goal. Remember she\'d never shown any interest in medicine before now in her life in this world. She\'s then sent to a really unforgiving hospital as part of the condition of allowing her to study and practice medicine with the expectation that she\'ll quickly give up.Here\'s where things really start to get bad. She shows up at this hospital and is sent by the ""genius"" resident surgeon to the ward with the worst conditions in the whole hospital to try and scare her off. She immediately cleans the dirty room in record time until it\'s spotless and then, problem number 5, proceeds to perfectly treat every patient and, worse still, perform unsupervised emergency surgery on one of them to which none of the nurses present offer any substantial resistance. Problem number 6, she performs this surgery using extremely modern tools and modern looking operating gowns in what has up until now appeared to be a early semi-Victorian era fantasy setting. She succeeds, shows up the resident ""genius"" doctor, and receives very little resistance or punishment on top of everything.It gets worse though. Problem number 7. In another emergency procedure, one of the staff brings in a patient who\'s clearly still breathing, albeit with difficulty, and suggests using an AED/defibrillator on them. As far as I know, you don\'t use a defibrillator on a patient whose heart is beating when the problem isn\'t the heart\'s rhythm. Problem 8. AEDs didn\'t exist in Victorian times. Problem 9. There\'s no explanation of where the power for the AED or anything else in this world comes from. Problem number 10. The protag again successfully performs the surgery herself with minimal resistance or supervision, shows up the ""genius"" doctor again, and receives no punishment afterward.Later on we see a patient who was shot in the spleen. Shot, not stabbed. So they\'ve added guns now. Fine. Guns did exist in Victorian times in more primitive forms, so that by itself isn\'t a problem. No, problems 11, 12, and 13 are how, with what, and by whom the patient was shot. We see a flashback showing the classic trope of these two characters being assaulted in a sketchy back alley. The bad guy charges at the two guys with a knife and the one guy defends the other with his sword and disarms the bad guy and knocks him down. What happened next blew my mind. The bad guy pulls out a modern-looking revolver and shoots the guy with the sword. First of all, why didn\'t the bad guy use the revolver from the start? Second, why is there a modern revolver in an early Victorian setting. At best, they had old looking black powder cartridge revolvers. Look them up if you\'re interested. Third, there\'s absolutely no way that this bad guy could have had a gun anyways given the way he\'s presumably been living. Revolvers back then were generally things that only military or police officers and wealthy people owned, and this bad guy was clearly none of those things given his living situation and lack of combat ability. Flashback to the present and once again, protag performs the surgery perfectly, receives little resistance from even the other doctors this time, saves the guy\'s life, shows up the ""genius"" resident yet again along with all the other doctors in the room, receives no punishment for disobeying orders, and everything is sunshine and rainbows.Here\'s another one. In one scene the protag helps set a patient\'s dislocated shoulder using a method named after the person who created it IRL. Problem number 14. The ""genius"" resident doctor recognizes and specifically says the name of the technique. There\'s absolutely no way that he could have known the name of a technique created by, and named after, a person from a completely different world. It would be one thing if the technique was named after a person who created it in the fantasy world, but the fact that they just used the name of the real person who created the technique in our Earth is just plain lazy writing. Such an obvious logical fallacy that could\'ve easily been fixed.Last before I completely stopped paying attention. Problem number 15, every single surgery the protag has performed through every episode so far, and likely going forward too, has seen her and someone else spilling mindless, argumentative exposition over top of the patient as the patient is suffering/bleeding out instead of performing the surgery, wasting valuable time that could determine whether or not the patient survives. It would be one thing if that time was spent identifying the problem and how to fix it or doing anything else meaningful, but in every instance so far, it\'s just characters creating conflict for the sake of dramatization.This show is downright insulting to watch and a complete waste of time. Don\'t watch it unless you can laugh at how bad it is. I certainly couldn\'t. Screw this show. the other passengers survive, many of whom are in critical condition.

Definitely not your average isekai. Its actually quite educational and informative. Theres lots of character development and growth that progressively happens over the manhwa.Doctor Elise is definitely one of the more unique isekais, utilizing real medical knowledge and integrating that into the story. Give this a watch if you're into more educational shows while still maintaining a good level of fictional attributes. The characters are pretty great. Elise is such a girlboss and she only gets even better as the story progresses.Personally, I think the anime...adaptation is definetly not bad, but I don't feel like it was as good as the manhwa. Of course this will probably change as the show continues to air, however at the time of posting this review, I'd recommend reading the manhwa over the manga.If you enjoy isekais, like education, and love strong female leads, this show is amazing. And if you enjoyed the show, definitely check out the manhwa. adaptation is definetly not bad, but I don't feel like it was as good as the manhwa.

The more recent ones have developed somewhat of a bad habit of excessive power fantasy and heavy wish fulfillment. It's a guilty pleasure to be sure. But every so often we get a story that offers a bit more.Gekai Elise is an anime adaptation of Doctor Elise: The Royal Lady with the Lamp, a Korean web novel that was later given a webtoons adaptation in 2017. My first impressions of the anime were strong enough that I decided to pick up the webtoon and read ahead. I read a lot more than watch anime, so...if one has source material, I start by comparing that if I can.First off, the anime takes a few liberties in adapting the story. The romance is more subdued in the anime and there is greater emphasis on proper medical practices. They even added filler episodes to cover more treatments. The medicine alone makes it worth a watch if only for the sake of edutainment. The era that the world takes place in is hard to place. It reflects 18th century Britain, but with some facilities comparable to 21st century. While there is magic it seems exclusive to certain individuals and can't heal injuries. The focus is definitely on the surgeries. As a result, anything out of place used to justify its use requires some suspension of disbelief. But if you can get by that, it's an enjoyable watch. There's also much more story to cover. For those looking to get a romance fix, that will have to wait until the next season.The animation quality is normal I'd say. Not at the level to a similar anime released at the same time: 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy! Even so, I would forgive it since there is a lot of talking. And the topics are more intelligent. The opening song [Believer] by Yui Ishikawa sounds nice. I actually liked the credits song [Listen] by Arai Maju much more. It sounds melancholy yet sweet. Enough that I've listened to it many times on Youtube.This was actually a recommendation from a friend. I went into this expecting it to be along the lines of Parallel World Pharmacy. It wasn't, but that's okay. I think if you like your fantasy stories more grounded in reality, just not in a modern setting, then I think this will be a nice enough watch. That being said, I can't give it a score higher than 7 for the following reasons. We are never fully told what horrible sins that Elise committed in her first life nor the powers that allowed her to reincarnate not once, but twice. It makes sense from a writing perspective since she needs knowledge of modern medicine in order to change fate. But it feels like a needless level of complexity. There's also the aforementioned suspension of disbelief. A handful of scenes felt almost like a PSA as far as best practices. And this is all coming from the word of a girl that hasn't come of age with no background in medicine. Privilege of the upper class I guess? The protagonist is female which is already a win since most of the isekai/reincarnations tend to be male centric power fantasies. The ones that do get female leads often play out like otome games. At least here, the main character is bringing about change through her own efforts, blood, sweat, and tears which is very admirable. I hope there are more isekai shows like this in the future. Here's hoping the next season builds upon the success of the first. if one has source material, I start by comparing that if I can.First off, the anime takes a few liberties in adapting the story.

It’s supposed to be a medevil society but it has the medical tech of 19th century while have medical tools of 20th century. It would have been so much more interesting if the author knew anything about medical science besides what they googled. Have a person with 21st century medical science have to deal with not having the tools she needs to do anything, calling her a genius while not have to adapt at all is so terrible.When watching this I just wanted to pull...out my copy of Black Jack instead of this minimum effort medical drama “romance”.The romance is non existent he doesn’t even interact with her as himself most of the shows run time.Why is thier no consequences for her past self actions, this literally could have been a doctor dies and is reborn in some random girls body. out my copy of Black Jack instead of this minimum effort medical drama “romance”.The romance is non existent he doesn’t even interact with her as himself most of the shows run time.Why is thier no consequences for her past self actions, this literally could have been a doctor dies and is reborn in some random girls body.', ""Everything is fine, but the writing is crazy badThere is a scene where a fire started inside a theater and our main character, Elise (of a very high ranking family, second only to the imperial family), tells some nobles not to breathe the obviously toxic smoke.Well... the show, out of thin air, pulls a nobles vs commoner girl cliché, and they start ranting about how they are nobles and superior and she is no one to tell them what to do, all this while breathing the smoke and coughing.It was so absurd that had me laughing, however, the other times this happens are not so...funny.The show is filled with these moments where clichés happen without any regard to the story.Most of the times they are small things, like a character saying some line that doesn't make any sense, however, sometimes they are major event that heavily steer the plot and that's very frustrating.I suggest you watch this anime only if you have high tolerance for bad writing. funny.The show is filled with these moments where clichés happen without any regard to the story.Most of the times they are small things, like a character saying some line that doesn't make any sense, however, sometimes they are major event that heavily steer the plot and that's very frustrating.I suggest you watch this anime only if you have high tolerance for bad writing."", 'Doctor Elise isn’t just an isekai—it’s a reverse/double isekai where a spoiled girl from the past is reborn in the modern world, becomes a doctor, and then returns to her old life with all her memories intact.Aoi Takamoto is a skilled doctor with a reputation for being one of the world’s best surgeons. Maybe it’s my bias as someone who also wants to go into medicine, but I instantly loved her character. She’s poised, professional, and kind both to her patients and her colleagues, important traits in health care that tend to get overlooked in favor of drama. But instead, Aoi embodies the ideal doctor,...showcasing both in skill and personality why she’s considered the best in her field. Also, she has some quirks outside the hospital, like her sweet tooth. :)Aoi became a doctor because her previous life ended tragically, both for herself and the people she loved. As a result, she wanted to make the most of her new life and help save as many people as possible. Her desperation is explained well with an early flashback of her execution. However, why she chose medicine in particular is a bit random. We learn a better motivator in the second episode; showing that motivation before Aoi works hard to become a doctor would’ve better explained her new career choice, which is important for reverse isekai.When Aoi returns to being Elise, her personality shifts so drastically I’m surprised the characters in her first life aren’t more suspicious of her. There’s even a hint of alternative history when Elise uses her modern knowledge of history and geopolitics to influence events in the past—and the other characters just go along with it because she sounds smart (she’s a doctor in a younger person’s body, like Aqua from Oshi no Ko, so of course she sounds smart, but still). Ultimately, it looks like the story is going to be a “you can have your cake and eat it too” deal, as New Elise will likely have it all: her career as a doctor, the crown prince she was in love with, a happy family life, etc. It’s a bit iffy when you realize that New Elise is a full adult woman at least in her late 20s suddenly in the body of a girl coming of age. :PThe art is lovely, with the characters’ eyes following the trend of that luminous glow, though simpler than other modern shows like The Apothecary Diaries. I like that New Elise’s face closely resembles Aoi’s, with her wide eyes and gentle expressions, even if it’s still technically Elise’s face (dark blue eyes instead of Aoi’s light brown ones). And I absolutely love the soundtrack, which is stunningly gorgeous and immerses you in the story.I recommend this anime if you like at least one of the following: isekai, medicine, romance, aristocratic slice-of-life—apart from shonen, it has something for almost everyone! ^^ showcasing both in skill and personality why she’s considered the best in her field.

The medical drama aspect is fairly unique for anime, presenting a variety of detailed and somewhat intense medical procedures. The romance is engaging too, with plenty of time spent on the leads growing together naturally.However, the confused time period of the setting really threw things off. Despite the rest of the setting being vaguely pre-industrial, the medical knowledge and technology is more advanced for some reason, kind of all over the place but usually something like 20th century. A show about an alternate medical history to our own would be fascinating,...but it feels like very little thought went into this aspect. It boils down to them having many modern tools for safe surgery, but lacking knowledge of more complex procedures, which is extremely convenient for our isekai’d protagonist to show off her superior surgery skills.My other issue was with the animation, which is fairly barebones and static. Most of the time it wasn’t too big of a deal, but I was really pulled out of the show during a certain dance scene where they kept going on about how intense it was, but they were just standing there in position the whole time.By the end of the show, I kind of wished I was rewatching The Saint’s Magic Power Is Omnipotent instead, which has the same VA playing a similar lead character but has more depth and feels less contrived. Regardless, I won’t be too harsh on Doctor Elise—it was entertaining enough as a filler show and scratched the medical drama itch that I haven’t seen anything else do the same way. but it feels like very little thought went into this aspect.

She decides to use her medical and past knowledge to save lives.The downside is it's unrealistic as Elise can do every type of surgery and never fails. The characters are likeable but similar to many other isekai anime. The art and opening is fine.Doctor Elise is a good inspiration for young female viewers who want to be a surgeon.

I had exactly that feeling with ""Doctor Elise: The Royal Lady with the Lamp"".Apart from the fact that I don\'t know where the lamp is supposed to be in the series, the anime is about a noblewoman who was executed at the stake by her husband. However, she wakes up in our world and wants to make up for her past mistakes and becomes a doctor who is considered an absolute genius. She is so talented that she...rescues every injured passenger after an airplane crash without having any tools. In the end, however, she dies from her own injuries, only to wake up again shortly before her engagement! In order to really make up for her mistakes and prevent all the suffering she had to witness in her first life, she does her best to break off the engagement and become a doctor here too.I have a few problems with the series. I\'ve already mentioned that the pacing seems slightly off. Halfway through, she\'s still engaged and still not recognized as a doctor, while at the same time she\'s undergone dozens of surgeries (or the like), all of which we get to see within the few episodes. This makes the show feel rushed when it\'s about her work as a doctor and too slow when it\'s about royal diplomacy.Apart from that, the characters all come across as flat or unsympathetic. The king, for example, allows himself to be influenced too much by his minister and thus comes across as stupid and an asshole, as he makes life difficult for the protagonist even though he made her a promise. Everyone else often only appears very briefly and simply befriends her or falls in love with her, without much backstory or similar. There seems to be some backstory, because stuff is hinted at again and again, but the hints aren\'t enough to give the characters any depth.Conclusion: Uff - why am I still watching this? The series somehow has a charm that I can hardly describe and that makes me curious about the next episodes, even though I could hardly stand the previous ones.Edit: I\'ve now seen the series all the way through and decided that I can leave this review as it is. The biggest problem with the series is the intrigue part, which I can only describe as strange. I admit that it has potential, but the way it\'s implemented is annoying 90% of the time. The last 10% concerns the finale, which took a step back from the doctors\' part and focused more on the intrigue, making for a thoroughly interesting finale, even if the rather open ending is annoying. rescues every injured passenger after an airplane crash without having any tools.

It fell into familiar tropes of reincarnation and second chances, leaving me somewhat disinterested. However, after giving it a chance and watching the initial episodes, I found myself unable to look away.The anticipation for the next episode was palpable, but rather than waiting idly, I delved into the source material—a Korean manhwa. The depth and detail I found there only heightened my excitement for the anime's continuation.Yet, upon returning to the anime, I was sorely disappointed. While the characters and storyline remained, the essence of what made the manhwa captivating seemed lost in translation....Alice's transformation from a mere noble to a remarkable doctor was glossed over, robbing the series of its emotional depth and complexity.Despite the potential hinted at in the source material, the anime failed to deliver. It rushed through pivotal moments and omitted crucial character development, leaving viewers like myself feeling unsatisfied and longing for what could have been. Ultimately, 'The Anime' fell short of its promise, leaving me disappointed and wishing for more.

Unlike many main characters of this genre, who's sole focus is their own survival and maintaining the person that they are. Elise works hard to change herself for the better. She is more than an intelligent and determined woman, she isn't swayed by emotion and always stays fixated on her goals (Since she...already knows the grave consequences of her actions). Elise has no regard for herself or her social statues, instead she puts all her energy into saving lives with medical knowledge that are decades ahead of current practices. Never batting an eye at the prejudice and sexist attitude of the era, never ignoring a patient in need and she always keeps herself to a high moral standard in any situation.The love story between Elise and Prince Linden is also very endearing. Particularly, how Prince Linden opens his heart to Elise. As a child he witnessed his Mother and Sister's death, the traumatic experience left him hallow. In Elise's first life, they had been married but Prince Linden never developed any feelings towards her, their relationship was cold and loveless. However, as Elise devoted herself in becoming a Doctor (She all but ignores the Prince, under the belief that he detested her), Prince Linden is taken by Elise's change in character and goes so far as using a Royal heirloom to mask his identity, so that he could spend more time with her and learn more about Elise. His feelings rapidly deepen for her, the once cold Prince begins to cherish and support Elise (even though she is completely oblivious to his feelings).The animation is adequate, the character designs are lovely, and dialogue is well versed between medical and political speech. The supporting characters are each unique and all are determined in aiding Elise in her endeavours. The soundtrack from the opening and ending songs are catchy, but not overly memorable.The main issue with this series is that the storyline of the anime does differ from the original Korean Manhwa (Web Novel). Since only 12 episodes were given (and no current information has been released for a second season), a great deal of information and important plot lines were never mentioned, as well as several scene being taken out of order. The sudden rewriting left the fanbase behind the original Manhwa disappointed.However, the anime by itself was a delight.

Having her return to her first life and get a second chance, rather than possessing the body of a book or game character as if often done, it a very interesting choice I enjoyed a lot. The change can be a bit jarring considering she had been a horrible person once and is...now literally perfect, but she did have twenty years in Japan spent learning and growing as a person.Like the original content the story is interesting and engaging. I loved the Manhau’s story, so it wasn’t surprising that the anime flew by. The changes and mix and match of the story was jarring to a fan of the original content, but it was well written and not out of place to a viewer not following the manhau’s content closely.Added new content not in the original, including more about Elise’s second life as a doctor! We got to see more about her death and her successes as a doctor, as well as meeting a friend that makes the loss of this life bittersweet.It’s a medical drama anime! For those who live medical shows this is very fun. I loved the medical mystery of the season finale.And some less than nice thingsFirst off they pick and choose from the original story, taking an arc from the end of the manhua and slapping in into the story. I hadn’t read this far in the manga yet, but it was a very confusing change.The war arc was my favorite in the manhua and it is cut here because there wasn’t room. I can only assume the war and disease arcs will be in season two. I hope they’ll iron out the story and fill the holes they may have created. If this doesn’t get included or a season two isn’t made, I’ll be very disappointed, as the war arc is very important to the story and Elise’s character.Severe lack of lamp, lol. I know it will come later, but the comments on each episode loved to call back to her lamplessness.They made the king a more sympathetic figure rather than the asshole he was in the original story. He’s still rude and going back on his wager in an underhanded way, but these decisions are suggested by an advisor who shoulders the hatred reserved for the king. I can assume this was done to make him more likable and us care more about him since he’s a large part of the finale?Lastly Elise really is perfect. This isn’t a bad think necessarily, she’s genuinely lovable and kind, but everything works out for her as a true protagonist. She doesn’t truly face consequences for how she acted on her first life and everyone accepts the sudden (to them atleast) change in personality after some time. There were some good moments where she was doubted, but her perfection shined through. She’s never lost a patient, something that some of the best doctors can’t say due to complications and reality of life. As much as I love Elise being a perfect and amazing doctor who’s always right, I would love to see her meet a patient she can’t fix, someone she couldn’t save, and have her carve it into her heart as promised while facing the reality that she can’t fox everything just because she wants to. But! If this doesn’t happen, it’s still enjoyable, especially if you like an MC that doesn’t have to struggle. now literally perfect, but she did have twenty years in Japan spent learning and growing as a person.Like the original content the story is interesting and engaging.

We got to see more about her death and her successes as a doctor, as well as meeting a friend that makes the loss of this life bittersweet.It’s a medical drama anime! For those who live medical shows this is very fun. I loved the medical mystery of the season finale.And some less than nice thingsFirst off they pick and choose from the original story, taking an arc from the end of the manhua and slapping in into the story. I hadn’t read this far in the manga yet, but it was a very confusing change.The war arc was my favorite in the manhua and it is cut here because there wasn’t room. I can only assume the war and disease arcs will be in season two. I hope they’ll iron out the story and fill the holes they may have created. If this doesn’t get included or a season two isn’t made, I’ll be very disappointed, as the war arc is very important to the story and Elise’s character.Severe lack of lamp, lol. I know it will come later, but the comments on each episode loved to call back to her lamplessness.They made the king a more sympathetic figure rather than the asshole he was in the original story. He’s still rude and going back on his wager in an underhanded way, but these decisions are suggested by an advisor who shoulders the hatred reserved for the king. I can assume this was done to make him more likable and us care more about him since he’s a large part of the finale?Lastly Elise really is perfect. This isn’t a bad think necessarily, she’s genuinely lovable and kind, but everything works out for her as a true protagonist. She doesn’t truly face consequences for how she acted on her first life and everyone accepts the sudden (to them atleast) change in personality after some time. There were some good moments where she was doubted, but her perfection shined through. She’s never lost a patient, something that some of the best doctors can’t say due to complications and reality of life. As much as I love Elise being a perfect and amazing doctor who’s always right, I would love to see her meet a patient she can’t fix, someone she couldn’t save, and have her carve it into her heart as promised while facing the reality that she can’t fox everything just because she wants to. But! If this doesn’t happen, it’s still enjoyable, especially if you like an MC that doesn’t have to struggle.', 'Gekai Elise a decent adaptation of a manhwa but unfortunately not memorable.The anime tries to be a medical drama, but it fails in an important point of this genre, the explanations. Usually when we see a medical product, what is most attractive is knowing what the disease is, why it hurts and how to cure it. Elise skips all this, only respecting the diagnosis and cure part but with very little information on her part to the viewer. The story focuses more on being a redemption story for Elise. How he reconnects with his family, how he makes friends with those who previously got along...badly, and how he will have the opportunity to love, but this time it will be reciprocated.In terms of adaptation, there are chapters that seem to me to be much better worked than in the manhwa version. To give an example, we have the first chapter, which I consider one of the best first chapters of the winter season. The way we are introduced to the protagonist, her profession and outcome, everything is worked in such a way that the viewer can feel empathy for what they are seeing. Afterwards, the rest of the chapters respect a rhythm without trying to rush the work, taking their time so that we can understand what Elise is facing in this new life.In conclusion, if you read the manhwa, this adaptation can meet most of the expectations you have. On the other hand, if you are only looking for a medical drama, let me tell you that this is a bad option, since it has quite a few good things except medicine. badly, and how he will have the opportunity to love, but this time it will be reciprocated.In terms of adaptation, there are chapters that seem to me to be much better worked than in the manhwa version.

I almost want to recommend it as a funny bad show, but while some stand out moments are hilariously poorly written, it\'s largely just boring and mediocre. From the characters to the setting to the plot, Surgeon Elise is a bland flat and uninteresting mess.Elise de Clorance is a very obvious Florence Nightingale reference and the latest entry in a series of ""villainesses"" in name only. While Surgeon Elise is not patient zero for this problem, it\'s fallen victim to...it. At no point in Surgeon Elise will Elise\'s villainess status actually be explored, she committed nebulous crimes in a past life that got her executed, had her change of heart before the show, now is back and is nice. Everyone around her is surprised but easily willing to accept this dramatic 180 in personality, and whatever ill deeds she has supposedly done are not relevant or explored. Essentially the viewer spends 12 episodes watching a woman do work that is supposed to help her conscious about crimes that the viewer will never actually get to know the scale or nature of. Instead she\'s a simple kind and determined girl who loves sweets, you\'d be forgiven for forgetting she was even a villainess at all when they aren\'t reminding you of it.This lack of depth is consistent. The setting is loosely based on the British Empire. She is basically traveling to a world earlier in time and bringing back future medical information. One which burns women at the stake for their crimes. Naturally, you would expect a few conflicts to arise from this: 1. A lack of technology to perform the necessary procedures 2. she\'s a woman 3. hostile reaction to her modern ideas. They do not. The Empire in Surgeon Elise is said to highly value medicine and exists in a weird bubble of medical advancement where they always have exactly enough tools for Elise to perform the necessary procedure but not enough medical knowledge for anyone but her to think of any solutions. Despite every other doctor being male there are apparently no barriers to women doing medicine. I guess Elise is just the only woman in the world who cares. Everyone near instantly accepts her work as genius, despite many of them never having even been theorized before she will explain it once and then be allowed to perform these theoretical surgeries on patients. No one really even questions her after the first couple episodes.Speaking of the setting it is a mess, I will say if that didn\'t deter you from watching this anime skip this paragraph because I\'m going to spoil the best (worst) part. Until around episode 10, there is not mention of any kind of magic or supernatural ability (minus the isekai-ing). It appears to just be an alternate history. Well, imagine the shock when an episode is opening with the Prince being told that his amulet is running out of power. What?! Apparently, the prince has been using a magic amulet this whole time and that amulet is dying from overuse. This reveal was so hilariously out of no where I had to stop the episode to let myself calm down and finish laughing. The purpose of this is to set up a later conflict about it running out and revealing his true identity, a conflict which goes no where and the amulet running out of power at no point actually effects the plot of the episode or show. This magic amulet, or any magic for that matter, is never explained or relevant again. Such a hilariously bad writing decision that it bumped this show up a point from a 2  to a 3.The main conflict is a nothing-burger because Elise never struggles. Obviously she will pass the exam because she has no gaps in her knowledge and her only flaw is poor handwriting. From minute one there is no room left open for her to struggle, she has never had an unsuccessful surgery, she has never misdiagnosed a patient. There is no actual conflict for the audience to get invested in.The characters are all flat and even the romance is more cookie cutter and dry than expected. Normally these types of shows can pull together at least one emotional moment for the main couple, but Surgeon Elise just drags these two planks of wood around for 12 episodes with no pay-off.

Not a single aspect of this show is enjoyable enough for it to be worth watching.', 'Gekai Elise, aka Elise the Surgeon, follows Elise, a formerly selfish noble woman from another, early renaissance period-ish world with some magic, that was reborn into our world after being executed for her crimes in her original world. Suddenly guilt-ridden, she spent her new life (as an unwanted orphan of course) training to become and becoming a world famous surgeon, saving lives to make up for her sins in her former life. She gets famous for the fact she never has made any mistake in any surgery or examination, being haled as a miracle.On her way to an important conference and an important surgery on...the other side of the world, her plane crashes, and she literally saves every passenger, despite her organs literally hanging out of her body, collapsing and dying just after saving the last other person, as the rescue personnel rushes towards her. She wakes up, having been reborn into her old life as Elise de Clorence in her original world, a few years before the events that led to her execution. She decides to change her fate, and that of the whole country, by becoming a surgeon there as well, continuing her work, instead of becoming empress/queen. She makes a wager with the King to this extent, and goes under-cover in a hospital as an assistant to prove her worth.Story & Characters: 5,6/10The story is fine enough, but there\'s really nothing special about it. It has an enjoyable, but not complex plot. Elise\'s world seems to fit an early renaissance, yet they have medical knowledge and tools, like those from the early 20th century, with medical terms picked straight out of our modern medical world.Most of the problems with the story revolves around it\'s characters, despite there being several interesting characters, these characters are not fleshed out properly and are left un-finished (something I hope they remedy if there comes a second season). Some of these characters are relatively un-important, but some have major roles in the story (such as both the princes).One of the most major character issues (to me at least) is the MC, Elise. To put it simply, she is a definite Mary Sue character. We are shown backflashes to her first life throughout the series, showing her behavior and ""crimes"", as well as often flashing back to the moment crown prince Linden executes her, yet, despite Linden in that moment explaining that her actions were so vile that her whole family had been executed and the country was in ruins, the crimes we are shown are mostly... her being friends with his younger brother Mikhail, leader of the noble faction (which opposes the royal faction, lead by Linden), and her being selfish. Elise is never shown as actually doing anything bad, other than being a spoiled brat. There is nothing to justify how she and her family was executed (she ""did no wrong""). On top of that, Elise is literally stated to NEVER have made ANY mistake in ANYTHING medical. She is literally written as the ""perfect miracle doctor/surgeon"", being 100% correct in everything, to the point that all other characters in the medical field, in both worlds, basically bows to her as a goddess and sucks her metaphorical dick. Prince Linden, which had liked her when they were children, but who had grown to despise her (despite her unconditional and obsessive love for him), quickly fell in deep love with her after she started working in a hospital, as well as Mikhail loving her for some reason, the doctor she works with falling hard for her, the King adoring her, etc. etc. Basic Mary Sue trait, as literally everyone loves her except for the unredeemable bad guys. She is always the center of attention, being the smartest and most beautiful, etc., and her only faults are that she originally was spoiled and self-centered, but now only have a terrible handwriting and can\'t fight.Art & Sound: 6,3/10The visuals of the show are fine, with pretty, though a bit generic, character designs, but is dragged down by mediocre animation whenever there\'s action, which luckily is quite in-frequently.The sounds and voice acting is fine. Not much more to say about that.Overall: 5,9/10Gekai Elise is an enjoyable show, but the character is an un-faultable Mary Sue in most situations, which makes the stakes feel shallow, and unimportant. Overall, I would still recommend it, but I would ask those about to watch it to lower their expectations of they\'re expecting a well-crafted, complex narrative.

One of them is animation and character design. Elise is just as beautiful as I remember. But I have some complaints in regards to the prince, because his character art is heavily inconsistent (the hair akksks), and the animation isn't the most grandiose either. Just ok enough to get by. But I like the story, they seem to take into account the important points of the original works and execute them pretty well. I don't remember the original story all that much, but the impression that I have from the manhwa...is very good, so far the anime has yet to disappoint me in the story aspect so I'll continue to watch for that! Hence a solid 7 from me, since I enjoy it this far.One more thing that would have been nice to see is the medical process. Too bad they didn't really get into detail there, I remember the manhwa being pretty complex about the medical aspects.

High School Fleet OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34125/High_School_Fleet_OVA,"[""Before reviewing this short but entertaining OVA, I would like to clarify few things.High School Fleet, or Haifuri in short, isn't just a CGDCT anime. Rather, I would say it is fairly heavier with its themes and does a good job at presenting them. So I would suggest you to give the original series a watch. There's a lot more to it than meets the eye.Haifuri OVA, just like the original series, also succeeded at entertaining me with its light-hearted and well executed narrative.Story (5)As a result of its final conflict with the rebellious Musashi, Harekaze receives critical damage, which leads to the possibility...that it won't be able to sail again. To rub even more salt into their wound, rumors about the Harekaze class being disbanded start spreading around the entire school.Haifuri OVA revolves around how the Harekaze girls, led by Kouko, try their best to solve this arising problem.As you would expect from an OVA, the story isn't anything special. But it doesn't mean that it isn't enjoyable as well. Although it was obvious that the rumors aren't actually true, it's quite entertaining to see the girls trying to find a way to stop their class from being dissolved. I even became a bit emotional at the end of the OVA.Art (8)There are OVAs of some shows that suffer from the problem of having worse animation than the original show. But in High School Fleet's case, the animation in the OVA is just as decent as the original show. The artstyle of isn't very unique, but all of the characters look very adorable and have decent character designs. As a result of having such a big cast of high school girls, however, very few of them share somewhat similar character designs. It's not that big a problem, though.Sound (7)The soundtrack of both Haifuri and its OVA isn't quite memorable. Though most songs are sort of entertaining to listen to, they aren't spectacular in any way. The opening song and the ending song are decent, but I wouldn't exactly call them great.The voice acting is great, though. All the VAs performed very decently. They were able to decently express the personalities of the characters, which definitely added more to my enjoyment of the OVA.Character (7)What High School Fleet lacked the most in was its characters. With such a big cast of characters, the show failed to develop all the characters properly, which irked me a little. So, does the OVA solve that problem?No, it doesn't. Would you really expect an OVA to do what the show wasn't able to do within only 2 episodes? But I would say the characters are quite decent nonetheless. The OVA also gives more screentime to some of the characters that didn't get much screentime in the show, which is a really admirable aspect.As I said earlier, I even became a little emotional at the end of the OVA. Why, though? The story isn't even that sad. Yes, it's true that the story isn't that sad. But still, I couldn't but help feel a bit emotional as I was fairly attached to some of the characters and cared about them quite a lot.Among all the characters, Kouko receives the most screentime in this OVA, which I honestly didn't mind at all since I think she's very likeable. Despite acting a little weird at times, she is an entertaining girl to say the least.Enjoyment (7)I had almost the same amount of fun watching Haifuri OVA as I had watching its original show. As I mentioned before, a quite decent amount of effort was put into its animation and voice acting. I was pretty entertained watching the OVA almost the entire time. The Mahjong and the Shogi/Japanese Chess part was quite confusing for me, though, as I basically don't have any proper knowledge of either of these games.Overall (7)Overall, Haifuri OVA is quite entertaining. It isn't best OVA I've watched, but it's still pretty decent. Suffice it to say, if you enjoyed the original series, you're most likely going to enjoy this OVA as well. So, I recommend watching this OVA to all of the people that enjoyed watching the series. And if you haven't watched Haifuri yet, I also recommend you giving it a try.I'll give Haifuri OVA an overall score of 7, the same score I gave to Haifuri. that it won't be able to sail again.

The opening song and the ending song are decent, but I wouldn't exactly call them great.The voice acting is great, though. All the VAs performed very decently. They were able to decently express the personalities of the characters, which definitely added more to my enjoyment of the OVA.Character (7)What High School Fleet lacked the most in was its characters. With such a big cast of characters, the show failed to develop all the characters properly, which irked me a little. So, does the OVA solve that problem?No, it doesn't. Would you really expect an OVA to do what the show wasn't able to do within only 2 episodes? But I would say the characters are quite decent nonetheless. The OVA also gives more screentime to some of the characters that didn't get much screentime in the show, which is a really admirable aspect.As I said earlier, I even became a little emotional at the end of the OVA. Why, though? The story isn't even that sad. Yes, it's true that the story isn't that sad. But still, I couldn't but help feel a bit emotional as I was fairly attached to some of the characters and cared about them quite a lot.Among all the characters, Kouko receives the most screentime in this OVA, which I honestly didn't mind at all since I think she's very likeable. Despite acting a little weird at times, she is an entertaining girl to say the least.Enjoyment (7)I had almost the same amount of fun watching Haifuri OVA as I had watching its original show. As I mentioned before, a quite decent amount of effort was put into its animation and voice acting. I was pretty entertained watching the OVA almost the entire time. The Mahjong and the Shogi/Japanese Chess part was quite confusing for me, though, as I basically don't have any proper knowledge of either of these games.Overall (7)Overall, Haifuri OVA is quite entertaining. It isn't best OVA I've watched, but it's still pretty decent. Suffice it to say, if you enjoyed the original series, you're most likely going to enjoy this OVA as well. So, I recommend watching this OVA to all of the people that enjoyed watching the series. And if you haven't watched Haifuri yet, I also recommend you giving it a try.I'll give Haifuri OVA an overall score of 7, the same score I gave to Haifuri.""]"
H2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/386/H2,"[""In a world where Touch and Cross Game exists, H2 is arguably the weakest out of the three. H2, Touch, and Cross Game, are works of Adachi Mitsuru, a man who has a bad habit of using the same character designs, character types, and story set ups during his long career. However, despite the rehashing of his work, I find H2, Touch, and Cross Game all endearing and innocent pieces of anime. I think Cross Game is the absolute perfection of all his years of work, but H2 stands on its own, while it lasts.Yes once again it's about high school baseball, yes it's about...another overpowered pitcher and his struggling team, and yes it's all about getting to that mother effing Koshien, Japan's nationwide high school baseball finals. This time around its Hiro and Noda's battery that take center stage as they help their newly established baseball team out of the rut.Now here's the problem, despite the 41 episode count, H2 in my opinion wastes a lot of time, roughly the first 10 episodes or so of not so great character building and generally dilly-dallying around. With Hiro's broken shoulder and Noda's broken back, their doctor instructs them to never play the game again or risk permanent damage. So the two are practically drifting for 10 episodes doing much of nothing and the story not progressing at all. For a while Hiro is just getting bullied by the soccer club with the story at a stand still until his very first baseball game.When the story does finally get into gear, things are great, fantastic even. The victories wholly satisfying, the losses saddening but hopeful. The baseball side of the story is great and equally the romance is sweet and innocent. I love it, devoid of any modern anime cliches, just a bunch of baseball loving teens discovering and growing into their love interests.And ultimately here's the major problem. It's unfinished. All ongoing storylines, whether baseball or romance are just unresolved. Not sure of the circumstances, but I can just assume it caught up to the manga at some point and just had to end abruptly.

They focused to much on the romance and not enough on the baseball which was a disappointing and a little weird.  Also the ending was horrible.  They needed to carry it on a bit in my opinion because it felt like it was just...cut off and finished with no sense of closing. cut off and finished with no sense of closing."", ""H2 is good, I like it.

It's got a relaxing ambient vibe at times, sort of like Aria or Mushishi, and it's pretty nice but man I just find myself fast forwarding 5 seconds at a time and just reading the subtitles.If you're interested in H2 because of Cross Game, don't bother, it won't fill the void.

Watch this anime if you enjoy sports anime, do NOT watch this for the romance/character progression.This anime was a great baseball story, and I'm not a baseball fan. I loved cross game so decided to give this a try. This is like cross game, except imo all the good romance from cross games is thrown out the window.*Spoilers* On why romance/characters are bad:Aside from baseball and trying to get to the tournament, the main conflict is Hiro's unricipricated love for his childhood friend Haruka, whom he set up with his other childhood friend Hideo. Haruka...didn't notice Hiro at the time since he was short, but she liked Hideo purely off his looks. So fast forward to a time when Hiro is now tall and she's getting all these mixed feelings. This is a good premise imo, but executed horribly. Haruka and Hiro obviuosly have much more depth, and have a good dynamic between the two. Haruka and her boyfriend Hideo are like 2 fake dolls trying to impress eachother constantly, and not showing their true selves. It's annoying as hell to see their relationship because they're simply the most boring couple I've ever seen. Then a new girl comes in that starts liking Hiro, and of course Hiraka is all jealous and eyeing her. Hiro is basically totally ignorant of her the whole anime. One guy focusing on one girl for like 12 years while she has a boyfriend the whole time is honestly pathetic.The anime won't end the romance conclusively, but the manga does. How it ends is awful. It should've ended 2 ways. Either hiro gives up his childhood love and focuses on the girl in front of him that didn't judge him based off appearances right away, or he confesses to his childhood friend and goes for her, and she realizes she's a better fit for him instead of Hideo. Instead he really does neither and basically says he's on the fence between hiraka and the other girl. So he lets hiraka decide. Hiraka chooses hideo, which is soooo stupid. Hiraka was actually an interesting character with hiro around, she laughed cried did random funny stuff and said funny things. With hideo she's a f**** robot, and so is Hideo. The anime made this clear! And Hiro knows so much more about her personality, what fits her, her dreams etc. Hideo is one of the most shallow characters I've ever seen.Awful awful character progression.

Himouto! Umaru-chan OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30991/Himouto_Umaru-chan_OVA,"['What i considered to be one of the best comedy and slice of life combination for summer 2015 (my persepective) An OVA has been released but through the BDs and DVDs. Usually, most OVAs are those typical fanservices as you have seen in some of the ""not well known anime with bad plots or so"" (not trying to offend anyone). This one, is quite a decent OVA, with no fanservice nor anything obscene, it\'s all pure comedy, well some maybe at the bad-timing. *MINOR SPOILERS BELOW, read at your own risk.They decided to continue where they left off from episode 12, where they are back...to their usual activities on the final days of summer vacations before the school terms begin. Well, since this was released in October, they decided to add some festive themes such as Halloween. Usual references are there especially the vocaloids merchandise, which is mainly used in the TV series back in summer. But to sum it up, the story is understandable and not to cliche and glad they continued from where they left off but as an OVA.The art and animations remain the same as the first season, nothing much changed, so the scores remain the same.The sound is pretty much the same as the first season, had no complaints about it unless the company screw the ova up.I enjoy watching Ebina in this ova especially when she talks about the food, reminds me of the anime that i watched back in Winter 2015. xD Overall, the characters are pretty much the same as season one.For a 23 min OVA, it\'s not really a waste of time to watch rather it fuels up your boringness on what anime you should watch or your having a very boring, dull, depressed day or whatsoever. I laughed so hard, had a great day but surely i\'m gonna miss this series, unless it makes a second season, i would be proud for that.So who to recommend? Viewers that had already watch the first season, but if you are a new viewer, i would recommend you to watch the TV series first but if you want to do the other way, you are always welcome to do it, since i\'m not the one who is controlling here.With that, i conclude with the same scoreline as the TV series, hope you enjoy reading this review, hopefully this is helpful, and yeah have a happy umaru day!~Overall: 8/10 to their usual activities on the final days of summer vacations before the school terms begin.

There wasn't enough time for anything major to happen, such as a new character being introduced, however the simple charm of the original 12 episodes which I really enjoyed was carried over into this.The only problem I have is that most of the second episode is very similar to episode 12. Despite this, it is an short, easy to watch anime which I can just relax to and not have to think about a complex plot.Story - 6/10Art - 8/10Sound - 5/10Character - 6/20Enjoyment - 7/10Overall - 7/10 ""]"
Hyakko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4550/Hyakko,"[""This show completely blew me away. Usually when Maceart suggests something to watch, it's some harem melodramatic crap or moe moe crap. But Hyakko is a different beast altogether.Hyakko is about the lives of students in Kamizono Academy. The cast numbers around 20 well-fleshed out students, mostly high school students and two elementary school students. The series is fairly episodic, and goes into each of the characters one by one.The characters make Hyakko golden. No other show in recent memory was this funny. The plot synopsis, a group of girls and guys hanging out in this high school, may sound like the most boring thing...ever. But it is not. You get the classic hyper girl, the quiet girl, the glasses girl, the scary girl, the tall airheaded girl, the girl who never opens her eyes, the bisexual girl, and many others. To make the show even better, Hyakko introduces a few key guy characters at just the right moments. You get the angry homeroom teacher, the lovesick guy, the bully, and the photographer dude. By the end of 13 episodes, all the characters will be etched inside your head like jam on toast. That analogy was pretty bad, but you get my point. What I mean is that everyone will find at least one character that they like. For me, I loved the lovesick guy and Tatsuki. They are amazingly awesome.Hyakko has situational comedy defined down to the atomic level. For example, when Torako and the gang visits the cafeteria, you get such classics as COMBO CARDS and BIG SERVINGS. Hyakko can create comedy out of the most mundane things. Thought dodgeball isn't funny? Well you haven't watched Hyakko. How about art class? Well, Hyakko has got that covered too. Hyakko also does not resort to tired conventions such as fanservice to get its comedy across. In that aspect, Hyakko rises above Toradora and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Looking for beach episode? Hot springs episode? Not in Hyakko, nope.As if the characters and situational comedy aren't enough, Hyakko's music is also awesome, to boot. I'm a classical music buff, and when I heard Vivaldi's 4th Season used as effective background music, I couldn't help but stand up in shock. Shocked in a good way, I mean. All of Vivaldi's work is presented in Hyakko, from Spring to Winter, and it is used so perfectly.People have asked what kind of animation you should expect in this show. Well, the show airs in HD. Expect orgasmic clouds and super sharp trees in the background. The character designs need some time to get used to, but I love them. Sometimes Hyakko uses the technique of speed lines to animate scenes very well that usually don't require awesome animation. For example, in episode 1, the scene when Ayumi chases Tatsuki and Tatsuki turns around. That must have cost bundles of yen to animate. Like all anime, the animation quality dips during the middle but not to the point of pure QUALITY. It got fine in the end though.As for the voice acting, Hyakko is littered with an all star cast. Aya Hirano is here. So is Yui Horie. So is Keiji Fujiwara. All the voices were superb. Even the two existential brats were awesome.Are there any bad things about this show? Well, only episode 2 was kind of on the weak side, as they stretched 18 pages of manga across 24 minutes. But even a weak episode had its golden parts. DREAM TEAM, anyone?Don't miss this show, please. I implore you not to. If you are looking for references and parodies, there are plenty. Hyakko covers Tetsujin 28, the Ring, Slam Dunk, and the Stonehenge, all within 13 episodes. Looking for lesbian tendencies? Hyakko has also got that base covered. If you are a fan of comedy, watch this show. If you like to watch pretty girls do surrealistic things, watch this show. If you have siblings, watch this show with them. My sister loved this show too.Hyakko is so good, that I spent the last two days translating the last three episodes. (Sorry Mayu-subs) That's six hours of my life right there, and rightfully spent.PS: This is more of a final impression/rant/giddiness rather than an objective review. The very long review by tehnominator is more level headed. I hope you still enjoyed reading it, though. ever. But it is not.

I almost never drop a show before the tenth episode, but I am seriously considering it. Well, lets start with production values. The OP and ED are crap. The BGM fails to be memorable. The art is sub-par from what I expected, so were the BGs. This is a kind of short review, but I just don&rsquo;t have anything good to say about this show. The story sits there&hellip; there isn&rsquo;t really any memorable plot to be had. The...characters are stereotypical, with the quiet girl who wants to establish herself, the prim and proper bitch, the loud and annoying, headstrong girl, and the weird &ldquo;eccentric&rdquo; girl who doesn&rsquo;t say much. The only character that I liked was the teacher, simply because he was the only male I had seen the entire episode. That&rsquo;s all I have to say for the show. It just fails to make a mark, or be unique in any way. I&rsquo;ve got to give this a 4/10.Production by Nippon Animation. Airs on Wednesdays. Subs by Ayako. characters are stereotypical, with the quiet girl who wants to establish herself, the prim and proper bitch, the loud and annoying, headstrong girl, and the weird &ldquo;eccentric&rdquo; girl who doesn&rsquo;t say much.

Subs by Ayako.', ""You can't judge this by watching 1 or 2 episodes... I've watched until sixth and even that may not be enough... But so far, it's was quite good with many hilarious and some heart warming moments.It's about four girls (friends), all with different personalities and many events that happen between them. I enjoyed a lot of jokes in the series. Although it's not the most hilarious anime you'll ever see, it's certainly a great series that's worth watching.Voice actings are great and are done by many recognized and popular voice actresses like Hirano Aya (Haruhi), Fumiko Orikasa (Rukia from Bleach), etc. "", 'You could call this series ""The Melancholy of Torako Kageyama"" and not be far off. If you like Kyon, Mikuru, Yuki and Haruhi you\'ll probably enjoy Tatsuki, Ayumi, Suzume and Torako almost equally. Normally, Torako would be the the character in charge of slapstick comedy - loud, boisterous, and embarassing like Tomo, Himeko or Kana but here she shines. But Hyakko revolves around Torako no less than MoHS is centered on Haruhi, as a matter of fact if Haruhi were a ""normal"" human she\'d probably be Torako Kageyama. In Torako\'s world there\'s too much to do and too many chances for fun and entertainment to...spend your time worrying about the sadder aspects of your life. Torako hates sitting still, grasping both life and her classmates with both hands she pulls both along in her wake blithely ignoring complaints and criticisms. There are other ""slice of life"" school girl comedies that are ""funnier"", Azumanga for instance, but I doubt if you\'ll find one with more fully developed characters in both the lead and supporting roles; particularly Torako Kageyama. spend your time worrying about the sadder aspects of your life.

The characters are so unique that their personalities tie this strong bond that gives the anime a more appealing enjoyment. Likewise, this show is hysterically funny and one of the good laughs for the Fall '08 anime line-up. At first I thought it won't be great, but as I got into the first episode, I found out that it has the potential. Anyways, long story short, Hyakko is a very great anime and has this unique charm to it. "", ""High school slice-of-life comedies are possibly the most common of anime. Dozens of them come out every year, and with a frequency that has only increased over time. Sometimes one of these school life shows does something special that makes them memorable and standout from their ilk, but usually they fade into obscurity, lost among a sea of similar shows. Such is the case with Hyakko, a generally enjoyable high school romp from 2008, that ultimately provides nothing outside the usual anime high school shenanigans.The shenanigans are those of teenage trouble-child Torako Kageyama and the many odd friends she makes at Kamizono Academy. And what...a eclectic group of friends she has; including the cute and shy Ayumi, snobbish Tatsuki, physically fit and gluttonous Suzume, yankee Ushio, Sadako look-a-like Inori, bisexual class president Nene, and so many other peculiar personalities. With such a wide variety quirky characters bouncing off each, the show is undoubtedly fun. The show has dozens of character gags from Torako and Tatsuki's conflicting personalities, to Suzume's oddly nonchalant personality and excessive eating, to Nene's drooling over the rest of the female cast. The gags and jokes are quite simple but the animated personalities of the girls make them work enough. Of course this is essentially just another 'cute girls doing cute things' anime, as evident by the fact most of the characters are girls even though Kamizono is a co-ed school; there are only 4 reoccurring male characters, one of them being a teacher.The overall tone of the show is largely zany. This is unmistakably a comedy show, and it rarely takes itself seriously. Most of the show's run time is spent on Torako's hair-brained antics and slowly introducing more characters into Torako's ever expanding group of friends. The usual episode is light and breezy, easy to watch and completely comfortable; devoid of any actual tension. While this makes the show enjoyable, it is also why the show ultimately doesn't accomplish anything of consequence, it is a good time but there is nothing more grasp onto. With no real plot and minimal conflict, the events of every episode blend together into a fuzzy glob of jokes. The comedy itself isn't particularly original or exceedingly crafty, it is more or less the usual anime humor of silly situations and overreactions, albeit done fairly well.What makes this particularly frustrating is that Hyakko does have the potential to be more than the average school life comedy, the show just never capitalizes on it. The potential lies in two characters, Tatsuki and our lead, Torako. Tatsuki is a rich heiress with a complicated family life, she's used to being alone and despite attending Kamizono Academy since elementary she hasn't made any real long lasting friendships. In one of the show's rare slightly more serious episodes, Tatsuki ponders the solidarity of her school life til high school and the value of her new friends, only to realize she actually treasures them when they drop by her house in a surprise visit. This is a nice bit of development, which makes it too bad that it is confined to a single episode; pushed aside for high goofy shenanigans.Likewise, Torako also has a complicated relationship with her family, probably even more so. She doesn't get alone well with the other members of her family, and often runs away from home. This could have been the foundation for some potent, maybe even mature family drama; perhaps even delving into why Torako behaves the way she does. However, this is only elaborated in a single admittedly good episode near the end of the series. There isn't really anything wrong with a show focusing on comedy, but Hyakko has clear potential for meaningful drama that it passes up, content with showing cute girls doing cute things. As a consequence, the show feels like a real under-achiever.On a technical standpoint, Hyakko isn't all that impressive either. It is by no means a bad looking show; the character designs are quite adequate, certainly cute enough. They are more or less what is expected from an anime with a high school setting, and that is kind of the problem with them. Kamizono Academy is laid out well enough to feel like an actual place, but the backgrounds settle for passable; adequate enough to properly  establish the setting, but never exceedingly well detailed. The animation is full of shortcuts and fully animated movement is rare. Such shortcuts are commonplace in slice-of-life comedies such as Hyakko, however this is a show that was made after The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, and other much better animated slice-of-life series, so it is hardly the best looking show of its kind or of its time. The music is largely light and wacky, adhering to the show's dominantly comedic tone. However, there are times when it achieves more emotional richness, which works well when the show aims to be slightly more serious or melancholy.Hyakko certainly isn't an unpleasant show, quite the contrary. It has likeable characters and plenty of funny moments. The zany antics and personalities are easy enough to enjoy; the show is an easy and comfortable watch. In fact, it is probably too easy of a watch. There is essentially no plot, little tension or conflict, and sparse character development. The potential for such things is there, but the show is so preoccupied with being cute and funny that it neglects to be anything more. Fun though the show might be, it is ultimately unremarkable and unmemorable. a eclectic group of friends she has; including the cute and shy Ayumi, snobbish Tatsuki, physically fit and gluttonous Suzume, yankee Ushio, Sadako look-a-like Inori, bisexual class president Nene, and so many other peculiar personalities. With such a wide variety quirky characters bouncing off each, the show is undoubtedly fun. The show has dozens of character gags from Torako and Tatsuki's conflicting personalities, to Suzume's oddly nonchalant personality and excessive eating, to Nene's drooling over the rest of the female cast. The gags and jokes are quite simple but the animated personalities of the girls make them work enough. Of course this is essentially just another 'cute girls doing cute things' anime, as evident by the fact most of the characters are girls even though Kamizono is a co-ed school; there are only 4 reoccurring male characters, one of them being a teacher.The overall tone of the show is largely zany. This is unmistakably a comedy show, and it rarely takes itself seriously. Most of the show's run time is spent on Torako's hair-brained antics and slowly introducing more characters into Torako's ever expanding group of friends. The usual episode is light and breezy, easy to watch and completely comfortable; devoid of any actual tension. While this makes the show enjoyable, it is also why the show ultimately doesn't accomplish anything of consequence, it is a good time but there is nothing more grasp onto. With no real plot and minimal conflict, the events of every episode blend together into a fuzzy glob of jokes. The comedy itself isn't particularly original or exceedingly crafty, it is more or less the usual anime humor of silly situations and overreactions, albeit done fairly well.What makes this particularly frustrating is that Hyakko does have the potential to be more than the average school life comedy, the show just never capitalizes on it. The potential lies in two characters, Tatsuki and our lead, Torako. Tatsuki is a rich heiress with a complicated family life, she's used to being alone and despite attending Kamizono Academy since elementary she hasn't made any real long lasting friendships. In one of the show's rare slightly more serious episodes, Tatsuki ponders the solidarity of her school life til high school and the value of her new friends, only to realize she actually treasures them when they drop by her house in a surprise visit.

Because Episode 13 occurs chronologically before all the other episodes, and is a whole lot more enlightening if viewed first, and, I'm sure, will make your viewing experience much more enjoyable. It's a waste of time to see the &quot;first&quot; episode at the very end, because, by that point, you can pretty much fill in all the blanks yourself.As for the show on the whole, it elicited a lukewarm response from me. At first, it deceivingly markets itself as a comedy, when it truly follows more of the drama/slice-of-life genre, although the drama...is mild and far-between.The only thing driving this show is the characters, comprised of a diverse cast of different personalities. Hyakko's characters are certainly the only thing that saves it from its less-than-lackluster plot.On the whole, Hyakko is decent. It wasn't for me, but if you're into this kind of genre (and the characters especially), it's certainly worth a run-through. is mild and far-between.The only thing driving this show is the characters, comprised of a diverse cast of different personalities.

Having a bunch of disparate personalities come together as friends within the school environment has been done countless times (although none come close to the brilliance of Azumanga Daioh). Even the class full of dysfunctional (or maybe just odd, in this case) has been beaten to death in Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.That said, it doesn’t start badly. Our four protagonists – the...timid and shy Ayumi; haughty and abrasive Tatsuki; impulsive Torako and the quiet Suzume actually form a pretty decent team. Then again, it’s the kind of pairing (or quadrupling if you like) that’s been seen in everything from Manabi Straight to Hidamari Sketch to Sketchbook and so forth. It’s a formula that works, so it gets trundled out again and for the first four episodes it works well and there are some genuinely funny moments, most of which involve Tatsuki having to deal with the human typhoon that is Torako. Foremost amongst these has to be and the antics of the openly bi and predatory class president – who has her eye on the student council presidency, as well as Torako. Suzume’s complete unawareness of the havoc her performing an Y-balance pose (with one leg in the air) would cause on her co-ed art class is also worth a mention.Sadly, the class president doesn’t get the screen time, or the development, her character needed to add some serious comedy to the whole affair. Likewise, the long-suffering homeroom teacher, Sengoku-sensei, has a couple of classic on-screen moments, usually involving Torako but these are, sadly, too few and far between. However, his portrayal of a world-weary teacher, who’s just realised his karma has caught up with him in the form of this flaxen-haired demon, is nicely done.After the first four episodes, however, it all starts to fall apart. We are introduced to more of the oddball classmates, which is all well and fine, if you left them to do oddball things. The problem is, they all have issues, which Torako & Co try to resolve. It’s a bit like Clannad’s “introduce-a-broken-chick-and-then-fix-her” motif, but at least Clannad has the decency to put some flesh on the character’s bones, so we know who they are and what makes them tick, before breaking them. In Hyakko, the viewer just isn’t made to care enough about the superficial characters to introduce that kind of drama and make it work. It gets even worse, when additional characters are suddenly out of the blue, in order to resolve Torako’s arc. It ends up messy and feeling very contrived.The soundtrack is also forgettable with a poor OP and an even worse ED. Aya Hirano, who I like as a seiyuu and who voices Ayumi, would appear have a pretty good deal, as she sings at least one song on whatever series she’s in. The problem is she obviously can’t choose what she sings and they tend to be generally bad and not at all suited for her voice. Maybe she should just stick to voice acting.On the whole, Hyakko was a disappointment. It never really set out to do anything that hadn’t been done before. It suffers from what I call “not knowing what to do” syndrome – if it wanted to be a comedy, then it shouldn’t have introduced drama and if it wanted to be a drama then it needed to flesh out the characters far more than they were.

However, don't let that stop you from watching this because this is an amazing anime. It surprised me just exactly how deep this anime is, and it really made for a good watch. Characters and character development is probably the strongest point in this anime - you will see a change in their personalities overtime, and personally that's my favorite part. The cast is great. If you can compare this, it's similar to lucky-star but less humor and a tad-bit of drama.

All of them.Torako: Starts off really brash and annoying but you get used to her soon enough. She doesn't change at all, you just get Stockholm'd into liking her.Ayumi: I honestly don't remember if she had a personality, she was kind of just there.Suzume: She's cool, goes with the flow and likes to eat a lot. Nothing not to like.Tatsuki: She's cool, kind of a tsundere, acts a bit like an ojou which is one of my favorite character types.Amagasa-sensei: I wish the school disciplinary policy was less...lenient and less realistic so he could sock Torako and give her one or more of those big ol' anime head-lumps every episode.Nene: A NATIONAL TREASURE AND A GIFT TO HUMANITYMinato: A NATIONAL TREASURE AND A GIFT TO HUMANITYUshio: SO GOOD?????!!!!Inori: SO GOOD?????!!!!Touma: Deeply regrets befriending Torako.

I thought it wasn't very funny, and didn't feel any compulsion to watch the next episode other than to finish it to merit a review.Hyakko follows the daily school life of a group of girls lead by the overly enthusiastic Torako. The basic synopsis is that Torako becomes friends with all of her classmates through various wild adventures and strange happenings.Overall, if you're looking for a situational, comedic slice-of-life character then this might be your series. I'd relate this to Lucky Star but it lacks all the fun otaku feeling, and I'd relate this to...Minami-ke except that I don't think it caries the same degree of hilarity that that series brings.My impression is that it was pretty much an episodic show with a 4-koma feel. Sadly, other series that are based around the same concept have distinctive points that I found interesting. The strongly contrasting personalities of this series and occasional humor were not enough to satisfy me.By all means, if you're looking for something plot-based, stay far away from this. If your looking for a slice of life comedy, this is a hit or miss.Animation:I really can't say anything bad about the animation here. The quality is very high and colors are well balanced. The only thing that annoyed me a bit was the somewhat original character drawing style. For me, it was enough to detract. Also, there is some fan service, though not really anything much.Sound:The OP/ED were skip-able (and I'm not one to skip them usually) and the BGM was fairly plain. I guess there isn't too much to expect cause there are very few moments of plot tension given the filler nature of the series as a whole. VAs were fine, Torako's voice definitely fits her personality.Story:I've pretty much already summed up the story line... There is no real plot. Each episode is actually broken into two or three parts similar to School Rumble but lacking any plot progression whatsoever. Basically Torako slowly wins over her classmates and eventually all is well. I will admit to almost falling asleep to this (it's a great substitute sleeping aid, especially with the BGM).Very little of Torako's background is known until the last few episodes of the series. The tone in these eps. is a bit more dark than the uplifting over-joyfulness that the other episodes show. The last episode is actually a prequel to what happens in the first episode, a strange order but nothing compared to Touka Gettan.Character:The characters in Hyakko are very distinct in their personality, leading to some fairly interesting situations. However, I didn't feel any consistent development except everyone slowly warming up to Torako one after another. The parallel developments for all of the class was painfully linear and detracted from the enjoyment of the series as a whole.Torako, as a person, is very clumsy and outgoing, despite what one later finds about her past. Her antics usually make up the majority of the series but for the most part, she is a static character.Value:This was recommended to me by a friend who found this a hilarious series.

Because of the nature of this show, then, there is only one question that needs to be asked, is this show funny? Is it satisfying what it set out to do? Is it making the viewer laugh?Such questions are hard to answer, each persons taste of humor is different, all I can hope to do is try and explain how the comedy in this particular show works,...hopefully from that you can understand if you would find it funny or not.The comedy in this show uses one formula, events happen, the characters react to this events, they interact with each other while doing so and at the end comedic moments appear. Does it succeed in doing that? In my honest opinion it doesn\'t.This show seems to try too hard in being funny, it is like they tried being overly funny but because they went too far with the ""overly"" part it ends up falling flat, they try to introduce random elements and make fun out of these situations but once again these random elements fall flat, when a show tries to be random all the time can it be called random anymore?The characters themselves fit to their own stereotypical images and are boring, perhaps this is one of the main reasons this show fails. All of the characters can be explained in few words at most.

Usually, slice of life comedies have a difficult time introducing the main characters very well, but honestly, Hyakko does a pretty good job of introducing them. Granted, it's not a masterpiece, but it's something simple and does the job greatly--something many comedies completely fail at doing.The followup episodes aren't bad either. You get to know Torako, Ayumi, Suzume, and Iizuka pretty well, and the gags are pretty good. I definitely laughed more than I expected.But honestly, that's where the positive feedback ends. The supporting cast is basically trash, and drags the show in the mud....Other than the four main leads, other other characters are so archetypal and redundant that you wonder why they are in the show in the first place. Their introductory episodes make you cringe, and they provide nothing to the story. Anything episode that has only side characters is sure to make you want to skip it.Perhaps these side characters were alright for the anime was made, an entire eleven years ago, let alone the manga, which is even more ancient. However, they really didn't age well, and it shows.Lastly, the serious episodes in this show are also quite bad. While some light hearted anime can have a good serious arc or flashback, Hyakko does not execute them nearly as well as expected. It feels very empty, and you wonder why they were there in the first place. It's just forced. You don't quite feel much of a deeper understanding, and I just wished that it was done in a more natural way.This show might have been good when it debuted over a decade ago, but there may be a reason why it's not mentioned anymore.

Anything episode that has only side characters is sure to make you want to skip it.Perhaps these side characters were alright for the anime was made, an entire eleven years ago, let alone the manga, which is even more ancient. However, they really didn't age well, and it shows.Lastly, the serious episodes in this show are also quite bad. While some light hearted anime can have a good serious arc or flashback, Hyakko does not execute them nearly as well as expected. It feels very empty, and you wonder why they were there in the first place. It's just forced. You don't quite feel much of a deeper understanding, and I just wished that it was done in a more natural way.This show might have been good when it debuted over a decade ago, but there may be a reason why it's not mentioned anymore."", ""Okay okay Nice AnimeSpectacles That Can Be Said Simple but Attractive.Simple what I can sayAnime Yang tells a group of girls at a school that can be spelled EliteBut Every-Every Student Personality Has Its Own Unique Traits, Not Just Groups That Just Prominent.honeston the First episode rather Ordinary Ya like anime Genre Slice of life and Comedy Generally (a little boring).And what I say Anime is interesting that is:On Moving From episode 1 to Next episode and so on...which is not the only group that stands outFrom episode to episode The Hidden Properties of Other Students Also DisclosedPlus There's a Dramatic Element Approaching the End episode.The problem lies in the last episodeI want to give a value of 8 on this Anime But Down slightly because of the last episode That is a bit skip which is not the only group that stands outFrom episode to episode The Hidden Properties of Other Students Also DisclosedPlus There's a Dramatic Element Approaching the End episode.The problem lies in the last episodeI want to give a value of 8 on this Anime But Down slightly because of the last episode That is a bit skip"", ""Hyakko is a prime example of a show that's really just spinning its wheels. It's not necessarily bad, and it's clear a lot of work was put in, but it doesn't seem to have resulted in anything remarkable. It's generally alright, and definitely had its good moments, but its weakest points were too numerous to overlook. Beginning with the story, it's largely your typical CGDCT faire, highly episodic with a generous helping of comedy throughout. In this respect, it managed to hold up, and a couple episodes were actually pretty good, though there were a few moments and even recurring subplots which felt bizarre and...out of place, and not in an absurdist comedy angle either. The art is simultaneously engaging and inconsistent, with solid use of color and visual comedy, paired with moments of almost amateurish animation and shot composition. The best part of the art is the character designs, managing to make a huge cast look distinct and recognizable from afar. The sound is generally awful from start to finish, with a stilted, artificial OST and sound effects which sound as though they are occurring at the end of a long tunnel. I don't know how else to describe it, but many of the sounds of life sound distant and echoey. The voice acting meets all the standards of quality, but doesn't make up for the rest of the sound design. The characters are this show's greatest strength, feeling believable for the world they're in as they play off each other quite well. If I had to choose my favorites, I'd choose Torako and Suzume, not only because they feel like the narrative core of this anime, but also because the last few episodes really developed them as characters. In fact, i'm not sure if I would have made that decision if those final episodes hadn't happened. This speaks to how I feel about Hyakko overall. In the end, it's a show which is especially sloppy in the beginning, developing into a better show as it clumsily stumbles to its feet. If the entire anime was like those last few episodes, than this would have gotten a higher rating, even with all its flaws. out of place, and not in an absurdist comedy angle either.
