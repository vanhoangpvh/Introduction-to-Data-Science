Zhen Hun Jie: Bei Luo Shi Men Pian Part 1,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40733/Zhen_Hun_Jie__Bei_Luo_Shi_Men_Pian_Part_1,[]
Zi Chuan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44389/Zi_Chuan,"['Before I start my review, I want to point out that even though this donghua is tagged as action and fantasy, the fantasy elements stop only at the fact that demons and demi-humans exist (with some wuxia/martial art elements mixed in), and the action is good but not a focus. So if you are here purely to see action or heavy fantasy elements, this is not for you.Now onto the review: This review will have some spoilers to this and will evaluate this work as an adaptation of its source material (novel). I will give it an adaptation score based on how closely it follows...the novel and a score on how well it tells a story through the medium of donghua.The story of Zichuan follows the life of 3 brothers, Di Lin, Sterling, and Zichuan Xiu (Zichuan Xiu being the main MC of the story), as they fight for the country. The first 1/3 of the story focuses on the attempted coup and its suppression with the help of the three brothers. Because of their philosophies and actions, they are rewarded differently, with 2 rising in power and Zichuan Xiu being ""punished"". The remainder of the covers the wars/battles that are the fallout caused by the attempted coup.The donghua does a good job with its exposition, so that new viewers can get a good general understanding of the plot. However, it is very difficult to understand many of the intricacies and finer details because it is too difficult to show in animated format. This donghua, in my opinion, is so much more enjoyable if you have read the novel. Another criticism of this donghua is that there seems to be misplaced humor and its somewhat disjointed (tangental) stories. This is because some attempt has been made to include the signature comedy that the novel that made it popular, and introduce characters that are important and relevant in future seasons (but not so currently). This results in some awkward moments and can cause confusion. Last but not least, I recommend reading the ""side story"" review and watching the ""side stories"" since they are important, but not required to enjoy this fully.As an adaptation, I think this donghua does a good job. There have been quite a few changes, but the overall story is the same. Unfortunately, the story/plot is too pack, complex, and detailed for it the studio to cram it into 42 episodes, so some sacrifices had to be made. There are also changes to introduce more characters, like Liufeng Shuang who is not that important in this season but is very important later in the story, or to give more importance to others, like Zichuang Ning (a side character whose existence many of the MC\'s decisions revolve around). The comedic side of the novel has also been simplified and cut, since most of it was immersion-breaking. Overall, despite the changes, I think this adaptation did a good job in telling the story to new viewers (those who have never read the novel before), though there are many details that can be understood only if you\'ve read the novel. Having read the novel will definitely boost enjoyment.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 7/10 the novel and a score on how well it tells a story through the medium of donghua.The story of Zichuan follows the life of 3 brothers, Di Lin, Sterling, and Zichuan Xiu (Zichuan Xiu being the main MC of the story), as they fight for the country.

It deserves better score to be honest. 3D, art and sound there is no other anime like this.Story is war between different races. It's kinda typical and might be boring after some episodes for some people. But I enjoyed variety of stories in between war scenes. Such as doing business with tradesman in frontlines, pact with Orcs, get in touch with Dwarves, there are some good stories apart from war.Art is no doubt well prepared and well presented, It's rendered beautifully in 3D. I enjoyed every little detail of 3D...rendering. Studio put so much work into this anime, it's rendering and post-production. I don't think that 2D animes can compete with such an artwork.Sound and music is so good that I always watch and listen opening and closing scenes and it gives me goosebumps.Characters are well thought and there are variety of different characters. Especially main character with his wisdom and power he is charming. There are other officers, coup people, rebels, enemies from demon race, orcs, etc. There are plenty of side characters take place. It's not boring from characters perspective.After all Zi Chuan is awesome anime/donghua. For me it's one of the top-notch 3D anime ever made. I would like thank you everyone who participated in the production and please keep up your good work. rendering. Studio put so much work into this anime, it's rendering and post-production.

The very first episode was awesome, but after that it started going downhill from there and became boring. I was expecting more from this series after seeing the first episode...but now 18 episodes in...definitely getting bored and probably wont be watching it anymore. From the first episode you can tell the main character is badass but you don't get to see him fight other than the first episode. I am guessing something big will happen in the future and he will start fighting again, but...18 episodes in and he has barely engaged in the story or the fighting. It doesn't seem like people know about his true powers but I wish they would have him be more active in the anime and not just passive. 18 episodes in and he has barely engaged in the story or the fighting. It doesn't seem like people know about his true powers but I wish they would have him be more active in the anime and not just passive."", ""Zi Chuan takes place in a fantasy setting where the Empires of Humanity and Demons are in constant conflict over resources and territory. Zi Chuan Xiu, the adopted second brother of the Zi Chuan family, one of the three major families in the Empire begins his journey proving himself by committing great war deeds and increasing his reputation in the Empire's army. Along with Xiu, first brother Zi Chuan Dilin and third brother Zi Chuan Sterling lead factions within the Empire to help turn the tide of the ongoing war on the Empire's Far East border town Pai City. How will the demon factions respond...to their mobilization and what ulterior motives lie in wait for the three brothers?Story & Character: 6/10I want to like this series in terms of its narrative accomplishments but it's so hard. Zi Chuan starts off as a faction battle between the young leaders to see who can achieve the most contributions to the war efforts and this was met with an enjoyable series of arcs that featured incredible world building elements, new characters with wild personalities and even some potential love interests. However, as the story progresses along with the war we are greeted with slow paced arcs with political talks that lead to absolutely no action whatsoever. In the end, the story gives us a brute-forced conclusion to the series with incomprehensible character decisions and even more unexplained plot logic. The story strays away from team-building and war strategies and instead aims for a dull plot focus on constant betrayal, corruption and fabricated court trials (inevitably leading to dead-ends)Character development was the better of the two in terms of consistency and depth. At first it is confusing to discern who the main character of the show is because we follow through the footsteps of the three Zi Chuan brothers and their individual perspectives. However, it becomes clear that Zi Chuan Xiu is the real protagonist among the three main characters. Beyond that, Dilin and Sterling don't lack in terms of depth; They try to solve their own personal issues just like Xiu. The characters surrounding the brothers lack in terms of depth but many aren't discarded in superficial plot events or involved in meaningless internal quarrels especially characters that Xiu has picked for his squad. There are some side characters that really lack in impact to the story like Princess Kardan or old President Zi Chuan where they are used for dialogue, shock factor or in a complex romantic subplot. I did enjoy the antagonist character's factions but they felt intentionally inferior in terms of combat tactics and decisive formations despite their species being on par with the Empire's technology; For a group of species that caused trouble for humanity over hundreds of years you'd expect the Demon army/God's race characters to have a cunning and calculative set of leaders no?Art & Sound: 6/10The art is of higher quality in comparison to the CGI series released in its period and that makes this viewing experience a lot better. However, there are times where shots feel very cheap and it tends to be scenes with high population density - This makes the background textures look low-poly and budget. The fight scenes also felt too wide angle in some scenes making the battles less immersive. The character designs were very detailed; I liked Princess Kardan, Ka'dun Emperor and Zi Chuan Sterling's character designs both because of their detailed faces and detailed character clothing.Sound is passable, there weren't anything out of the ordinary. The background music in many of the battle scenes were suitable to the mood. Especially the Pai City defense, the background music choice and timing were perfect for the mood. Voice acting is good quality, there were some characters that sounded the same in tone and talking speed so it was hard to discern between them - Mainly the Empire officials VA. Sound effects were good, nothing too bad.Overall & Enjoyment: 5/10I really enjoyed the earlier arcs of this series with the team-building and team bonding but the story led all the progress astray in order to focus on the three brothers and their factions overall. I did enjoy the funny scenes with Zi Chuan Xiu being a menace to his troops and the Demon factions. Overall, it was a little hard to watch the latter half than the former half but it was because of the slow pace and unnecessary characters. to their mobilization and what ulterior motives lie in wait for the three brothers?Story & Character: 6/10I want to like this series in terms of its narrative accomplishments but it's so hard.

Sousei no Aquarion OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2170/Sousei_no_Aquarion_OVA,"[""The OVA vs. the seriesEven-though the premise is the same, the story has been re-vamped.  This is what makes the OVA a better watch than the series.  While watching the series, I experienced a bit like too much was going on.  The revisions in the OVA fixed that for me.  Yes, it's a post-apocalyptic that is similar to the likes of Evangelion, Escaflowne & RaXhephon, but there's a different fight here.  Most have not seen this because they are too wrapped up in the fact that it resembles older titles.  In a sense, I could even say it is...similar to Voltron.  This title like the others, has a specific fight.  Like I don't give away the story (because others have already), I would recommend a watch of the OVA as it is only 2 episodes.  If you are curious to know the difference of the series, see if this holds your attention well enough, then check out the series.  Also, find the true battle in this story. similar to Voltron.

Also, find the true battle in this story."", ""Although there are mecha elements in this OVA, I really wouldn't characterize it as a mecha. The focus in this anime is reincarnation and relationships.Story: 8/10. The basic premise is a battle between angels and humans. The battle is based on the fact that the two races just don't see eye to eye: the angels want to eradicate the humans and the humans want to survive. Go figure. BTW, I refer to the angels as a race, because they are just jerks with wings that I wouldn't characterize as angels.The setting is 12,000 years after an Angel of Massacre falls in love with a human...warrior chic with big breasts. I mean with how many shots they dedicate to his eyes focusing on her chest, you don't have to even wonder what he really fell in love with her for.Then their best friend kills him. Sorry, that's not a spoiler; that's a flashback. You get that information in the first five minutes of the movie. The real story doesn't even start until years later.The plot then revolves around the reincarnation of these three individuals and how manipulative the angels are about trying to use their once friendship against them.The story does have romance within it, in fact, the romance is the premise instead of the typical mecha theme. But this doesn't fit in the romance genre either. So it is what it is. A mecha movie with romance as a theme.Characters: 8/10. I liked the characters for the most part. Apollo is great. Typical but great. He does have some development, even it is minor. But what do you expect from a two episode OVA?  He's hot headed, but protective and loyal. The main girls Silvia and Reika are great too. But I won't go into details of their characters, because that would be dipping into the realm of spoiling... since the story revolves around his relationship with the two of them.The side characters for the most part are a little bland, but not too bad. The commander is great though.The end is mildly disappointing though. Not too bad, but not what I was hoping for. That's because my taste leans more towards the romance side of things.Art: 6/10. I have to admit that I have never seen an anime pendulum swing back and forth between beautiful artistry and something off an afternoon comic. It is though the in-between artists had no idea what the main capture artists had in mind. One moment the art is fantastic and the next it looks shabby like two different studios were creating the artwork. In addition to that, there are elements of CG, which at moments outshine the regular animation.There are some bishies for the bishie fans. And there is fan service for those type of fans.Warning for people with children: there is a good amount of barbie doll nudity of both male and female characters. There are some minor sexual insinuations. Also there are a couple of bath scenes, one of a male character and the other of a female character. One more nude scene and I was going to deem this anime unwatchable.Sound: 7/10. No complaints, but there was nothing grand about it either.Overall: It wasn't half bad.If you're a die hard mecha fan, this anime might not satisfy you. If you are a die hard romance fan, then this won't satisfy you either. But if you like both, then you will be satisfied. warrior chic with big breasts.

Yakushiji Ryouko no Kaiki Jikenbo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3614/Yakushiji_Ryouko_no_Kaiki_Jikenbo,"[""Yakushiji Ryoko no Kaiki Jikenbo (or Ryoko Yakushiji's Strange Case Files to give it it's full name), is another of those odd shows that I always seem to end up reviewing. The anime is based on a series of manga and light novels written by Tanaka Yoshiki, who also wrote the much acclaimed Legend of Galactic Heroes series. The manga was illustrated by Kakinouchi Narumi, who also created the manga series Vampire Princess Miyu, and has worked as an animator, character designer and director, amongst her other roles, on such notable series as Kimagure Orange Road, Superdimensional Fortress Macross (and the movie &quot;Do You Remember...Love?&quot;), Urusei Yatsura, and Megazone 23.The series centres around an elite police officer with the Tokyo Metrolpolitan Police Department named Yakushiji Ryoko, who holds the rank of Superintendent. She is one of the heirs to the powerful JACES security company, a place which employs many retired high ranking police officers and officials. She works together with her immediate subordinate Izumida Junichiro, a non career officer who holds the rank of Assistant Inspector in the police department, and a small team of underappreciated officers who handle the daily running of her department within the police.The story gets a bit &quot;strange&quot; once it becomes clear that the case dealt with by Ryoko and her department are considered bizarre to the point of being paranormal or supernatural. This is not an original concept for anime and manga, however Ryoko Case Files does suffer because of the inclusion of such a plot device.The anime begins in an episodic manner, but as it progresses the main story does become apparent (to a certain degree - I'll explain why in a bit). The animation throughout the series is very smooth, and rather stylish at times. The characters are well designed, and the overall feel of the show is very much like that of Baccano!. The sound is nothing overly impressive, with adequate effects used throughout the series. The OP is a nice, jazzy piece that wouldn't be out of place in a Bond or Pink Panther movie, whilst the ED has a very &quot;continental&quot; (think France, Italy, etc), feel to it, and while neither will ever appear on my playlist, they're not bad efforts at all.The seiyuu do a reasonably good job presenting their respective characters, with the best being the titular character's seiyuu, Nabatame Hitomi. She manages to bring across certain qualities of the petulant, spoiled, and generally arrogant Ryoko's character in a rather nice way.The characters in the series are generally okay, but they're also quite one-dimensional. The titular character is, as I mentioned, petulant, arrogant, moody, spoiled, etc, etc, which is generally how anime and manga tend to portray the heirs of wealthy or powerful corporations. Junichiro comes across as long-suffering and hard working, but there isn't really anything overtly impressive about him as a character. The rest of the cast all suffer from the same one-dimensional flaw, and there isn't really any sort of development for any of the characters that is noticeable.Wether you enjoy this show or not will very much depend on how seriously you take it. As a simple &quot;watch then throw away&quot; show it isn't too bad, but it's by no means a classic or original. One of the main problems with the show is the fact that it leaves many unanswered question, and never really makes any attempts at explaining what the hell is going on. Add to this some pseudo-political shenanigans and you have a lopsided storyline which doesn't really give the audience anything to get their teeth into. The show is stylish though, and well animated on the whole. The characters aren't all that annoying  (although I do wish that they'd developed the relationship between Ryoko and Junichiro a whole lot more, as that would have added a nice dynamic to the show that may have improved it), and are generally better than quite a few other shows I could name.This is a decent enough show on the whole, but it's not a show that I would recommend to everyone. Mystery lovers may like it, as well as lovers of sexy female lead characters, or those looking for an odd take on the supernatural.Overall this show seems to be more of an advert for the manga and light novels than anything else, but it's worth a watch if you've got half an hour to waste.

I thought that Ryoko's case filies was a cliche anime and was a waste of time. From the start of the series, it seems like detective conan turned into a girl but I was wrong. The main character, Ryoko,  is one of the most hilarious and coolest character I have ever come across. It wouldn't be a waste of time to watch it. I hope this series will have a second season!!! "", ""A mystery anime starring Yakushiji Ryouko a rich lawyer and her assistant.The two of them face some very mysterious cases on daily basis and with her strong attitude plus her assistant's help also they manage to solve every single one of them.I like how though the storyline is simple,it manages to keep you watching it through the effort they put to solve these unnatural cases.Lively art plus realistic are some of the great parts of this anime.It also shows you how two totally different characters,a sparkling beautiful and powerful woman and a calm shy but strong man,can understand each and help each other flawlessly. "", ""I was immediately intrigued into the nature of this anime. Sexy girls, guns, supernatural activities?! Who wouldn't be curious?! And i am glad that i gave this anime a shot.It is extremely well drawn and the plots are second to none. I would place this along the lines of death note (even though i know deep down that it is nowhere that good).The main person - the seductive detective - is THE person to watch. Sexy, intelligent and very, very naughty, she is truly the perfect main role.Give this a shot. "", ""I've seen just one episode so far.  The opening and ending have jazzy lounge music which sets a mood suitable for a detective story.  The opening has some risque silhouettes of a woman's body.I had been a little disappointed with more youth-oriented detective stories, but I decided to give this a shot and I'm glad I did.The characters are grown-ups.  I.e., they have grown-up personalities, grown-up levels of self-control, grown-up worries.  The viewpoint character is a 33-year-old male lieutenant cop.  The star of the show is his 27-year-old female boss.  She's physically beautiful and very competent, but not a...superhero or a psychic.  She's either genuinely attracted enough to her subordinate to flirt outrageously, or else she's a sadistic tease who enjoys sexually harassing a guy who has no safe way to assert himself.  That right there is a perfect example of a grown-up challenge:  will the viewpoint character eventually get some respect and affection, or is he going to be a dutiful, beautiful loser for the whole series?  I don't know, but I'm motivated to keep watching for developments.The show does have some supernatural/paranormal story elements, but the bad guys that interest me the most commit some very down-to-earth, hard-boiled crimes, suitable for a gritty detective story.

She's either genuinely attracted enough to her subordinate to flirt outrageously, or else she's a sadistic tease who enjoys sexually harassing a guy who has no safe way to assert himself.  That right there is a perfect example of a grown-up challenge:  will the viewpoint character eventually get some respect and affection, or is he going to be a dutiful, beautiful loser for the whole series?  I don't know, but I'm motivated to keep watching for developments.The show does have some supernatural/paranormal story elements, but the bad guys that interest me the most commit some very down-to-earth, hard-boiled crimes, suitable for a gritty detective story.

Unfortunately it\'s not a genre that seem\'s to produce a particularly large body of material. So when one comes across an enjoyable example of the genre it is cause for celebration. I have to say I really enjoyed this show, the titular character Ryoko Yakushiji is extremely well realised and is certainly one of the main draws for the show as I see it.As a slight tangent I find that anime and manga adapted from novel\'s (light or otherwise) is often of superior quality. I imagine this is because...the pre-existing material makes for an excellent frame around which to construct a suitable representation in another medium. However, wankery aside, this series is well worth a watch if you enjoy mysteries. Most of the cases are presented as one-off encounters. But as the series progresses the over-arching background plot is revealed and most of the plot threads from earlier episodes are fully resolved. The animation quality is also quite nice, perhaps not as stunning as some big budget shows but it’s certainly above the ""average"" standard of animation one see\'s. The series is also (regrettably) only thirteen episodes long, so it’s not a huge investment in time to check it out.Unfortunately for those wanting more Ryoko neither the light novel\'s or the manga has been translated. It\'s actually surprising how few light novels’ get translated into English considering how big they appear to be in Japan. And it’s not as if they\'re something like visual novels (which would appear to be sales kryptonite to the average western consumer). There are some fan translation projects going for the bigger light novel series such as Shakugan no Shana. But to be honest reading said fan translations too often feel\'s like rubbing sandpaper across one\'s eyes. I suppose prose is much harder for fan translators than dialogue. the pre-existing material makes for an excellent frame around which to construct a suitable representation in another medium.

She has an excessive need to buy the latest clothes and stay one step ahead of her coworker Yukiko Muromachi. Her assistant, Junichiru Izumida is (to my amazement) patient with her impulses but utterly oblivious of her passive love for him. I thought this series could fit into the romantic genre, but then again, maybe not. The plot is slightly repetitive but since there are only 13 episodes it isn't drawn-out, making it a good watch. The comedy surrounding Ryuko and Izumida is catchy and at...times priceless. Ryuko has two french maids that are cute and very capable of operating modern weaponry. (what more could you ask for?) The opening song Th&egrave;me Principal by katsu has a jazzy 007 feeling to it that will no doubt have you snapping your fingers to the rhythm.

Show By Rock!! Mashumairesh!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40763/Show_By_Rock_Mashumairesh,"[""It all starts with a girl from the middle of nowhere with a dream of music and making it big. Now if you heard that before I wouldn't be surprised at all since it seems to be a commonly used trope in media. But despite the start there is so much that Show By Rock Mashumairesh!! is able to do with it that puts it a cut above the rest. For while our main character, Howan, comes to the big city with dreams of rocking the world what she gets is something even more powerful and meaningful, strong bonds and friendships and a tight knit...group where she can belong.The big highlight in Mashumairesh for me are the characters and their interactions. The way that the characters are built up I think are quite organic and are done exceedingly well. Despite most of our cast being in a band together from the start it's clear that they are new to this and that they aren't that close to each other. Mashumairesh does a good job of having them interaction with each other and provide fun moments while also showcasing the distance that they have. This allows them to grow closer together and become more of a conceive whole which is one of the main themes of the show. There are a couple of arcs about the characters and how their friendship grows and I think it does a good job of showcasing how distance is created despite being able to interact daily and have fun. There is a lot that goes into a friendship and while fun times and interaction is great and usually leads to a strong friendship there is even more that can make a bond strong. And while a casual friendship is nice, in order to get more and to have more there needs to be a connection made, one the allows the others to see more of the person exposed and to accept it for what it is worth. And while I think the whole cast does a great job of opening themselves up to each other and connecting, I think there are two really good examples of these strong bonds in Delmin and Ruhuyu, and Howan and Himeko.Delmin and Ruhuyu get less focus but I think there is a lot of strong bonds showcased between the two. They play into a tsukkomi and boke type of interaction with Ruhuyu being the tsukkomi and Delmin being the boke and I think it's done very well. They bounce off each other really well and there is a lot of liveliness and fun in their interactions. Ruhuyu plays herself up in a really fun way and I enjoy seeing all the different ways she tries to force her lunatic theme into everything. And while at first it is sort of accepted as the show goes on Delmin and the others poke fun at it and rib off of it more and more usually in fun ways. It's just fun seeing the way that they play around with each other. It feels like an authentic friendship experience one where each party isn't afraid to tease each other. This also happens with the band as a whole and Himeko as they grow closer to her. Overall the two of them are able to develop and get depth in the process of them becoming better friends. So even though their fun interactions were there from the start their bond is able to become so much more as they share more of themselves with the band. This is not just true of them but the whole band leading to strong characters and a strong impactful bond.Howan and Himeko's relationship is in my opinion the highlight of the show. It's very nice to see a bond come from nothing be able to grow into a thriving powerful relationship between the two of them. They clearly leave an impression on each other with their interactions and you can see how the two of them are able to become so close to each other over the course of the season. One aspect that I really liked was how the show covered Himeko's initial distance from the group, how she handled herself, and why she did it. Despite being in the group from the start the show does a great job of showcasing her distance and her issues even despite not addressing them into later. It then is able to expose those issues while she gets development and in that process she is able to grow closer to the band and in particular Howan. It felt like Howan and Himeko were a perfect pair together and were both able to fill up what the other needed most. The two of them share something special and it's magical to see. It's specially nice to see how Howan's joining effects Himeko and how she ultimately grows from it. They also just make a very adorable pair that melts my heart.The main characters were of course the focus but there were other important characters that I think were also done well. There was the boy's band, who doesn't get as much focus and thusly doesn't have the same depth but does make up for it in comedic moments. They too have parallels with coming together and growing closer although they were much more antagonistic to begin with. They have some strong episodes that show how music has grown on them and how they themselves have grown on each other, which I think went well. There was also a ShinganCrimsonZ cameo which had to be some of the funniest stuff from the show. There was also ReijinSignal who got a good amount of development despite the limited time they had in the show and served as a very good counterpoint to the main band. One of the interesting aspects that Mashumairesh covered was the difference between playing music for fun and bonding and playing music to strike it rich. And while the two can (and do) go together I think there is a clear divide between ReijinSignal who is a professional band, that is adeptly skilled at their craft and Mashumairesh and the paths that they take. The show does a good job of showing their different paths and the ways that it effects them and what they can gain from it. Both paths are looked at as valid, and are just different paths.While the characters and their interactions were definitely the highlights there were a lot of other strong aspects that made the show shine. The art in general was very nice and I love the style and atmosphere that Midi City has. I think it perfectly captures the mood that it's trying to go for. This dark and night-life filled city with its neon lights and filled to the brim with music studios and the like. It feels like a great combination of the rock and the pop styles that the show and game at least traditionally cover. You can feel the music scene that revolves around the city, that rock 'n roll experience of staying up late, playing gigs, and having a lively city with so many bands running around. The atmosphere of the show is really nice in general and the show knows how to set up its scenery well to match the feelings such a place is supposed to invoke. The character art also pops and looks very good and strong which is nice. As expected of a music anime the songs are pretty good and nice to listen to. The choice to have many Show By Rock songs from the game show up in the background on the radio is a good unique way to both get those songs played but to have actual realistic background noise in places like the eating establishment that they frequent.Overall I was very happy with how Show By Rock!! Mashumairesh!! turned out. Being such a big fan of Show By Rock!! I was anxious for how it would turn out especially with the whole focus on new bands but I think it went very well and it managed to live up to my expectations.

I'd personally recommend it and I really had a lot of fun with it."", ""Full truth: I love Show By Rock. The first two seasons of it, at least. The first season, while objectively nothing to write home about in the public eye, I personally thought was fun, funny, dramatic, silly, awesome, and reveled in its sparkly, musical silliness. The second season, I feel, improved on many of the first seasons flaws, though it itself isn't without its problems, and was still just as fun and entertaining. I own both seasons on Blu-Ray and when I heard that a third season starring an entirely new cast of characters was going to air, I was hyped as hell. I really...thought I was going to enjoy this one, and having a new cast of characters can actually be refreshing if done right. Sadly, Mashumairesh had a promising start but ultimately failed to reach beyond mediocre.So instead of focusing on Cyan and her band Plasmagica, the story focuses on an entirely new character, Howan, a girl living in the snowy countryside who wants to make it big. She decides to go out to Midi City for an audition...only for her to loss her form and be unable to do so. But she finds a band performing on the street and they invite her to join them. Touched by their kindness, Howan decides to join them, proposing that they start a band together and see if they can make it big, just like Howan always dreamed. Yeah, tell me you haven't heard this premise before. Unoriginal as hell, though unlike the original show, there's no evil villain out to destroy the world, so any conflict is scaled down. I've heard someone say Show By Rock would be better as a pure slice of life show rather than have a more urgent save-the-world conflict, and I could see where they were coming from, but with the way Mashumairesh was executed, this shows that going that direction may not have been the best idea.I'll get the positives out of the way first. For one, the animation is quite good. The original show was made by Bones, but Mashumairesh was animated by a different studio, Kinema Citrus, who you may know worked on shows such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Made In Abyss, Rising of the Shield Hero, Is The Order a Rabbit, and other shows. While I do feel the character designs are way too ridiculous and over the top for their own good (Himeko's huge hair curls, anyone?), the show still feels true to the feel of the original, and while the CGI chibi models don't have as much shading and depth to them as the first show did, they're still cute and easy on the eyes, and stay away from looking really creepy and uncanny. I'm kind of mixed on the music, though. Some parts of it are good, such as the opening and ending songs. I wasn't a fan of the opening and ending themes for both the original show and the sequel, and the songs used here are much more pleasant to listen to and less obnoxious. That said, some of the songs sung in-universe are kind of odd. The melodies and beats are fine, but some of the lyrics make no sense, especially for some of Dokonjofinger's songs. Many of them have lyrics that feel like they were just slapped together at the last second.Speaking of Dokonjofinger...I'm not gonna lie, they're pretty much the biggest dark spot on this show, and pretty much encapsulate the show's biggest problem: Its complete lack of interest in giving its characters any meaningful development whatsoever. All of the characters, even the ones we're supposed to care about and root for, are all really bland and dull, with many of them only having one character trait that's shilled to high heaven and that's it. Ruhuyu's whole adding the world lunatic to literally every word she said and shouting it every chance she had got old really fast. No, show, giving your character an annoying quirk and having them do nothing but said quirk all the time does not make a good, endearing character. Nearly every single character has all the emotional depth of a wet paper bag, and not helping matters is that the characters are implied to have interesting backstories, but they're never explored or fleshed out in any way, except with a throwaway line of dialogue here and there that's never followed up on. Tying back to Dokonjofinger, not only are they the absolute worst characters in the show, because they're all annoying as hell and their plight is completely inconsequential to the story, their whole setup is a complete logical disaster (They've done bad things and are about to get expelled from school...but to avoid that, their principal makes them form a band and forces them to compete with other bands. How can any principal expect problem teens to be able to get along as a band and NOT be scared that they'll just use it as a means to cause even more trouble?! And they do exactly that!!) and they get a crap ton of screen time but no meaningful development that'd make the audience care about them. How little does this show care about its characters? Here's an example: In Dokofin's introductory episode, the narrator explains that Joe's hobbies are, I shit you not...giving blood and receiving IV treatment. SHOW, THOSE ARE NOT HOBBIES!! Nor do they add any kind of depth and nuance to a character whatsoever! Out of all of them, Hachin is the absolute worst, because not only is he an annoying brat who always starts fights, even with his own bandmates, for kicks and giggles, he's got an especially grating voice that makes you want to stick needles in your ears. Think Asta from Black Clover but ten times worse.The characters all stay the same throughout the series, and as a result, nearly every important moment they have near the end of the series not only feels fake, but completely unearned. It's especially bad because the creators wasted their resources on showing the bands having fun and wasting time on pointless activities, like a curling contest of all things, when they could have used that time and their resources to really flesh out their characters and make the audience care about them. Unfortunately, every character is dull and remains the same, with Dokofin's worst qualities never changing at all. Say what you will about the original show and its second season, it at least recognized its flaws from its first season and tried to rectify them in its second season. I mean, it's no sacred masterpiece, but it at least tried and put effort into making you care about the characters, even if its writing could be all over the place at times. Mashumairesh just feels like a shallow imitation that can't stand on its own two feet.It's a shame, because as flawed as the original Show By Rock is, I still enjoy watching it, and I wanted this show to be good as well. Overall, while Mashumairesh isn't utter crap, I can't recommend this show, even for Show By Rock fans. It went too far with showing silly band shenanigans and lost sight of what made the original show so good.

Mashumairesh!!"" is unironically an anime (season) I am looking forward to the most. Coming from a background of my specific joy in anime, I aim to steer towards something that has to do with music, loud and vibrant colors, cute and/or handsome characters, a ton of gender variety of characters, AND is a VERY HUGE TIE IN to a rhythm game for the smartphone. (Ideally I prefer at the arcades, but i can\'t be picky.) Sanrio, the godfathers of ""kawaii character"" culture that bought all of us Hello Kitty, My Melody, Gudetama, etc. had soft rebooted ""Show by Rock!!"" as a whole,...starting off with introducting newcomers and the veteran fans (like myself) a girl band that starts of by a mix of off-SB69 (""S""how ""b""y ""69"" (Ro-Kuu)) of: A Sanrio AniStore mascot (Howan), a virtual Youtuber (Himeko Mashima), Delmin (a massive mobage crossover game character, name shorten from ""Devil Mint""), and Ruhuyu (a new member to the roster, who end up being a (cosplayer) YouTuber). I was put off a little bit by this idea, but with Sanrio commissioning their character artist to do so much kemonomimi characters outside of Show By Rock!! really hints that the future of SB69 is coming to that soft reboot I think the series as a whole kind-of needs. And... I\'m okay with this. Enter the unofficial ""third"" season to the anime franchise! While this is NOT the same traditional SB69 anime I know, it also had to do some self-control in order to attract the new audience while still keeping it charms. (Like the strange Myumon system and why the main characters and other Myumons are all in their human/enhanced forms. There are sooo many fan headcanons for this...) I loved it when I force myself (in a good way cause I wan tto continue to remain that dedicated fan) to watch this first as priority over other anime and it paid off.STORY: My grip here is that its a slow burner. There are two arching stories into one anime: a story about a country fox girl named Howan who was recruited for a audition to be in a gig but missed her chance at MIDI CITY, only to have a faithful encounter with a struggling indie girl band with no name.  The other story involves high school boys in a delinquent boys school that NEEDS to graduate high school but circumstances back them down and the only (ridiculous) way to push onwards to graduating is to form a boy band and get their name to the big stage! While the slow burner takes place for the first half of the season, the comical additions (DOKONJOFINGER antics, featuring a cameo of ShinganCrimsomz in one episode) and the soft drama bits between the ""unofficial ships"" (Howan x Himeko and Delmin x Ruhuyu) makes up for the fluffy fanservice (with a exception of a shirtless Yasu... I was off guard!), and adding with some plot and a ""unofficial"" antagonist group (and girl band) REJINSIGNAL who are a solely independent J-Pop-esque kind of crowd that works independently to achieve a ""#1 goal"" and is in need of a rival group, so Rararin (their leader) took interest in Howan after she won a lotto to have a ""night"" with the girls. Overall, its nothing special to you all, but for me its a matter of the ""bits"" the anime delivers are more than good enough to satisfy my thirst for this series!CHARACTERS: While the soft girl drama between members of Mashumairesh!! are all alright, each character showcases their talents, flaws, and what it means to accept their ""quirks"" for who they are! (Ruhuyu copes with her delusional acts to feel ""special"" for herself and admires Delmin, while Delmin wants to fit in like every other Myumon cause she is a outcast from her Devil Mint Clan (and fled to MIDI CITY). Those two make up for each other and admire and love (in a friendship way) to each other back.) What the anime did  win me over even more is the comedy content and character build up for DOKONJOMEMBERS, especially Yasu. He ended up becoming my favorite for this season (and the new Show by Rock game, while waiting for Criticrista content to come over...) for his slow yet noticeable development of apprecating music, the fans he gained and wanting his band to also take this gig seriously so they can get out of the slump while also having their fun time performing! He is kind of like a tsundere in my thought, but he has a reason for it: At least a couple o fhis band mates (mainly Hacchin and Soujoun) show little interest on the surface, but deep inside they do care while the lesson applies: don\'t assume sudden judgement just by how they act on publlic because delusions and aggressive boy-fights are just a shield to keep their personal struggles and true feelings inside their minds.ANIMATION: The key art style had a subtle make over if you do notice, especially of how the character eyes are designed. In the past, the Show by Rock!! game has a lot of variety of hired artists into the SB69 team and the studio that formerly did the first two seasons and the shorts had to make what do to match the key features of each character into the anime. The new game all now had a consistent ""eye style"" which are probably resulted to having one key character artist doing all of the shots, thus affecting the Mashumairesh!! anime.  I was put off at first, but when going onward watching the anime, the quality control and animation has improved a ton thanks to Kinema Citrus (oh, I did not know they worked on Shield Hero, good to know!), and Polygon Pictures for the 3D CG scenes. Show by Rock is (in)famous within the anime community for using ""monster encounter"" and ""stage performing"" moments in full 3D animation for the Myumon models. While 3DCG is not everyone\'s cup of tea, SB69 wouldn\'t have a visual appeal that makes what this franchise is fully known for without these over the top animated moments. In this season, Polygon Pictures renders the models and setting to look as close to the feel of the new mobile game\'s Live2D appeal for the Myumon art which to me felt like a nice touch to a well defined soft reboot.OST, OP and ED: I have to combine all of this into one category because the songs performed for the OP and ED are also performed by the fictional band Mashumairesh(!!). If you are a seasoned SB69 fan and did see the first two seasons (and shorts) for the anime, the OG fictional girl band Plasmagica had a high-paced and high-energy girly touch to their songs, which probably explains the foundation of the band and the overall franchise. For Mashumairesh(!!), their style is more toned down and adding a touch of emotional feelings to their songs and lyrics, even for a OP and ED song. ""Hiromenesu"" (the OP) ended up becoming my fave Mashu-Mashu song that I end up looping the full track (which you can purchase at the iTunes store) at a certain grim time of my life (if you all know the events happen in early 2020, then you get it why it means a lot!). For the other bands, DOKONJOFINGER are also what made the show pretty fun due to their music! ""Ido Shudan wa Bike Desu"" and ""Kaban niwa Tepan Desu"" are... Strange picks for song titles, but their songs have this fiery hype energy that sets apart from ShinganCrimsomz, and I think I would rather root for them over the OG visual kei band! REJINSIGNAL is a new kind of addition and define their ""take"" of a band. They are a EDM-fusion pop band with a variety of genres they tackle (including a ""emotional"" song to trump down Mashu-Mashu on the band battle...) and it takes a bit to appreciate their style. (This ain\'t the first time SB69 had at least slap one EDM band into their game...) Finally, the general background OST for this season recycles elements from the previous season\'s back log of tracks, as well churning a new OST for this specific season, which again was a nice addition coming from a anime that is now going beyond Season 3! (As of writing this review, SB69 Twitter announces a new 4th season for the franchise!) Overall, their music collection helps contributing to this anime and script/story and I have encountered no issues when it comes to the sound track! (Though agian, this is a mere opinionated review, so don\'t take mines fully for granted...)""Would I recommend it?"": Yes and no...? THe ""no"" part coming from your own behalf. If you are into music, comedy, some Sanrio cuteness (or their take of ikemen like Sanrio Danshi), some slow burner development and MUSIC (again had to say that), then I say pick it up...! If you are not into any of theses categories, then I say don\'t. However, in terms of the previous seasons: You may not have to watch the first two! Mashumairesh(!!) is a fresh restart after all! It also helps decompress band focus to just three, so it makes room for them to develop and get to know them! However, if you are that one person that actually saw the grim trailer for the first season and hoping for some ""Dark Monster"" encounters: You are NOT getting those in this season! If you are new and wanted to see that stuff, go back track to the first season! If you need a anime to cope at some dark times but do not want some intense drama, I thik this season handles it pretty well! if you do love SB69 as a whole but are on a budget, the best you can do is to support the global release of the band singles on any digital format! You can also play them on Spotify as well!For me, I think 2015 and onward helped me a lot with personal cope through Show by Rock and its tiny community of fans. I am also a sucker for ""kawaii culture"" but also in need of mixing with ""anime culture"", and this anime rounds up into one package with ""music culture"" as a bonus! I hope this review is helpful, because I really want to put this up just after finishing Episode 12 and needing to share my feelings and love into one review, while also being honest in a opinionated matter! I hope your future is bright like Mashu-Mashu! starting off with introducting newcomers and the veteran fans (like myself) a girl band that starts of by a mix of off-SB69 (""S""how ""b""y ""69"" (Ro-Kuu)) of: A Sanrio AniStore mascot (Howan), a virtual Youtuber (Himeko Mashima), Delmin (a massive mobage crossover game character, name shorten from ""Devil Mint""), and Ruhuyu (a new member to the roster, who end up being a (cosplayer) YouTuber). I was put off a little bit by this idea, but with Sanrio commissioning their character artist to do so much kemonomimi characters outside of Show By Rock!! really hints that the future of SB69 is coming to that soft reboot I think the series as a whole kind-of needs. And... I\'m okay with this. Enter the unofficial ""third"" season to the anime franchise! While this is NOT the same traditional SB69 anime I know, it also had to do some self-control in order to attract the new audience while still keeping it charms. (Like the strange Myumon system and why the main characters and other Myumons are all in their human/enhanced forms. There are sooo many fan headcanons for this...) I loved it when I force myself (in a good way cause I wan tto continue to remain that dedicated fan) to watch this first as priority over other anime and it paid off.STORY: My grip here is that its a slow burner.

I am not exaggerating.Though I have not watched the previous movie in this series, from the official website it suggests this to be a standalone movie that you can enjoy regardless and has good reviews from people who did not watch the first one. So I went ahead to watch it. But honestly I think only the people who watched the first movie would have felt anything from it.The main problem here is that there was almost...no time for one to build an attachment to the main characters and feel anything for anyone. If you are seeking the signature heart-wringing moments in a romance movie, turn back now. There is none to be had here. There are a few cute/funny scenes but beyond that this movie is bland.The entire movie is 65 minutes, and things progress fast. *very minor spoiler* The main characters go from first years at junior high to being in a high school in like 15 minutes. The timeskips are jarring. I got the feeling like the movie had a lack of budget and and scenes were aggressively cut for it. Of the two guys in the love triangle, one of them barely had any screentime, so you just knew who she was going to end up with. The characters and relationships are sorely underdeveloped.This movie is very low on substance and is entirely a promotional vehicle for HoneyWorks songs.

I do believe it's the core...of this anime and I really enjoy the music. Once again, Honeywork's did an good job creating such a wonderful music.Character:Like a previous movie, the characters are decent. every single one of them have their own characteristic and they have their own romantic love. It's not great but you can pretty much enjoy their action.Enjoyment:I do enjoy this movie. They have a certain event that makes you laugh and sometimes it makes you want to scream at them but overall, it was enjoyable.Overall:Suki ni naru is an good movie.

Thank you for reading my review."", ""Here we have a story about a girl who wants to confess to her senpai but y'know what happens with senpais. In simple words it is very cliche and also a very simple movie. To be honest, I liked this movie more than the first although there was so much irony I was like dying inside. I believe you should watch the first movie first before watching the sequel.The story was very cliche but handled the cliches in the mediocre side of the spectrum. Although boring at times, it is survivable to go through all the boring moments.Sound and Art were my shit in this...film. Although it's not as designed carefully as the music videos Honeyworks makes outstanding art which is very pretty. The sound is my jam, mostly because honeyworks makes the most songs with the catchiest toons you can't anywhere else.Characters were so very disappointing. To sum it all up childhood friends a boy who was a tsundere and a girl kinda acts like it as well and there's a senpai who's changing for someone and considered the girly type which is pretty cliche. I have watched each music video of the Confession Committee so far that has come out and the supporting characters such as the twin tail girl  who looks at a girl getting separated by her classmates and why is that? It isn't really explained at all and it would've been nice for more character development but you can't really do that with supporting characters if you only have 1 hour to do so.Overall, the series was pretty okay and is pretty shoujo-like. You would probably like this if you like the first film or shoujo manga or if you only like looking at beautiful visuals and music. film.

It\'s got a bit of something for everyone, and when I say that, I don\'t mean to like, I mean to hate. An incredibly nonsensical romance, multiple characters who are important to the narrative but aren\'t really included at all, terrible writing, major conformity, and the culmination of all things to hate in romantic anime films.The beginning of the movie was, to be frank, legitimately cringe inducing. I have long thought the days of guy characters tripping and accidentally seeing a girl\'s panties and then being chased around over,...but this movie just reminded me that third rate writing will always exist. On top of that overplayed scene, of which I guess was the only way to introduce two of the main characters to each other, upon learning that the guy who she was just chasing around like a hound was her upperclassmen, Setoguchi Hina suddenly falls in love with the guy. Like, what? I was so shocked at the random and hasty development that I had to check the time that had gone by in the movie. A whole 8 minutes had passed before the main heroine got the hots for the other main character, Ayase Koyuki.8 minutes has to be a record for shitty pacing. Even though I hate people who will call a film\'s pacing bad just because it doesn\'t adhere to some objective scale of, ""this happens at x time"" and such, 8 minutes was pretty jaw-dropping.Worst of all, though, it\'s not like he does anything to gain her affection. He shows up, trips over the garbage she cleaned up, looked at her garments, and then turned out to be older than her. Bam, girl madly in love. What the hell?It only continues to go downhill, as just a few scenes later, following some stupid scenes about Hina being jealous, Ayase has suddenly graduates. Oh, and those other older characters? They graduated too, I guess. Hina bawls her eyes out, but the audience is kind of left feeling apathetic to the whole ordeal. Of the few scenes they had shown up to that point, Ayase wasn\'t even in that many many of them to begin with. The fact I was now supposed to resonate with the girl, of whom was not developed particularly well either, about the guy whose only personality traits seem to be smiling, really stirred me up.Now listen, I don\'t claim to be some music critic, but the soundtrack on this movie is pretty subpar at best. I Want to Eat Your Pancreas had a mediocre soundtrack, but I still loved that movie. The difference here is that this movie seems to have a boner for its songs and tries to play them at every moment possible. The continuous and repetitive melodies get really old, really quickly, especially when the scenes that they overlay are cliché montages that don\'t actually serve to substantially progress the story in any way. It\'s worse than a backdrop at the end, it\'s legitimately gritting to sit there and watch some melodramatic scene filled by less than average music.The characterization? I wish there was stuff to talk about, but every character can only be boiled down to their archetypes, really. Childhood friend who really likes the main character. Main character who really likes some other character. Cool big brother. Teasing big sister. Love interest, but that\'s all you need to know about him.It\'s kind of funny because when Ayase gets a haircut and Hina theorizes it\'s because he wants to make Natsuki, her childhood friend\'s elder sister, attracted to him, I laughed it off because there had been no indication whatsoever, neither had the two even interacted that much. But at the end of the movie, it turns out he DID like Natsuki, and it made me crack up because of how utterly convoluted and underdeveloped the whole plot was. Everyone likes everyone, but none of that is ever dived into. Yes, it\'s a one hour film that doesn\'t necessarily have the tools to put into place the groundwork for an emotionally riveting and complex narrative as far as the theme of multiple romances go, but why even try to tackle it in the first place if it\'s left so half assed.Its presentation is acceptable at best. Usually, movies like this will try to have at least one nice looking still, or barely moving frame that\'s wallpaper worthy, but this one seemed to have spent half of its budget in the weird prologue thing in terms of visuals, and god knows it did not care for its audial qualities.Its only saving grace is that is stumbled outside of the cliché realm at the ending to deliver an ending that actually implies the childhood friend won Hina\'s heart. Although it was a short lived implication, the fact that it comes after all of the inexcusable garbage made the moment an amazingly refreshing touch.Even then, I can\'t believe I sat there and watched the full hour of whatever dumpster fire this movie was. It lacked in all qualities that one would expect from a good, or even average film. Everything it did in mediocrity was only exacerbated in a negative manner by all of the bad it portrayed. How can something be this by the numbers and mind numbingly cookie cutter in its presentation, characterization, and plot progression, and still not do it at least somewhat well? The formula has been set in stone since the late 2000\'s for cheesy romantic anime and still, this modern piece of cinematic rubbish can\'t do a single thing right. Forget its somewhat interesting ending, I hate this stupid movie. I hate it with my all.I\'m feeling a light 1. but this movie just reminded me that third rate writing will always exist.

Usually, movies like this will try to have at least one nice looking still, or barely moving frame that\'s wallpaper worthy, but this one seemed to have spent half of its budget in the weird prologue thing in terms of visuals, and god knows it did not care for its audial qualities.Its only saving grace is that is stumbled outside of the cliché realm at the ending to deliver an ending that actually implies the childhood friend won Hina\'s heart. Although it was a short lived implication, the fact that it comes after all of the inexcusable garbage made the moment an amazingly refreshing touch.Even then, I can\'t believe I sat there and watched the full hour of whatever dumpster fire this movie was. It lacked in all qualities that one would expect from a good, or even average film. Everything it did in mediocrity was only exacerbated in a negative manner by all of the bad it portrayed. How can something be this by the numbers and mind numbingly cookie cutter in its presentation, characterization, and plot progression, and still not do it at least somewhat well? The formula has been set in stone since the late 2000\'s for cheesy romantic anime and still, this modern piece of cinematic rubbish can\'t do a single thing right. Forget its somewhat interesting ending, I hate this stupid movie. I hate it with my all.I\'m feeling a light 1.', 'Reviewer\'s point of view: I was having a romance marathon and thought why not add fuel to the fire. I saw the prequel, I did not read the novels, and I don\'t listen to vocaloid.Plot: So I did find the plot much more bearable than the last one. The reason I disliked the prior film iwa because the movie tried cramping in multiple stories while only a few were given an appropriate plot or conclusion. This sequel did a better job by focusing only on the love rectangle (?) involving the protagonists Hina, Kotarou, their respective siblings, and Koyuki. The love story had a longer...period of time to develop so I felt in the know this time. But certain things remained constant with its predecessor, for example the incomplete ending.Art: The art is once again beautiful and perfect for the movie\'s tone.Sound: So, I\'m not involved in the vocaloid community. I don\'t think I\'ve voluntary listened to vocaloid besides some songs in Mekaku City Actors. But for the most part, they were okay. The lyrics to the songs were perfectly matched with the scene. I think there was only one song I really liked while the other one\'s I just didn\'t hate.Characters: I complained about the previous movie having too many cliche and shallow characters and now I feel like I got smacked with karma because it got worse. The main character, Hina, is much more unbearable than Natsuki. (If you don\'t want the 1st five minutes spoiled, skip to the next paragraph):So 1st five minutes into the movie; Hina trips Koyuki with a broom. He falls and all the trash he was holding fell out on the floor. She yells at him for dirtying the floor she just cleaned without apologizing for tripping him. As she rants, her legs are wide open and Koyuki can see her panties from the floor and promptly warns her. She gets mad at him for seeing her panties even though her legs were wide open. Next day: she\'s in love!!!Natsuki\'s annoying attitude and rudeness towards the guys in her life are unbearable and not funny. She whines over the littlest issue and seems to care for nobody but herself. Even I have to feel sorry for the cliche Kotarou for falling in love with her. There seemed to be only one character with a more complex story-line, but was only utilized in the movie as a wing man, or woman.Enjoyment: I enjoyed seeing the better plot, but the characters gave me headaches and there was no conclusion. I think the most enjoyable part I saw was when some of the characters got tickets to see the movie, The Anthem of the Heart, (I recommend it) and I was like, ""Yeah, go watch that and take notes on what a romance movie should look like!!"" period of time to develop so I felt in the know this time.

Will they end this anime with this disappointing ending?Then after I thought about it for a few minutes, and couldn\'t find a way out, disappointment came over meThe one hour duration of this anime doesn\'t have a story that matters. What\'s in this anime is just nonsenseThis anime only tells about a cowardly men and women because they don\'t dare to express their love for the person they like because they are afraid that their relationship with the person they like...will be awkward if their love confession is rejected.I mean that kind of thing is a risk you have to take if you want to confess your love to someone. If you are not ready to accept the risk then you must be determined to forget your love and don\'t feel pain. Seeing something annoying like this from the beginning to the end of the story makes me very disappointedAnother thing that confuses me is why the love story of Setoguchi Yuu (Setoguchi Hina\'s older brother) and Enomoto Natsuki (Enomoto Kotarou\'s older sister) who are side characters can dominate more than the main character\'s love story.The role of the two of them as side characters and as an older brother and sister should be to help the main character (their younger brother and sister) to get what they want. But in fact they are happier and these two side characters dominate the story more than the main characterThe only good thing about this anime is the animation and songs by chico with honeyworks.

The characters are very loveable, the art style is nice and easy on the eyes. It's a good movie to watch when you want to relax and feel emotions while unstressing.However, the ending was extremely disappointing. You don't feel much real closure and it almost feels like the movie was a waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. But it almost feels like I read a book and threw it away when I got to the climax.The actual storyline it follows is pretty normal, but involves...some pretty endearing characters. Sometimes, you won't know who you're rooting for. There were times where I was pretty unclear on people's relationships or why a character would do a certain thing, but otherwise it's easy to follow and all and all a good story. Minus the ending.The art style is right up my ally. Not much to say about it, but it's pleasing to me.The music is nice and puts me in a happy mood, even when feeling sad emotions with the characters.

Besides your typical animal spheal, you see relationships between characters similar to some you'd see in real life in my opinion. Even side characters feel important and you get a good understanding of how the characters are with people for the most part.Over all, I enjoyed the movie. It was cute and a lot of fun to watch, but I wish they'd put another fifteen-thirty minutes in past where it ends. It doesn't feel finished-- it almost feels like they got that far writing, didn't know what to do, and decided it was done.

And that part should be put outside of reviews/scores for obvious reasons but I won't do it since that's what worked for me here.It's easy to get the main points in this romance but for me the one standing out would be that the time that you pass with other people don't have the same meaning for both and the result is that for one can be like a normal friendship but in the mind of other...person they could see every single talk/moment like the most romantic thing that can happen. And if you've been in the same situation you will just want to punch a wall next to you since you learned the hard way and you root for her to not fall in the same problem.Could be way more worked all situation in itself but the movie don't get complex, it's very direct, and I've to praise it for that.

This makes the movie very far from big productions or those fascinating moments that will stay in your mind for years but in the end it's a story that's well written and I think deserves her little spot in the market.The ending couldn't be other given the situation so I can understand the complain about missing buildup but not on that point since the story would need a love creation and was not needed since we understand very well the future given to the chars (still the post credits scene it's adorable).I'm surprised to find out it was released in cinema since the art quality it's just your normal anime and takes 1h, looks more those movies released on Fox (tv movies).

The movie's story was moving enough, just enough, but man, it really deserved a longer play time or something...Even though I said heartbreaks are not bad, this one was not too well executed.Not too much more to say.

If you saw the first one you are going to see some of the characters from that movie, which is pretty nice. Its a pretty cute movie, but is just a simple movie.[ART & ANIMATION]The art of this anime is pretty cute but sometimes it seems weird, mostly because of their faces and eyes. There is something off with them that I find unpleasant and weird. In the other hand,...the character design is pretty good, I like their school uniforms and I didn't seem to hate or love the way their bodies are constructed. The background was nice and simple, almost seen in a lot of amines. Personally, I didn't enjoy the art mostly because of the unpleasant design for the eyes and faces, but I don’t think is that bad. The animation seems some kind of stuck in some frames and it doesn't seem smooth, at least they don't seem unproportioned or doing weird maneuvers. The animation is passable. 6/10[SOUND]The sound used in general was good, I like the VA and could recognize some of them. The VA work is pretty good and every voice I could fit with their characters. The music that the choose is pretty nice to listen to, and they can fit the emotion that the situation transmits. I didn't have any problems with it, and I'm actually looking forward to searching the songs and listening them in my free time. 7/10[STORY]This were I have the most problems with in general with this anime. First, I have to say that in general the story is intriguing and I personally like romance and drama anime, and this anime touches the story pretty good and in a cute way. The thing is that it introduces a lot of characters in so little time to actually care about all of them. Also, the anime tries to build a story, a lot of times, where it doesn't need to be, and it leaves stories incomplete. This also happens in the first movie so don't be surprised. The story seems to be rushed and they tried to develop more story that they actually can fit in the time they have. I believe that ending (after the credits) seemed force, so It can leave a happy ending to the viewer, but I honestly didn't like that force ending. 5/10[CONCLUSION]In general, I did like the anime but it had a lot of problems that it can improve. I recommend watching this movie for people that like shoujo anime, like me, and they don't have anything to do. It's a pretty normal anime, that is a cute bland anime to pass the time.

It\'s also about  FAILURE, PERSEVERANCE, PAIN and how you can stand up to it and move on. LOVE isn\'t always perfect with ""I\'ve...always loved you"" ... "" I love you too"", I guess most shoujo anime wouldn\'t really go for that type of story because they\'d make it as lovey-dovey as possible.

While I found this to be good, I can see it's a bad thing for the viewer who haven't watched...the first movie. The story goes slow at first and then it's steadily getting faster towards the end, because it's constrained by the duration of a movie. The characters in this anime are mostly useless except the 2 main characters, because the supporting characters did not explored at all, only introduced once and done, even though they have some potential for their own story. There's no plot holes as far as I know, the only thing annoyed me is the fact that the story is so predictable that it's bound to get boring at some point.The arts are beautiful it's so vibrant and just screams bittersweet love life of a teenager. The character designs, their clothing, the details of the rooms and buildings, it's of a high quality. The animation though, not so much, not like I expected much from this kind of genre, but I do hope they improve it a bit compared to the previous movie. It's still the same stuff with before, not that it's bad, it's just so average, that it's weird that it's paired with the amazing visuals.The audio are simply superb, with a stable performance from the seiyuus, each characters got their own charms and life easily (even though they didn't explored beyond the introduction stuff). I don't think anyone can find fault with Honeyworks doing the OST for this genre of anime, since it's like their very brand, the lyrics, the melody, and the overall feels they conveyed are just right on point.Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-Great continuation of the first movie-Great songs from Honeyworks as usual-Cute heartwarming romance storyReasons NOT to watch:-A bad standalone movie, need to watch the first one to get the feel-An average visual the first movie.

An example would be the Si family and Kou family young master on the island, instead of explaining the misunderstanding when Nie Feng defeats both he waits until the Si family escalates the missing young masters to Kou family before he intervenes after cultivating with Yuanling crystals. There is so much meaningless development that could be avoided and further new experiences that spring up as a result of Nie Feng's decision affecting the future but the story dwells on the past experiences too much. Overall, the story is very repetitive and becomes uninteresting because of the lack of new experiences breaking the endless cycle of noble family and disciple drama. Characters are thrown around too easily and it seems like they only exist to fill the dialogue between action; When it comes to action they are disposed of to make way for Nie Feng's character development. This becomes a common occurrence especially when it comes to opposing characters of the Si, Kou, Qinghe and Cheng families where the young masters are slowly culled to pave the way of cultivation for Nie Feng. The only interesting characters and meaningful interactions were toward the end with the chamber of commerce and Meng family female elder. This is where Nie Feng meets his past life love interest but yet again the development is superficial because it's so late in the series that we don't have any emotional entanglement with any of the important characters.Art & Sound: 3/10The art and animation are poor for the release period. The character rigging is rough so the fight scenes feel unnatural and jarring to watch; It doesn't help that there isn't any proper physics and characters can fly around or jump across without any inertial forces. The character design is not bad but the detail in skin, hair and costume leave a lot to be desired. The backgrounds and ambient lighting is poor with low detail and density in the background of many scenes. Art is definitely not this series strong points.Sound is a miss in my opinion. The voice acting is poor quality and they try their best to make the sound as immersive as possible by mimicking the environment the characters are in (an example they try to replicate reverb from characters speaking in caves/underground chambers but it just sounds like a cheap filter) The music isn't special and they don't make use of theme songs in hero sequences for emotional impact. Sound effects are a miss too, overall sound design could definitely be improved.Overall & Enjoyment: 3/10I previously rated this series a 6/10 after 4 episode but I revoke my old rating. This series is well deserving of a 3/10 because there is nothing special that occurs in the series apart from constant familial fights and drama. Nie Feng is always belittled as the Nie family's cripple and there is apparently no news that he became a transcendental-esque master at the age of 17 which makes many unseen enemies attack him. or will he fall behind?Story & Characters: 5/10The Peak of True Martial Arts is your typical regression style series where the main character returns to the past with their memories intact and tries to fix the problems that plagued their previous life. Nie Feng is focused entirely on the prosperity of the Nie Family and he does this by defeating enemies that covet their resources, manpower and status. However, after a certain point Nie Feng's involvement against opposing noble families always ends before they get assistance from external parties which leads to an endless spiral of fighting and unfulfilled destruction.

Aishen Qiaokeli-ing...II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36848/Aishen_Qiaokeli-ingII,"['Seeing as there is no review for the second season, I felt it obligatory to write one.  I am doing so on a shoddy laptop, so forgive me for any grammatical errors.The second season continues where the last left off.  I will admit that the final girl shown causes a little confusion as to how she was doing what she was doing at the end of the first season, considering her position in the second, but it is a harem anime about magic, so I got over it.  The biggest difference between the first season and the second is probably the tone....The first is a little more slapstick (despite having some serious situations), but the second immediately gets heavy, but in a good way.What separates this from just another harem anime is the way Jiang handles himself and the situations around him.  Despite slightly lacking subs, I am constantly waiting for the next episode.  Hao Yi is not only relatable, but intelligent and hard-working (when he chooses to be) as well.  I get so fed up with the same character tropes in harem animes, especially for the main protagonist!  The girls all have unique personalities and their own quirks and less than ideal situations of their own that leads to interesting viewing.  There are many things to praise this anime on, and in my opinion, not too much to be overly critical about.Add the fact that this is a Chinese anime, and it gains more appeal, personally.  I enjoy hearing the different names, accents, and language compared to the rather stale, ubiquitous Japanese voice acting and dialogue.If you have seen the first season and are even remotely questioning seeing this one, please do give it a watch.  If you liked the first even a little you surely will like the second just as much if not much more (like myself).

And while it kept the “freshness” resulting (probably) from being chinese anime, I’m generally disappointed.I felt like this season was considerably weaker than previous one. Without going into overly detailed comparison, I’ll just focus on the most noticeable points, both good and bad:Bad drama. Too much and too over the top. Villains were just cheap and cheesy. I actually liked how girls problems were shown and solved in first season, but here it wasn’t fun to watch.Useless and forgotten elements in story. Without spoiling too much, I mean...things like Hayoi’s arm being broken at the very beginning just to be perfectly healthy a scene later, or two new characters introduced and doing some stuff that never led to any consequences. While the latter might be a setup for sequel, it doesn’t excuse the way it was executed.Good harem members interactions. What I mean here is that, the dynamics between girls change and they notice others and their feelings. Too many harems (especially visible in VN adaptations that mix routes) fail at this and reduce girls’ interactions only to comedic bickering.Characters’ main selling points were ignored for the most part, wasting a lot of their screen time. Old cast (Zitong being main offender) got too much focus, despite not getting any real development.Overall anime kept some of the things I liked, but general quality of story feels much lower.When it comes to art/music, it also doesn’t look that great. Or rather it “looks” pretty bad.Animation had a lot of bad moments. Characters walking as a static element just jumping up and down and moving through screen. Hentai-level movement details. Reused scenes. Yeah, it looked cheap.Overuse of special effects to hide flaws in art. Sparkles, leaves flying through whole screen and such. They sure are pretty, but sometimes it just got too sparkly.And what’s up with their clothes? I understand character design, but seeing them having same outfit in every situation, especially considering how unusual they are, looks really out of place.Music used during some scenes worked really well. I love when anime changes BGM to fit tone of a scene.What music is missing, is variety. We got a singer heroine, but all her singing is just “la la la” and when she finally gets to sing it’s… opening song. Pretty disappointing. And why all of them have the same ringtone?It might look like I’m just complaining and throw in some positives here and there. Don’t misunderstand. It’s still a fun anime and absolutely worth watching if you liked first season. The above are just my observations as a fan of harem anime who also happened to have soft spot for this specific title. things like Hayoi’s arm being broken at the very beginning just to be perfectly healthy a scene later, or two new characters introduced and doing some stuff that never led to any consequences.

Fanservice is only limited to Zitong, swimsuit fanservice, only in the 1st episode only on a one time shot and it wasn\'t on the frequent basis. Also, the illustration of the characters since they\'re not in high school uniforms kinda accentuate the characters personality, like Zitong\'s outfit that makes her this  lady of class that serves as wife material or an ideal girlfriend of  such gentleness and of refine stature. Tang Xuan a tomboy whose girly side is hidden by her aggressiveness,  Xueli Ouyang a typical goth loli with a very dark side that one should avoid at all cost, Lin Yang who personifies as this typical girl Xueba  which is Chinese for nerd who is your everyday girl whom would serves as your wife who will serve you as her husband and make babies with.Good 7, Sound:I\'ve rated it a 7 cu\'z it ain\'t everyday that we get to watch an anime like this were the seiyu\'s were Chinese. And not to mention the opening theme Aishen Qiaokeli Jinxing Shi (爱神巧克力进行时)"" by Wu Jiaying that kinda give one\'s anime viewing a whole new light.Poor 3, Character:Ok , tbh I really hate it when producers Tencent Animation and BiliBili decided to alter the main character Jian Haoyi\'s backstory in fact his character varies from the web manga to the 1st season to the sequel , you see in the web manga, he is a tsundere there who hangs out with his fellow high school classmates , in the 1st season he is this Xeuba  who doesn\'t like trouble in fact he does avoids contact with anyone and btw in the 1st season the setting was in high school thought the students there wear no standard high school uniform......ok so back to Jiang Haoyi, in the web manga there isn\'t any mention of his parents line of work, in season 1 his father is a salary man while his mother is a housewife, in season 2 his both his parents were working in law enforcement. But in both the Web Manga and in the sequel is shown that he lives alone and his parents were busy with their jobs   as if they work 24/7 which is quite ridiculous to even think about it  when in the 1st season he doesn\'t live alone, but  the thing that was constant about Jiang Haoyi was that he can fight when push comes to shove, he has a watcahmacllit special relationship with a MILF Miss Jie and that he is indeed a Xueba and that he really did give way for Xueli to be on top on when she was still sane...sort of, and that he has a friend Zeng Dong, those were the only thing that Tencent animation and BiliBili hasn\'t change. About the girls, in the web manga they\'re portrayed as high schoolers and so as in the 1st season but n the character lvel most still maintains their characters like  Zitong Xia, Tang Xuan, and Lin Yang still maintains their character. However Xueli Ouyang , though she still maintains her character in the web manga up to the 1st season , here in this sequelm we het to see her backstory as how she becomes this obsess psychopath whose weakness and fear is a certain Du Yuze who happens to be her Xenzhang or Sempai in Japanese, way back when she is trying to make Haoyi jealous but instead things turned ugly for her when she was dump on site and in front of everyone. And in this sequel we see two new addtion to Jian Hoayi\'s harem, one is Sandy who is not in both season 1 and in the web Manga and  Ling Xiaotu who competes his harem as a loli element. Of course let\'s not forget Mea Tata and her backstory, in the web manga and in the 1st season we only knew her as this bungling cupid who somehow is partly responsible for Hoayi\'s predicament and now we knew that she admire the president of the candy factory in heaven and that she has this fellow cupid who is in love with her , but much to his chagrin, she doesn\'t like him, but her backstory ends early without us even knowing as to what happen to that cupid that was chasing Mea Tata and that head Cupid in heaven, I guess will know in season 3 cu\'z there were indications that there will be.Good 7, Enjoyment:Let\'s face it watching this chinese anime for a change was something else, and this was probably the best one there is which runs for at least 13 or 15 mins long, and even if the genre were the usual, it wasn\'t always we get to see something different this time around.Good 7, Overall :I guess by Chinese standards this is as good as it gets, it maybe the usual but then again any time soon we\'ll be enjoying watching such Chinese anime  soon the same way we enjoy watching Jap anime........谢谢你们所有人希望看另一个续集, another season???? why not.这就是所有人 of plot where two or more women or men would compete for one person on the romantic level.Good 7, Art:Ok, so here the setting is in College, so it was pretty much good that this doesn\'t follow that quintessential  school uniform, in fact the school uniform is only , limited to this anime\'s web manga version.

Yuan is one of the many female leads honestly to describe her she pretty laid back and just pretty cheerful only real things that i can really say about her but she is a good character. Tata is another female lead and well she is a spirit or a magical person who follows Hayoi around (also no one can see her just him) cause of the cupid's chocolate is the reason why she follows him around to describe her i mean she is pretty nice but she can get annoying to Hayoi at times otherwise i did like her. Xueli is another female lead and well shes the only person who in fact didn't eat the cupid's chocolate she always loved Haoyi at first she wasn't always like that to hayoi they were always rivals but childhood friends at the same time but as time grew she began to love Hayoi and see well became a yandere cause of her change in attitude to describe her well she is a yandere always wanting to be with him again loved her character (im a fan of the yandere type to be honest). Xuan is another female lead and she can become kinda bossy and a push around hayoi but always has the soft spot for him she also cosplay's as well she is kinda a pushy one to describe her she can be nice but she kinda is a Tsundere in that sense. Xia is the last female lead and well she is the first person who ends up meeting Haoyi in the anime not really having friends she really likes Haoyi cause of it she is a really happy and go lucky person and is again is just a really nice person all around. (pretty much copied and pasted my review of the characters from the 1st season sense they basically act the same here) Sandy is the last character her and she is a singer and or pop start and she also ate cupids chocolate and and she likes haoyi she is pretty much a happy girl overall and a sweet one as well.Enjoyment: What i liked: i personally like the anime for the comedy and for all the characters being here and for the art to the music being really well done and also for the tense moments being actually really well done here. What i didn't like: the comedy is here and there so which is kinda disappointing but not a bad thing also you think Sandy might be in the anime a lot RIGHT wrong she is barely in the anime expect for 1-3 and also a little bit of 14 and that's it like ok then why have her has a character to being with like shes more of side character to me if anything those are my only real complaints well maybe the Ed as for me not liking it as well.Overall: ill give this a 7 (might change it to a 8 honestly but will see) as for the anime while the comedy is here and there the comedy does it job pretty well actually and all the characters being here is a damn good thing as well i personally liked season 1 maybe just a little bit more than season 2 but this season was actually pretty good maybe it was a tiny or a little disappointing but again loved this season so i wouldn't call it a bad second season or anything like that this season was still pretty darn good for me i would recommend it for sure also a 3rd season might becoming as well for how it ended so i cant wait for that whenever it comes. feeling for Hayoi that's pretty much what you in a sense get for the story (kind a bummer but still the story is decent)Art: will say the art is really good from the background to the character design and so one they did really good job this time around with everything in it.Sound: The Op i actually liked in the second as for the Ed eh personally i wasn't a fan of it but oh well as for the voice actors cant say anything else expect they were really damn good here.Character: Hayoi is the main male character and well has his harem but hes honestly not a scaredy cat (sometimes he is but not all the time) when it comes to it he knows when to handle certain things which i liked this dude for a good main male character.

I watched the first episode but I started it again 5 years later. So here is my breakdown of both seasons.S1 Story: 8/10For an Ecchi Harem anime, the plot is executed quite well and I thought the concept was unique. It caught me off guard that it also included a lot of drama. There was a lot of dilemmas and the story rarely felt like...it slowed down. However, there were a few problems, for example in the first episode he claims he had never talked to Zitong yet in a flashback he is handing the cake to the main girls, all in the same room, which is impossible because later on in the anime the girls interact between each other as if they had met each other for the first time. Another contradiction is that the MC says he's something along the lines of a boring average student who will become a bin man or something. Yet we learn that he is well trained in kung-fu, the smartest student in the school and has a very strong moral compass. My favourite arc in the whole anime was the Lin Yuan arc. Fuck me that ending made me tear up.S2 Story: 4/10Similar problems to S1 except the MC feels like a complete Gary Stu now and there are more inconsistencies in the story. What else didn't help is that Lin Yuan, Tang Xuan and Mei Tata got way less screen time in exchange for Zitong (who did basically nothing during that screentime), Xueli (who I don't mind because she's best girl and actually has decent character development) and the new character Sandy. I did not give a shit about Sandy or her arc and she just felt like she was shoehorned at the last minute. Her personality is non-existant and her arc is just BORING. It had some good moments but it just felt like S2 was trying to be too many genres at one time. Also it got old how the MC would find the girls father (or father figure) and teach them a lesson with some good old words (that don't vary with any of the dads).Sound: 6/10 (combining both seasons here)When talking about sound as in voice acting and sound quality, this is what almost turned me off this show. Despite looking like the show had quite a big budget the mic quality was probably the same as OVAs from tiny studios. As for the actual voice acting, it was serviceable, but most of the time the tone was melodramatic when it shouldn't have been.Now onto the music perspective. The opening and ending music and animation is one of the lowest budget OP and EDs I have ever seen, most of it is static images and the first season didn't even have lyrics in the opening. As for the actual soundtrack in the show, I'm pretty sure it was all royalty free but where the music was placed fitted well in my opinion.S1 Characters: 7/10As I mentioned before, I loved Lin Yuan's arc and the characters involved in it. It really portrayed the MC in a wholesome light that didn't seem superficial. Zitong at the beginning was pretty nice but she eventually got more bland. Tang Xuan was your typical big-breasted tsundere who I grew to enjoy in her arc but sometimes afterwards It seemed as if that had never occurred and she went back to her tsundere self. Xueli barely had any screen time and Mei was alrightS2 Characters: 3/10My god what a colossal fuck-up. To avoid repeating myself, i'll put it simple. Every character had either shit character development or no development at all. Especially Sandy, and the MC's cousin that appeared for like the last 2 episode and did nothing of note. I'm guessing this means that they're planning on a season 3 sometime soon as I don't see why they would just introduce a love interest for 2 episodesS1 Art: 8/10I was actually really impressed at the artstyle and animation of the first few episodes, The animation was smooth and vibrant with colour. Not really much else to sayS2 Art: 5/10The art and animation got noticeably more simple and jankier as the series went on. They used less flowing animation and they reused old backgrounds a lot more. The art was still fine, but it was no way near the standard the first season set.Enjoyment (Overall): 8/10It was easy to watch and was quite funny but also did have its sad moments. It's easy to binge both seasons.S1 Overall: 8/10S2 Overall: 5/10Conclusion: If you have watched the first season but haven't watched the second, you won't lose any sleep not watching the second season. Unless they announce season 3. Personally I would just not watch S2 or skim watch it it slowed down. However, there were a few problems, for example in the first episode he claims he had never talked to Zitong yet in a flashback he is handing the cake to the main girls, all in the same room, which is impossible because later on in the anime the girls interact between each other as if they had met each other for the first time. Another contradiction is that the MC says he's something along the lines of a boring average student who will become a bin man or something. Yet we learn that he is well trained in kung-fu, the smartest student in the school and has a very strong moral compass. My favourite arc in the whole anime was the Lin Yuan arc. Fuck me that ending made me tear up.S2 Story: 4/10Similar problems to S1 except the MC feels like a complete Gary Stu now and there are more inconsistencies in the story. What else didn't help is that Lin Yuan, Tang Xuan and Mei Tata got way less screen time in exchange for Zitong (who did basically nothing during that screentime), Xueli (who I don't mind because she's best girl and actually has decent character development) and the new character Sandy. I did not give a shit about Sandy or her arc and she just felt like she was shoehorned at the last minute. Her personality is non-existant and her arc is just BORING. It had some good moments but it just felt like S2 was trying to be too many genres at one time. Also it got old how the MC would find the girls father (or father figure) and teach them a lesson with some good old words (that don't vary with any of the dads).Sound: 6/10 (combining both seasons here)When talking about sound as in voice acting and sound quality, this is what almost turned me off this show. Despite looking like the show had quite a big budget the mic quality was probably the same as OVAs from tiny studios. As for the actual voice acting, it was serviceable, but most of the time the tone was melodramatic when it shouldn't have been.Now onto the music perspective. The opening and ending music and animation is one of the lowest budget OP and EDs I have ever seen, most of it is static images and the first season didn't even have lyrics in the opening.

Mainly in the technical part. The script part was good only the animated part and the audio part were terrible. But all 3 areas have improved a lot. It's easy to get emotional and let tears fall at times, mainly because the direction is also very appealing with the characters crying and tearing like a small child (a common cinematography technique guided by the visual contagion effect), but the situations imposed are very emotional same. It wasn't just a comedy anime, they changed a lot the humor...and drama of the anime. They made it much more tense with a much deeper plot, but all the dramatic arcs of the main and addressed characters are very well written. So, that being said, I highly recommend this anime. Too bad to get to the second season, you have to watch the first one, which is practically the first arc of the work. Anyway. Note 8. and drama of the anime.

I know people who enjoy this but I\'m just not feeling it, let me explain. Or try.Meet male character. Male is easily flustered. Male accidentally gropes woman. Male has tons of women who find interest in him. Male wakes up with VIOLENT MAGIC FEMALE #7281 in bed. Male freaks out. VIOLENT MAGIC FEMALE #7281 attacks male. I\'d call her a tsundere but she hasn\'t said the standard legal amount of ""baka"" for her to count so I guess she\'s a revolution in character design. She doesn\'t wear panties. There\'s a plot by the way. Blah, blah blah. Ghosts. Done....This show is also revolutionary in the sense that there\'s a female character who gets just as flustered and overreacts in just about the same way as main male character. She hits people constantly with a paper fan because slapstick is funny. That was the best part of the show I think. It was all a blur.The animation quality is pretty good with plenty of movement and expression. It\'s the best part. The music can also stand out at times, which is nice. But the characters are so cliché and empty that it\'s hard to care about any of this. Sure there\'s action, sure there\'s all the girls you could ever want. All sorts of flavors of woman show up.

Everyone seems to enjoy it more than me except for the few that didn\'t. 5/10', 'Tsugumomo which is adapted from the manga of the same name is an interesting anime that has a rather unique premise and story behind it. Very few anime these days actually have names that relate to the subject matter of the anime itself and in this case Tsugumomo is probably the first example I actually seen. Tsugumomo which is something that actually exists within Japanese traditional legend are essentially objects that after long years of use and cherishment by its owners have gained sentience and their own bodies and through the use of magic spiritual abilities. Tsugumomo combines this premise with a traditional exorcist storyline...that works similarly to the likes of Twin stars exorcist which pairs the Tsugumomo with someone that has with a bond with the Tsugumomo thus creating a team that can be used to deal with hostile enemies that have been possessed by evil miasma.Story and settingThe main story for Tsugumomo largely takes place within the town of Kamioka and the surrounding areas and takes place in the modern time period. The story follows the life of Kazuya Kagami a normal high school student that one day is confronted with the fact that the obi that he had inherited from his mother had somehow become sentient and thus introducing him to the world of Tsugumomo’s and malison cleansing. The story behind Tsugumomo is essentially a fusion of comedy and action that is derived from both the everyday lives of Kazuya and his duties as a malison cleanser.The unique nature and setting for this series story means that apart from having a rather unique story and setting it also has many interesting enemy types that are tied with the theme itself. With the enemy’s in this series I liked the fact that in going with the theme they tend to revolve around the target’s inner desires which also affect how powerful they can be. One of the things that are present in each episode that I particularly like is a short introduction of the enemy type that is to be featured in each episode. I thought that these were informative and useful to the viewer.KazuyaKazuya voiced by veteran seiyuu Yuuko Sanpei of Boruto Naruto Next Generations and 3 Gatsu no lion fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. In the beginning of the series Kazuya was an average teenage boy that attends the local high school. In the beginning Kazuya as a person did not have much personality traits that made him really stand out. In the beginning of the series Kazuya’s chief personality traits was that he was honest, understanding and kind hearted but tended to get scared easily. These starting traits of his though weren’t completely removed as the series went on but stayed and were improved upon as the series went on. As the series progresses Kazuya as a person also starts to improve thanks to the challenges that he and Kiriha overcome as well as the results of the bonds that he forms with people that he helped. Because of these improvements Kazuya becomes more dependable as he comes to understand the role that was given to him and more determined to help those that need his help. More importantly because of his new-found determination Kazuya also become much more brave and willing to take a stand against a terrifying opponent and end it there before it can hurt anyone else.Kazuya’s defining trait is without a doubt his kindness as though his role as a malison cleanser means that he will have to deal with hostile creatures that are born from evil malison such as the various types of Amasogi Kazuya always tries to understand the reason that they were formed from and understand what led to them being formed. This trait of trying to understand the reason behind how they were formed puts him in good stead as though he must deal with them eventually Kazuya at least tries to understand them and determine what the reason behind them was before exorcising them. This trait of trying to understand your foes I felt was nice to see.The bond that Kazuya shares with his partner Kiriha is without a doubt one of the center pieces of the series. In the beginning of the series we can see that though Kazuya was grateful to Kiriha for saving his life that he didn’t fully trust her and indeed did not really know who she was other than the fact that she had materialized from his mother’s obi. At this point Kazuya often finds himself being abused and taking advantage of by Kiriha who takes advantage of his kind and honest personality. Often Kazuya is forced by Kiriha to serve her by getting things for her. Though their bond started off on a wrong foot as the series progresses however the trust that Kazuya and Kiriha develop with each other starts to manifest more with Kiriha more willing to listen to him. Though still lording over him a result of the trust that the two have built up means that both Kiriha and Kazuya have developed a partnership between the two that shows how much they care for each other. Notably in later parts of the series Kazuya tries to ensure that he doesn’t use Kiriha’s true self in his attacks as this will affect her life.In overall, I felt that the character of Kazuya was a well-rounded character that was well designed. Though at first, he was a rather average character with few distinguishing characteristics I felt that the character development for him was well done and seeing the character gradually transform from an average Joe to someone that has both conviction in his duties and compassion and understanding that enables him to understand the events that led to a amasogi’s formation. I felt that his seiyuu Yuuko Sanpei really did a great job portraying the character of Kazuya.KirihaKiriha voiced by veteran seiyuu Naomi Oozora is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main heroine. A veteran Tsugumomo that has lived for a long time Kiriha is the manifestation of Kazuya’s mother’s obi and had previously served her. A feisty and mischievous young woman that’s boastful and has a lot of self-confidence Kiriha has a personality that can be said to be a direct contrast to the one that Kazuya has. In addition to being feisty and mischievous in the beginning of the series Kiriha also had a rather self-centered personality that when combined with her feisty nature really made her hard to deal with for Kazuya as he often become victims of her impulsive nature. However though lazy and slothful when she’s at home when dealing with hostile forces Kiriha adapts a more serious nature that’s more serious, cautious and focused on dealing with the enemy using the best way possible. Similar to Kazuya Kiriha is one that doesn’t like to destroy Amasogi entirely proving that she too detests mindless destruction if it can be avoided.Kiriha has a number of running gags within the series that help define her character. Firstly, is Kiriha’s love of fooling around with others that comes from her teasing nature. Although not harmful these episodes of fooling around which most often targets Kukuri is a sign of the trust that she has in the people that she teases though this is something that she wouldn’t like to be found out. The other running gag of the series regarding Kiriha is her love of pudding and her desire to have one every day. When she doesn’t for some reason get what she wants Kiriha tends to be more impulsive than usual with a notable exception when she created a song for not getting one.Kiriha’s bond with her master is one of the main aspects of this series and also serves as a means for her development as a character. In the beginning Kiriha did not really have a high opinion of Kazuya both as a person and as a fighter. As a result, she often treated him harshly and in turn created a sort of master slave relationship that only she believed in. As the series progresses however and as Kiriha sees how determined Kazuya has become in becoming a malison cleanser her attitude towards him changes and she begins not just advising him on the various Amasogi that he must face but also in training him as well. By the end of the series Kiriha’s trust in Kazuya has become strong and that she really respects the strength that he has developed over the series. I felt that Kiriha as a character was a pretty well-designed and that her seiyuu Naomi Oozora really did a great job portraying her.KukuriKukuri voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of Urara and High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Kazuya and Kiriha’s allies. The goddess that is charged with watching over the area that Kazuya and Kiriha and their allies live in Kukuri is a contrast to Kiriha’s feisty personality in that she is a friendly young woman that however has a tendency of being overly proud of her status as a god. At the same time, she is also rather dutiful and serious about her duties as well. Kukuri’s most prominent trait is no doubt her humble nature as despite her status as a god she never looks down on people and always treat people with respect whether they are fellow gods, humans or Tsugumomo like Kiriha. Kukuri is also very diligent and willing to help in performing small tasks which is also another contrast with Kiriha’s lazy nature. Like Kiriha Kukuri also has a running gag within the series with her being not being taken seriously by others despite her status as a god. This little byplay is most often seen when she’s with Kiriha and is always a funny thing to see.The character of Kukuri i felt was an interesting character and was perhaps the last image that I had when picturing a god. The byplay between her and Kiriha was funny every time I see it and her humble and diligent nature actually made her pretty cute. I felt that her seiyuu Yurika Kubo really did a great job voicing her. a notable trait of Kukuri is the fact that she speaks in an accent that’s very peculiar and uses words not often seen in conventional Japanese. This serves to make her even more charming though.ChisatoChisato voiced by new seiyuu Noriko Shibasaki is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kazuya’s allies within the series. A childhood friend of Kazuya’s Chisato is also the class rep for the class that Kazuya is in and as such is often the one that chides him when he’s distracted by something. A cheerful, upbeat and positive person that’s also kind and caring it can be seen quite easily that Chisato cares a great deal about Kazuya. As a result, her first meeting with Kiriha was a nasty shock to her as she now must contend with her for Kazuya’s attention. Despite that as the series progresses their relationship soon turned to respect instead. Though a mere human being when compared to the likes of Kukuri and Kiriha Chisato like her fellow human ally Osamu can assist Kazuya by using their intelligence and reasoning to help determine things that he might have missed. Though only a support character I felt that for her first role Noriko Shibasaki actually did a pretty good job of portraying the character of Chisato and I hope that she will continue to improve her skills and get more roles and establish her career.SunaoSunao voiced by veteran seiyuu You Taichi is one of the main support characters of the series and is a plot central character for the latter part of the series. A fellow malison cleanser like Kazuya Sunao is a confident, determined and passionate person who unlike Kazuya wanted to become a malison cleanser by choice. Apart from her desire to become a malison cleanser what really sets Sunao apart from Kazuya is how she perceives the Tsugumomo. Unlike Kazuya who sees tsugumomo’s as partners and treats them as such Sunao however sees them as nothing but tools that should only act when she commands them to and not be treated as anything else. In a way, the contest that erupts between the two is as much as a contest of strength and techniques and one that pits their perception and views of Tsugumomo. In a way Sunao really isn’t really a bad guy in truth but they were forced to be on opposing sides because of their vastly different views regarding Tsugumomo and how they should be treated and used. Unlike Kazuya whose role as a malison cleanser was forced on to him Sunao willingly accepted her role as one and as such her abilities as one far outstrips Kazuya’s skills.Never less seeing Sunao go up against Kazuya and seeing them go straight out against each other was interesting as was seeing the techniques that she used which is very different to how Kazuya usually fights.  I felt that Sunao as a character was a well-designed one and introducing a character that was like Kazuya but views Tsugumomo differently was a good move. The clash of both ideology and might between the two I felt was nicely done as it highlighted the strong bond that Kiriha and Kazuya have forged over the battles that they have been through and proves that friendship and trust can beat even people that are more powerful that you are.Arts and animationArts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good. The character designs for the characters I felt were done pretty well and was largely faithful to their counterparts in the manga. The various environments that the cast fight in was also well detailed. The animation for the series I felt was pretty good with the fight scenes between the various types of Amasogi being of high quality. However, I felt that the final dual that took place in the anime had the best animation in its fight scenes though compared to earlier battles.MusicThe music for the series I felt was reasonably good in regard to both the scene music and the opening and ending themes. The combat scenes in particular had some pretty good scene music that changed depending on the battle is going and I felt that this was well designed. The opening theme for the series which in this case was METAMORISER by Band Ja Naimon I felt was pretty catchy and helped convey the comedic side of this series which is helped by the visuals that is shown during the opening song. This is contrasted by the ending theme which is I4U which is sung by veteran singer Michi that seems to convey the bonds and friendships that Kazuya has formed with his friends and allies. Of the two I would say that the ending theme was actually one of my favorites because of the message that it conveyed and the visuals that were used there.Voice actingThe Voice acting for the series I felt was pretty good with particular praise going to Naomi Oozora and Yurika Kubo who voiced the characters of Kiriha and Kukuri who I felt did a great job portraying their characters and making them stand out. Other seiyuu that I felt also did a great job was Noriko Shibasaki who despite her thin role managed to portray the character of Chisato reasonably well. One seiyuu that really surprised me in this series was You Taichi who voiced the character of Sunao. Though I have heard her voice before most notably in Owari no seraph in which she had a minor support role her performance here I felt was excellent as she managed to portray the character that she had been assigned to here pretty well. Indeed, after Kazuya and Kukuri Sunao is my third favourite character which is largely due to her hard work.Overall conclusionIn overall, I felt that Tsugumomo was an interesting anime that’s main advantage was the fact that it had an interesting theme, story, characters, fight scenes and capable voice acting from a young voice cast. The theme of the series which is actually derived from a commonly held belief that states that if you treat an object with care over a period of years that it will eventually gain sentience. This theme itself I felt was pretty interesting and served to only enhance this series and make it more interesting. The overall story of Tsugumomo can be said to be a fusion of a comedy and an action anime and in this I felt that it succeeded as the series itself had plenty of good comedic moments as it has in good fights. The overall story I felt was reasonably interesting and seeing how Kazuya and Kiriha grow in power as they forge a bond that is formed from executing their duties of clearing malison from their area of operations and confront increasingly powerful enemies was really enjoyable. Though the series itself did make use of a villain of the week troupe that is most often seen in tv shows each of the enemy types that was featured in the series apart from having great fight scenes where they were exorcised also features a period where the cast investigates the nature of the enemy which in this case is often a Amasogi and from there determine what was the true reason that caused it to form. This aspect of finding an aberration and then trying to determine the reasons that caused them to form before ultimately fighting them after understanding the reasons for their formation I though was well done and gave the impression that malison cleansers are not just heartless exorcists that only live to exorcise Amasogi without trying to understand the circumstances of their formation.Of course, without a good cast of characters in the series this anime wouldn’t go far even with a great story but in this I felt that the series also did well in. The main character of Kazuya though a rather average person at the start of the series was developed pretty well as the series went on and seeing him forge a strong bond with the main heroine Kiriha and seeing them both increase in power was something that I liked seeing. Seeing and understanding the motivation for Kazuya’s actions and seeing how determined he is with is line of thinking was also something that I appreciated. Though he obviously didn’t want to take up the mantle of becoming a cleanser at first it was nice to see him eventually grow to like the role and also develop the understanding that Tsugumomo are not merely tools to be used in battle like weapons but are living things that have their own personalities like that of a human and should be treated with the same amount of respect. The character of Sunao though a support character also had a large role within the series and was a pretty interesting character that I felt was well developed and acted. In terms of both personality and skill Sunao served as a contrast to Kazuya in that she treated her Tsugumomo very differently to Kazuya while at the same time both her skills and motivations that she has is vastly different to Kazuya’s. As a result, the struggle between the two was as much as a contest of strength as it was a contest against conflicting beliefs and ideologies which made the struggle between them even more interesting to watch as I was curious to see how it would play out.Though the main cast I felt was developed and used pretty well in the series I felt that some of the support cast could have been used more. The character of Chisato I felt didn’t really have much of a role in the story and could have been used a bit more. The same could be said of Kazuya’s older sister Kasumi who was played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayana Taketatsu. As a result, I felt that their roles were a waste of their talents and I wished that their characters were more fleshed out. As a fight anime, it was important that the series have excellent fight scenes that make good use of the setting and theme and in this I felt that it succeeded. Each of the fight scenes in the series I felt was well designed and thought out that though of a layout that we have seen in other series before was also unique in just enemy types but also determining what their weaknesses were and how their true desire could be factored into the fight as an advantage. The struggle between Sunao and Kazuya that took place near the end of the series notably had some excellent fight scenes that I particularly enjoyed watching. that works similarly to the likes of Twin stars exorcist which pairs the Tsugumomo with someone that has with a bond with the Tsugumomo thus creating a team that can be used to deal with hostile enemies that have been possessed by evil miasma.Story and settingThe main story for Tsugumomo largely takes place within the town of Kamioka and the surrounding areas and takes place in the modern time period. The story follows the life of Kazuya Kagami a normal high school student that one day is confronted with the fact that the obi that he had inherited from his mother had somehow become sentient and thus introducing him to the world of Tsugumomo’s and malison cleansing. The story behind Tsugumomo is essentially a fusion of comedy and action that is derived from both the everyday lives of Kazuya and his duties as a malison cleanser.The unique nature and setting for this series story means that apart from having a rather unique story and setting it also has many interesting enemy types that are tied with the theme itself. With the enemy’s in this series I liked the fact that in going with the theme they tend to revolve around the target’s inner desires which also affect how powerful they can be. One of the things that are present in each episode that I particularly like is a short introduction of the enemy type that is to be featured in each episode. I thought that these were informative and useful to the viewer.KazuyaKazuya voiced by veteran seiyuu Yuuko Sanpei of Boruto Naruto Next Generations and 3 Gatsu no lion fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. In the beginning of the series Kazuya was an average teenage boy that attends the local high school. In the beginning Kazuya as a person did not have much personality traits that made him really stand out. In the beginning of the series Kazuya’s chief personality traits was that he was honest, understanding and kind hearted but tended to get scared easily. These starting traits of his though weren’t completely removed as the series went on but stayed and were improved upon as the series went on. As the series progresses Kazuya as a person also starts to improve thanks to the challenges that he and Kiriha overcome as well as the results of the bonds that he forms with people that he helped. Because of these improvements Kazuya becomes more dependable as he comes to understand the role that was given to him and more determined to help those that need his help. More importantly because of his new-found determination Kazuya also become much more brave and willing to take a stand against a terrifying opponent and end it there before it can hurt anyone else.Kazuya’s defining trait is without a doubt his kindness as though his role as a malison cleanser means that he will have to deal with hostile creatures that are born from evil malison such as the various types of Amasogi Kazuya always tries to understand the reason that they were formed from and understand what led to them being formed. This trait of trying to understand the reason behind how they were formed puts him in good stead as though he must deal with them eventually Kazuya at least tries to understand them and determine what the reason behind them was before exorcising them. This trait of trying to understand your foes I felt was nice to see.The bond that Kazuya shares with his partner Kiriha is without a doubt one of the center pieces of the series. In the beginning of the series we can see that though Kazuya was grateful to Kiriha for saving his life that he didn’t fully trust her and indeed did not really know who she was other than the fact that she had materialized from his mother’s obi. At this point Kazuya often finds himself being abused and taking advantage of by Kiriha who takes advantage of his kind and honest personality. Often Kazuya is forced by Kiriha to serve her by getting things for her. Though their bond started off on a wrong foot as the series progresses however the trust that Kazuya and Kiriha develop with each other starts to manifest more with Kiriha more willing to listen to him. Though still lording over him a result of the trust that the two have built up means that both Kiriha and Kazuya have developed a partnership between the two that shows how much they care for each other. Notably in later parts of the series Kazuya tries to ensure that he doesn’t use Kiriha’s true self in his attacks as this will affect her life.In overall, I felt that the character of Kazuya was a well-rounded character that was well designed. Though at first, he was a rather average character with few distinguishing characteristics I felt that the character development for him was well done and seeing the character gradually transform from an average Joe to someone that has both conviction in his duties and compassion and understanding that enables him to understand the events that led to a amasogi’s formation. I felt that his seiyuu Yuuko Sanpei really did a great job portraying the character of Kazuya.KirihaKiriha voiced by veteran seiyuu Naomi Oozora is one of the main characters of the series and is the series main heroine. A veteran Tsugumomo that has lived for a long time Kiriha is the manifestation of Kazuya’s mother’s obi and had previously served her. A feisty and mischievous young woman that’s boastful and has a lot of self-confidence Kiriha has a personality that can be said to be a direct contrast to the one that Kazuya has. In addition to being feisty and mischievous in the beginning of the series Kiriha also had a rather self-centered personality that when combined with her feisty nature really made her hard to deal with for Kazuya as he often become victims of her impulsive nature. However though lazy and slothful when she’s at home when dealing with hostile forces Kiriha adapts a more serious nature that’s more serious, cautious and focused on dealing with the enemy using the best way possible. Similar to Kazuya Kiriha is one that doesn’t like to destroy Amasogi entirely proving that she too detests mindless destruction if it can be avoided.Kiriha has a number of running gags within the series that help define her character. Firstly, is Kiriha’s love of fooling around with others that comes from her teasing nature. Although not harmful these episodes of fooling around which most often targets Kukuri is a sign of the trust that she has in the people that she teases though this is something that she wouldn’t like to be found out. The other running gag of the series regarding Kiriha is her love of pudding and her desire to have one every day. When she doesn’t for some reason get what she wants Kiriha tends to be more impulsive than usual with a notable exception when she created a song for not getting one.Kiriha’s bond with her master is one of the main aspects of this series and also serves as a means for her development as a character. In the beginning Kiriha did not really have a high opinion of Kazuya both as a person and as a fighter. As a result, she often treated him harshly and in turn created a sort of master slave relationship that only she believed in. As the series progresses however and as Kiriha sees how determined Kazuya has become in becoming a malison cleanser her attitude towards him changes and she begins not just advising him on the various Amasogi that he must face but also in training him as well. By the end of the series Kiriha’s trust in Kazuya has become strong and that she really respects the strength that he has developed over the series. I felt that Kiriha as a character was a pretty well-designed and that her seiyuu Naomi Oozora really did a great job portraying her.KukuriKukuri voiced by veteran seiyuu Yurika Kubo of Urara and High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of Kazuya and Kiriha’s allies. The goddess that is charged with watching over the area that Kazuya and Kiriha and their allies live in Kukuri is a contrast to Kiriha’s feisty personality in that she is a friendly young woman that however has a tendency of being overly proud of her status as a god. At the same time, she is also rather dutiful and serious about her duties as well. Kukuri’s most prominent trait is no doubt her humble nature as despite her status as a god she never looks down on people and always treat people with respect whether they are fellow gods, humans or Tsugumomo like Kiriha. Kukuri is also very diligent and willing to help in performing small tasks which is also another contrast with Kiriha’s lazy nature. Like Kiriha Kukuri also has a running gag within the series with her being not being taken seriously by others despite her status as a god. This little byplay is most often seen when she’s with Kiriha and is always a funny thing to see.The character of Kukuri i felt was an interesting character and was perhaps the last image that I had when picturing a god. The byplay between her and Kiriha was funny every time I see it and her humble and diligent nature actually made her pretty cute. I felt that her seiyuu Yurika Kubo really did a great job voicing her. a notable trait of Kukuri is the fact that she speaks in an accent that’s very peculiar and uses words not often seen in conventional Japanese. This serves to make her even more charming though.ChisatoChisato voiced by new seiyuu Noriko Shibasaki is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kazuya’s allies within the series. A childhood friend of Kazuya’s Chisato is also the class rep for the class that Kazuya is in and as such is often the one that chides him when he’s distracted by something. A cheerful, upbeat and positive person that’s also kind and caring it can be seen quite easily that Chisato cares a great deal about Kazuya. As a result, her first meeting with Kiriha was a nasty shock to her as she now must contend with her for Kazuya’s attention. Despite that as the series progresses their relationship soon turned to respect instead. Though a mere human being when compared to the likes of Kukuri and Kiriha Chisato like her fellow human ally Osamu can assist Kazuya by using their intelligence and reasoning to help determine things that he might have missed. Though only a support character I felt that for her first role Noriko Shibasaki actually did a pretty good job of portraying the character of Chisato and I hope that she will continue to improve her skills and get more roles and establish her career.SunaoSunao voiced by veteran seiyuu You Taichi is one of the main support characters of the series and is a plot central character for the latter part of the series. A fellow malison cleanser like Kazuya Sunao is a confident, determined and passionate person who unlike Kazuya wanted to become a malison cleanser by choice. Apart from her desire to become a malison cleanser what really sets Sunao apart from Kazuya is how she perceives the Tsugumomo. Unlike Kazuya who sees tsugumomo’s as partners and treats them as such Sunao however sees them as nothing but tools that should only act when she commands them to and not be treated as anything else. In a way, the contest that erupts between the two is as much as a contest of strength and techniques and one that pits their perception and views of Tsugumomo. In a way Sunao really isn’t really a bad guy in truth but they were forced to be on opposing sides because of their vastly different views regarding Tsugumomo and how they should be treated and used. Unlike Kazuya whose role as a malison cleanser was forced on to him Sunao willingly accepted her role as one and as such her abilities as one far outstrips Kazuya’s skills.Never less seeing Sunao go up against Kazuya and seeing them go straight out against each other was interesting as was seeing the techniques that she used which is very different to how Kazuya usually fights.  I felt that Sunao as a character was a well-designed one and introducing a character that was like Kazuya but views Tsugumomo differently was a good move. The clash of both ideology and might between the two I felt was nicely done as it highlighted the strong bond that Kiriha and Kazuya have forged over the battles that they have been through and proves that friendship and trust can beat even people that are more powerful that you are.Arts and animationArts and animation for the series I felt was pretty good. The character designs for the characters I felt were done pretty well and was largely faithful to their counterparts in the manga. The various environments that the cast fight in was also well detailed. The animation for the series I felt was pretty good with the fight scenes between the various types of Amasogi being of high quality. However, I felt that the final dual that took place in the anime had the best animation in its fight scenes though compared to earlier battles.MusicThe music for the series I felt was reasonably good in regard to both the scene music and the opening and ending themes. The combat scenes in particular had some pretty good scene music that changed depending on the battle is going and I felt that this was well designed. The opening theme for the series which in this case was METAMORISER by Band Ja Naimon I felt was pretty catchy and helped convey the comedic side of this series which is helped by the visuals that is shown during the opening song. This is contrasted by the ending theme which is I4U which is sung by veteran singer Michi that seems to convey the bonds and friendships that Kazuya has formed with his friends and allies. Of the two I would say that the ending theme was actually one of my favorites because of the message that it conveyed and the visuals that were used there.Voice actingThe Voice acting for the series I felt was pretty good with particular praise going to Naomi Oozora and Yurika Kubo who voiced the characters of Kiriha and Kukuri who I felt did a great job portraying their characters and making them stand out. Other seiyuu that I felt also did a great job was Noriko Shibasaki who despite her thin role managed to portray the character of Chisato reasonably well.

A simple story seasoned with basic yet entertaining characters, some clever ideas and a fun variety of situations. No Breakout whatsoever, but a fun experience overallStory 6\\10The Story is generic and it doesn't have anything interesting to offer, but it has some really clever ideas and good episodes, especially during the parts of the Malison Cleansiment, with interesting twists and ,just a little bit though, a serious tone and sense of resentment of the main character, who questions if he's really the good guy, but it's not explored enough though,...and that's a colossal shame because it could have been an amusing mix of comedy and seriousness, even if the result may have been silly. The comedy is funny at times but the Ecchi kind of ruins everything:Ecchi, if used in a clever way or if dosed correctly is humorous, but here it's just too much, it feels forced, out of place and puts the overall tone of the story into childish territory, becoming almost a teenage guy wet dream(Maybe i exaggerated a bit) and damaging the characters that the show is trying to establishCharacters 6\\10The characters are bland and have little to no development, even though in some episodes are surprisingly well-written and  with amusing lines and, well, character; this hurts the show even more, it could have been so much  better if they stayed on that path, without trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator and if they tried taking some risks. The best part is hands down the banter, the interactions between characters, that on their own would have the same personality as my bedside table.When they're together, they're actually fun, hilarious and entartaining: the relationship between Kazuya and Kiriha, despite being a bit clichè, is fun and has the biggest progress of them all:on their own they're nothing, but together they feel like partners, they feel like friends;same for Kiriha and Kukuri, which are believable rivals\\friends when they're together, but alone they seem like different characters.If only the show focused more on the individual, not even much, just 1 episode, even 2 at maximumSound 6.75The Music is weird: the opening is catchy, fast, energetic and perfect for the Show,the OST are strangely  flooded with a Naruto vibe, they're not bad, but they're repeated too much and they get tiring really fast, they're not the best pieces, but they're somewhat enjoyable nevertheless.

Then about 4 episodes in it hit me. The show is not bad, but the show is not great either, in fact, what was bugging me was the peculiar sensation that the show was so run-of-the-mill, so median, so perfectly average that I couldn\'t honestly bring myself to complain without feeling a sense of guilt about the fact I was ragging on a show that really hasn\'t done anything wrong.The ""story"" actually begins to become somewhat interesting 4-5 episodes in, which is a good thing for...what is otherwise an entirely fan service based show. I\'d have given up on the show in fact if it wasn\'t for the fact the jokes were so unabashed. Evolving from the boring and tired meta of ""tease"", ""euphemism"" and ""sexual connotation"" to outright, adult horseplay. At the very least i found this refreshing despite being blatantly perverted. Would you watch this show for its story? Probably not. It\'s just a nice thing to have supporting the juicy antics.The animation is awkwardly all over the place. Going from ""basic as fuck"" to enticingly graphic (when it knows it needs to pull out some aesthetic stops during its service scenes). The thing that really lets the show down though is its background art. This is also in reference to my initial paragraph, everything feels so geometric and clean and it took me a while to figure out why that was so weird and it\'s because such an empty environment is obviously sterile. It doesn\'t feel like anyone lives there, it quite literally looks like a ""set"" for a play.It\'s too early to really discuss the characters on account of the fact they haven\'t been properly developed. We\'re learning about the MC\'s heritage and the role he will play in the narrative, the justification for his importance, but in general the MC is about has hollow and husk like as you\'d expect in order to get as many people projecting onto him as easily as possible. The word we\'re looking for here is ""generic"". This is not a sign of a quality narrative, but a reinforcement of the service gimmick that ultimately sells the show.So is the show worth watching? Well the humour isn\'t bad, if not somewhat thin and expectedly cliché in places. But other than that, if you\'re a novice anime watcher you\'ll find this show will leave a hell of a lot to be desired. A newbie will get a lot more enjoyment from the show, but then at the same time there are so many better shows waiting to be watched for a newbie. So I struggle to find a justification to recommend this besides the fact the sexual humour refreshingly doesn\'t beat around the bush.Watch if you\'red bored or desperate and you wont be too disappointed. It\'s not bad. But it also isn\'t good. what is otherwise an entirely fan service based show. I\'d have given up on the show in fact if it wasn\'t for the fact the jokes were so unabashed.

Well the humour isn\'t bad, if not somewhat thin and expectedly cliché in places. But other than that, if you\'re a novice anime watcher you\'ll find this show will leave a hell of a lot to be desired. A newbie will get a lot more enjoyment from the show, but then at the same time there are so many better shows waiting to be watched for a newbie. So I struggle to find a justification to recommend this besides the fact the sexual humour refreshingly doesn\'t beat around the bush.Watch if you\'red bored or desperate and you wont be too disappointed. It\'s not bad. But it also isn\'t good.', ""So far into the show, I'm getting vibes similar to that of Omamori Himari and other animes that reference mystical/domestic being living together, the show dance on cliches and takes the dialogue a bit further.Some scenes where you expect a cliche to happen, the show will disarm you by self deprecating and rewarding you with a little bit of fanservice, it looks interesting and it's pretty funny so far, the main character is a bit of a dense one but the scenes between the main duo are hilarious, give this show a try.It's not over the top, it's funny and down to earth and it's...starting to pick up, don't let the art style and the cover fool you, it's definitely a comedy and it's definitely ecchi starting to pick up, don't let the art style and the cover fool you, it's definitely a comedy and it's definitely ecchi"", 'Koko ni itaiDoko ni itaikotae\xa0wa\xa0kikanakute\xa0mo\xa0shittetadoko\xa0ni\xa0itaikoko\xa0ni\xa0itai!minna\xa0ga\xa0omotteru\xa0kara\xa0\xa0seeno\xa0dekotae\xa0wa\xa0onaji\xa0\xa0kotae\xa0wa\xa0onajitsunagari\xa0wa\xa0keshitakunaindauketotte?\xa0\xa0uketotta!...Man, that opening them alone was funny, never mind if it\'s in Nippongo, as long as I like it, ok, so going back to business, this anime may not be much, but it did fine by my ratings.........:Fair 6, story:Ok, so it was a usual supernatural themed story, with something naughty, where it leaves us audience in such imaginative conclusion of some of the things that were being hinted by writer  Ryōichi Kuraya, but the plot itself rely heavily on the main character getting his ass kicked by a cute yokai where at the same time , she also does some perverted acts that we guys can only imagine.Fair 6, Art:In one point it was decent , but in another it was something where illustrator Tajiri san seemly was just to reluctant to go all the way with the fanservices , Panchira was only limited to Chisato at first and then to Tadata and to kiriha in her chibi form, but the full boob flash with Kyouko and everyone else was a disappointment, nevertheless it was fair enough were we were left with a lot to be left in our imagination.Very Good 8, Sound:well the opening theme "" METAMORISER "" was really good for the anime itself and so as the ending theme "" 14U"" did match well with the anime.

Characters end up in very weird/awkward situations. It is something half-way between comedy jokes of To Love Ru, and blunt humor of something like prison school... actually it is quite hard to describe it properly. It is as if it tried to use bluntest lewd jokes without making situation look ""sexy"". I\'d say it is quite clsoe to the kind of humor used in ""Kyou no 5 no 2"".Second, for some strange reason it has very high quality animation in fight scenes and fairly amazing music.

It is something that is worth of being in a very well done fighting game, like blazblue. Heavy and powerful. Perhaps not as powerful as the main t heme of first ajin, or as cheerful tracks of ""monster musume to iru nichijou""... but it is definitely about average as far as anime tracks go.Character: 5/10:They\'re amusing, have some sort of personality and aren\'t carton cutouts, but it is hard to say much about them. They\'re story devices first and character seconds. So they behave according to their role, and pick behaviors that would be most comedic.... so you\'d end up seeing them less as characters and more like comedy elements.Enjoyment: 6/10:It is oddly perverted, but once you get over it, it has interesting moments, and surprisingly good fighting scenes and music. Long story short, there\'s much worse anime out of there.Overall: 6/10:Overall, it is worth a watch, but you need to have a very high tolerance to lewd and ecchi jokes.

Unfortunately, the only ways it stands out from a dozen other shows like it are negative.  The characters are mostly annoying, the character designs and art look surprisingly dated for a show released in 2017, and the story is skin and bones even by usual ""become chosen one, train, fight rival"" shounen standards.  The jokes are the same unfunny ecchi humor that you\'ve seen in a thousand other shows.  Kiriha\'s pudding song was the only thing in the entire season that made me laugh....You get the occasional creative idea resulting from the amasogi, the spirits that the protagonist fights.  One particularly good one is the episode where the school is turned into a visual novel.  Unfortunately these occasional good ideas are never fully capitalized on, and too few and far between to salvage the show.Bottom line, if you want to see Kiriha topless, then you may as well watch it I guess.  Otherwise, there\'s almost nothing to recommend in this show, and plenty of nearly identical but better shows of this type are out there if you find the concept interesting.

While many harem anime tend to blend together in a sea of stereotypical tropes, Tsugumomo stands out as a surprisingly entertaining and engaging series that manages to carve its own unique path.A Tale of Artifacts and Unexpected TransformationsThe story of Tsugumomo revolves around Kazuya Kagami, a seemingly ordinary high school student who inherits a mysterious artifact known as a ""Tsugumomo"" from his late grandfather. Tsugumomo are said to possess spirits that can transform into beautiful women,...and Kazuya\'s Tsugumomo, a sword named Kukuri, is no exception.As Kazuya delves deeper into the world of Tsugumomo, he encounters a colorful cast of characters, each with their own unique Tsugumomo companions. Along the way, he must face off against various enemies and unravel the secrets surrounding his grandfather\'s legacy.Action-Packed Fights with a Touch of ComedyTsugumomo delivers some of the most visually stunning and dynamic fighting sequences in the harem genre. The animation is fluid and well-choreographed, showcasing the characters\' diverse fighting styles and abilities. These battles are further enhanced by the series\' lighthearted and comedic tone, which helps to balance out the more serious moments of the story.Ecchi Elements for Mature AudiencesWhile Tsugumomo is primarily a harem anime, it also incorporates ecchi elements that may not be suitable for all audiences. Fans of fanservice will find plenty of panty shots, suggestive scenes, and lighthearted sexual humor to enjoy. However, it\'s important to note that these elements are not gratuitous and serve to further emphasize the series\' comedic nature.Room for Improvement in Facial Coordination and ArtDespite its overall strengths, Tsugumomo does have some areas where it could improve. The facial coordination and art style can occasionally feel a bit inconsistent, with some characters appearing more detailed and expressive than others. While this doesn\'t significantly detract from the overall viewing experience, it\'s something that could be polished in future seasons.Unexpected Heroine TransformationsOne of the most surprising aspects of Tsugumomo is the unexpected transformations of its heroines. While the series initially introduces them as attractive young women, they occasionally transform into younger, more childlike appearances. This quirk may be off-putting for some viewers, but it adds an element of unpredictability and humor to the series.Main Protagonist: A Constant Source of SurprisesKazuya Kagami, the main protagonist of Tsugumomo, is a character who constantly keeps viewers on their toes. He\'s portrayed as a somewhat clumsy and indecisive individual, but he also possesses a hidden strength and determination that shines through in moments of crisis. His unpredictable actions and interactions with the other characters are a major source of the series\' entertainment value.A Series for Those Seeking Unconventional Harem AnticsTsugumomo is not your average harem anime. It\'s a series that embraces the genre\'s tropes while also injecting its own unique blend of action, comedy, and ecchi elements. If you\'re looking for a harem anime that\'s both entertaining and unconventional, Tsugumomo is definitely worth checking out.A Sound Theme that Complements the AnimeThe opening and ending themes of Tsugumomo perfectly complement the anime\'s lighthearted and comedic tone. The opening theme, ""Secret of the Heart,"" is an upbeat and catchy song that sets the mood for the adventures that lie ahead. The ending theme, ""Honto no Kimochi,"" is a more mellow and reflective song that captures the emotions of the characters and the overall atmosphere of the series.Story: 7/10Visual: 6/10Detailed: 5/10Characters: 5/10Emotions: 3/10Smoothness: 6/10OP/ED: 7/10Audio: 5/10Originals: 5/10Intense: 4/10Uniqueness: 6/10Fun/Laughter: 9/10NSFW: 9/10Boring/Idling: 3/10Recommendation: A Series that Defies ExpectationsTsugumomo is an anime that defies expectations.

In terms of the overarching story, there isn't much beyond setting up the characters and systems, and though there are some plot threads that I am interested in seeing where they lead, there largely isn't something at a grand scale that they're working towards, with it largely...being focused on smaller stories.

You get a wide cast from odd to perverted people in a very funny and wholesome show.The story of possessed objects of which some are good with consciousness and some bad comes with a funny story that has some serious action and heartfelt moments. Let us not forgot that the show is very ecchi too in the best possible way.The art is a very high standard that has aged well. It can be goofy at times but that is purposeful I believe by the show and its style.Sound has a fun op and...ed with sounds generally being of great quality. The SFX could be deeper but that is a rare thing outside of serious action-based shows or that which is meant to be deeply dramatic.Characters are wide and varied whether it be a cute blue-haired girl who is awesome, a childhood friend that wishes for lewdness or even a loli goddess that is preyed on by a lolicon goddess.In terms of enjoyment, the show goes through various cycles all of which are great.For example, some main points for me would be the sex that may or may not be happening but you do get some pretty graphic but comedic moments like in the bath.During episode 6 we have a pretty XXX episode that cringed me to the moon and back.Episode 8 was a real hard hitter in the complete understanding of Shirou Shiramine and his love troubles in school. Literally happened to me the negative thing did with girls.Episode 9 takes a very dark turn that has consequences of death then divorce but you also get a cute girl introduced along with ecchi scenes.Episode 12 gets some funny setups for the next season which was very welcome.I would say the show is funny from start to finish even when it is being serious it has a great storyline.9/10 ed with sounds generally being of great quality.

Overall, there isn't too much to say about it. If you are looking for something that isn't too heavy of a watch with a bit of a lewd chuckle here and there, look no further.This series took me by surprise. While not the greatest anime ever made, Tsugumomo has its own special charm that will keep you watching until the final episode. It isn't for everyone but fans of light hearted comedies will be pleasantly surprised. Watching the characters grow...and bond together kept a smile on my face that lingered even after I'd finished.The animation and sound are superb. Nothing jumps out as being amazing but there aren't any glaring issues, either. The character designs are a bit on the generic side but by no means bad.The anime does end with plenty of story left to tell and you will be left itching for the second season coming out next year.I highly recommend this anime. and bond together kept a smile on my face that lingered even after I'd finished.The animation and sound are superb.

highly recommend this anime."", ""Warning possible SpoilersGoing into Tsugumomo I was just expecting another two misfit characters doing random stuff like fighting monsters or other stuff which is what I got yet it somehow surprised in more ways than I was expecting.The story begins with Kazuya Kagami who doesn't go anywhere without his Sakura Obi that his mother gave him until one day a Tsugumomo spirit called Kiriha saved him from an evil spirit and that point on Kazuya's days would never be normal again.Now the story isn't really spectacular, but it is enjoyable because at least the characters do go around trying to stop evil spirits attacking people...or being used by people who have been persuaded by the spirits to do evil or weird things unlike Love Tyrant which just gives up it's directive 3 episodes in whereas Tsugumomo actually puts in some effort and it can be quite knowledgeable too which did surprise me a little since I was expecting the characters to mess around which they do, but they do get serious when the situation gets a little hectic and it was interesting how Kazuya and Kiriha were able to beat the enemy and how they got stronger overtime as their partnership became more trustful.Despite not having a good story it did pick up thanks to the characters and the situations they got into because there were a few moments that completely caught me off guard which I'll explain later, but it showed that it wasn't using the usual cliche's I have seen before which is why I was pretty impressed by this show and the characters were a big help too since they were a bunch of fun and none seemed dislikeable yes even the girl that shows up at the end didn't annoy me surprisingly.But it does fall short a little how it the series ends with the usual two people with similar or the same powers going at it to see who is better, luckily the fight was actually pretty cool to see.Now the characters were a pretty random bunch and were pretty likeable since they offered me a good amount of laughs and surprises.Kazuya Kagami is the male MC and is Kirihas partner in battle, Kazuya is kinda like the usual MC you see in harems yet not as dumb and is more controlled of his perverted desires which is a good start, he is a pretty friendly guy and doesn't hesitate to help people as long as he doesn't find them annoying, at first he wasn't really good at fighting the other spirits, but thanks to working with Kiriha he did get stronger the only downside to his life is that he is constantly getting beaten up by Kiriha if he does something she doesn't like.Kiriha is the female MC and is a Tsugumomo which is a spirit created from sentimental attachment to certain objects, she is a Tsundere and a good one at that as she is a very random character as she'll be kicking Kazuya in the nuts for annoying her to being flirtatious with him to being obsessive over pudding, she likes to be boastful so she can remind Kazuya who's boss, but can be really lazy sometimes as she doesn't like doing things that aren't really to do with her making her have a selfish nature plus she can also be pretty open to anything sexual as she doesn't mind being nude around Kazuya and even flirts with him many times though when the going gets tough she is a loyal and reliable friend to Kazuya.Chisato Chikaishi is Kazuya's best friend and has been his friend since they were little, she is a kind girl though does get frustrated if the boys in her class do stuff that isn't normal or perverted and tends to beat them, but she is a smart person and helps Kazuya with his spirit situations along with his schoolwork, she cares about Kazuya very much often making sure he's alright.Kukuri and Kokuyou are both God's at the local shrine near where Kazuya lives, Kukuri is the one who wanted Kazuya to become an Exorcist so he can destroy the evil spirits, she may be powerful though her form looks like a little girl which doesn't make the others seem intimidated by her and she is often being used as a punching bag for Kiriha since they don't get on very well however when she had to live in Kazuya's house she was a helpful often doing chores with his sister while Kokuyou on the other hand is a much more mature woman often noted by her huge oppai and she is very seclusive with her emotions often having a very mild tone, but she is protective of Kukuri's well being though whenever someone asks to fondle her breasts she doesn't actually mind them doing it.Sunao Sumeragi is another exorcist like Kazuya and is his rival, she is a very direct and hot-blooded person as when she has a goal in mind she is very determined to see it through without giving much thought on the consequences, at first she only saw Tsugumomo's as a weapon or tool, but after her fight with Kazuya she does see her Tsugumomo differently and tries to improve their partnership afterwards.Now the artstyle wasn't impressive, but I did like some of the forms that the evil spirits took like the giant book monster or the hair monster that looked pretty intimidating, but mostly it wasn't much different from most anime's that I've seen before, although it was pretty funny how the characters design's went from normal to chibi form from time to time which were used to depict comedic moments that were done pretty well.The action wasn't amazing, but it had something because there was some strategy involved and usually anime's like this don't put that effort in for their battles so it entertaining seeing Kazuya, Kiriha and anyone else involved in the battles trying to figure out the enemies weakness and then trying to beat it also the final battle wasn't too bad either and I did like some of the moves that were created.Now the comedy is definitely what makes this an enjoyable show because it was hilarious to watch Kazuya and Kiriha always having arguments with each other that always end up with Kazuya getting a hit in the nuts and the other characters proved to be very funny too as Kukuri and Kiriha also had their moments of fighting each other that was just really funny to watch and probably the best part of the comedy is the amount of sexual innuendos that are thrown at use and it made me laugh my ass off because it worked so well and it mainly came from Kiriha which just made her character even more likeable.The ecchi/fanservice was also something that completely threw me off because Kazuya and Kiriha are probably the most chill characters I have every seen nude together because usually one of the characters would blush or just run away of embarrassment, but these two are literally having bath's together and talking in the bed nude like their private parts are just hanging out and their just having a friendly conversation it surprised the hell out of me and that's not all there was one scene with Kazuya and Chisato in the nurses room that surprised the hell out of me along with Kazuya, Kirirha and Kukuri's trip to another God's shrine who had a lolicon fetish and that was really awkward to watch, a lot of the fanservice in this show really caught me off guard.Overall this show was actually very funny as where it lacks in story definitely makes up for with really surprising comedy and fanservice so if you're looking for a show to give you a good laugh then this'll be a great time. or being used by people who have been

of its Japanese culture. Kiriha in particular really interested me with her bossy but confident personality and her unique fighting abilities as a tsugumomo. This anime surprisingly has a pretty interesting story as well as an intriguing cast of cast of characters.I really liked how the anime shamelessly uses lewd elements to conduct its story, it did not feel really alienating and each lewd element felt purposeful. It crosses a line of storytelling I thought wasn't possible. There's also a good...amount of fights that happen in this story that really hooked me in with these characters. All of this leads to a good balance of comedy, lewdness, storytelling that makes Tsugumomo stand out to me personally.My only problem with the anime is that the main character is somewhat boring. He certainly shows his potential growth as a character by the end of the series, but he really never gets to express how he feels about the sexual events that happen to him nor does he show any relatable elements that would make him likable. The other characters can be a bit cliche at times as well, but it never bothered me too much as the story really hooked me in anyway.I would love to see another season of this anime happen as I hear the manga gets much better later on. This set of 12 episodes I hear is only the beginning of a great story unfolding. If you can personally handle the lewd elements of the show and the bit cliche characters, you're in for a pretty good ride.

Needless to say starts off pretty shit if you ask me but then gets better and better.  At first I was like what are these fight scenes, plot and all the rest.  Eventually it kind of grew on me and I could see the humor in it.  I would probably never watch this again but...it was not the worst for something to chuckle at in the background as I focus on other things. it was not the worst for something to chuckle at in the background as I focus on other things."", ""Tsugumomo looks like a typical generic shounen action harem show, at least at first sight.You've got Kazuya, our weak and average male MC who has to get stronger to fight some supernatural creatures, Kiriha, the supernatural and strong female lead who helps him, some more harem cast, and some ecchi of course.But right after the first episode, I knew this would be different, and I would like it.And after finishing, I knew that I was right.Yes it uses generic elements, but many of them in a rather unusual way.But there is more to it than just generics.Tsugumomo has plenty of ecchi scenes, but more in...a funny way.Not like for example Shinmai Maou no Testament which is sometimes borderline Hentai, and you see lots of detailed boobs, butts, and lewd SM stuff going on, to make you pitch a tent between the fights.Instead, you don't get to see any details, but plenty of lewd comments from the acting persons what's going on, or unambiguous visual substitutes of what happens.And there is definitely a lot going on, in fact his whole harem (including his childhood friend and even his big sister) at once gets him off multiple times, and there are quite obvious hints that even more has happend with some harem members, something quite rarely seen, although not really voluntarily from his side...You don't get to see many panty shots except those for some comedy, I think mostly because Kiriha does't wear any anyway, which is another comedic element here.Really, I laughed my ass off during these scenes, I liked very much how explicit Tsugumomo was without being visual explicit.Comedy has a big role in the show, be it stereotypical, lewd, or unconventional.Have you ever thought of a local goddess getting so weak due to lacking belief and overuse of her powers, that her body transforms to a very young girl?And of that literally poor goddess begging for money of another goddess, and a very lewd one on top of that?And Tsugumomo actually has a plot, though not the most innovative kind, but with quite interesting reference to Japanese popular beliefs.I mean, seriously, who ever thought of fighting with an obi (a kimono belt) as a weapon, but it works and you get some decent fights.It's just a little disappointing that not everything is explained, for example what exactly had happend to Kazuya in his past and why.That calls for a second season, but I think one has to read the manga...Character drawing is sometimes quite simple, but without looking lazy, and sometimes more detailed, mostly during any kind of action.The only thing I didn't quite like was Chisato's hair style, the high forehead without hair looks a bit awkward.Animation is fluent and nice to watch.I also liked the visual substitutes, like a bunch of hearts popping up, a massive telescopic crane, or the Rin (a cup gong), these always made me grin lewdly.You won't see any full front nudity, the most important parts are always covered with towels, arms, soap, blur or stuff like that.I'm fully ok with that, it fits the show very well, you don't always have to have massive boobs swinging right before your eyes (although that can be quite nice from time to time, too).Sound is nice and decent, all seiyuu voice their character very well, I especially liked Kiriha's voice with that lewd tone, and Kokuyou's deep voice and formal mode of expression.Character design is quite ok, the more important characters all get some sort of development, although that is not the most important part for that kind of show.I wished that Kokuyou had some more screen time, I really liked her dry comments...As Tsugumomo is a comedy show, character design can not work without using stereotypes, because it would be a waste of comedic resources.You just have to use the tropes in a clever way instead of showing the exact same template like the cheap generic shows.I'm sure we all have seen many different male-wants-to-take-a-bath-but-nude-female-is-already-there-scenes, and the female char screams, beats up the male char, or both.But when Kazuya rushes in, Kiriha just tells him to wash her back, because he as her servant surely  is here to do that anyway.I liked Tsugumomo a lot, and even rewatched the most hilarious scenes, still laughing like the first time.If you are here just for some boobs, you will be disappointed.But if you like lewd humour, I think this is for you!

It follows a cliche monster of the week formula, but does this unapologeticly. The story is simple boy is a student, has to defeat ghosts, has obi who is a girl that knew his death mother. What truly shines is as said variety, for example there is a ghost that turned high school into a otome hentai game, or protagonist's best friend is a pervert, but from ghost wish recives a perfume that gets him all the girls. Is it perfect? No, but is it extremely fun? Yes!!!!! "", 'One of the major reasons LA even looked into Tsugumomo is because Naomi Oozora was voicing a character with a Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell cadence.......no seriously.Tsugumomo is if anything a fanserviced-up harem anime with a dense main male protagonist with some sprinklings of Shinto and Japanese folklore to go along with, however it\'s VERY scattershot.Tsugumomo\'s characters are stock at best from our bland main male protagonist Kazuya Kagami voiced by Yuuko Sanpei being the owner of the obi tsukumogami Kiriha voiced by Naomi Ozoora, where she\'s the extremely abrasive type and that\'s saying it lightly. Kazuya also has an older sister who\'s has a crush on...him and is brazen about it, Chisato Chikaishi voiced by Noriko Shibasaki the tsundere childhood friend love interest who\'s extremely strict at anything pervy (so discount Yui Kotegawa from To Love Ru) as well as the local god of Kazuya\'s region Kukkuri voiced by Yurika Kubo being the butt monkey of the series along with her stacked disciple Kokuyou voiced by Eriko Matsui. Kazuya\'s friends also gets some screentime like the perverted womanizer best friend Shiro Shiramine voiced by Sachi Kokuryu and the always reliable otaku Osamu Osanai voiced by Shiho Sasaki. LA\'s favourite character easily goes to Kiriha however because Naomi Oozora ok. Tsugumomo\'s progressions mainly character development is largely stunted however due to it\'s plot format.Tsugumomo\'s plot format mainly consists of episodic nature for the majority having Kazuya face off against the tsukumogami of the week kind of deal, but it\'s also spliced in with gratuitous out of nowhere fanservice as well as some slice of life moments that doesn\'t amount to much. Tsugumomo\'s plot is a mess is a compliment if anything but for LA, there are a rare few times when the plot was indeed interesting, mainly the Nanako mini arc as well as the rival Sunao Sumeragi finale. The very few characters that seemed to develop a bit of character development are Kazuya and Kiriha but KIRIHA the most mainly due to her backstory. Kazuya yes, does develop but ONLY properly for himself during the Sunao\'s final episodes. Kazuya does develop in terms of how he uses his powers (a la Kiriha) and he gains the typical ""nice guy, protect everyone"" kind of belief but in all honesty his development was rushed and rather typical of the main male protagonist position mainly due to what little screentime he gets (seriously we get more screentime of minor characters dilemma of the day and development than Kazuya\'s) that and LA liked Kiriha\'s backstory more. Some minor character do develop as well due to their focus of the some episodes like Tadataka Tadata voiced by Mikako Komatsu, Shiro and Chisato with Osamu being the helper to the situation at hand but they are left in default mode anyways by the end of it which was a shame as OSAMU was more of a competent character than the entire cast sometimes.One of the other interesting things about Tsugumomo at the very least that grabbed LA\'s attention was with it\'s interesting actual lore on Shinto and Japanese folklore, mainly the tsukumogami/tsugumomo, objects that gains sentience, that along with the local god Kukkuri wanting Kazuya to be a malison cleanser to get rid of objects gone rogue and we pretty much got interesting folklore mixed into the plot itself that anybody would be interested in however...Ok now to get the elephant out of the room. Tsugumomo has a tendency to cross the line at times, as in sexual harassment and incest as ""comedy"" and even for LA, LA had to squick at the prospects of what Tsugumomo is even doing. LA can understand the gratuitous fanservice, the material adapted from is a borderline-hentai manga but still when it crosses the line...it crosses the line.In terms of animation by Zero-G, the animation was decent enough with the over exaggerated expressions being chibified to some decent character designs and the few times they go into fight scenes was ""ok"" at best. Backgrounding was decent though forgettable. Zero-G\'s best in animation for LA at least went to it\'s character designs though some are stock generic at times.Now voice acting, if Tsugumomo has anything it\'s a melting pot of idol seiyuu\'s and great voice actors. Naomi Oozora voicing Chieri Ogata from the iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls series to Yurika Kubo voicing Hanayo from Love Live and Ayana Taketatsu voicing Sachiko Koshimizu from the iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls as well. *ahem* anyways LA did have ALOT of fun hearing these voice actors in Tsugumomo, the best and obvious being Naomi Oozora but some special mention also to Yurika Kubo, Rumi Ookubo, You Taichi, Yuuko Sanpei AND Mikako Komatsu crossdressing voices as Kazuya and Tadataka respectively and Noriko Shibasaki who only has two roles to her name (including this anime).Tsugumomo is scattershot due to it\'s plot format and wanting to try EVERYTHING it can to see what sticks but the obvious consistency it has is it\'s fanservice harem elements, bland characters, episodic nature and it\'s modern folklore setting. The only two plot points LA will give praise to is the Nanako mini arc for giving us a rather heartwarming minor character development with CONSEQUENCES THAT STICKS and Sunao\'s finale arc where we see Kazuya develop, yes rushed to all hell but compensated with a rather awesome final bout.But as much as Tsugumomo has it\'s tendencies to ALSO cross the line with it\'s comedy and fanservice, LA can\'t exactly hate on Tsugumomo all that much, it\'s not perfect and LA doesn\'t expect it too be neither does LA think this is the best fanservice battle supernatural harem. It\'s in the middle for LA...it\'s fine and as a bonus, LA got to hear a completely unchecked Naomi Oozora go all out in this anime and that\'s kinda what LA got from this anime so LA was satisfied with Tsugumomo, scattershot fanservice baggage and all. him and is brazen about it, Chisato Chikaishi voiced by Noriko Shibasaki the tsundere childhood friend love interest who\'s extremely strict at anything pervy (so discount Yui Kotegawa from To Love Ru) as well as the local god of Kazuya\'s region Kukkuri voiced by Yurika Kubo being the butt monkey of the series along with her stacked disciple Kokuyou voiced by Eriko Matsui. Kazuya\'s friends also gets some screentime like the perverted womanizer best friend Shiro Shiramine voiced by Sachi Kokuryu and the always reliable otaku Osamu Osanai voiced by Shiho Sasaki. LA\'s favourite character easily goes to Kiriha however because Naomi Oozora ok. Tsugumomo\'s progressions mainly character development is largely stunted however due to it\'s plot format.Tsugumomo\'s plot format mainly consists of episodic nature for the majority having Kazuya face off against the tsukumogami of the week kind of deal, but it\'s also spliced in with gratuitous out of nowhere fanservice as well as some slice of life moments that doesn\'t amount to much. Tsugumomo\'s plot is a mess is a compliment if anything but for LA, there are a rare few times when the plot was indeed interesting, mainly the Nanako mini arc as well as the rival Sunao Sumeragi finale. The very few characters that seemed to develop a bit of character development are Kazuya and Kiriha but KIRIHA the most mainly due to her backstory. Kazuya yes, does develop but ONLY properly for himself during the Sunao\'s final episodes. Kazuya does develop in terms of how he uses his powers (a la Kiriha) and he gains the typical ""nice guy, protect everyone"" kind of belief but in all honesty his development was rushed and rather typical of the main male protagonist position mainly due to what little screentime he gets (seriously we get more screentime of minor characters dilemma of the day and development than Kazuya\'s) that and LA liked Kiriha\'s backstory more. Some minor character do develop as well due to their focus of the some episodes like Tadataka Tadata voiced by Mikako Komatsu, Shiro and Chisato with Osamu being the helper to the situation at hand but they are left in default mode anyways by the end of it which was a shame as OSAMU was more of a competent character than the entire cast sometimes.One of the other interesting things about Tsugumomo at the very least that grabbed LA\'s attention was with it\'s interesting actual lore on Shinto and Japanese folklore, mainly the tsukumogami/tsugumomo, objects that gains sentience, that along with the local god Kukkuri wanting Kazuya to be a malison cleanser to get rid of objects gone rogue and we pretty much got interesting folklore mixed into the plot itself that anybody would be interested in however...Ok now to get the elephant out of the room. Tsugumomo has a tendency to cross the line at times, as in sexual harassment and incest as ""comedy"" and even for LA, LA had to squick at the prospects of what Tsugumomo is even doing. LA can understand the gratuitous fanservice, the material adapted from is a borderline-hentai manga but still when it crosses the line...it crosses the line.In terms of animation by Zero-G, the animation was decent enough with the over exaggerated expressions being chibified to some decent character designs and the few times they go into fight scenes was ""ok"" at best. Backgrounding was decent though forgettable. Zero-G\'s best in animation for LA at least went to it\'s character designs though some are stock generic at times.Now voice acting, if Tsugumomo has anything it\'s a melting pot of idol seiyuu\'s and great voice actors. Naomi Oozora voicing Chieri Ogata from the iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls series to Yurika Kubo voicing Hanayo from Love Live and Ayana Taketatsu voicing Sachiko Koshimizu from the iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls as well. *ahem* anyways LA did have ALOT of fun hearing these voice actors in Tsugumomo, the best and obvious being Naomi Oozora but some special mention also to Yurika Kubo, Rumi Ookubo, You Taichi, Yuuko Sanpei AND Mikako Komatsu crossdressing voices as Kazuya and Tadataka respectively and Noriko Shibasaki who only has two roles to her name (including this anime).Tsugumomo is scattershot due to it\'s plot format and wanting to try EVERYTHING it can to see what sticks but the obvious consistency it has is it\'s fanservice harem elements, bland characters, episodic nature and it\'s modern folklore setting. The only two plot points LA will give praise to is the Nanako mini arc for giving us a rather heartwarming minor character development with CONSEQUENCES THAT STICKS and Sunao\'s finale arc where we see Kazuya develop, yes rushed to all hell but compensated with a rather awesome final bout.But as much as Tsugumomo has it\'s tendencies to ALSO cross the line with it\'s comedy and fanservice, LA can\'t exactly hate on Tsugumomo all that much, it\'s not perfect and LA doesn\'t expect it too be neither does LA think this is the best fanservice battle supernatural harem.

And trouble we indeed got, Tsugumomo in my eyes is ecchi done right, those that can't handle a bit of lewd, loli, and life-threatening ball abuse (let's face it MC is never going to have kids if this keeps up...) should probably pass on this. Things get uncomfortable and awkward but that's kind of what makes it funny, rare is the fanservice here that doesn't play into some sort of joke. That being said the show also has a bit of shounen in its blood as the rare combat scenes have...me enthralled and the show masterfully knows when to get serious and when to make sexually charged jokes. me enthralled and the show masterfully knows when to get serious and when to make sexually charged jokes."", ""Story: so Kazuya is basically having a normal school day until a evil spirit comes after him and well wanting him until his Sakura Obi appears before him a girl and she defends him from the spirit not long after that battle she tells him she is the master and hes the servant which he agrees too so now Kazuya and Kiriha have to battle these spirit's that manifest from the people of the school awhile also dealing with the girls (ill get to that in the character part) Kazuya life just got a lot crazier.Art: art is very good nothing wrong with the art...at all.Sound: The Op and Ed are decent at best also i watched the dub but all the people or actress were very good.Character: Kazuya is the male lead and well hes the nice and also shy type of guy in this anime honestly though i loved the guy just kind and nice also the shy guy i love that but a good and nice character.

I didn't have high hopes for this anime, but Tsugumomo actually turned out quite well.Let's start with genres. There are 3 things worth pointing out: it's seinen, there is no harem tag and there is no drama tag.While Tsugumomo not being harem didn't really save this anime from feeling like one, it gives protagonist a bit more freedom and doesn't need to show us how dense he is every episode.This anime being seinen is a wonderful thing for any ecchi fan. No, we don't get anything special. It just means that instead of boobfest and nosebleeds without doing anything we...have more or less reasonable use of nudity and reactions to it, although protagonists is too meek to make satisfying use of it.Finally, the lack of drama tag makes this kind of stories much more enjoyable. Yes, there are serious moments and there is a story. But the amount of cringe caused by useless tryhard protagonist is limited.Overall story in Tsugumomo is really basic and not that interesting. It has funny moments, mostly based on characters interactions. Thing worth mentioning is that we get plenty of fanservice that somehow doesn't feel forced.Characters in Tsugumomo are a mixed bag. Protagonist is another boring, useless, nice guy that you saw hundreds of times already. Kiriha on the other hand is very solid. She might not be really deep or well written, but she gives this feeling of being a complete character with her own personality.Most of side characters are forgettable. Some of them fit their role and were fun to watch whenever they appeared, while others were next to useless. On the bright side I don't think any of them felt like a waste of time. They had their roles, played them and didn't stay longer than needed.Art style is simple and rather bland. Characters look good, but again, nothing special. Animation is where stuff gets better, especially in some action scenes it was considerably above level I expected.Fanservice also deserves mention here. With right angles and covering, it manages to be satisfyingly erotic while not going into borderline hentai territory.Generally speaking, Tsugumomo is enjoyable anime. It had some annoying moments, all caused by protagonist's weak character, but lack of problematic drama, good ecchi and Kiriha made up for it. have more or less reasonable use of nudity and reactions to it, although protagonists is too meek to make satisfying use of it.Finally, the lack of drama tag makes this kind of stories much more enjoyable.

""Kagami Kazuya"" is now forced to and later decides to exorcise these bad spirits (amasogi) after knowing the truth behind it. so the rest of the part in the story is the appearance of many ""amasogi"" and Kagami Kazuya\'s attempts to exorcise them and become strong so other people won\'t suffer because of him.The story plot is done well, well ""well"" because the events are like average with no risk in them (that\'s what I feel), it\'s not like that each episode or events raise your feeling of curiosity or they are fascinating but that\'s just what I like about this anime.

Yuri Kuma Arashi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/26165/Yuri_Kuma_Arashi,"['Watching Yuri Kuma Arashi is like trying to memorize the first 100 digits of Pi. Succeeding might technically be considered an accomplishment, but good lord is it meaningless.Yuri Kuma Arashi is a textbook example of an anime that tries to be too damn smart for its own good. It\'s a show which attempts to utilize intricate symbolisms and references rather than to present a story which you can take at face value. By hiding content in-between the lines, it tries to provide a plot which is unorthodox, deep and thought-provoking. However this is nothing more than a façade which tries (and fails) to cover up...the fact that the plot itself is in reality nowhere near as complicated as it makes itself out to be.The story takes place in a world that has been struck by an asteroid called Kumaria, and after the following meteor shower ended, for whatever reason all the bears all over the world rose up and started attacking and eating humans. After the dust settled, a giant Severance Barrier was erected in order to separate the world of the bears from the world of the humans, and to try and cause a ceasefire in-between the two warring sides. Or at least that\'s what the premise states that the story is about, but in reality almost none of that is correct as Yuri Kuma Arashi is all about symbolism.This is of course because Yuri Kuma Arashi is written by the one and only Ikuhara Kunihiko, famous for other deeply symbolic and successful works such as Shoujo Kakumei Utena and Mawaru Penguindrum among others. Most things in his works look like one thing but in actuality represent something entirely different. It\'s kind of like solving a riddle in that sense as you have to try and figure out what everything really means on your own. Yuri Kuma Arashi is no different either as it primarily revolves around homophobia and society\'s view on it, but there\'s one clear difference here: although the story is unorthodox, complex and filled with references, that still doesn\'t change the fact that the vast majority of it feels completely uninteresting and intangible. The execution of Yuri Kuma Arashi is one of the most random ones I\'ve seen in a long time, and it doesn\'t really make the viewer care very much about the actual events occuring throughout the course of the story.Merely including references and symbolisms to various works of media like The Shining and historical events such as the Sankebetsu Brown Bear Incident does *not* make a good story in and of itself. That\'s not how scriptwriting works. If all you needed to make an interesting plot was to haphazardly throw in cryptic references and symbolisms wherever you could, then writing a ""good"" storyline would be easy as pie. However that\'s sadly not the case, but Yuri Kuma Arashi seemingly fails to understand this. As a result you end up with a story which contains countless plot elements from various sources, but in actuality the vast majority of them don\'t matter whatsoever in the end. When it all comes down to it, what you\'re left with is a pretentious and quirky Yuri story, complemented with tons and tons of completely irrelevant references.Speaking of which, I also have to say that Yuri is one of the absolute rarest genres in anime, and also one of my favorites. However if you\'re looking to see some cute, romantic, erotic or dramatic girl-on-girl moments you should look somewhere else because this anime has very little of that. The Yuri elements in this show are mostly used as a plot mechanic in order to be able to talk about homophobia. It is not really anything meant to try and be satisfying on its own.The characters... who were they again? If it wasn\'t for the fact that their names themselves are pretty easy to remember, I probably wouldn\'t be able to name them without double checking here and now. That\'s how forgettable and wholly uninspiring they are. Ikuhara\'s writing style is heavily integrated into the characters\' personalities and as a result they come across as quite intangible and hard to really get a good feel for. Well at least the main characters\' goals and intentions are pretty clear since the show never stops repeating them, but other than that they all feel like nothing more than plot devices instead of actual persons.Also a more subjective issue I have with this anime is how cringeworthy the dialogue is. If you\'ve watched any Ikuhara shows before, then you\'ll be familiar with some of the more random catchphrases that he tends to use. I mean who can forget about SEIZON SENRYAKUUUU and penguins for example. However those still felt appropriate and humorous somehow, but in Yuri Kuma Arashi it only made me hold my head in agony. ""Gao Gao"", ""Shabadadoo"", ""Deliciousmell~"", ""Kuma Shock!"", and the list goes on. It\'s so unbearably awkward to listen to. Am I supposed to be watching a psychological seinen anime, or Teletubbies? Sometimes I\'m honestly not sure.If there\'s anything good to mention about this show, then I\'d still have to give the animation some credit. Yuri Kuma Arashi uses a very artistic and Shaft-like art style which is very reminiscent of the Monogatari Series in how it looks, and also how the show utilizes it. The OP is also very atmospheric (and even has some decently pronounced French lyrics in it), and the ED is very catchy and addictive. Overall the production value is quite solid, but sadly that is not all you need to make a good anime. If pretty artwork and nice music was all that mattered, then you\'re better off watching something more dedicated on that front like Iblard Jikan or similar.I don\'t bother making negative reviews very often, simply because a) I don\'t actually hate anime, and b) most of the bad shows I come across are just bad because they\'re predictable, generic and boring. However it\'s been a very long time since I saw an anime which genuinely annoyed me as much as this one did, because I sincerely believed it had a lot of potential before the season started. I like Ikuhara\'s writing style. I think it\'s very unique and interesting, but in this case it just didn\'t work out at all. The first episode alone left me with a horribly negative impression, however I still had hope that it would get better over time when things would start to be explained and make more sense, but I am left somewhat disappointed on that front as well. Fortunately the eventual ending of the entire show was a lot better than everything before it, but that alone doesn\'t really make up for all the time where the story is pitifully bad.If you haven\'t seen an Ikuhara anime before and you\'re interested in seeing what they\'re like, all I have to say is [go watch one of his other works]. There is no need to bother watching this one before that. If you\'ve already done so and you really liked them, then I guess it might be worth at least giving Yuri Kuma Arashi a shot. But just make sure to not get your hopes up too high because odds are that you\'re going to be left somewhat disappointed if you do. the fact that the plot itself is in reality nowhere near as complicated as it makes itself out to be.The story takes place in a world that has been struck by an asteroid called Kumaria, and after the following meteor shower ended, for whatever reason all the bears all over the world rose up and started attacking and eating humans.

Sometimes I\'m honestly not sure.If there\'s anything good to mention about this show, then I\'d still have to give the animation some credit. Yuri Kuma Arashi uses a very artistic and Shaft-like art style which is very reminiscent of the Monogatari Series in how it looks, and also how the show utilizes it. The OP is also very atmospheric (and even has some decently pronounced French lyrics in it), and the ED is very catchy and addictive. Overall the production value is quite solid, but sadly that is not all you need to make a good anime. If pretty artwork and nice music was all that mattered, then you\'re better off watching something more dedicated on that front like Iblard Jikan or similar.I don\'t bother making negative reviews very often, simply because a) I don\'t actually hate anime, and b) most of the bad shows I come across are just bad because they\'re predictable, generic and boring. However it\'s been a very long time since I saw an anime which genuinely annoyed me as much as this one did, because I sincerely believed it had a lot of potential before the season started. I like Ikuhara\'s writing style. I think it\'s very unique and interesting, but in this case it just didn\'t work out at all. The first episode alone left me with a horribly negative impression, however I still had hope that it would get better over time when things would start to be explained and make more sense, but I am left somewhat disappointed on that front as well. Fortunately the eventual ending of the entire show was a lot better than everything before it, but that alone doesn\'t really make up for all the time where the story is pitifully bad.If you haven\'t seen an Ikuhara anime before and you\'re interested in seeing what they\'re like, all I have to say is [go watch one of his other works]. There is no need to bother watching this one before that. If you\'ve already done so and you really liked them, then I guess it might be worth at least giving Yuri Kuma Arashi a shot. But just make sure to not get your hopes up too high because odds are that you\'re going to be left somewhat disappointed if you do.', '**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Surrealism: it’s something that you are either into or you aren’t. The plots of these shows are usually far harder to comprehend than your average anime and the actions of the characters won’t always make logical sense, but if you merely change your perspective, you will see what the show is really trying to say. Yuri Kuma Arashi, which translates into “Lesbian Bear Storm”, is no exception to the formula of surrealist art; it is NOT for everyone. While most shows are driven by their plot or by their characters, YKA is a show driven by its themes and the messages that the...plot and characters are trying to relay. Brought to us by the artistic genius Kunihiko Ikuhara (Mawaru Penguindrum, Revolutionary Girl Utena), this show is a unique experience that allows you to really feel the passion and dedication that went into creating it; it has incredible attention to detail for the purposes of making a commentary on an important social issue. The best way to do this, of course, is through lesbian bears and lots of boobs. Right?Synopsis: Long ago, humans and bears lived together in harmony. But then, everything changed when the asteroid Kumaria crashed into the Earth, causing the bears to go berserk and start eating humans alive. To stop the fighting, a “Wall of Severance” was constructed to separate the two beings, thus ushering in an era of pure hatred and exclusion.In case you aren’t familiar with the works of Ikuhara and therefore don’t understand how such a silly concept can hold such a serious message, immediately stop reading this and go watch one of his shows; the only way to understand it is to experience it. I won’t hide the fact that I absolutely love Ikuhara’s style; the insane amount of symbolism, the repetition of sequences, the abstract environments, the use of color dissonance, etc. I’m an absolute sucker for all of it, so it’s no wonder why I was instantly turned on to this show.YKA’s plot may be nothing special if you take it at its face value, but when you examine the purpose of it all and how masterfully it is worked into the theme of homosexuality as well as how society perceives homosexuality, it becomes quite clear how well written it truly is. In case the title didn’t tip you off, this is an anime that uses lesbianism to make a commentary on society; not necessarily for fanservice (though you could certainly argue the amount of naked girls is gratuitous). It should go without saying, but this isn’t ACTUALLY a show about lesibians vs. bears; it’s an abstract concept used to display a theme. Some people are simply unable to get on board with that, which is understandable, but for those who do appreciate this sort of thing, YKA’s world building and storyline will be truly appreciated. There is a great deal of depth to it that I still haven’t taken the time to fully digest myself, but I definitely plan on rewatching this show in order to do so. Without doing a full on analysis of this show complete with spoilers, that’s about as much as I’m allowed to say about YKA’s narrative.While I could gush over everything this show does right all day, let’s talk about why you are never going to hear it mentioned in conversation amongst most anime fans. First and foremost, it gets off to a slow and confusing start. The first 3 episodes of YKA are far more abstract and cryptic than the rest of the show, which was admittedly a poor choice considering how assessable the themes are made later on. Because the characters take so long to be introduced and fleshed out, many people were scared away because of how strange and “out there” the anime appeared. It’s ironic that the symbols become so much easier to understand than Ikuhara’s other works later on, because it’s for precisely the opposite reason that so many people dropped it.The aspect of YKA that really makes the show work and ties all its themes together without many loose ends is the cast of characters. While they initially feel distant and unrelateable, they eventually emerge as unique and likable, not to mention the fact that they are perfect manifestations of the concepts that the show is working with. Ikuhara is a master of making sure that every character, no matter how minor, serves an important role. Outside of the main trio of Lulu, Ginko, and Kureha, every character has a symbolic purpose, thus painting the picture of a twisted dystopia that excludes all who do not conform to their standards. In addition to being thematically brilliant, the characters are a main source of the show’s fantastic comedy. Did I mention that this show is laugh-out-loud hilarious? I think it says something about the directing of a show that can make you think hard and laugh hard in the same episode. Sure, Kureha is bit bland and serves mostly as vessel for the show’s agenda, but this is overall a great use of characterization.Perhaps the best thing about an Ikuhara work is the animation itself; he always finds a new and unique way to portray something that could have been mundane, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for that. The sheer intricacy of each and every shot makes it clear just how much effort was put into this show in order to make it great. Regardless of whether or not you like his style, it is a commendable effort. The music choice is strange, but somehow fitting. This show contains easily the weirdest use of a choir I’ve ever heard, but I mean that in a good way.I think I’ll stop there just because even though there is so much to talk about with YKA, so little of it is worthwhile to someone who hasn’t actually seen it yet. I would highly recommend that you go watch it; even if you aren’t into the whole symbolism thing, this show makes it accessible enough that anyone can understand at least the basic gist of it. Sure the fanservice can be distracting despite its occasional relevance, the first few episodes are off-putting, and it isn’t exactly as bulletproof as Ikuhara’s other shows, but it’s a memorable, funny, and worthwhile experience nonetheless. If you’re looking for a show that actually has some depth, check it out. Shaba-da-doo. plot and characters are trying to relay.

One could say this is one of anime’s weirdest creations, but I think it’s one of the greatest, this year in fact. It is one of the first few anime that aired this year (and season) and as well as the one which focuses on girl-on-girl relationship.Yuri Kuma Arashi was probably picked up by many because it was directed by Ikuhara Kunihiko, the director of the well-famed Mawaru Penguindrum. To give some background of the story, there was a planet Kumaria that exploded on space which showered around Earth. This caused the bears to become violent...and start attacking and eating humans. So to prevent any more attacks, the humans build up the ‘Wall of Severance’ between the two and things calmed down. One day, two bears, Ginko and Lulu, disguised themselves as humans and transferred in a class where Kureha and her love Sumika is. While Kureha have been eyeing for Sumika, the bears eye towards Kureha. Then, tragedy ensues on that same day. First of all, many regarded the anime as one which has a lot of symbolism. Some have linked this anime to lesbianship in Japan, while others have their own other opinions about the topic in general. But even if there is symbolism, I think that this anime can be watched without caring about it. It is something that one should not delve into if he wants to watch an anime without thinking critically and just enjoy what is there in the story. Nevertheless, feel free to express your own thoughts linking with the story.The first few episodes can definitely throw everyone off because of the confusion behind the story. I do not know if some have dropped it because of this specific reason, but if you are one of the person, I suggest picking this anime up, because it gets better after episode three. To summarise what has been going on, the progression of the story is so clear and well-done. It is like piecing the puzzles to form a completed timeline, which means that the anime jumps in and out of flashbacks a lot of times. Trust me, it cannot be very annoying since you will be able to understand more about the story as well as the characters. Also, there can be a number of cliffhangers at the end of most episodes which leaves the suspense high for the audience. Overall, the story was written well with good sense of direction. It not only focuses on love, but also bullying and the society that have a general view on these topic. There are some funny moments to brighten up the dramatic mood of the anime and eventually there are also some fan-service moments that tickle the fantasies of many people. I am satisfied by how the story went by, and I really loved the ending so much that brought the story to great closure.Ah, the characters. The story revolves around these three girls, a human and two bears. Aside from their differences, they are fairly interesting characters to look at and quite likeable. I would say that Kureha is this girl that is affected by many things in the past, hence that was how she was in the beginning of the anime. As you bring the bears to play, she has gotten more active and is at first not willing to be with them. However, these bears are trying to change her for the sake for something, and towards the finale, something major happened for these characters that might move you emotionally. It was a nice character development for these girls as they get to understand more about one another and with a clever idea of flashback, we can see how these girls made it towards the end. I was pleased by how they think and understood by how they feel, so as I mentioned before, they are interesting.I like some of the side characters too. The anime got a whole lot of people to make Kureha suffer a lot, and it was nice how she kept herself strong, although she really never hung out with them in a long time. In fact, there are very few with an interesting twist, however easily spoilt through their names. With the three alluring court bears, two past-time lovers and many others, the anime holds its charm for having a good cast.Stunning visuals. At first I thought this was made by SHAFT, but nope, studio Silver Link (what a surprise) decided to direct this original anime, and I am sure only one (or very few) staff member working on the animation has links to involving SHAFT’s anime. The sceneries are great and have finer details in them, making them visually pleasing. Sometimes, there are scenes that usually throw in some symbolism and make it so abstract, so beautiful. I think the anime pushes to be this unique and I think this is perfect. The character designs are fine and quite simple - they look perfect in themselves. In bear form, I swear I could not stop awe-ing by their adorable figures. The fan-service is pretty nice and lewd, but at least it did not bring over towards the ecchi level, meaning that the anime does not throw in naughty fan-service anywhere to make the audience pumped up.When I first heard the opening song, I was moved by the emotions played in it. It was so calming, so beautiful that it is great. I love the vocals of its rich smooth high-toned singing, and apparently this is the singer’s, Bonjour Suzuki, first anisong. I never heard of her other songs before (if there is any), but I do welcome her to sing more songs to make her shine better. Meanwhile, this ending song sung by the voice actresses of the three main girls has this nice electronic beat that makes you groove. A nice touch for the simple animation behind, with a bear doing a cute dance. The background music is loveable, I hear a nice variety of choice in it. The voice acting is a job well-done indeed. The three voice actresses for the main characters are not-so-well-known yet they are great for putting the emotions into power with the characters, as well as defining what their respective characters are.Hell, Yuri Kuma Arashi is a bloomed lily flower over many other flowers in a garden. It definitely stands out by its wonderful and creative direction, however it does not really stand out much in terms of popularity. To say that the anime showed up at a wrong season is a possibility, but I would say that the anime is certainly the best among the rest of this season’s anime. I enjoyed the anime so much that I was hoping for a real-life time-skip to start a brand new episode each week, because of the cliffhangers. Now, will this anime be recommended by all? Not all, unfortunately. But it is a worth of try. Yuri fanatics are welcomed to start this show right now, and those who like to ponder over symbolism too. Everyone else, give it a try. You would not feel sorry. and start attacking and eating humans. So to prevent any more attacks, the humans build up the ‘Wall of Severance’ between the two and things calmed down.

You would not feel sorry.', '""Everything is good in moderation"" ..now if you were to say that to Ikuhara he would probably pimp slap you with a proverbial hand and skip off into the schizophrenic sunset of left field allegorical stew, while conjuring new ways to make even Satoshi Kon\'s nuttiest creations to look like tamed Saturday morning cartoons.Yuri Kuma Arashi is a dream factory chock-full of symbolism and motifs with everything being beyond what\'s presented at face value. This isn\'t for casual viewing and if unprepared to really dig deep it can be either taxing or repulsive upon initial impression. I normally don\'t like to judge works based on...the creator behind them but in the anime industry, some giants have made a very noticeable signature or trademark style when it comes to their works. May that be the western homage mashups of Shinichiro Watanabe, the ""kill em all"" approach of Gen ""the butcher"" Urobuchi, or the slow burn conceptual pieces of Yoshitoshi ABe. Many of these industry power players have all made a name for themselves from their style and presentation, and if there was ever a person whose work was instantly recognizable it would be Kunihiko Ikuhara\'s. The man has a knack for allegorical symbolism in everything he does and Arashi is his latest addition to screwball storytelling.Story: 7/10Yuri Kuma Arashi, when stripped of its symbolism, is mainly about two things: sexual liberation and exposing societal mistreatment through exclusion.Through our different female characters, we take several multifaceted approaches at tackling the 1st conflict brought up, sexual liberation. Since the general theme is only explored through the niche sub-category of yuri (love between women), it helps focus on one aspect instead of spreading itself too thin to try to cover a broader picture. The story shows how each character approaches their desire for yuri love. And again since it\'s all metaphorical, the key to understanding how each character approach that love is hinted at through wordplay and symbols. The quicker you figure out what they represent the quicker it becomes easier to piece together what the hidden messages behind each person\'s approach is. May that be to embrace that love with open arms or to reject it out of fear of social pressure. Each separate choice mirrors that of the ones commonly seen in today\'s society. You see it with the people that openly aren\'t afraid to express themselves and face rejection, and also when you hear stories of people ""being in the closet"". Being accepted by others is something we all desire in one way or another, but the show asks you at what cost are you willing to pay for that acceptance? Is acceptance worth restraining your true feelings to keep in good standing with societal standards?This leads us to our next theme, societal mistreatment. This one should be pretty self-explanatory since it\'s an issue that is still debated today. You\'ve probably heard it on the news or read about it every now and then. Every time you hear a story of a Bill being rejected to allow same-sex marriage in a state to be recognized. Or every time you hear of a celebrity publicly apologizing for making derogatory remarks against homosexuality. Societal mistreatment and exclusion is something that\'s been relevant for as long as the conflict existed. Yuri Kuma tackles this by using the ""mob"" mentality. When the majority forces the minority to either conform or be rejected. Although this conflict could have been handled with more tact in Yuri Kuma, they did get their point across clearly. With such an interesting setup this became a rare case where the antagonist is society itself and not just an individual.Art/Animation: 6/10The art and animation left nothing to really be desired. Often inconsistent and greatly lacking in fluidity it feels like it was put together on a shoestring budget. Needless to say, you\'re not watching this show for top-tier quality. The highlight lies with the character designs themselves as they are very distinctive from other shows. They carry a personality of their own and it shows when needed. This felt like more of a passion project that the studio knew wasn\'t going to sell well but something they wanted to do regardless. Despite the lack of consistency, the charm is certainly there. The setting itself was interesting but often muddled, felt like too much saturation of objects was placed in every frame. It certainly captures your attention but is quickly desensitized due to the constant bombardment of color and clunky set pieces. It isn\'t inherently a bad thing but certainly a hindrance at times.Sound: 6.5/10The opening can best be described as Honey synth-pop. With soft vocals and hints of sexualized undertones by the performer. It\'s a nice addition to the show and a good way to get kick-started into every episode. It\'s certainly one I found myself listening to every time. It may be typical but that isn\'t a bad thing when given the content and presentation to the show it corresponds to. Unfortunately, the rest of the OST was left concealed in the background and did nothing to stand out. None of the tracks really grip you or enhance the scenes they correspond with, they felt off in the distance and takes no risk in standing out. It\'s tracks that played it safe which resulted in nothing memorable to take away from it. The voice actors on the other hand were a real treat at times. Standouts being the Judge and court representatives ""SHABADABA DOO"".Characters: 6/10Remember the ""Everything is good in moderation"" quote, well that\'s something Ikuhara never seem to comprehend.You see the problem some metaphorical/conceptual shows face is that they more than often sacrifice proper characterization to stay thematically sound. This results in characters that become an embodiment of a ideology, which in turn make them only necessary when serving or pushing forward the show\'s themes. The cast of Yuri Kuma suffers greatly from this dilemma, since none of the characters feel human or even fleshed out for that matter. They come across as lifeless mouthpieces and ideological symbols which negate any sort of attachment or concern for their well-being. The focus is placed more on solving the hidden allegorical message than the characters that are directly affected by it.  This isn\'t to say their involvement isn\'t essential, since it truly is, but because of the highly conceptual setting, they\'re reduced to being a part of the symbolic devices instead of being characters independent of it.In short, they\'re simply lifeless puppets being tugged to the tune of Ikuhara\'s madness.Enjoyment: 6/10Outside of figuring out the hidden messages, I can\'t say this was an experience that brought me great pleasure or entertainment. It was certainly a unique and left-field way to approach a topic but didn\'t do anything to grip me outside of providing something to think about a few minutes after completion.Overall: 6.5/10In order to appreciate the show, it should be noted that almost everything is metaphorical, from physical objects in the show to even characters. Nothing is (or should be) taken at face value. Most of the enjoyment for the series comes from deciphering it but in terms of viewer engagement, it\'s greatly lacking. If you\'re seeking something to get your brain running by testing your analytical skills then this is a nice brain workout but if you\'re seeking anything else you might not find it here. the creator behind them but in the anime industry, some giants have made a very noticeable signature or trademark style when it comes to their works.

Or every time you hear of a celebrity publicly apologizing for making derogatory remarks against homosexuality. Societal mistreatment and exclusion is something that\'s been relevant for as long as the conflict existed. Yuri Kuma tackles this by using the ""mob"" mentality. When the majority forces the minority to either conform or be rejected. Although this conflict could have been handled with more tact in Yuri Kuma, they did get their point across clearly. With such an interesting setup this became a rare case where the antagonist is society itself and not just an individual.Art/Animation: 6/10The art and animation left nothing to really be desired. Often inconsistent and greatly lacking in fluidity it feels like it was put together on a shoestring budget. Needless to say, you\'re not watching this show for top-tier quality. The highlight lies with the character designs themselves as they are very distinctive from other shows. They carry a personality of their own and it shows when needed. This felt like more of a passion project that the studio knew wasn\'t going to sell well but something they wanted to do regardless. Despite the lack of consistency, the charm is certainly there. The setting itself was interesting but often muddled, felt like too much saturation of objects was placed in every frame. It certainly captures your attention but is quickly desensitized due to the constant bombardment of color and clunky set pieces. It isn\'t inherently a bad thing but certainly a hindrance at times.Sound: 6.5/10The opening can best be described as Honey synth-pop. With soft vocals and hints of sexualized undertones by the performer. It\'s a nice addition to the show and a good way to get kick-started into every episode. It\'s certainly one I found myself listening to every time. It may be typical but that isn\'t a bad thing when given the content and presentation to the show it corresponds to. Unfortunately, the rest of the OST was left concealed in the background and did nothing to stand out. None of the tracks really grip you or enhance the scenes they correspond with, they felt off in the distance and takes no risk in standing out. It\'s tracks that played it safe which resulted in nothing memorable to take away from it. The voice actors on the other hand were a real treat at times. Standouts being the Judge and court representatives ""SHABADABA DOO"".Characters: 6/10Remember the ""Everything is good in moderation"" quote, well that\'s something Ikuhara never seem to comprehend.You see the problem some metaphorical/conceptual shows face is that they more than often sacrifice proper characterization to stay thematically sound. This results in characters that become an embodiment of a ideology, which in turn make them only necessary when serving or pushing forward the show\'s themes. The cast of Yuri Kuma suffers greatly from this dilemma, since none of the characters feel human or even fleshed out for that matter. They come across as lifeless mouthpieces and ideological symbols which negate any sort of attachment or concern for their well-being. The focus is placed more on solving the hidden allegorical message than the characters that are directly affected by it.  This isn\'t to say their involvement isn\'t essential, since it truly is, but because of the highly conceptual setting, they\'re reduced to being a part of the symbolic devices instead of being characters independent of it.In short, they\'re simply lifeless puppets being tugged to the tune of Ikuhara\'s madness.Enjoyment: 6/10Outside of figuring out the hidden messages, I can\'t say this was an experience that brought me great pleasure or entertainment. It was certainly a unique and left-field way to approach a topic but didn\'t do anything to grip me outside of providing something to think about a few minutes after completion.Overall: 6.5/10In order to appreciate the show, it should be noted that almost everything is metaphorical, from physical objects in the show to even characters. Nothing is (or should be) taken at face value. Most of the enjoyment for the series comes from deciphering it but in terms of viewer engagement, it\'s greatly lacking. If you\'re seeking something to get your brain running by testing your analytical skills then this is a nice brain workout but if you\'re seeking anything else you might not find it here.', 'Yuri Kuma Arashi is to me the anime version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. That may seem to be a completely bizarre, nonsensical comparison, but there is one shared trait between the two that supersedes in value every single trait they don\'t share: each story is written by a director who is clearly creative, intelligent, and has a lot of talent and great ideas but is so absorbed in delivering some metaphysical message or lump of symbolism he forgets the prime element of storytelling is... *gasp* the story! (Shock! Kuma shock!) Due to the radical focus on the message, the actual execution is so wildly...insipid it bored the ever-living hell out of me.Honestly, I hated this. There\'re a lot of things I appreciate about the show: the soundtrack is uniquely composed, enjoyable, and fits the tone of the series; ""Ano Mori de Matteru"" is arguably the greatest anime opening I\'ll ever witness and even the ending theme is catchy; the art direction is outlandish and nearly surreal yet creative and pleasing; the mantra-like dialogue is so quotable (perhaps for ironic reasons) it\'s meme-worthy (shabadadoo); episode 4 contained a genuinely great mini-story; and the series wrapped up nicely—I was still bored out of my skull for a large portion of the finale, but I nonetheless appreciate how it ended. The problem is the narrative itself removed from its theme is so uninspired, bland and poorly executed I could hardly stand to watch 85% of the series due to how ridiculously monotonous and tired it is; by relying heavily on its flamboyant, eccentric style, it attempts to disguise the fact the plot bears no substance (pun intended), but this only highlights what a pretentious mess this series is.It doesn\'t help that I literally could not give a fuck less about a single one of the characters (except Life Sexy maybe because lulz). Seriously, every single character and story element in this bloody show exists as a pillar to support its message or symbolism. With characters in particular, it is important to give them life, not just let them exist as devices to accomplish a greater deed. These characters have no life. They are cardboard themes and nothing more.Maybe if I remotely cared about the message it\'s attempting to convey (I don\'t), the fact that this show has no real story or characters wouldn\'t have mattered to me and I still could\'ve been absorbed in tearing off the mundane superficial cover and feast upon its more elaborate innards. Unfortunately, I still watch anime for its plot and characters, not for social justice propaganda. insipid it bored the ever-living hell out of me.Honestly, I hated this.

But when you think about it, there is a lot more to it than at first perceived. Love can be used to bring someone wonderful happiness or utter sadness. Love can make you extremely nervous or completely at ease. Love can even be used to bring about total beauty or despondent sin. This omnipresent feeling is incredibly complex, being something that everyone feels in one form or another. Ultimately, though, it is a good feeling. But much like the symbols that this anime thrives on, its meaning morphs depending on...the context. In other words, love is like a symbol where all of its roads, all of its interpretations, lead to a solitary destination. Yuri Kuma Arashi is founded on both love and symbolism, creating what can only be coined a masterpiece.STORYYKA (the acronym of choice from here on out) stars Tsubaki Kureha, who is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her female classmate, Izumino Sumika. However, following the latter’s tragic death, Yurishiro Ginko and Yurigasaki Lulu — two bears having crossed the “Wall of Severance” — begin to protect the now lonely Kureha from the “Invisible Storm.” All in the name of “never giving up on love.”From this tiny description alone, it becomes rather apparent that YKA isn’t anything like other anime around it. The show does warn you about the direction it will be taking — the title of the anime is literally “Lesbian Bear Storm” — but even then, as one begins to partake in what it has to offer, it seems to come off as almost incoherent. What is the “Exclusion Ceremony?” Why are there bears disguising themselves as humans? How in the world is the “Severance Court” logical? It’s not until one realizes that the show does all of its explaining through symbolism that things go from being annoyingly complicated to astoundingly genius. For this is arguably YKA’s strongest point: every single aspect of the show has meaning or purpose. It doesn’t matter what is chosen — be it the constant flashbacks, a portion of a character’s name, or even a common flower — everything is symbolic. But more importantly than just having a myriad of symbols, for any show can generate them, what YKA does with the symbols is simple yet remarkable. And that is fully supporting the themes it presents.The themes, like the symbols, are not just interesting but also difficult. Difficult in the sense that they are rarely touched on or investigated in anime let alone other mediums. YKA sets its sights on three distinct motifs: sociopolitical commentary on the perceptions of prejudice, specifically in regards to sexual discrimination and racism; telling a complex yet richly unique love story; and challenging religious connotations associated with preconceived beliefs. These themes sound menacing, which is why the symbols exist to aid in the understanding of the ideas that are being tackled. The anime very early on starts with a look at prejudice and what it means in relation to society as a whole. The first half of the show focuses mostly on sexual discrimination, using female homosexuality as its example of choice. Many of the symbols presented, such as Kureha’s preference for “shiokara spaghetti” symbolizing her homosexual tendencies, Harishima’s hypocritical sex highlighting society’s often unfair criticisms, and Reia’s picture book The Moon Girl and The Forest Girl demonstrating how such love is hard to obtain but within the realm of possibility; each provides the audience with the ability to see that YKA views such prejudice as not just wrong but evil. The second half does the same, but instead using racism rather than sexual discrimination. The war that occurs on “The Day of Severance” shows the hatred between those who are humans and those who are bears, Yuriika’s red boxes symbolize her ingrained sense of oppression, and Ooki’s harsh treatment towards the bears showcase the shift in narrative focus while still maintaining the stance that prejudice only brings about harm to those it is targeted at.YKA doesn’t just stop with prejudice; it also tackles yet another controversial topic in the form of religion. Essentially, the anime denounces what such affiliations often teach. Once again, many of the symbols used back such arguable claims. Kureha’s birthday “party” being mired in religion’s often violent behavior, the bears’ religious fanaticism in their devotion to Lady Kumalia, and the human girls not believing in anything but the “invisible atmosphere”; such scenes paint religion as this toxic entity that, like prejudice, only seems to bring about harm to those that completely follow or abstain from that kind of thinking. In other words, the anime wants you to have beliefs, but in the one variable, the one idea, that, no matter what, always remains true. And this idea is none other than love itself. YKA presents love as something that should not only be strived for but also something that should never be forgotten. Because despite all of the sin that may form as a result of fighting for pure love — whether it is Ginko’s overwhelmingly selfish desire to have Kureha all to herself or Kureha’s childish pride getting the best of her unknowingly — love is, even with all of its flaws, something good. That is, the solution to all of the prejudice, all of the violence, and all of the hate, is love. It’s the emotion that anyone, no matter our ethnicity, creed, or background, can understand.ANIMATIONMuch of what YKA does in terms of style, art, and overall direction is the prevalent tactic of mirroring. Mirroring here involves the idea of showcasing “the same, but different” events or moments. Mitsuko’s black bed of sin and Yuriika’s nighttime attack against Kureha, within the same episode, is a fantastic example of such a move. The dichotomy of the situations is great enough to see their individual importance yet simultaneously similar enough to establish connections between these separate parts. Such connections then bring about stronger bonds in relation to the symbols and subsequently the themes, too. Along these same lines, the majority of the shots within the anime are done focusing on the center. Rarely will the show deviate from this formula; nearly everything shown is placed in the middle of the frame. Such camera work makes not only whatever is happening on-screen grab your attention but also applies its own form of mirroring that the show is so fond of.The character designs for the anime are both nicely done and thematically symbolic of what each person represents, the messages they convey, and the kind of love they embody. Lulu’s wavy twin-tails, green colored attire, and expressive faces symbolize her as not just the comic relief girl but also as someone whose previous greediness gave way to unfettered charity. Ai’s simplistic yet balanced design hold connotations in relation to the show’s purpose of having society come together through unification. And even insignificant ones such as Katyusha and Eriko were crafted in such a way as to make it clear how unimportant they are in the overall show.Finally, actual animation for YKA is always above average. This is mainly due to the rather “simplistic” art of the anime itself; by presenting the show in a fashion comparable to the picture book within the anime — more mirroring — it uses softer shades and water color-esque backgrounds that lends itself to less rigorous frames. Characters are always moving fluidly when in human form, bear form, or the human-bear combo; the CG usage is appropriate yet minimal; and the anime’s diverse scenarios — Kureha’s cleansing summons, Ginko’s backstory, Lulu’s escape, etc. — provide the anime with ample opportunities to enact the “show; don’t tell” philosophy that it and its symbols utilize.CHARACTERSYKA’s symbolism doesn’t end with the plot or the animation. The characters likewise see symbolic purpose within the show. While the side cast is as important as the mains — more specifically, Sumika, Mitsuko, and Yuriika — the coverage here will be on the big three; namely, Kureha, Ginko, and Lulu.Now one of my all-time favorite characters, Lulu is a girl whose past is filled with loneliness. Taking on the form of a bee, her attitude in life caused by the position she held made her ambivalent towards anyone and anything around her. She had everything she could ever ask for, but still felt incomplete. And when her little brother Mirun “stole” her status, she turned her self-loathing into hatred, into desire, to remove the person responsible for taking that which she, ironically, didn’t truly care for. It’s not until Mirun dies that she understands the folly of her ways and the love she couldn’t see due to being blinded by hatred. When she is found by Ginko, she has a change of heart: she becomes the best “wing girl (bear)” anime has ever seen. Helping to save Kureha from the “Invisible Storm” daily, treating Ginko’s wounds when she undergoes duress; Lulu transitions from avoiding love to fighting for and protecting it. Yet, her greediness still comes through when betraying Ginko, reinforcing love’s complex structure. But in the end, she maintains her newfound philanthropy, sacrificing herself to save not just her love, but her lover’s love, from being eliminated. Lulu’s final act of love was not only the least greedy move conceived but also earned her the title of “true friend.”As a staunch defender of love, Ginko refuses to let go of the feelings she had with the girl who, mirroring Ginko’s own help, saved her from being “The Lone Wolfsbane.” Ginko initially looked to Lady Kumalia as the person to save her from the loneliness she felt, but it was Kureha who gave her the love she always wanted. Years later, Ginko then sets out to do the same: protect Kureha from anything that would potentially ruin her. But as we see, Ginko’s pride, her desire, had always loomed over her; while she most certainly wanted to reciprocate the love she had felt, it was for selfish reasons as opposed to doing it for the good of love. Even her treatment of Lulu, ignoring Lulu’s advances and emotions outright, was performed only because she wanted nothing else but Kureha’s love. And when Ginko’s literal criminal activity — her “killing” of Sumika — is revealed to the woman she values most, she takes the bullet she knew she had to, but still devolves into a mindset where only lust resides. But to her, “love is the real thing,” so she fights back, overcomes her instinctual habits, and does what she should have done the entire time: love Kureha not for herself, but for the girl who “loved her from the beginning.”As the star (and more contextually, the moon) of the anime, Kureha undergoes the largest development throughout YKA. In the beginning, Kureha’s motivations are just, to an extent; that is, while she, too, fights for the love she holds dear, she shuns anyone else from getting near her person. But this makes sense, given her situation: the girls ostracize both her and Sumika, causing her to gain huge mistrust for others. Combined with the recent bear attacks, she feels desperate, wanting nothing more than to have back the girl who loved her so much. Which is where Ginko comes in; Ginko’s constant support for Kureha breaks the girl’s outer shell, slowly but surely, until Kureha has her own revelation. She discovers that it was her selfish pride that made her forget the girl who had always been there watching over her. Sumika’s love was good as well, but it wasn’t so much the love she gave to Kureha that mattered but instead what it taught her. And that is that true love always exists. Thus, Kureha chooses to literally transform herself from human to bear. She realizes that love isn’t about the sex or race one is; love transcends boundaries, differences, and walls because love is simply good.What we see among all of the girls here — Kureha, Ginko, and Lulu — are many of the same traits. All three experience loneliness, selfishness, and sin in one way or another. Hearkening back to the talk about animation, the idea of mirroring occurs here without end. And it’s not just these three; many of the characters have gluttony, envy, and wrath caused by any number of moments — abandonment, ignorance, jealousy, etc. But once again, this falls in line with the anime’s take on mirroring; while love is ultimately something that should be obtained and given, it is not without its own sin. Most important of all, and what our three main characters here demonstrate, is that love has only one weakness: you. Lulu’s indirect death of Mirun, Ginko’s inaction that killed Sumika, and Kureha’s own inability to understand love makes it undeniably clear that love can defeat anything, as long as you yourself allow it to happen.SOUNDThe opening theme for YKA is a beautiful arrangement that is, like the show itself, extremely unique. The sultry whispering, the choir singing, and the French lyrics fill the piece with a wonderfully calm and sensual feeling. In contrast, the ending theme is quick, jumpy, and fun, making it both catchy to the ear and the mind. What’s fascinating about the OP and ED, though, is not just their sound, but how they continue the mirroring that has been reiterated both here and within the anime. It’s not just in the tone, too: the pieces are (coincidentally) found at the beginning and ending of the show; the “singers” alternate — Kureha is the focal point for the OP, Ginko for the ED; and the lines of each song follow particular scenes from YKA, messages that the anime advocates, and even have purposeful word reuse between them. In short, even the OP and ED are symbolic tools for the anime.The original soundtrack continues this same trend. All of the pieces have their titles being given meaning depending on the situation — for example, “Yuri Rabrinsu” is Mitsuko’s theme song, a literal lesbian love labyrinth. Others maintain the show’s religious undertones — “Yuri Shounin!” plays a portion of the “Ave Maria,” the world-renowned Virgin Mary prayer. Yet others still hold contextual relevancy — “Futari no Mirai” is a stunning track that plays during the saddest of moments and mirrors the scenarios it is played during. Each song isn’t just wonderfully composed; they are all, once again, their own symbols that reinforce all of what YKA does.Voice-acting sees above average performances for everyone involved. Nozomi Yamane as Kureha for both her first major role and her great range, Miho Arakawa as Ginko for her “growling,” and Yushiko Ikuta as Lulu for her perky way of speaking each deserve their own, individual shout-outs.ENJOYMENTI’m a fan of “yuri” content; so seeing it throughout the show here in a tasteful manner was a definite boon. The comedy of the anime is likewise just as great; I still, to this day, think back to Lulu’s over-the-top murdering of her little brother, with her screaming “Die!” and “Desire!” only to have Mirun show back up with a huge smile on his face, and it always makes me chuckle. Lulu carries the majority of the comedy with her, but Ginko isn’t averse to it either. Her delusions, and especially the bath scene, were downright hilarious to watch. And on top of all that, the romance the anime offered was amazing. I seem to gravitate towards unorthodox couples, and Kureha and Ginko’s relationship is no different. So watching all of their efforts, all of their love, coalesce as one made me extremely happy to see.The show not only resounded with me on a personal level, but it also allowed me to flourish as a writer. Over the past two months, dissecting nearly everything that it contained, all of the research that I did, and the words that I wrote; this is an anime that will forever be something that I can look back on and say to myself, “This was the anime that elevated my prowess in writing beyond my wildest imaginations.” It’s a show that I’ve fallen in love with, and, like the characters and their love, is an anime that I’ll never forget.Yuri Kuma Arashi is a special show. Not just because of the lesbians, the bears, and the storms; but because it accomplished everything that it set out to do. The symbolism is masterful, the themes are profound, and the execution is impeccable. It’s not everyday that one gets to witness something so perfect unfold.But this season, I did just that.SummaryStory: Great, incredibly unique, symbolically powerful, thematically astoundingAnimation: Great, excellent art style and direction, very nice and purposeful character designs, above average actual animationCharacters: Great, Kureha, Ginko, Lulu, and the rest of the cast symbolize and mirror loveSound: Great, fantastic OP, ED, and soundtrack, with above-average VA workEnjoyment: Great, “yuri,” comedy, romance, and personal improvement makes this an anime that will stay with me foreverFinal Score: 10/10 the context.

Which is where Ginko comes in; Ginko’s constant support for Kureha breaks the girl’s outer shell, slowly but surely, until Kureha has her own revelation. She discovers that it was her selfish pride that made her forget the girl who had always been there watching over her. Sumika’s love was good as well, but it wasn’t so much the love she gave to Kureha that mattered but instead what it taught her. And that is that true love always exists. Thus, Kureha chooses to literally transform herself from human to bear. She realizes that love isn’t about the sex or race one is; love transcends boundaries, differences, and walls because love is simply good.What we see among all of the girls here — Kureha, Ginko, and Lulu — are many of the same traits. All three experience loneliness, selfishness, and sin in one way or another. Hearkening back to the talk about animation, the idea of mirroring occurs here without end. And it’s not just these three; many of the characters have gluttony, envy, and wrath caused by any number of moments — abandonment, ignorance, jealousy, etc. But once again, this falls in line with the anime’s take on mirroring; while love is ultimately something that should be obtained and given, it is not without its own sin. Most important of all, and what our three main characters here demonstrate, is that love has only one weakness: you. Lulu’s indirect death of Mirun, Ginko’s inaction that killed Sumika, and Kureha’s own inability to understand love makes it undeniably clear that love can defeat anything, as long as you yourself allow it to happen.SOUNDThe opening theme for YKA is a beautiful arrangement that is, like the show itself, extremely unique. The sultry whispering, the choir singing, and the French lyrics fill the piece with a wonderfully calm and sensual feeling. In contrast, the ending theme is quick, jumpy, and fun, making it both catchy to the ear and the mind. What’s fascinating about the OP and ED, though, is not just their sound, but how they continue the mirroring that has been reiterated both here and within the anime. It’s not just in the tone, too: the pieces are (coincidentally) found at the beginning and ending of the show; the “singers” alternate — Kureha is the focal point for the OP, Ginko for the ED; and the lines of each song follow particular scenes from YKA, messages that the anime advocates, and even have purposeful word reuse between them. In short, even the OP and ED are symbolic tools for the anime.The original soundtrack continues this same trend. All of the pieces have their titles being given meaning depending on the situation — for example, “Yuri Rabrinsu” is Mitsuko’s theme song, a literal lesbian love labyrinth. Others maintain the show’s religious undertones — “Yuri Shounin!” plays a portion of the “Ave Maria,” the world-renowned Virgin Mary prayer. Yet others still hold contextual relevancy — “Futari no Mirai” is a stunning track that plays during the saddest of moments and mirrors the scenarios it is played during. Each song isn’t just wonderfully composed; they are all, once again, their own symbols that reinforce all of what YKA does.Voice-acting sees above average performances for everyone involved. Nozomi Yamane as Kureha for both her first major role and her great range, Miho Arakawa as Ginko for her “growling,” and Yushiko Ikuta as Lulu for her perky way of speaking each deserve their own, individual shout-outs.ENJOYMENTI’m a fan of “yuri” content; so seeing it throughout the show here in a tasteful manner was a definite boon. The comedy of the anime is likewise just as great; I still, to this day, think back to Lulu’s over-the-top murdering of her little brother, with her screaming “Die!” and “Desire!” only to have Mirun show back up with a huge smile on his face, and it always makes me chuckle. Lulu carries the majority of the comedy with her, but Ginko isn’t averse to it either. Her delusions, and especially the bath scene, were downright hilarious to watch. And on top of all that, the romance the anime offered was amazing. I seem to gravitate towards unorthodox couples, and Kureha and Ginko’s relationship is no different. So watching all of their efforts, all of their love, coalesce as one made me extremely happy to see.The show not only resounded with me on a personal level, but it also allowed me to flourish as a writer. Over the past two months, dissecting nearly everything that it contained, all of the research that I did, and the words that I wrote; this is an anime that will forever be something that I can look back on and say to myself, “This was the anime that elevated my prowess in writing beyond my wildest imaginations.” It’s a show that I’ve fallen in love with, and, like the characters and their love, is an anime that I’ll never forget.Yuri Kuma Arashi is a special show. Not just because of the lesbians, the bears, and the storms; but because it accomplished everything that it set out to do. The symbolism is masterful, the themes are profound, and the execution is impeccable. It’s not everyday that one gets to witness something so perfect unfold.But this season, I did just that.SummaryStory: Great, incredibly unique, symbolically powerful, thematically astoundingAnimation: Great, excellent art style and direction, very nice and purposeful character designs, above average actual animationCharacters: Great, Kureha, Ginko, Lulu, and the rest of the cast symbolize and mirror loveSound: Great, fantastic OP, ED, and soundtrack, with above-average VA workEnjoyment: Great, “yuri,” comedy, romance, and personal improvement makes this an anime that will stay with me foreverFinal Score: 10/10', ""Very lengthy review!Warning: Spoilers present (but no detailed spoiler present).Now, how do we review a show that>is so unique that it's almost absurd>has very polarized views>is hard to review without spoiling detailed stuff?Answer: To be in the sexy way....Get what I mean? Bet you don't. I don't either.OK seriously:To review this show, simply trying to interpret all the symbols is not enough. More analysis must be done on whether the symbols are portrayed well, and whether the plot & characters are well done.Now first, about how much you would expect: Don't expect a flawless masterpiece or you would likely be disappointed, and of course don't expect too little because after all it's Ikuhara.Yuri Kuma Arashi, as an Ikuhara work, is all about symbolism, mostly criticism on various aspects of 'yuri'.--Settings--Literal:So one day some meteor(planet?) falls on Earth and bears start to attack humans and... Never mind.Actual:The MC girls live in a world surrounded by hypocritic homophobic lesbians and yandere lesbians and... Wow, judging from this description sounds like homo is sin itself.'Yuri ga Aku da!'(百合が悪だ！)The only way to get true yuri love is to stay away from all those sins.So done with the settings and that brings us to the next part:--Design, and Portrayal of Symbols-->The homophobia part:It plays a good role being satirical, but when this symbol turns blatant it gets dull and only serves as something to ignite viewers' hatred towards the homophobes. (I advise viewers to view the homophobe part rationally.)One of the good points the anime brings up is that 'Homophobia is just like the cycle of life', and also one certain character gets a deeper look. But still, those are not enough. Homophobia is criticised but not looked into properly, instead it mostly gets a typical portrayal of 'bad guys(girls/bears to be exact)' in anime.Yeah, that's how you criticise a certain group of people: By writing a story and portraying all those people as morbid idiots without sanity. It's satirical, but unrealisitic at the same time.Also it seems as if the homophobes exclude not only lesbians but also non-homophobes. It may serve its own purpose being satirical, but I don't see this being an actual case in real life. Maybe in Japan it is the case???>How to face a homophobic environment:Still quite good, but obviously imperfect since it's still potentially resourceful.The story leaves the MCs with a dilemma: whether to hide their own feelings or to hit the society in its face. This part is good.But the 'at what cost' (if you hit the society in its face) part is underdeveloped. To be precise: if you hit the society in its face society will hit you back, of course. But what's more important, in real life FAMILY MEMBERS are often likely to shown little tolerance to your decision for moral reasons etc. Without your family members you have little to fear, but what if you do have to face the family vs love decision?If you've watched the show, you'll find that this part is underdeveloped. For those who may argue that this dilemma is present in a certain episode, no, it is not present there.The fact is, if you look at it seriously, the whole point about 'love vs reality' in the anime is even somewhat biased since it appears as if the anime is telling us that 'reality is bullcrap, so forget this reality stuff already'. Is this a step in the right direction? Nah, it's a step in the 'other' wrong direction.Let's take a look at what Ikuhara actually thinks of this matter:Quote (from Ikuhara, translated by me so probably inaccuracies):Ikuhara K.: I've found that people tend to have increasing desire to be 'liked'(i.e. the 'like' function in certain SNS sites). ...Of course, to have such desire isn't necessarily a bad thing; I want to be 'liked' too. But at the same time somewhere in my heart whispers 'you don't need such thing!' But if you really don't need it, can you live on your own then? ...It's not that I want to judge if this is good or bad, but that we should be self-aware of said fact. If we jump to the conclusion 'it's bad!' and live a counterproductive way, we're being self-deceiving. But the awareness of such fact should lead us into thinking 'what is it that we cherish'.FANTASTIC interpretation. But how does the anime go wrong when it does bring up Ikuhara's interpretation?Here's how: Since the society is depicted as a society screwed beyond reason, and with the MCs 'deprived of' their close relatives (Note: technically they may exist, but either have or show no importance in the MCs' lives), they don't actually need to face a strong dilemma and the only things they need to do are 1, to have the courage and 2, to survive from the executioners.>The judges:Some say they reflect the otakus' perception on yuri, some others say the judges are the dictators of the world(or patriarchy) and reflect the ruling class of the real world. But both interpretations are flawed imo. Judges = otakus? Is it that otakus rule the world or something? Not. Judges = real world rulers/patriarchy? In this interpretation some certain events/facts about the judges (which only serve as plot devices) become nonsensical in real life.So I can't really say much, and personally I suggest that the judgmens = patriarchy and do reflect some bad perceptions of yuri, but are not well-designed as a symbol particularly due to some events in the anime. If you have a more convincing interpretation, tell me.>Yuri as a Genre:This is one complex problem to discuss, so here I'm going to pick one specific problem:Fanservice: Satire or Overkill?I suggest that it's both.Some say that two points contribute to the anime's massive insertion of lewd scenes: 1, lesbians are fetishised and often treated as sources of (male gaze) fanservice, and 2, lesbian sex are often viewed as more indecent than hetero sex. Thus by inserting lewd scenes making them commonplace, the anime tells people that 'these scenes are nothing abnormal, stop giving them strange looks'.Now first, I find these points to make some sense. However, it is NIGH IMPOSSIBLE for any viewer not being distracted by the scenes in the first place. Furthermore, making lewd scenes&events (EVEN ASSAULTS!) commonplace seems to tell the viewers that for a lot of lesbians, their desires for sex are present anytime and are likely to dominate their motives for actions. So it's still overkill, in my humble opinion.And after all, even though the fanservice may turn some people off, it's still fanservice and does attract male gaze.>Minor symbols:They are scattered everywhere throughout the anime. They can be fun to interpret, but don't add a lot of bonus points to the show's rating, and sometimes the presence of those symbols can add some frustration.A particularly good symbol is 'how sex being treated unequally lead to horrifying consequences'. The most well-designed symbol in the anime, personally speaking. Hints about sexual liberation are good too.As for some other symbols such as the true meaning of the promised kiss (specifically: in the culmination of the Lulu arc), I doubt if what they reflect are actually positive in real life, though.Symbol Design & Portrayal: 7/10--Story--The main problem with the story is that it's rather messed up. Many parts are even messed up intentionally to confuse the viewers at first glance, but serve no extra purpose.The storytelling is a love it or hate it thing. For me, I find the storytelling barely acceptable. The earlier episodes are typical examples of how the storytelling can turn people off.As for the story, it's good for the most part, but for some points.Before we name some of the improvable points in the storyline, I shall point out that many parts of the story are UNRESOLVED (to be exact 'underresolved').(Rule for unsound storyline in YKA:If a part of the story technically doesn't make sense but doesn't create a flaw in the points the anime tries to deliver, this isn't considered unsound.Illustrative examples:'Why didn't they shoot her instead of waiting her to complete her speech?' This is not unsound.'Why didn't they shoot her when they didn't hesitate to shoot another character?' This is very flawed, but borderline sound.'Why, in a case where timing was of importance in its meaning as it could explain other people's motives, didn't they shoot her, while in the equivalent case IRL, people around her would not hesitate to do anything to stand in her way?' This is unsound.The above events may or may not happen in the anime.)Some other improvable points:>What is it that you mean love?The show's portrayal of this is unique but flawed nontheless. The show has shown and made mockery on many bad perceptions of love, but the ending isn't completely satisfying judging from this point. I mean, how can MC1 accept MC2 that easily after some certain event that is due to MC2's wrongdoing? (This is not the problem with the ending itself though.) Even when the show tries to forgive MC2 this problem still stands. A typical example of the symbols not being transcribed well.And this is quite ironic: The show has tried to criticise 'love is based on possessiveness'... until the ending, which, if you connect it with the previous events, actually indicates that being possessive is not a bad thing after all, it's all about who laughs last rather than who truly knows love. Just look at the pitiful deaths someone who truly know love deserve!BTW, what is it that I think of love? In my opinion, love is not only based on feelings but also trust. (How can trust be kept if one does such things to hurt the one she loves, simply out of jealousy?) And also the best state of a couple should be when their characters are complementary. Etc. So there are many ways to exploit 'love', and YKA is not doing the best job with it.>Higher level of existance?You can interpret them as dead or not, but in both interpretations, this part is cliched.What's worse, Ikuhara seems to have contradicted his own statement: 'To completely ignore other people and live a counterproductive way is self-deceiving'. The only purpose the two serves, for the society, is to act as a symbol--a middle finger to the screwed-up society, and nothing else. So basically the way they choose is counterproductive in all other ways, and again it seems to encourage an unreasonable way to deal with the previously said dilemma IRL.Now, why is the plot inferior to the symbols? One of the reasons is that everything in this anime is meant to serve the symbols.e.g.: In the first example given, jealousness is meant to bring up a false perception of love that the show wants to criticise, but unfortunately, to conclude stuff the MC2's wrongdoings must be forgiven. In the second example, the higher level of existance thing is meant to make mockery on the point 'for homo love, love and reality cannot coexist', but ended up being not successful enough.Story: 6.5/10--Characters--Weakest aspect in the anime. Besides the main cast, other characters mostly serve symbolic purposes: In order to bring up the themes, many characters, potentially resourceful, are wasted and underdeveloped.Even the MCs suffer from not having interesting/memorable traits, one exception being Lulu.This is why the show would likely be better had it been 2 seasons instead of 1.To name a few characters:Haris**** K****: The show spends a good portion on her actions, but aside from fueling viewers' hatred towards homophobes, what other purpose does this character serve? And plus she could have had a backstory, but the fact is she doesn't have one in the anime. Hell, even her symbolic purpose is too insignificant.MC1: Being the MC, she undergoes little character development in the earlier episodes. Even when she does undergo character development in the later eps, the development still seems more of something symbolic.Now, there is this masterpiece called The Hunchback of Notre Dame written by Victor Hugo, and it has its own reasons to be a masterpiece: character-wise, the characters are not only symbolised but also very fleshed out. For example, the Archdeacon, Frollo, stands for one oppressed by asceticism and eventually driven to morbidity. While being symbolised, all his actions are very properly explained, and readers will find him 'a real human being' instead of simply 'a symbol'.Yuri Kuma Arashi, on the other hand, fails at this aspect. What this show desperately needs are more details on the characters themselves -- to let fleshed-out people and vivid events come to life, and thus let viewers fully accept the symbols. (Though the show is too short for what it aims to achieve, imho the story pacing is still rather improvable.)Characters: 5/10A few minor aspects:Sound: 7/10The OP stands out most, other tracks are of OK quality.Animation & Art: 7.5/10This is likely subjective opinion, but I find the animation quite good.The unique thing about it, is of course, the fact that almost every 10 seconds there will definitely be at least one symbol presented via the animation. Usually, these scenes are more abstract, which can turn people off sometimes. But overall, it's a pleasant experience.--Enjoyment Value--Not high enough, at least for me. It's inspiring to say the least, but this show requires you to come back to interpret it for a total of 6 hours before you can fully understand everything and eventually find that it's not as promising as it is advertised to be. (This is why some commentators called this anime an 'Ikuhara-ised Junkyard'. I don't like this name, but it isn't completely nonsensical)Also, since the anime's symbols are more ambiguous in the earlier episodes, it's not until the ending of the anime than you can finally start making your own thorough interpretations and analysis. The interesting fact is that even ANN commentators interpreted some symbols in the 'wrong' way, or at least not what they turned out to be.Enjoyment Value: 6/10--Inspiration Value--The inspiration value is off the charts. With such unique settings and all those symbols to work around with, there are a quintillion ways to make our own interpretations.My only complaint though is something about the settings: Homo vs Hetero(what society requires) = 'Same' vs 'Different', but Human-Bear vs Human-Human & Bear-Bear(what society requires) = 'Different' vs 'Same'? This made some other real-life problems among homosexual people hard to portray in the YKA settings. (I have been writing a doujinshi actually and I've found this problem to be a bit frustrating.)...Also, a curious point is that the literal 'homo relationship between girls' seems to be considered more 'natural' in the show, and this can also be quite of a barrier if one decided to write a fanfiction of it.Inspiration Value: 10/10Summary:Clarifying some points I previously made:>The points the anime tries to deliver are mostly good, but many are not looked into seriously. Flawed or not, every symbol is very inspiring.>The storytelling can really turn a lot of viewers off, even non-casual viewers.>The characters aren't developed enough, and are not really fleshed-out.OVERALL RATING: ...HOLD ON, ONE MORE THING!--What Does the Bear Say?--Translation: What subtle things does the show implicitly tell us?This question arose when I was writing my doujinshi for YKA.Now, as ironic the jealousy/possessiveness thing may get, we all know that the show has tried to criticise it.So exactly what does the show ENCOURAGE US to do?To completely turn your back on reality when it rejects your dream?To kill those bullies when the bullies bully your friend/lover? (The show has indirectly criticised this behaviour though)To ...That will not be the reasonable way!What we should learn from the show, is the signal of freedom and liberation over conventional social norms and order.But, do not pursue freedom, happiness etc., in an unreasonable way that is counterproductive to society and people close to you. Society is screwed beyond reason in YKA, but not in real life.As I've observed, many people enjoy climatic but irrational plot (and hence the 'why not kill those b*tches!' comments). Yeah, the plot should develop for sheer climax & joy, is it not?Unfortunately, Anderssen's 18.Bd6!? could be met with the cold 18. ...Qa1+ 19.Ke2 Qb2 20.Kd2 Bxg1 with an unclear position. And IRL, people directly following the MCs' footsteps on an impulse would likely find themselves facing hard-to-resolve difficulties and living a life not as happy as they once imagined.(Whether or not it is this part that boosted the unhelpful rate from 20% to the current unhelpful rate, I'm not going to remove this part.)In a word:Learn from the symbols, but not the actions.OVERALL RATING: 7/10 (for 'Great' in my scales)DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS ANIME? Yes, but keep yourself level-headed when watching it. Also, if you're still not into the show after Episode 4, it's likely not your taste, so don't force yourself to complete this.CLOSING WORDS:In a show that is meant to reflect real-life problems, anything that doesn't make sense in real life has its value halved.(Note: This review's helpful stats, along with those of some other reviews of this anime, has undergone some weird manipulation.On 22 Apr 2015, when MAL still had the unhelpful button, the helpful rate was at its highest point 17 out of 21, and then the review was bombed 11 consecutive unhelpfuls in 20 minutes, and probably 8 more on the next day.The highest observed helpful count was 44 (not long after MAL cancelled the unhelpful button), however recently as of 24 Dec 2016 the helpful count is observed to have DROPPED to 38.Show me how to cancel a review vote, anyone?The cause of this manipulation can not be confirmed. And out of all my reviews, only this review has undergone this manipulation.) Get what I mean? Bet you don't. I don't either.OK seriously:To review this show, simply trying to interpret all the symbols is not enough. More analysis must be done on whether the symbols are portrayed well, and whether the plot & characters are well done.Now first, about how much you would expect: Don't expect a flawless masterpiece or you would likely be disappointed, and of course don't expect too little because after all it's Ikuhara.Yuri Kuma Arashi, as an Ikuhara work, is all about symbolism, mostly criticism on various aspects of 'yuri'.--Settings--Literal:So one day some meteor(planet?) falls on Earth and bears start to attack humans and...

Hell, even her symbolic purpose is too insignificant.MC1: Being the MC, she undergoes little character development in the earlier episodes. Even when she does undergo character development in the later eps, the development still seems more of something symbolic.Now, there is this masterpiece called The Hunchback of Notre Dame written by Victor Hugo, and it has its own reasons to be a masterpiece: character-wise, the characters are not only symbolised but also very fleshed out. For example, the Archdeacon, Frollo, stands for one oppressed by asceticism and eventually driven to morbidity. While being symbolised, all his actions are very properly explained, and readers will find him 'a real human being' instead of simply 'a symbol'.Yuri Kuma Arashi, on the other hand, fails at this aspect. What this show desperately needs are more details on the characters themselves -- to let fleshed-out people and vivid events come to life, and thus let viewers fully accept the symbols. (Though the show is too short for what it aims to achieve, imho the story pacing is still rather improvable.)Characters: 5/10A few minor aspects:Sound: 7/10The OP stands out most, other tracks are of OK quality.Animation & Art: 7.5/10This is likely subjective opinion, but I find the animation quite good.The unique thing about it, is of course, the fact that almost every 10 seconds there will definitely be at least one symbol presented via the animation. Usually, these scenes are more abstract, which can turn people off sometimes. But overall, it's a pleasant experience.--Enjoyment Value--Not high enough, at least for me. It's inspiring to say the least, but this show requires you to come back to interpret it for a total of 6 hours before you can fully understand everything and eventually find that it's not as promising as it is advertised to be. (This is why some commentators called this anime an 'Ikuhara-ised Junkyard'. I don't like this name, but it isn't completely nonsensical)Also, since the anime's symbols are more ambiguous in the earlier episodes, it's not until the ending of the anime than you can finally start making your own thorough interpretations and analysis. The interesting fact is that even ANN commentators interpreted some symbols in the 'wrong' way, or at least not what they turned out to be.Enjoyment Value: 6/10--Inspiration Value--The inspiration value is off the charts. With such unique settings and all those symbols to work around with, there are a quintillion ways to make our own interpretations.My only complaint though is something about the settings: Homo vs Hetero(what society requires) = 'Same' vs 'Different', but Human-Bear vs Human-Human & Bear-Bear(what society requires) = 'Different' vs 'Same'? This made some other real-life problems among homosexual people hard to portray in the YKA settings. (I have been writing a doujinshi actually and I've found this problem to be a bit frustrating.)...Also, a curious point is that the literal 'homo relationship between girls' seems to be considered more 'natural' in the show, and this can also be quite of a barrier if one decided to write a fanfiction of it.Inspiration Value: 10/10Summary:Clarifying some points I previously made:>The points the anime tries to deliver are mostly good, but many are not looked into seriously. Flawed or not, every symbol is very inspiring.>The storytelling can really turn a lot of viewers off, even non-casual viewers.>The characters aren't developed enough, and are not really fleshed-out.OVERALL RATING: ...HOLD ON, ONE MORE THING!--What Does the Bear Say?--Translation: What subtle things does the show implicitly tell us?This question arose when I was writing my doujinshi for YKA.Now, as ironic the jealousy/possessiveness thing may get, we all know that the show has tried to criticise it.So exactly what does the show ENCOURAGE US to do?To completely turn your back on reality when it rejects your dream?To kill those bullies when the bullies bully your friend/lover? (The show has indirectly criticised this behaviour though)To ...That will not be the reasonable way!What we should learn from the show, is the signal of freedom and liberation over conventional social norms and order.But, do not pursue freedom, happiness etc., in an unreasonable way that is counterproductive to society and people close to you. Society is screwed beyond reason in YKA, but not in real life.As I've observed, many people enjoy climatic but irrational plot (and hence the 'why not kill those b*tches!' comments). Yeah, the plot should develop for sheer climax & joy, is it not?Unfortunately, Anderssen's 18.Bd6!? could be met with the cold 18. ...Qa1+ 19.Ke2 Qb2 20.Kd2 Bxg1 with an unclear position. And IRL, people directly following the MCs' footsteps on an impulse would likely find themselves facing hard-to-resolve difficulties and living a life not as happy as they once imagined.(Whether or not it is this part that boosted the unhelpful rate from 20% to the current unhelpful rate, I'm not going to remove this part.)In a word:Learn from the symbols, but not the actions.OVERALL RATING: 7/10 (for 'Great' in my scales)DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS ANIME? Yes, but keep yourself level-headed when watching it. Also, if you're still not into the show after Episode 4, it's likely not your taste, so don't force yourself to complete this.CLOSING WORDS:In a show that is meant to reflect real-life problems, anything that doesn't make sense in real life has its value halved.(Note: This review's helpful stats, along with those of some other reviews of this anime, has undergone some weird manipulation.On 22 Apr 2015, when MAL still had the unhelpful button, the helpful rate was at its highest point 17 out of 21, and then the review was bombed 11 consecutive unhelpfuls in 20 minutes, and probably 8 more on the next day.The highest observed helpful count was 44 (not long after MAL cancelled the unhelpful button), however recently as of 24 Dec 2016 the helpful count is observed to have DROPPED to 38.Show me how to cancel a review vote, anyone?The cause of this manipulation can not be confirmed. And out of all my reviews, only this review has undergone this manipulation.)"", 'When Kunihiko Ikuhara said he was going to make Yuri Kuma Arashi the self-titled ""Gundam of Yuri"" I was a bit spectacle of how something like that would turn out and if he could even pull off such an elaborate ploy.I was glad to find out that I was wrong.YKA is a 12 episode series by Silver Link and the basic story is about a young girl named Kureha who lives in a world where a giant ""Barrier of Severance"" divides humanity from the world of human-devouring bears who started to attack humans after a great meteor shower covered the lands. Two transfer students, who...are actually bears disguised as humans, named Ginko and Lulu then transfer into her class at school and start an uproar of mysterious tragedies, including the death of Kureha\'s lover Sumika. Kureha is then faced with trials questioning her true love and through it opens the truth of the world around her and that not everything is as she sees it.The story was very well done and the 12 episode format was great for developing the main characters as well as giving support characters great coverage to help move the story along, and like Gundam many people die. Art as well was very good and had a nice mix of traditional yuri manga styles as well as a blend of Ikuhara\'s own character style from the fashionable costumes to the mannerisms of the director\'s breed of sexiness.Sound design was definitely the highlight of YKA, as Yukari Hashimoto pulls of a fantastic score that even surpasses her last collaboration work with Ikuhara, Mawaru Penguindrum, and the editing was done superbly and really shaped the effect of the shots in each scene.The characters in general were enjoyable and interesting, however some characters aren\'t as fleshed out as others and they seem to come off as a 1 dimensional plot device rather then an independent character, however the number of those types are minimal and the lead players truly deserve praise.  Nozomi Yamane especially as Kureha and Aoi Yuuki as Mitsuko deserve high praise as they pull of fantastic emotional performances that really put them as some of my favorite female characters in anime and of course Penguindrum alumni Miho Arakawa was great as Ginko as was Lulu\'s VA Yoshiko Ikuta.In the end if I had to compare YKA to Ikuhara\'s other works I would say this was not as good as Utena, but definitely better then Penguindrum which I found to be dragging at later episodes. Regardless if your looking for a sexy and fun character driven show that will push your emotions to the brink and send you on a yuri space odyssey then I definitely recommend Yuri Kuma Arashi. are actually bears disguised as humans, named Ginko and Lulu then transfer into her class at school and start an uproar of mysterious tragedies, including the death of Kureha\'s lover Sumika.

This anime is a prime example of why people should not quit watching a non-linear show after the first few episodes.Art is outstanding – beautifully designed characters, colorful background, lots of attention to details and expression. The OP is good on its own; the soundtrack blends into the storytelling perfectly and doesn’t distract you.Despite all that, Yuri Kuma Arashi is definitely not an easy anime to watch. As many people may have noticed, the first three episodes – no, make it five episodes – had one of the highest WTF-per-minute factor. The story didn’t make any sense. Asteroid exploding, cute-looking bears uprising and...eating human, Kureha and her inexplicable not giving up on love… nothing seems to fit anywhere.Luckily, the murder of Sumika, the catchy OP, and the irresistible “Shabadadoo” of Junichi Suwabe kept me watching. And I felt so lucky I did. Since the way the story is told is similar to having a puzzle with pieces being revealed one at a time which, while confusing at first, once there are enough pieces, it makes your mind try to interpolate and fill in the unseen pieces. It is rewarding when you guessed the right missing piece; but Ikuhara’s genius directing piques your interest even more when you guessed it wrong. To that end, a fun game you can try for the first 5 episodes is to guess which characters are bears and which are humans.Did I mention that Life Sexy’s voice is aptly very sexy? His voice is so good that I have been eagerly waiting for the Judgement section of every episode. And episode 4 is worthy of several re-watches, because one just cannot get enough Shabadadoo.Don’t let the initial confusion shy you away from this otherwise great work of art. There are many things to enjoy in Yuri Kuma Arashi. eating human, Kureha and her inexplicable not giving up on love… nothing seems to fit anywhere.Luckily, the murder of Sumika, the catchy OP, and the irresistible “Shabadadoo” of Junichi Suwabe kept me watching.

There are many things to enjoy in Yuri Kuma Arashi.', 'Kunihiko Ikuhara sat down one day, picked up a Mad Libs book, and found his first prompt: ""Adjective, Noun, Noun.""  Of course, he chose ""Lesbian,"" ""Bear,"" and ""Storm"" as any normal and respectable individual would.Although it certainly might seem like Ikuhara just threw some words together to make this series, Yuri Kuma Arashi (Lesbian Bear Storm) is not a ""thrown-together"" series by a long shot.  Now please bear with me-- I promise the puns won\'t be this terrible-- for my take on YKA.Disclaimer: Although I am majorly biased towards Ikuhara (Utena and Penguindrum are my #1 and #2) I\'d like to think that...this review attempts to eliminate bias.  If my fanboyishness is too flamboyant in some areas, please tell me so I cna review that and correct it.STORY (9/10):I don\'t just hand out 9s for stories-- YKA has a damn good story to tell.  Contrary to what some other yuri shows might present us, YKA isn\'t just girls mashing their faces into one other (although that certainly does happen and is welcome, oh based Ikuhara).As with any Ikuhara show, YKA is riddled with extended metaphor, symbolism, various motifs, and a whole bunch of other fancy terms.  Don\'t get me wrong, they\'re all great and I like them a lot (the ones I picked up on, anyway.  There\'s plenty I missed, I\'m sure). However, YKA is great in that it\'s enjoyable even if you don\'t read heavily into the symbolism.  Despite it\'s somewhat outwardly wacky nature, it\'s a fairly accessible story, as opposed to a show like Utena.  Of course, some people are immediately turned off by any hints of symbolism, writing the show off as 3deep5me and cursing everyone who likes the show, calling them ""anime hipsters"" and the show ""pretentious.""  I don\'t really care.  We all have our own opinions, and I happen to enjoy the symbolism.Anyway, YKA boils down to a story about love, bullying, and society.  It doesn\'t take an Einstein to figure that out.  And despite a limited arsenal of 12 episodes to work with (as opposed to his 39 with Utena and 24 with Penguindrum), Ikuhara manages to seamlessly craft a heartwarming story with a few KUMA SHOCKS! along the way.  With a genius like Ikuhara writing, it\'s no wonder that the story is so good.ART (9/10):Ohmygawd was this show pretty.  So many scenes were screenshot worthy.  Every location, every surreal still shot... just gorgeous.  The characters all look brilliant.  The yuri is high def.  What more can you want?Just to drive it home a little more, when I say surreal, I mean surreal.  This god damned show freezes certain moments in time with some shots, mostly towards the end.  Bobduh\'s episodic screenshots capture most of them.SOUND (9/10):Soundtrack was great, too.  Ikuhara knows what he\'s doing so he knows when to play the music, etc. etc.  But wha really makes YKA stand out musically is its OP and ED.  Bonjour Suzuki does the OP and it is phenomenal.    Breathy singing is exactly what this show needed.  And it works so well.  The ED is a techno-sounding tune that\'s really upbeat.  It might be slightly generic, but it contrasted certain scenes EXTREMELY WELL.  I\'m not going to spoil a thing, but I was a bit listless after a certain scene nearing the end of an episode, then BOOM the first few notes start playing to confirm reality and shake everything back into existence.  I guess that might just be limited to a personal experience I had, but boy did I like that.CHARACTER (10/10):This category is really where any Ikuhara show excels.  YKA\'s characters are the backbone of the entire show.  The characterization and development of the three main characters (Kureha, Lulu, and Ginko)  is just stellar.  All three are so interesting, so unique, so... Ikuhara.  The interactions between these three characters are just fun to watch because of how well these characters are portrayed.  The three of them have overarching essences to their being that Ikuhara emphasizes with dialogue and actions.  For instance, Ginko initially acts out of pure desire.  Her desire is portrayed through her actions around Kureha, her ignoring of Lulu, etc.YKA also succeeds in making its other characters interesting.  Anthy 2.0-- excuse me, Sumika-- serves her purpose well (no other words on her).  The student council president is such a fun character.  All of the girls that lead the exclusion ceremonies are unique.  [Not really SPOILERS, as you\'ll have no idea what this is until it\'s literally right in front of you, but skip the next sentence if you\'re so inclined.] I cared about the girl in the van with the cyborg bear effortlessly, because just with all of the characters in YKA, Ikuhara makes the audience care about them.Uniqueness, archetypes, and the ability to make me give a damn? 10/10.ENJOYMENT (10/10):Okay, so the fanboy can\'t hide here.  This show has been the highlight of my week for the past 13 weeks (including the week with the interview).  I couldn\'t wait until Monday to watch my lesbian bears.This show is just so god-damned fun to watch.  Bias aside, with all of the aforementioned factors working together to create this beaut of a show, it\'s hard NOT to have fun.  Watching YKA unfold was bliss.  Watching it end was sad.OVERALL:Yuri Kuma Arashi gets a 9/10.  It\'s not a masterpiece, but it\'s a damn good show.WATCH OR DON\'T WATCH:With a 9/10, this should be accessible to all audiences, right?  I wish.  As much as I\'d like for this not to be true, technical greatness of this show aside, the symbolism can be a turn off for some.  Although YKA can still offer you a great story even if you don\'t read into it, this show is best enjoyed with some analysis and thought of what\'s going on.  I\'m not saying it\'s necessary to pick every symbol apart-- you\'ll go mad.  But I\'d say to watch this if you\'re willing to think.  If not, probably not the best choice.  Whatever your choice is, don\'t let others judge you.  That\' s the sexy way.  Shaba-da-doo. this review attempts to eliminate bias.

Shaba-da-doo.', ""To be honest, Yuri Kuma Arashi (Yuri Bear Storm) is one of those shows you’ll want to like or hate from the early start. Make no mistake, this is not your ordinary slice of life series or one of those shows where cute girls do cute things. To put it into easier perspective, Yuri Kuma Arashi appeals more to fans of surrealism, or those who seeks out more than just a plot and its characters. Symbolisms, foreshadowing, and many plot elements are exclusively packaged into this series that hits peculiarity from all directions.The show has this strange vibrant radiance to it. From the first few...episodes, it’s clear that there’s a lot of effort put in by Kunihiko Ikuhara. He directs this show with an idiosyncratic style and is easy to tell how vastly peculiar some episodes can be. There’s also that gleeful atmosphere throughout the entire series whether it’s the bear symbolism, motifs, or allusions. But for what’s worth, this series should be viewed as creative and thought provoking piece of work. Translated as “Yuri Bear Storm, it may take fans by storm just like that.Yuri Kuma is designed to seem complex but in reality has a meaningful tale to tell. It has a profoundly moving look at bears, an animal species that some people may have fascination about. The show begins with a fictional planet named “Kumalia” that exploded. The meteoroids that crashes onto earth manifests bears who has integrated themselves into human society. Except for one thing: they also like to feast and humanity seems to be one of their favorite meals on the menu. The show transits to the main characters who lives safely behind a protective barrier known as the Wall of Extinction. But one thing leads to another and we learn that bears have infiltrated the school to get a bite out of more humans. It’s up to Kureha to protect her girlfriend Sumika from becoming happy meal but not all seems easy. And by this point, you’re probably having a lot of thoughts on whether you should venture into this show further. Make no mistake, this series stretches beyond the boundaries of imaginations and easily takes risks. So if you’re really curious, then keep reading on.As a testament of Ikuhara, there’s a lot of symbolism combined with themes to illustrate the nature of this series. Love plays out as a prominent idea. In fact, there are several key catch phases in the show that capitalizes on this idea such as “I will not give up on love”, or “We hated you from the beginning... and we loved you from the beginning, too.” Kureha treasures the people in her life that she cares for dearly. These include Sumika and her deceased mother. And while this series has a lot of subtle yuri gimmicks, it also crafts romantic friendships that is charming to the eye. It is how the show plays with its plot that really makes our characters change though. Losing Sumika for one thing creates a breakdown for Kureha. And seriously, who can blame her? She already lost her mother and that was an experience she won’t forget. Now that she’s lost an important friend, what else is there to lose? The show illustrates an insight on Kureha’s motivation to get to the truth, especially about the bears such as Ginko and Lulu. After learning that there are bears who are part of the school she is attending, we can easily see how determined she is to flesh them out.It’s also hard to describe exactly where this show fits in when it comes to the main story. A combination of slice of life, horror, and fantasy comes to mind while it throws most logic out the window. From the trials to the menacing murders (with cannibalistic symbolism), Yuri Kuma shows exactly what it is capable of when it comes to mind games. The judges of the series that initiates the yuri trials in the  Court of Severance adds both a psychological and seductive twist. Because let’s face it, the bears are being judged for approval and while this seems like a serious trial, the seductive speech mannerisms takes the cake in another direction. Don’t believe me? Just hear it for yourself. Several catchphrases such as, ‘That's the sexy way. Shaba-da-doo’, ‘I’m so cool’, and ‘Delicious smell!’ are just among a few of them. Of course, the series isn’t a stranger to peculiar dialogues throughout the majority run of the show. The constant growls and roars (with a peculiar ‘Gao’ aesthetic) gives the fans something to think about in regards to the bears. What’s more horrific is how the series also capitalizes on an avant garde style of fictional violence. The backgrounds and violent scenes makes it easy for viewers to interpret themselves at what happens. It shows how dangerous the bears are and exactly why society fears them so much; enough for them to build a damn wall anyways in attempt to keep everyone safe. It also shows how much of a predator some of the bears are as part of human society. Mitsuko is a good example of this as she shows her true colors even from the first episode.From another story perspective, the narrative of this series is directed with brilliance and creativity. Flashbacks are literally told as what they are with a stylistic tone through both its visuals and dialogues. From a fantasy point of view, we also have certain episodes that really brings it to life when it comes to the style of the characters. The mass amount of symbolism such as the royalty, honey, bear claws, etc further enhances the style and purpose of this series. Unfortunately, at some point, fans will get to a point of confusion where they feel like it’s trying far too hard. I had a similar feeling for the first half of this series with all the sexual allusions and cryptic dialogues. It’s also unsurprising that there are a lot of key words or phrases that holds more meaning than just its catchy choice of words. (ex. Invisible Storm) And for all its worth, Yuri Kuma is like dream for fans who appreciates shoujo-ai with its heavy yuri undertones. After all, there are literally no other male students (it’s a damn all-school girl school) so relationships are built by trust, connections, and love. Just ask Kureha and her lover and you’ll see the dedication she puts in to find out the truth about the bears. Revenge or not, the series’ cat-and-mouse like game between humans and bears is hard to ignore with its thought provoking factors.Then, there was the art. How to describe it really? On one hand, it can be simple and imaginative with the countless symbolism and motifs. The sexual allusions are also all over the place each episode relating to the behavior of the bears. Finally, we have the yuri. As a series with girl-on-girl relationships, it shouldn’t be a surprise to see some of it being visually depicted. The OP and ED songs wastes almost no time with its heavy fan service scenarios. And to be honest, this show takes fan service to a rather ambivalent level because of how much it indulges on the yuri tropes. And to say the least, this series’ fantasy and world fiction has a peculiar tone. In retrospect, Silver Link delivers its art’s purpose but how you appreciate it can be a hit or a miss.Soundtrack on most parts is decent with a good amount of effort. The main part though is the dialogues. It isn’t used just as a way with mannerism of speech but with its style to tell the story. The catchphrases are imperative to the show’s core while characters’ voices deliver the consistency of their personalities. I give praise especially to the bears with their way of speech. It has a combination of peculiarity, attachment, and in all purposeful with their roles in the story. And to not top it off, who can forget those seductive judges? Oh I think I know. The OP song. Brace yourself for a brave attempt at a performance from one of the heaviest yuri tone songs you’ll witness and hear with the ears.It’s hard to say exactly what Yuri Kuma is aiming for. If it’s just pure entertainment, then it this the nail hard in the coffin. But for story, this could be quite a headache for those who knows little about the director’s style. It’ll take some patience and an open mind to get through this show because the mass amount of symbolism and its peculiar way it’s presented. For what’s worth, Yuri Kuma crams these symbolism not just because it wants to be or feel unique but rather for telling its story in that appealing way. Although this may steer away some people from giving the series a chance, I’d still recommend giving Yuri Kuma at least a try even if you aren’t on the same track as those menacing bears. Gao. episodes, it’s clear that there’s a lot of effort put in by Kunihiko Ikuhara. He directs this show with an idiosyncratic style and is easy to tell how vastly peculiar some episodes can be. There’s also that gleeful atmosphere throughout the entire series whether it’s the bear symbolism, motifs, or allusions. But for what’s worth, this series should be viewed as creative and thought provoking piece of work. Translated as “Yuri Bear Storm, it may take fans by storm just like that.Yuri Kuma is designed to seem complex but in reality has a meaningful tale to tell. It has a profoundly moving look at bears, an animal species that some people may have fascination about. The show begins with a fictional planet named “Kumalia” that exploded. The meteoroids that crashes onto earth manifests bears who has integrated themselves into human society. Except for one thing: they also like to feast and humanity seems to be one of their favorite meals on the menu. The show transits to the main characters who lives safely behind a protective barrier known as the Wall of Extinction. But one thing leads to another and we learn that bears have infiltrated the school to get a bite out of more humans. It’s up to Kureha to protect her girlfriend Sumika from becoming happy meal but not all seems easy. And by this point, you’re probably having a lot of thoughts on whether you should venture into this show further. Make no mistake, this series stretches beyond the boundaries of imaginations and easily takes risks. So if you’re really curious, then keep reading on.As a testament of Ikuhara, there’s a lot of symbolism combined with themes to illustrate the nature of this series. Love plays out as a prominent idea. In fact, there are several key catch phases in the show that capitalizes on this idea such as “I will not give up on love”, or “We hated you from the beginning... and we loved you from the beginning, too.” Kureha treasures the people in her life that she cares for dearly. These include Sumika and her deceased mother. And while this series has a lot of subtle yuri gimmicks, it also crafts romantic friendships that is charming to the eye. It is how the show plays with its plot that really makes our characters change though. Losing Sumika for one thing creates a breakdown for Kureha. And seriously, who can blame her? She already lost her mother and that was an experience she won’t forget. Now that she’s lost an important friend, what else is there to lose? The show illustrates an insight on Kureha’s motivation to get to the truth, especially about the bears such as Ginko and Lulu. After learning that there are bears who are part of the school she is attending, we can easily see how determined she is to flesh them out.It’s also hard to describe exactly where this show fits in when it comes to the main story. A combination of slice of life, horror, and fantasy comes to mind while it throws most logic out the window. From the trials to the menacing murders (with cannibalistic symbolism), Yuri Kuma shows exactly what it is capable of when it comes to mind games. The judges of the series that initiates the yuri trials in the  Court of Severance adds both a psychological and seductive twist. Because let’s face it, the bears are being judged for approval and while this seems like a serious trial, the seductive speech mannerisms takes the cake in another direction. Don’t believe me? Just hear it for yourself. Several catchphrases such as, ‘That's the sexy way. Shaba-da-doo’, ‘I’m so cool’, and ‘Delicious smell!’ are just among a few of them. Of course, the series isn’t a stranger to peculiar dialogues throughout the majority run of the show. The constant growls and roars (with a peculiar ‘Gao’ aesthetic) gives the fans something to think about in regards to the bears. What’s more horrific is how the series also capitalizes on an avant garde style of fictional violence. The backgrounds and violent scenes makes it easy for viewers to interpret themselves at what happens. It shows how dangerous the bears are and exactly why society fears them so much; enough for them to build a damn wall anyways in attempt to keep everyone safe. It also shows how much of a predator some of the bears are as part of human society. Mitsuko is a good example of this as she shows her true colors even from the first episode.From another story perspective, the narrative of this series is directed with brilliance and creativity. Flashbacks are literally told as what they are with a stylistic tone through both its visuals and dialogues. From a fantasy point of view, we also have certain episodes that really brings it to life when it comes to the style of the characters. The mass amount of symbolism such as the royalty, honey, bear claws, etc further enhances the style and purpose of this series. Unfortunately, at some point, fans will get to a point of confusion where they feel like it’s trying far too hard. I had a similar feeling for the first half of this series with all the sexual allusions and cryptic dialogues. It’s also unsurprising that there are a lot of key words or phrases that holds more meaning than just its catchy choice of words. (ex. Invisible Storm) And for all its worth, Yuri Kuma is like dream for fans who appreciates shoujo-ai with its heavy yuri undertones. After all, there are literally no other male students (it’s a damn all-school girl school) so relationships are built by trust, connections, and love. Just ask Kureha and her lover and you’ll see the dedication she puts in to find out the truth about the bears. Revenge or not, the series’ cat-and-mouse like game between humans and bears is hard to ignore with its thought provoking factors.Then, there was the art. How to describe it really? On one hand, it can be simple and imaginative with the countless symbolism and motifs. The sexual allusions are also all over the place each episode relating to the behavior of the bears. Finally, we have the yuri. As a series with girl-on-girl relationships, it shouldn’t be a surprise to see some of it being visually depicted. The OP and ED songs wastes almost no time with its heavy fan service scenarios. And to be honest, this show takes fan service to a rather ambivalent level because of how much it indulges on the yuri tropes. And to say the least, this series’ fantasy and world fiction has a peculiar tone. In retrospect, Silver Link delivers its art’s purpose but how you appreciate it can be a hit or a miss.Soundtrack on most parts is decent with a good amount of effort. The main part though is the dialogues. It isn’t used just as a way with mannerism of speech but with its style to tell the story. The catchphrases are imperative to the show’s core while characters’ voices deliver the consistency of their personalities. I give praise especially to the bears with their way of speech. It has a combination of peculiarity, attachment, and in all purposeful with their roles in the story. And to not top it off, who can forget those seductive judges? Oh I think I know. The OP song. Brace yourself for a brave attempt at a performance from one of the heaviest yuri tone songs you’ll witness and hear with the ears.It’s hard to say exactly what Yuri Kuma is aiming for. If it’s just pure entertainment, then it this the nail hard in the coffin. But for story, this could be quite a headache for those who knows little about the director’s style. It’ll take some patience and an open mind to get through this show because the mass amount of symbolism and its peculiar way it’s presented. For what’s worth, Yuri Kuma crams these symbolism not just because it wants to be or feel unique but rather for telling its story in that appealing way. Although this may steer away some people from giving the series a chance, I’d still recommend giving Yuri Kuma at least a try even if you aren’t on the same track as those menacing bears. Gao."", ""Yuri Kuma Arashi.  I’m going to be flat out honest, I utterly loathe this show for the sheer fact that I’ve fallen in love with it.  Now I must caution you all, this show will alienate you if you haven’t seen Ikuhara’s previous works like Penguindrum or Utena so upon viewing this as a first title his style can be rather overbearing.  But, back to the topic at hand, there are some anime out there that can only be described as otherworldly and Yuri Kuma is just that.  Today I will be reviewing the anime Yuri Kuma Arashi so without further...ado KUMA SHOCK.Yuri Kuma Arashi is produced by studio Silver Link who created the best Fate in the franchise Fate Illya, and also created Strike the Blood… Yeah they done fucked up.  It was constructed by Kunihiko Ikuhara who is the mastermind behind Penguindrum and Utena.  It is a psychological fantasy seinen that consists of 12 episodes.The storyYuri Kuma Arashi is set in a futuristic world where an asteroid titled Kumaria explodes in space, and as the fragments rain down from the sky, this causes the bears from all over the earth like Yogi Bear to all initiate an attack on humanity.  As a result a huge wall of extinction erects between the two societies to bring peace, kinda like Attack on Titan and the Berlin Wall.  One day, academy student Kureha who despises bears is with her lover Sumika as the bear sirens sound.  Bears are attacking the human world, and questions begin to arise, mysteries start to appear, and the yuri will yurinate all over your brain.To begin, this anime is highly niche and isn't for everyone, especially those who take things at face value and consider Aldnoah.Zero a masterpiece.  Before watching this anime I'd recommend seeing a past Ikuhara work like Mawaru Penguindrum or Utena so that you are familiar with Ikuhara's surrealist style of storytelling.If you take the story at face value what you perceive initially is just women and bears rubbing their carpets together in harmonious motion while symbolism is being thrown, but Yuri Kuma is a more deeper anime commenting on religion, love and about conformity to the general public.Yuri Kuma Arashi’s theme of homosexuality is often seen as face value rather than anything deeper, and I can’t blame the average anime watcher for only seeing sex because of how yuri is portrayed in the medium with animes like Sakura Dick.  But the homosexuality is utilized as a method to convey a commentary on how people identify the gay vs straight argument, only in this anime it’s taken to the extreme with its themes.  The bears being represented as corrupted for having homoerotic feelings while the females represent a type of religious purity that looks down upon those who have the qualities of the bear which is shown through an abstract method of storytelling.  Despite the name, Yuri Kuma Arashi after its first 3 episodes lacks in yuri which is honestly a pro allowing the yuri to be perceived as more symbolic rather than fan service to the naked eye due to the non overbearingness of it.  Funny thing is, the people who shun this anime for the nudity and it's sexual themes are the same people who will turn around and state that Elfen Lied is beautiful FOR THE SAME REASON.  The homosexuality nods at biblical concepts stating that being with another person of the same gender is a sin, which is amplified to the extreme in the sense that being with the same gender or in this case have bearlike behaviors will cause you to be excluded and shunned by society paralleling to Puritan age customs like the Scarlet Letter only on a grander scale.  Other interpretations on the work see the student body as a religion based government and the main characters as radicals.This brings me to the symbolism, which at times can be highly forced to the point where it gets jammed down your throat like abstinence in high school.  Ikuhara is a crazy motherfucker renowned for his symbolism within his fiction and this show is no exception.  The show is like a puzzle piece, waiting to be solved by you the viewer and succeeds at being an interactive experience along the way.  There is symbolism plastered everywhere, in the gardens, heck even the wall is symbolic, everything in this show is a physical representation of a theme, concept and ideal.A gripe with the show I had was its pacing, specifically within its first 3 episodes which were repetitive in nature allowing little to no variation and was at times slower than deaf person using a Bop-it toy.  Also, those first 3 episodes were extremely jarring and indecipherable which definitely hurt the series and in that regard very difficult to follow its themes.  But luckily it improves upon the initial flaws and becomes more approachable to the audience.Finally, a comment about the atmosphere and the world provided by the show.  The atmosphere is uncanny and it works hand and hand with the show’s perplexing storytelling.  As for the world, surprisingly I have varied opinions.  On one hand, the world expands on a grander scale with the edition of the Kuma Kingdom, but on the flipside the human world seems to only consist of a school and Kureha’s house which is sad considering how the anime could have exploited its eccentric foundation to become something better.The conclusion to the show is very hit or miss depending on how a person interprets what happened, all I have to say though is the ending is satisfying.  Every loose end of the story comes together and wraps up with a nice little bow.Now it’s time to move on to the characters.The CharactersYuri Kuma Arashi struggled in the beginning with characterization, but towards the conclusion it repairs these issues and the characters differentiate themselves from others.  However, this doesn't stop it from being weakest component of the show, and as a result of their symbolic meanings the characters halt in characterizationKureha's initially is portrayed as having blind hate towards bears, desiring to witness their destruction.  But as the series progresses you learn through backstory on the reasons why she despises bears, and how she became the person she is in the anime.  She represents individualism as she acts outside of what society considers normal which causes her character to be shunned by others showing a great deal of growth as she copes with society rejecting her.  Though her character I feel her character lacks depth.Ginko is a bear who appears to have her own agenda, and though unrelatable and bland in the beginning, she results in being unique and relatable.  Seeing her on her endeavors on screen is hilarious, and watching her grow from her experiences and develop as a character truly fashions her as a well written character.  She gets proper backstory, and as witnessed sticks insanely to her motivations being revealed as a determined character.Lulu is also a bear that follows Ginko on her journey and along the way provides for some zany humor.  She’s highly outgoing, and is portrayed as the genki archetype.  Receiving some backstory she’s not the most developed character but by the end is characterized properly.The rest of the characters arguably aren’t characterized conventionally which to a certain extent is true and can be perceived as a flaw.  But the fact of the matter is each character holds a purpose in the plot, mostly a symbolic purpose.  Some characters represent desire, others have a more religious purpose, but in conclusion they all hold some sort of purpose. Though I do agree that the characters are the weakest part seeing how anyone outside the general cast have a lack of characterization.The Art/AnimationYuri Kuma Arashi's art can be described in 3 words, abstract as fuck.  The use of color to convey symbolism and to show importance on certain elements within shots is astounding, and adds to the surrealist nature of the story.  From the school's color of period blood red, to the lush forests of booger color green, the colorization is on point.  The character designs for the humans are somewhat bland but as for the bears, they all look eccentric and really eye catching like an ISIS member at a Protestant Church.  But though bland, the facial expressions on the characters are constructed extremely well emphasizing the emotions each character feels.  Lighting is something this show nails, with high key and low key lighting occurring at the right time generate some wallpaper-esque gorgeous scenes.  But, where the flaw lies within its magical art is the horrendous looking CGI in some areas, especially the bear claw which looks worse than a girl who is depressed about Zayn Malik leaving One Direction.The animation however is very inconsistent, with some areas appearing to be smooth but in other areas looks like Microsoft PowerPoint which is a real shame considering that this is a psychological anime.  The movements in the background characters are minimal to the point where it seems lazy.  But, there are two sides to one coin as Clinton showed us, where one side the animation is ugly, but on the other side it sparkles and improves over the course of the show.  All and all though, the art is presented in a unique fashion while the animation though lazy in the beginning slowly begins to improve by the end.  But shall I make note that I appreciated the nods to Penguindrum, Utena and even The Shining, because incorporating those references were cool.The SoundThe ost of Yuri Kuma Arashi can be described with 2 words, ominous and unique.  This is an unusual show, and the music highlights its unconventional nature by being extremely different from ordinary soundtracks.  There are a sufficient amount of songs ranging from slow music for the passive melancholic scenes to swiftly paced haunting music accompanying intense scenes, the music is composed brilliantly, and is reminiscent of sci if horror esque soundtracks.  It also in some instances creates clever hyperboles, playing intense music over an event that is presented in a non serious way is genius.  The opening and ending themes fit the show with the opening being slow yet gets you immersed upon watching it.  As for the voice acting, ughhhhhh, it's varied.  On one side Ginko and Kureha's voice actresses represent the characters wonderfully, presenting emotions and confidence.  On the other hand, you have the voice actress of Sumika and other characters who sound more annoying than North Korea watching the Interview or just standard.In conclusion Yuri Kuma is a very niche show that I’d only recommend to 2 types of people.A person familiar with a work of Ikuhara’s and has seen either Penguindrum or Utena.A person who can look beyond the sexual aspects of the show and see the deeper underlying meanings rather than what’s at face value.  Yuri Kuma Arashi is not good anime as a piece of social commentary as well as entertainment and I believe that this anime is a cult classic. ado KUMA SHOCK.Yuri Kuma Arashi is produced by studio Silver Link who created the best Fate in the franchise Fate Illya, and also created Strike the Blood… Yeah they done fucked up.

My advice is to just not think too hard about the deeper meanings and simply enjoy the cute characters, art, and story. After you become interested in the show, you can always watch it again in order to analyze it.I decided to watch this show based on the art I had seen...and I was not disappointed because the art used in the show is very good and appealing to the eye. The outfits and character design are very cute as well....The school uniforms struck me especially because they are very unique. In Japan hats are not often part of the school uniform, and if they are it is only in elementary school. However this school uniform meant for high school kids had included a very cute hat...it\'s not that important but it is something that stood out to me.Anyway...I am the type of person who enjoys shows about ""cute girls doing cute things"" but these shows often have fan service which frankly creeps me out since these girls are almost always under eighteen. Although in this show there were many scenes in which the girls were naked, they did not appear to be meant for fan service. There were only a few times in which it was invasive fan service, such as during the opening and during the bears\' transformation scenes. However I feel that they were small enough events that I can excuse them. I know this may seem nitpicking but I can\'t help but pay attention to these things... Even though the under-age girls are fictional, I still feel creeped out when there is fan service of them. (If you know any shows that have girl characters and no fan service please tell me... I have only found a few like this. Examples are The Rolling Girls and K-ON)I enjoyed the soundtrack. I liked the softness of the vocals and the lyrics of the opening and ending song were very meaningful.I give it a ten overall because the good art, the cute characters, the soundtrack, and the story were all very enjoyable to me. I have only seen a few shows in which a lesbian couple was not a joke and also was not clearly made just for fan service. As someone who is part of the LGBT+ community it is very important to me that a show like Yuri Kuma Arashi was made, a show in which people like me are not just a joke in the background or something to be fetishized.

No doubt, Yuri Kuma Arashi is a series that talks about something related to lesbians, but what the series wants to present to the audience is more than the lesbian theme. Yuri Kuma Arashi, was translated to “Lesbian Bears Storm”. The title, however, is very misleading. “Yuri” actually refers to pure maiden while “Kuma” actually refers to sexual predators. In other words, Yuri Kuma Arashi actually is a show that symbolizing the difference between pure romantic friendship between two girls & the real lesbianship. Ikuhara might had...set an objective for the series which making the audience able to differentiate a pure romantic friendship & a lustful lesbianship.About the story, Yuri Kuma Arashi basically was about a bear who named Ginko wanted to be loved by Kureha who once was her friend in past. The series was set with a setting which at long ago, a far off planet known as Kumalia exploded, turning into a meteor shower that fell upon earth. This lead to the bears becoming violent and attacking the humans, who created the Wall of Severance between them and the bears. The setting was actually similar with Shingeki no Kyoujin (Attack on Titans) which human were living in the wall to avoid the attacks from the monster, but what made Yuri Kuma Arashi more interesting was bears can actually disguise themselves into human. The series started off by after several years, two bears, Ginko and Lulu, disguise themselves as humans and enroll in Arashigaoka Academy, where Ginko takes interest in a human girl named Kureha.Having a great premise doesn’t mean the series was good. A lot of series which had a great premise usually failed to be a great series because most of the time the development was bad. In term of “development”, we’re talking about the pacing & the plot quality. Yuri Kuma Arashi is great part of the reason have to thanks to the slow-pacing development. Making the audience confused episode by episode and slowly revealing the truth is what Yuri Kuma Arashi had. The plot was developed with a slow-pace to present what Ikuhara actually wanted to prove us, the difference between a pure romantic friendship & a lustful lesbianship. From the series, you can actually see the love by Ginko to Kureha was changing slowly from the beginning to the current episode.Now, let’s talk bout’ the characters. The characters are great and memorable. They are actually some realistic characters that you can related them to someone in your life. Almost all the major characters in Yuri Kuma Arashi get their character development. Start from the protagonists, Kureha Tsubaki. Kureha is a character that don’t give a fuck to the others except those who close to her like her best friend, Sumika Izumino. Moreover, Kureha is a character who not really well in making decision even though her hatred to bears are deeper than anyone. Also, Kureha is a character who was thirsty for having friends. You can actually relates her to Ruuko Kominato from Selector WIXOSS series. Move to the 2nd protagonist, Ginko Yurishiro. Ginko is a character who will do anything for Kureha’s love. Ginko is also a selfish character who ignore others as long as it doesn’t related to her. Comes to the final protagonist, Lulu Yurigasaki. Lulu is a character who similar to Kureha, cares about those who close to her. But at the same time, Lulu is also a character who full with jealousy. Aside from the protagonists, the other characters are well-written too and how that acted on situations are splendid. You can actually sense that realistic human nature are inputted to all the characters.Advance to the arts, it’s great with a standard of above average. As you know, Ikuhara, who was great in symbolism usually take the advantages of visual to symbolize some messages he wanted to present to the audience. In Yuri Kuma Arashi, he used lilies to symbolize the purity of a maiden. This sounds confusing but Ikuhara actually did used more that lilies to present out some messages. Aside from the visual effects, Yuri Kuma Arashi actually had a great character designs. The characters looks cute and suitable for the series. Moreover, the background the series used is another tricks that Ikuhara used to plot something mystery. You can actually find something interesting from the background through series like Kureha’s room which was symbolizing Kureha was a lonely person by making her room looks full (Loners actually did this. When they are lonely, they actually filling up their rooms with a lot of objects so that the room isn’t big enough to fit in the second person, which at the same time the loners could able to make excuses for themselves that they aren’t lonely at all).Move to the sound, Yuri Kuma Arashi also did well on it. Instead of hiring experienced voice actors for their protagonists (Kureha, Ginko & Lulu’s VA isn’t popular at all), the studio hired the experienced voice actors for side-characters. The studio was aware that the side-characters need a more professional voice acting compare to the protagonists to bring out great effects for the series. For example, they hired Junichi Suwabe (Archer from Fate/stay night’s VA) for voice acting Life Sexy because they know that his professional voice acting’s skill might bring effects to series. Not to mention, “SHABADADOO~~” had already became a memorable term to the audience. Aside from the voice acting part, Yuri Kuma Arashi also did well in bringing up the soundtracks. The OSTs are great which the audience able to feel the atmosphere of the situation. In additional, the sound effects that Yuri Kuma Arashi used is another kind of tricks for Ikuhara to plot some messages to audience.My thoughts on Yuri Kuma Arashi is actually quite simple. Despite being about lesbians, this show manages to be great in its own right. The series actually does symbolize all kinds of stuff like friendship, desire for something, how the society treats lesbians, how people treat sex differences & the power of love. Besides that, the series was progressed well with a mysterious way which makes me getting more interested for the show. The characters are great and memorable most of the reasons because they’re realistic like someone who close to us in real life. As a conclusion, missing out Yuri Kuma Arashi might be regretful for you since it’s one of the best series in Winter 2015. set an objective for the series which making the audience able to differentiate a pure romantic friendship & a lustful lesbianship.About the story, Yuri Kuma Arashi basically was about a bear who named Ginko wanted to be loved by Kureha who once was her friend in past. The series was set with a setting which at long ago, a far off planet known as Kumalia exploded, turning into a meteor shower that fell upon earth. This lead to the bears becoming violent and attacking the humans, who created the Wall of Severance between them and the bears. The setting was actually similar with Shingeki no Kyoujin (Attack on Titans) which human were living in the wall to avoid the attacks from the monster, but what made Yuri Kuma Arashi more interesting was bears can actually disguise themselves into human. The series started off by after several years, two bears, Ginko and Lulu, disguise themselves as humans and enroll in Arashigaoka Academy, where Ginko takes interest in a human girl named Kureha.Having a great premise doesn’t mean the series was good. A lot of series which had a great premise usually failed to be a great series because most of the time the development was bad. In term of “development”, we’re talking about the pacing & the plot quality. Yuri Kuma Arashi is great part of the reason have to thanks to the slow-pacing development. Making the audience confused episode by episode and slowly revealing the truth is what Yuri Kuma Arashi had. The plot was developed with a slow-pace to present what Ikuhara actually wanted to prove us, the difference between a pure romantic friendship & a lustful lesbianship. From the series, you can actually see the love by Ginko to Kureha was changing slowly from the beginning to the current episode.Now, let’s talk bout’ the characters. The characters are great and memorable. They are actually some realistic characters that you can related them to someone in your life. Almost all the major characters in Yuri Kuma Arashi get their character development. Start from the protagonists, Kureha Tsubaki. Kureha is a character that don’t give a fuck to the others except those who close to her like her best friend, Sumika Izumino. Moreover, Kureha is a character who not really well in making decision even though her hatred to bears are deeper than anyone. Also, Kureha is a character who was thirsty for having friends. You can actually relates her to Ruuko Kominato from Selector WIXOSS series. Move to the 2nd protagonist, Ginko Yurishiro. Ginko is a character who will do anything for Kureha’s love. Ginko is also a selfish character who ignore others as long as it doesn’t related to her. Comes to the final protagonist, Lulu Yurigasaki. Lulu is a character who similar to Kureha, cares about those who close to her. But at the same time, Lulu is also a character who full with jealousy.

For example, the opening is simply AMAZING, and gives off a very psychedelic feeling. Then we move on to the main story, that looks like a comedy, since in a world where no males exist, humanity, which is called ""yuri"", aka ""lesbian"", has built a wall to protect itself from the intelligent BEARS that wage war against it. There is no single statement in that sentence that isn\'t utterly laughable. But then we meet our main character, Kuroha, who is hands down one of the best drama queens to ever exist.

After thinking about it I mused that maybe it\'s trying to pass a message about homosexuality being acceptable rather than someone\'s heritage, but that makes even less sense since in that world homosexuality is already the norm (hell, humanity calls itself YURI), and in fact being straight is weird.

I remember hearing about the project and was excited for a yuri anime to be directed by Ikuhara, since he's always included it in his past work.

The first couple of episodes of the anime don't give it any justice since the fan service is everywhere, but the show does get better.

This show is fairly confusing, even by Ikuhara standards, so to properly understand yuri kuma arashi we need to understand what it is trying to say.Yuri kuma arashi is a very symbolic anime, so to understand what it is trying to say we need to understand what each of these symbols means and how they tie into the main narrative as a whole. Yuri means yuri, no surprise there. While kuma literally translates to bear it is...used as slang for homosexuals, the use of bears is also to allude to the concept of the predatory lesbian. This is made clearer by the fact that the bears try to ""eat"" other girls, I shouldn\'t have to explain what that is referencing. If a girl is found to be ""eaten"" they might as well be dead referring to the shame present in Japanese society. This leads us to the third part of the title, storm, referencing the invisible storm. The invisible storm is a more abstract concept which is meant to represent homophobia as a whole with the invisible part referencing the social isolation prevalent in Japanese society. There is also the wall of severance which was constructed by the humans to keep out the bears, this is also alluding to homophobia by forcefully separating homosexual things and none homosexual things. There is also the promised kiss, which is meant to be a symbol of true love. It doesn\'t necessarily have to be romantic either as seen Lulu and Milne (the jar of honey). The promise kiss is also shown to be able to make miracles occur, alluding to the fact that love is transcendent, a common theme in Ikuhara anime.So what does this all mean? Well, yuri kuma arashi is a story about the bears (lesbians) vs the invisible storm (homophobia), while the students aren\'t directly homophobic they chose to become invisible to the storm allowing it to continue and to keep taking lives. In the end, the only thing that can defeat the storm is love, the promise kiss, at the end Ginko and Kureha use a promise kiss to escape the invisible storm, they defeat hate with love.Yuri kuma is a very flawed work, while what I have described was what the show intended to say the overall message comes across as muddled, shots that show nudity and raw sexuality are commonplace but these scenes are dolled up for the viewer. While this isn\'t an issue in an of itself yuri kuma arashi is a show that critiques the yuri genre so these fairly explicit scenes just make the show come off as hypocritical. The length of the show is also an issue, it attempts to say a lot and the nature of the show means it is hard to understand, factor in the fact that this is only 12 episodes means the core message is even harder to understand. This restrictive episode count makes other problems like the accidental implications that sexuality is evil. Since the bears are shown as villains with little nuance they are often connected to the idea being morally wrong and since these are the only characters shown to be sexual someone might make the connection that the show is trying to say that sex is evil. Because of this, the other messages of the show break down and yuri kuma just becomes a lesbian version of attack on titan. Since the show attempts to be metaphorical but in the process sacrifices proper characterisation and a coherent story to say its piece, and what the show is trying to say doesn\'t come off well.TLDR: Yuri kuma tries to do a lot and fails at most of it. used as slang for homosexuals, the use of bears is also to allude to the concept of the predatory lesbian.

A Romeo Juliet type of story, with 100% yuri involved. Really interesting. Something to watch entirely through though, since the way the story goes, you\'ll essentially be confused until you get to the last episode or so; unfortunate it\'s shown this way, because it becomes an easy excuse to just toss the anime aside, but I think the way that Yuri Kuma Arashi handled the story is pretty great, especially since it\'s not really about bears and yuri, well sort of, but not really.Following Kureka Tsukabi, Lulu Yurigasaki and Ginko Yurishiro, we witness a blossoming...love story. The entire plot and how it is shown is quite surreal. A beautiful art style is involved too, which makes it incredibly easy to watch; also helped by the ecchi and yuri scenes of course! =)The seiyu though, did a fantastic job. All the intricate noises and sounds the girls had to do were fantastic. ""Gau gau"" and adding cute noises to words and everything else, honestly, I could just listen to them speak with those voices all day, so good.OP for Yuri Kuma Arashi is the best. I was introduced to the OP before I wanted to watch the show, so I knew about the song beforehand and my goodness, I love it. Bonjour Suzuki, the artist that did the OP is utterly fantastic, I now own her music because of this OP. Speaking of which, the OP works really well with Yuri Kuma Arashi as well, so that\'s a plus. ED is nice too, but what made the ED amazing was the art that was shown with it and the dancing Kuma. Aside from the OP and ED, I\'d say most of the music and sounds that were played were really well done, especially the kuma scenes. Nice orchestral music was played when expected and helped heighten emotions during special scenes.Overall, I really like Yuri Kuma Arashi, sure there may be a lot of ecchi scenes and yes, it uses bears and yuri to tell it\'s story, but it\'s a good one none-the-less. I\'d most definitely recommend, but only if you\'re okay with the ecchi/fan service type of things. It\'s all very symbolic. love story. The entire plot and how it is shown is quite surreal. A beautiful art style is involved too, which makes it incredibly easy to watch; also helped by the ecchi and yuri scenes of course! =)The seiyu though, did a fantastic job. All the intricate noises and sounds the girls had to do were fantastic. ""Gau gau"" and adding cute noises to words and everything else, honestly, I could just listen to them speak with those voices all day, so good.OP for Yuri Kuma Arashi is the best. I was introduced to the OP before I wanted to watch the show, so I knew about the song beforehand and my goodness, I love it. Bonjour Suzuki, the artist that did the OP is utterly fantastic, I now own her music because of this OP. Speaking of which, the OP works really well with Yuri Kuma Arashi as well, so that\'s a plus. ED is nice too, but what made the ED amazing was the art that was shown with it and the dancing Kuma.

If you\'re not a fan of really symbolic anime, you\'ll definitely hate it. If you do, you\'ll probably still hate it.The main problem is how pseudo-intellectual it is. It sacrifices any watch-ability for some theme about homophobia and gay rights. They don\'t even manage to make it as profound as they believe it is. It\'s all pretty obvious and cliche. I can just imagine the staff in a conference room smoking weed and saying ""Dude, it\'s like... symbolic... and it\'s about like, SOCIETY, or somethin, and how it\'s bad... uh, like, so deep man..."".Story: It\'s not...an entertaining story. It\'s so focused on symbolism that it forgets to entertain its audience. It\'s simplistic and predictable. I never found myself wondering what would happen next.Art: I don\'t prefer this type of art, but any other viewer might.  Also, it\'s pretty fanservicey and objectifying for something intended to be socially progressive.Sound: Nothing amazing. Pretty annoying catch phrases and effects like ""Kuma shock!"".I can\'t say there was anything enjoyable about it. Shows like this are praised by MAL so much, but they\'re just fooling themselves.

It's got it all, it's the best bear-hunting anime I've ever watched for one. If you enjoy bear-hunting and would like to watch an anime that accurately simulates the sport, Yuri Kuma has all you need. Now grab those bear traps and head out to the woods!It's also an anime about societal exclusion and discrimination. Is the anime about how people (Lesbians in this show) are discriminated and excluded...by society? Yes it is. Does it handle its theme with the subtlety or with the respect/care it deserves. Hell no.For all its messages on how Bears (which largely represent Lesbians in this case) are discriminated and hunted by humans and how this is bad and all, the show doesn't handle its primary theme with care. What with all the gratuitous fanservice of our characters thrown around everywhere for starters, or how the show is inconsistent with portraying the bears (so they're being discriminated but are also psychopaths who should be hunted?) or all the lovely unfortunate implications this show brings (so a number of antagonists in this show are lesbians and are portrayed as bad people because they're driven by lust or something).Which brings me to my next point, the characters aren't particularly likable. Lulu and Ginko are fine but I positively loathe Kureha, she complains so much at every and any given opportunity and is always oblivious to danger and the like. The antagonists aren't particularly well written either, mostly boiling down to one-dimensional evil villain stereotypes with minimal depth. Sumiko I particularly didn't like as later episodes that involved her scenes felt forced and out of place since they usually come in the form of flashbacks in the middle of the anime. Life Sexy is the real MVP though.But on a whole, the show just works. It flows very fluidly and is paced extremely well,  and despite my complaints earlier regarding characters and character development, I still found Kureha's adventure fun to follow. The surrealist animation especially gives life to the anime, providing spectacular moments to be enjoyed.By the ending I was overflowing with tears.   It was the first anime I've watched to garner such a reaction from me and it holds a special place in my heart for it.Ya see, kids are cruel. I wasn't a lesbian, but I was still different from the other kids. I acted differently and I was ostracized by it. Our society is one that's just not receptive to strange people.

I'd originally heard of the opening while stumbling around, and I fell head over heels for it. That in mind, I decided to play my hand at actually watching this show, and boy what a ride it's been. Seeing its respective reviews up to this point, I cannot possibly fathom why the ratings are so low. This was a beautiful and fantastic masterpiece, with a romantic finish that had me in tears, especially at the implications of everything.For those unaware, this is absolutely a yuri anime, and watching...the romance between the cast of different characters that come and go in this anime was not nearly as teeth grindingly irritating as a typical anime with your every man. These characters have heart and feeling to them, and though their situations are just so slightly beyond my grasp, their real struggles and stacking odds hit home. My only real complaints is the art direction and how odd the story and themes can get at time, but in earnest, those are very, very slight pickings. After the first episode, I couldn't help but watch the rest.I'd not only recommend this anime to anyone who wants to watch a good yuri anime (to which this one is simply the absolute best I have seen thus far), but anyone who's interested in watching a great anime.

Nothing is out of the question yet guessing the actual meaning behind the symbolism is part of the journey, not to mention the multitude of meanings one might get from just one series. What one sees symbolically can change with each viewing, yet the series can also be enjoyed as simply a story.On the other hand, this creator is also known for going all the way out there regarding the psychological elements he pulls...in. It’s not a series meant for a viewer who is turned off by the genre type, but the psychological genre is meant to be mind breaking, off the wall. The well written ones do this in a way where strange things happen, yet the strange things still feel believable, yet even in that regard, the genre isn’t for everyone.That said, this series also touches upon same sex relations between females.

This is a story about the relationship between a human and a bear.You might think: ""What de hell? Am outa here""...BUT. Surprisingly, this is a quite good show.Main summaryThe story beggins with a gril named Kureha who shares a relationship with her best friend, Sumika. They love each other and they say that they will forever protect their love. BUT- This isn\'t an ordinary love story, in an ordinary world... Because of some stuff that happened to universe that I - and probably everybody else- can\'t really explain, bears...have the will to attack and eat humans. So the world is seperated into two parts. The human world - And the bear world. The humans created a wall so that they could protect themselves from the bears and well they had been in general protected. Two bears with the names Ginco and Lulu crossed the wall and entered the human zone with the form of humans, after they made a deal with the Judgements holding the Yuri trials.   -Confused already? cause this is just the beggining...-   Well the two bears seemed to be there for a reason. They seemed to be wanting to eat Kureha. Well, a lot of things happened, a lot of people died and a lot of plot twists and history revelations took place. BUT-guess what. THIS IS ALL SUPPOSED TO BE SYMBOLIC. There is the theory -which is probably true- that supports that the bears and the discrimination towards them symbolizes the LGBT community and the discrimination towards the people that belong to it. To be honest, this is quite easy to understand, since exept from the yuri relationships inside the story (girl x girl) most of the girls\' names have the word ""Yuri"" inside of them and you can see the Yuri flower (Lily) in so many places inside the story, and for fuks shake, even the name of the anime has the word ""Yuri"" in it.Personal opinionI personally found the story to be very interesting. I love watching new things...Different things. And this- was a completely unique thing. The story was like a fairytail. It was shown and narrated in such a unique way.  Since it was so confusing and odd, it hooked me and made me want to watch more. The characters were quite interesting. The main ones are Ginco and Kureha but Lulu also plays a very important role. I enjoyed the fact that the story provided us clear images of the characters\' history. I was mostly interested in Lulu\'s character. I was moved by her story and by her ,later on in the show, actions. Kureha\'s and Ginco\'s perseverance in love was admirable. Some quotes and main phrases from the anime were also pretty memorable...""Is your love the real thing?""...""Shaba-da-doo""...The artstyle is something different. It is again not as usual, but I feel like it portrays and shows the deeper meaning excellently. I don\'t really know why, but I feel like although the artstyle is quite cute and not maybe as deep as others, it is perfect for the story. Sure, this story could have had a pretty dramatic and kind of more realistic artstyle like ""attack on titan"" but this one...makes the difference. I don\'t really know how to explain that though...Now, about the soundtrack, it is a masterpiece. I found the music so appealing and so meaningful. It fitted every moment, and gave each scene the atmosphere it needed. The opening was great too, although I do strongly believe that the video coming with it is very misleading. The opening video shows more nudity than the actual show has. I mean, watching the opening only, will create a false idea of what this story is about. And yes, there is some mild nudity here and there throughout the show but to be honest, it didn\'t really bother me that much. I do believe it would have been better without it but - ok...All in all, I enjoyed this anime very much. It was a different experience and with a theme so beautiful, it\'s hard not to keep and remember. I feel like it could have been better, in terms of development,  and especially at the end, because I feel like in the end, everything just happened too fast but if you see it in total I feel like it is a great anime, cute and with meaning, with its funny and its more emotional parts.

Less cautious.So I went in with high hopes and man...I was extremely dissapointed with yuri kuma arashi...Firstly the good stuff about this show: The color design, the opening theme, the scenery art, the...prop design, the character designs, even the sound design was pretty good.But there\'s nothing else, this show left me asking the question ""what is this about?"" for every. single. episode. By episode 5 that question had turned into ""why should I care?""This show ended up defining ""I\'m not mad, just dissapointed.""Story:There is a story but its mediocre at best, it throws ideas and things the staff thought were themes at all ends to the point where the show believes the viewer is stupid. NOT ONCE have I ever taken poor directing personally but the idea that /their/ ideas can only be understood after pounding them into my skull five hundred times is ludicrous, and will piss anyone off if you do it for twelve straight episodes.In addition the twists the show does have are not foreshadowed (the ""kuma shock"" moments mostly) unless you consider given it away a minute into the episode \'foreshadowing\', this creates a terrible unbalance in the feeling of an episode.The overarching story (a separation of worlds/races conquered by love) is not something easy to mess up, yet they did. It was hard to root for these characters an they only were weaved into the story to TELL the story, the writer wanted so badly to spout their meaningless opinions and dialogue to the point were the characters are only vessels for the themes, not characters. It is my belief that when you take a character out of the story the character should be in tact and the world should be in tact but they\'re so interdependent the quality of both is ruined.I will also say that there is nothing that can redeem this story, its so badly beaten the last two episodes will do nothing to change that or remedy that.Yuri Premise:Did you want actual relationships between girls? TOO BAD! The ""love interest"" dies in the first god damn episode (maybe second, who cares shes dead as a door nail.) Don\'t worry you won\'t feel anything though, because the girl was a moe blob and the main character barely felt anything about it either. If you came for yuri fanservice there is some of that.

Ikuhara\'s sexually-charged symbolism used from Utena and Penguindrum are retained for this series as lesbianism and a fair number of implied situations are frequent sights throughout this mind trip of a series.Yuri Kuma Arashi offers some critical...looks at how society as a whole can view lesbianism and female sexuality. Any positive relationships between bears and humans which are frowned upon by the Invisible Storm in this series is actually a symbolic representation of how Japan\'s group mentality frowns upon same-sex relationships and tend to ostracize those that don\'t follow their society\'s cultural norms and plant labels on them. The group mentality is as such where the loss of a leader still allows the mentality to function and those that are gay or support it (or in this case, bears for Yuri Kuma) are labeled as a source of ""evil"" that has to be cleansed, hence the existence of the Invisible Storm representing societal pressure and conformity. In addition, the Life Judgement Guys that Ginko and Lulu often encounter for their ""yuri trials"" are representations of the dated, male-centric Freudian concepts of id, ego and superego where the bears of the series must behave an expected way to retain their ability to take on human forms that the Life Judgement Guys granted to them. Learning more about these concepts will allow you to get a better appreciation for how Ikuhara uses real-life events and concepts to paint symbolism into his work.Outside of symbolism, the series also tells a rather cohesive story with Kureha trying to seek out answers about the death of her former lover Sumika and seeking answers about what past relations she may have with Ginko and Lulu. Many of Yuri Kuma Arashi\'s characters get fleshed out to reveal their motives and any past connections they have to Kureha, including what is driving the Invisible Storm to ostracize her. In addition, the story gradually builds up to explore the tragic developments of the relationship that Kureha establishes with Ginko and Lulu due to their different upbringings and events escalate with both enemy bears and the Invisible Storm stepping up their efforts to wreck apart said relationship. The story structure for early episodes in the series is repetitive at first and the symbolism does get hammered at points, but these don\'t hurt the show\'s strengths too badly.Presentation-wise, Yuri Kuma Arashi sports beautiful scenic shots and character designs that depict bright, vivid colors and a good deal of detail with scenic designs. However, animation is not as heavily emphasized with some scenes having limited movement and some reused shots.Overall, Yuri Kuma Arashi is another strong work from Ikuhara offering his usual unique direction with the sexually-drive developments driving Kureha and others in its symbolic look into female sexuality. The heavy symbolism employed in it won\'t be for everyone. But for those looking for unique titles that require you to think, this is a definite recommendation. looks at how society as a whole can view lesbianism and female sexuality.

The group mentality is as such where the loss of a leader still allows the mentality to function and those that are gay or support it (or in this case, bears for Yuri Kuma) are labeled as a source of ""evil"" that has to be cleansed, hence the existence of the Invisible Storm representing societal pressure and conformity. In addition, the Life Judgement Guys that Ginko and Lulu often encounter for their ""yuri trials"" are representations of the dated, male-centric Freudian concepts of id, ego and superego where the bears of the series must behave an expected way to retain their ability to take on human forms that the Life Judgement Guys granted to them. Learning more about these concepts will allow you to get a better appreciation for how Ikuhara uses real-life events and concepts to paint symbolism into his work.Outside of symbolism, the series also tells a rather cohesive story with Kureha trying to seek out answers about the death of her former lover Sumika and seeking answers about what past relations she may have with Ginko and Lulu. Many of Yuri Kuma Arashi\'s characters get fleshed out to reveal their motives and any past connections they have to Kureha, including what is driving the Invisible Storm to ostracize her. In addition, the story gradually builds up to explore the tragic developments of the relationship that Kureha establishes with Ginko and Lulu due to their different upbringings and events escalate with both enemy bears and the Invisible Storm stepping up their efforts to wreck apart said relationship. The story structure for early episodes in the series is repetitive at first and the symbolism does get hammered at points, but these don\'t hurt the show\'s strengths too badly.Presentation-wise, Yuri Kuma Arashi sports beautiful scenic shots and character designs that depict bright, vivid colors and a good deal of detail with scenic designs. However, animation is not as heavily emphasized with some scenes having limited movement and some reused shots.Overall, Yuri Kuma Arashi is another strong work from Ikuhara offering his usual unique direction with the sexually-drive developments driving Kureha and others in its symbolic look into female sexuality. The heavy symbolism employed in it won\'t be for everyone. But for those looking for unique titles that require you to think, this is a definite recommendation.', ""I was drawn to Yuri Kuma Arashi because I heard its basic premise and it's bizarre. Humans and bears were at war, the humans built a wall to keep peace, some bears sneak into a human school. That's a premise that's likely either going to be awesomely stupid & hilarious or just really stupid. The anime version was handled by Silver Link, and I'm hoping for the best thing I've seen from them. Which wouldn't be difficult given the other works of theirs that I've reviewed. It could be sub-par but not bad and still be the best I've seen from them. Now, the original...manga was created by Ikuhara Kunihiko, known for the awesomeness of Utena, the crappy melodrama of Penguindrum and directing a good chunk of the original Sailor Moon anime. So, there is potential there. But let's take a look at Yuri Kuma Arashi and see if Ikuhara still has it or if Penguindrum was a sad precursor of where his work's going.Story:Long ago, humans and bears lived in peace. Then, in distant space, Kumaria exploded. This somehow resulted in bears getting violent and resulted in a war between humans and bears. This eventually ended with the wall of Severance being erected to keep bears away from humans. In the present, two bears, Ginko & Lulu, sneak into the wall disguised as human schoolgirls. The two enrol in Arashigaoka Academy where they take an interest in Tsubaki Kureha, another student there. When Kureha's girlfriend, Sumika, goes missing she receives a call from a blocked number telling her, if her love is true, to go to the roof and give herself to the bears. She heads up, rifle in hand and ready to prove her love. What happened to Sumika? Why are the bears interested in Kureha? And what exactly is this “Invisible Storm” that keeps getting mentioned? These questions may very well lead Kureha on a journey of personal growth that she never expected.This story is odd and I'm not saying that in a demeaning way. It's done in a style very reminiscent of a fairy tale, much like Princess Tutu, with Ikuhara's own inimitable twist and all of the surreal elements one would expect from that. The trial scenes with Sexy judging, Beauty defending and Cool prosecuting as well as the Exclusion ceremony scenes being the most prominent. The biggest issue I had with the narrative is that it's written like a relatively uncomplicated fairy tale, one character even announcing what she represents at one point while others are quite literally named for it, but it's intended for older audiences. There's a bit of a disconnect there and there, honestly, isn't much reason for this to be made for older audiences. About the only thing that elevates it to that level are some of the more explicit yuri moments. Aside from that, the violence is very much toned down and the structure and dialogue are both very much that of a traditional fairy tale.That being said, I quite liked the narrative, in much the same way as I liked Princess Tutu. The fairy tale element meshes quite well with Ikuhara's surrealism. The love story has a surprising amount of tension, especially given how formulaic it is and it has a lot of strong moments. The themes of fighting for love and refusing to give up on love are both superbly handled, accentuated deftly by the way it uses repetitious scenes, like the aforementioned trial scenes. I really do like the main romance in general. It has a lot of sweetness to it, intermixed with some tragic elements.Characters:The characters are about as complex as they need to be. By that, I mean that the major characters have a good amount going on. They have fleshed out motivations, back stories and they have arcs within the story that move them. The secondary characters have as much as they need for the function they serve. Some of them are simply there to embody a particular aspect and that's what they do. Others are more side characters who need to do a particular thing and they get very basic motivations for it but not much in terms of personality. Yet others, notably Yuriika, are more developed. About the only complaint I have is with Milne, a small child character who does virtually nothing but try to cling to his older sister, Lulu, and act kind of obnoxious. The episode with him in a central role was definitely the hardest to watch. Yeah, I can understand a five or six year old kid being clingy, but that doesn't make it not annoying.Art:The only real flaw with the art is the excessive fan-service. Which basically all revolves around high school girls. Way to keep it classy, Silver Link. And yes, that was sarcasm. That aside, I actually really liked the art in this. The way they portray the story book scenes, the surreal moments. I also appreciate that they do downplay the actual violence, opting to show a claw and then a collapsed form or to otherwise keep the camera away from the injury while also clearly conveying that the injury happened. It fits in with the fairy tale style. As does making the bears cutesy instead of more realistic. We also see Ikuhara's flower fixation at play. In Utena, it was roses. In Yuri Kuma Arashi, it's lilies and there are some really pretty scenes with them.Sound:You might not expect this series to have great acting simply because the leads are all voiced by ladies without many roles. We've got Yamane Nozomi, who has one other credit on MAL, Ikuta Yoshiko, with credits for six characters & Arakawa Miho, she has the most with twenty characters. That being said, they all do really well. The performances in this are all capable but those three in particular have a lot to express with theirs and they all do so very well. I really like the music too. Hashimoto Yukari does a fantastic job of composing to suit the aesthetic.Ho-yay:Naturally, there is a lot. Every female character we spend any time with is shown or heavily implied to be into girls. Even Kureha's mum seems to have been highly homo-erotic with another woman. I'm guessing she likes both. Although, we never even see the father nor is he mentioned. For all we know, she got herself artificially inseminated so that she could share a baby with this other woman. Feel free to make that your head canon. There are a handful of significant dudes, the blokes in the trial scenes and Lulu's twit of a brother. None of them get involved with anyone romantically. So, it's not an anime like Strawberry Panic where men only exist as an abstract concept, but it comes close.Final Thoughts:So, that's Yuri Kuma Arashi. It's not what I expected, being more serious and lacking in stupidity, awesome or otherwise. Is it Ikuhara's best work? No. Is it better than Penguindrum? No contest. Is it the best I've seen from Silver Link thus far? Absolutely. I found it quite enjoyable. I liked the way they used the fairy tale aesthetic and thought that the surreal elements added a lot to that. I found the characters endearing. The art, vocal performances and music were all strong as well. I would go so far as to call it a good series. Not one of the best I've seen but a solid 7/10. Next week I'm going to go back to requests and look at Terra Formars.

It\'s original, with over the top yuri that was done in a way acceptable/not-a-distraction for viewer like me who\'s not usually going for yuri shows.It\'s a story about love which is repeated over and over again.It\'s a story about peer pressure which is performed over rand over again.It\'s a show about extending your hand out to people who are labeled otherwise.It\'s a bit heavy to swallow at first --- those cute looking bears actually kill people and eat them?

His art direction is at its absolute peak with this show, and the series is stunning on the level of pure image. He has also mastered a very subtle, surreal, and almost wacky approach to directing his anime. Finally, like almost all Ikuhara anime, this one is overtly preoccupied with lesbianism and the social reactions to it. Indeed, the title of the anime would appear to translate to ""lesbian bear storm.""STORYAsteroid breaks up over Earth. Bears go nuts and start murdering girls (or humans, perhaps, since all humans in the...show appear to be female). Humans justifiably freak out and build a wall to keep them out. Bears and humans appear to have wars with one-another. Two bears disguise themselves as humans and sneak over the wall in order to eat humans, and wind up befriending a human girl with a mysterious past. This loose plot synopsis might sound terse. If it does, it\'s because the show doesn\'t really care about its plot, and as such, I don\'t either. Things don\'t happen in the world of Yurikuma Arashi in any meaningfully objective sense. I have the feeling that this work only has a sense of narrative cohesion at all because Ikuhara wanted a continuous story to expand upon his themes. The general rule here is that everything in this show content-wise, from story to character, is subservient to the iron grip of the themes and multiple layers of symbolism Ikuhara wants to explore.Enough twists and turns are included to make the plot watchable, but there was clearly little effort put into this aspect of the show. It\'s not what Yurikuma is about.5/10CHARACTERThere is little to say about the characters in this work. They\'re all very pretty, and since they\'re Ikuhara people, they often say and think interesting things. This show, again, isn\'t interested in exploring characters, though, and so their function and nature are subservient to the themes and symbolism. This is not, by any means, a character-driven show.4/10THEMESThis is the big focus of the show, so unsurprisingly, this aspect of it is complex, multifaceted, and fascinating. I won\'t say too much about the themes in this show except to note that it is very uniquely Japanese in its social critiques and that it is worth analyzing this title on multiple levels in order to understand it as fully as is possible.10/10ART/DIRECTIONThis aspect of the show is incredible, which is unsurprising, as everything Ikuhara has done since Utena is incredible in this regard. The character designs are fairly generic (although I doubt we\'ll ever get back to the unique, angular designs of Utena characters), but the design of the environments and the visual flair of the show itself as simply stunning. The school environment was inspired by Suspiria, and one can see several surprising and awesome influences elsewhere in the show as well. Many of the scenes have a gorgeous poetry to the way scenes are staged and progress.9/10SOUNDThe soundtrack for this show is eclectic, to say the least, and stylistically very diverse. It\'s not a masterpiece like Cowboy Bebop or Vision of Escaflowne, mind, but it does an excellent job of pulling you in the weird world Ikuhara creates. Also, it has a killer opener.8/10OVERALLThe biggest problem with this show is that it never really comes together into a greater whole that justifies any of its individual weaknesses. It\'s an artistically inconsistent experience that is memorable but, at the same time, will be unlikely to end up being considered a classic of anime.

Everything’s set at angles in Yurikuma, which tie in with the dividing lines made quickly apparent between the bears and the humans outlined in the opening narration. Despite carrying around a reputation for being obtuse, Ikuhara is as subtle as a sledgehammer here with his themes – pretty clear pretty early on what’s being implied with the divide between human and bears, and the devouring and so on, and in case it isn’t clear Ikuhara will make the character repeat the same...thing about six or seven times, just to make sure that you understand, just in case you didn’t hear it the first, or fourth, or fiftieth time.Ikuhara’s characterization here though is terrible, but he’s always been very weak at that in all his shows. He eschews realism in favour of having his characters represent some sort of idea, and he will twist time and space to make sure that they act in such a way that adheres to this idea, using whatever justification necessary for having a character act in a certain fashion regardless of whether or not the justification itself makes any common sense. Results in a lack of relatability, and a lack of personal connection to any of his characters beyond the idea they represent. Putting it another way, you like Ikuhara’s characters not for who they are but rather what they represent. By extension the same logic applies to his works as a whole. There’s very little, in my opinion, for the viewer to latch onto as something relatable, some situation that’s grounded in reality.Take the main girl, an orphan who lives alone, is ostracized by her peers, is bullied – can’t care. No attention is drawn to her plight beyond what is necessary to the core message of the show, so none of it seems real, there’s no chance for any sympathy to form between you and the character, because Ikuhara doesn’t allow her to have a life outside of the story. Broadly this applies to everyone in the show. The resulting lack of an emotional attachment to the characters naturally leads to the adoption of a very indifferent attitude to the majority of the events which unfold in Yurikuma’s story.Like the characters, the story is a farce. There are bears who want to eat humans, bears disguised as humans, bears who want to kill other bears disguised as humans, all very grizzly. The bears are lesbians, the humans don’t like lesbians, but some humans do like lesbians, but those humans are excluded, by the other humans, because they don’t like lesbians, because they think lesbians don’t like them, because they’re lesbians. Something like that. Ikuhara uses this circular irrational line of thinking as a baseline for circling around the various reasons for the irrational hatred of lesbians and draws some pretty obvious though nevertheless valid conclusions which the show explains in obvious fashion.Personally not a fan of these open-and-shut social/moral questions with obvious right answers in fiction because it makes the story very predictable and also very rigid, with very little to interpret beyond what Ikuhara wants you to interpret. Granted, there is more to Yurikuma than that theme of loving what/who you love regardless of what other people think, but its nothing that Penguindrum hadn’t covered already from another angle. It’s all very agreeable but merely being agreeable isn’t really anything noteworthy.With Ikuhara, you never really get the feeling you’re getting what’s been promised. He’s someone whose works I admire but never personally like. His shows never really seem to come together when they should, they’re always aesthetically pleasing but uneventful, always lacking in concrete action.

Yuri = lesbian in Japanese, so the title roughly translates to 'Lesbian Bear Storm' which sounds a lot tackier, almost like 'Lesbian Vampire Killers'.So yes, there are lesbians, and yes, there are bears. And yes, it is weird. But I didn't expect any less from the director of Revolutionary Girl Utena, Mawaru Penguindrum and Sailor Moon. In fact, in some bizarre way, I expected more. But I'm getting ahead of myself.In the show, the world is separated into two parts by a huge...wall. On one side are the humans, and on the other are ravenous man-eating bears. The reason these bears are so ravenous is because of a planet called Kumaria that exploded thousands of years ago, shards of the planet falling to earth and causing bears to attack humans. With me so far?Cut to present day human world, where Kureha (girl in blue) despises bears because her mother was killed and eaten by one. She attends a prestigious academy which has just had two transfer students : Ginko and Lulu (girl in pink and girl in green respectively). But SHOCK! Ginko and Lulu are actually bears in disguise!!! People are eaten, there's a lot of hijinks and a lot of metaphors, symbolism and style (which is par for the course for the director of the show).The problem for me is that the story is never engaging enough to more than 'this is bizarre, isn't it? What are they doing in this anime? Why is the main girl flying down those stairs, while the bears are in bear court being judged by three bear humans who all have catchphrases?' It just falls a little short of the mark left by Utena and Penguindrum (two of my all-time favourites)All in all, it's style over substance, and it looks very very stylish. There were a lot of questionable moments in regards to the sexual nature of the show, but I've watched worse. wall. On one side are the humans, and on the other are ravenous man-eating bears.

What are they doing in this anime? Why is the main girl flying down those stairs, while the bears are in bear court being judged by three bear humans who all have catchphrases?' It just falls a little short of the mark left by Utena and Penguindrum (two of my all-time favourites)All in all, it's style over substance, and it looks very very stylish. There were a lot of questionable moments in regards to the sexual nature of the show, but I've watched worse."", 'In janeiro\'2014 season, the fandom works with shoujo-ai and yuri content just having the presence of anime Sakura Trick to indulge, even in parts, that will and desire to have a focused work to do so.

I mean I did drop this when it came out because it was just too much. I mean a meteor fell and now Bear eat humans and are intelligent and now are separated by wall, like WHAT. That being said underneath the silliness are some powerful commentary on LGBT and honestly any hate group. Plus on the surface it has some of the most creative visual and amazing score.  Visually and score wise this is a masterpiece. I said the best comparison is Utena...the movie and the show, if it was crammed into 12 episode and was more focused on yuri, and had bears.  So let's get to the reviewStory: As I said in the intro the story is hard to get into at first. I mean again is about humans being separated by intelligent man eating bears. That being said that is not the main focus, and more focus about Tsubaki as she does suffer a tragedy and is now trying to confront that both physically with the bear and herself. As the episode continues new things will emerge that will make her questioned herself and who are the actual people she should trust. The message about love and how society acts towards outcast. It shows the hatred of people who shunned those who are different, but also show how those victims, those outcast will always fight back because of love. Both sides will always have the motivation to keep on fighting, and the message is honestly really moving. That being said, the silliness does distract it a lot. I mean symbolism is great and everything, but from a logical point something doesn't add up, and the tone does change quite often which can be distracting. Not to mention there is a nice couple that is unfortunately taken away too soon, and I wanted to see them together more. While that couple is focused on flashback, I wish I could see more to feel the weight of that lost. Not to mention I just felt that couple seem to make more sense logically than the actual couple which again serves more for symbolism than logic.So to summarize the story does deliver some strong message, but their shift in tone, some of it is silly and questionable. That being said I probably like the story more if I rewatched it since there just so much to dissect from the show.Character: The characters are decent. I mean Tsubaki journey is great. Her wanting revenge on the bear makes sense and is easy to root for her. I just wish they made the weight of her wanting revenge much stronger.  The real star is the two bears, Ginko and Lulu who are just so much fun. While it's hard to support them at first, their motivation is clear up as the story go on, and they do a great job at making the audience support them.  They have all the best laugh and moments. As for the rest, they all okay and serve their message and symbolism and stuff I guess. None of them were truly terrible or annoying.So basically, Ginko and Lulu are the stars of the show. Tsubaki is an okay main character, along with the other character that served their roles.Sound and Art: Amazing. I mean I am listening to the soundtrack while doing this review and I can tell you is just excellent. Does a great job at accompanying the mood, and making this world feel much more vast and add so much to the anime. The art style also amazing, is like a picture book come to life. So many great memorable visuals. Just amazing, I can’t do it justice, is simply breathtaking. As I said is very much like Utena, more specifically the movie where the world seems dream like it almost seem real, but there always something strange and surreal to it. I was able to stand the madness of this anime, just because of how great it looked and just how much impact the music added to it.Basically the art and sound are amazing.Overall, I said if you are a Yuri fan, go watch this. While it might be nonsensical, the animation, the score, and the message do make it worth it.  While yes the message and symbolism sometimes do come first before logic, the characters are good enough to make the audience want to keep going and find out what's happening. This anime is just a wonderful picture book come to life. the movie and the show, if it was crammed into 12 episode and was more focused on yuri, and had bears.

But well its kind of good in some ways.I like the unusual ways of this anime. Very nice art and sound is very good.Its a story about love of two girls from fighting fractions. Story happens in a depresing war world. You should be warned that even with such fun looking style this anime is actually very dramatic anime.First episodes are kind of very unpredictable but later story is not so hard.I know its a drama but i wish there was a better conclusion for this story. ', 'Yuri Kuma Arashi feels like the kind of anime you\'re completely on board with, or not.  I, unfortunately, fall into the latter.Story: Yuri Kuma Arashi speaks of a world where a bears have invaded earth and are eating it\'s citizens.  In response, mankind has created a structure to split themselves off from these bears, called the Wall of Severance.  Our main story takes place at Arashigaoka Academy, where we are introduced to Kureha Tsubaki, a student whose mother was eaten by a bear.  This caused Kureha to have a complete distaste for the bears, as she personally suffered, due to their...existence.  Two of those bears, Ginko Yurishiro and Lulu Yurigasaki, take the form of humans and have enrolled into the academy.  Around this time, a student is eaten and academy is put on high alert.  This causes the academy to form a group of students known as the Invisible Storm to watch over the students and make sure times remain relatively peaceful.Honestly, I didn\'t mind the story itself.  Early on, Kureha gets word that another student is eaten by a bear, and this fuels her fire to hate bears even more.  The entire setup reminds me a bit of Attack on Titan - think Erin Yaeger with the various walls surrounding Shinsengumi.  This form of storytelling does work.  As we get through the story, we can see how Kureha ends up interacting with Ginko and Lulu, and she constantly questions, without knowing they are bears, why they want to be so close to her.  How do they know her?  What do they want with her?  Do they just want to make new friends?  These are questions that are fairly asked, and the series seeks to answer them, as well as other deeper plotlines that do creep into spoiler territory.What I minded significantly more is the writing.  The series goes in such roundabout ways to getting to some very simple topics and it feels like a lot of fat added on to create a story that has a longer airtime.  One example is a plotline surrounding a pendant that gets mentioned a few different times.  It ends up being a pretty important item, but why did they have to tack on so much extra to it?  They mention the reason for it once, then keep telling us over and over again.  There are also terms being used that just straight up sound stupid.  The Invisible Storm is created as a way to police students, but they do a poor job at explaining what their objective is other than kill the bears that invade their turf.  This kind of links to plot holes that I feel are prevalent at times.  The series has moments where there are suspicions of bears on campus, but then this group picks a name and says ""yes, she is the next threat"".  Another writing aspect that drove me nuts was the fact that characters repeated certain lines over and over again.  In case hearing ""Is your love true?"" didn\'t bother you the first time, maybe another dozen or more times would change your mind?  There are multiple lines that the series stubbornly sticks to.  The story elements are definitely there, but the way they went about it was just such a mess.  (4/10)Characters: This is a cast of characters that I just couldn\'t grow attached to.  Kureha was mostly okay, being a bear hater, but she really doesn\'t have much going for her outside of how her past starts to unfold as the story goes on.  Her mother was obviously very dear to her, but I do wish more was explained about her.  Ginko and Lulu aren\'t that bright, but clearly have very good intentions in mind.  We eventually see who these two are and they go from being annoying to just tolerable.Side characters weren\'t much better.  Mitsuko is confusing, as she seems to have this sinister side to her, and we actually find out why pretty early on, but they just ... kind of ignore her after a few episodes.  She\'s present in later episodes, but adds nothing, when she\'s hiding something that seems fairly important.  Yurika is the principal at the academy and her backstory\'s actually pretty interesting.  She has a very clear fear after being adopted at an early age and her main instinct, while questionable, makes sense when you hear her explain it.And then there\'s the three bears that oversee, what the series calls, the Yuri Trials (yes, it is about as stupid as it sounds).  Life Sexy, Life Cool and Life Beauty basically act as judges for all of bear-kind when those bears want something out of love.  They then approve it, sometimes with conditions, before should ""Yuri Approved"".  The entire setup, characters included, were cringy to watch, and really drive me nuts whenever they interjected into the story.  (5/10)Art: The art was fine, mostly keeping away from heavily popping visuals, but instead, going for something that reminds you of those playful kid\'s rooms when you were younger.  Light textures and colours took up most of what we saw.  Darker scenes were fine too, but felt like they were out of place.  This leads me to another thing that annoyed me - the strange way they portrayed censorship.  People die in this anime.  We hear our characters say person x and y gets eaten, or shot.  Your only indication of this in screen was a lying body or the hearing of ""munch munch"".  Look, you don\'t need to show gruesome blood or bullet holes, but trying to keep this show looking for something for young teens is a bit much, especially because we see half naked girls in the opening sequence alone.  (6/10)Sound: The OST and otherwise might be the only saving grace.  The tracks used matches what we see on the screen pretty well.  I was a huge fan of the OP, Ano Mori de Matteru, by Bonjour Suzuki.  The ED, Territory, was fine, sung by the Japanese VAs for Ginko, Lulu and Kureha.  The voice work was generally really well cast and executed.  Alexis Tipton (Kureha) was a strong choice here, as were Monica Rial (Ginko) and J Michael Tatum (Life Sexy).  I didn\'t have any real qualms with any of the VOs, credit to the ADR Director, Christopher Bevins, whose directing work I\'ve actually never seen before.  (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: I was simply not a fan of Yuri Kuma Arashi because, even though many of the story elements were fine, the writing and weird use of censorship really spoiled the experience for me.  When you hear the same thing over and over again, you can only take so much of that before you roll your eyes so hard they pop out of your head.  If you want something in the shoujo-ai category, want to turn your brain off, and just want to watch something somewhat cute, this might be for you, but it certainly didn\'t speak to me.

(5/10)', 'To me, my 2021 (and life in general) can be likened to sailing in a brig through a highly tempestuous ocean to in order to reach and resupply at the next port, one which you may not even know if it stands anymore.The weather seems to work against you. Your supplies are limited, and disease stalks around the corner. You carry various baggage, and may lose some in the occasional whirlpool. But once in a while, the air is warm, pleasant and blows to your port’s direction. You may have quite some opportunities to catch fish, and the lost baggage makes your boat lighter.And in...the end of the journey, there it is. The port. But it is far from the pristine shipyard city you would envision. There is a whole new set of challenges to navigate, such as dealing with totally different people and the local market’s workings. At this stage, one bears their own biases, emotions and morals and has to learn to deal with a new whole set of biases, emotions and morals, plus any overarching set of rules.Why bother writing this odd parallel? Because I want to point out that some challenges during the journey of life stem from objective circumstances, yet others from intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. There are many totally subjective barriers dividing mankind, such as language, religion, culture, etc.But the greatest barrier might be the ego. Many people claim to be tolerant of differences, but in practice just want their feelings validated and themselves reflected in the outer world. When somebody truly different shows up, they often react with fear and aversion, even if in a more implicit, passive-aggressive matter. And quite often, it is exactly because they see themselves reflected in the “Other” that they react as such. You frequently are what you hate.How does this review fit with these? It happens that Yuri Kuma explores exactly that: the barriers of the heart and the barriers imposed by society. It is time to elaborate.~~~ [1. First with an introduction…]~~~Yuri Kuma could be summarized as a demented fairy tale with a few sci-fi elements, and an allegorical commentary on the inconsistent attitudes of Japan towards homosexuality.~~~ [2. Followed by details on its approach…] ~~~Yuri Kuma thrives on visual storytelling, with images as a narrative tool on their own right. The work is highly symbolical, the whole tale serving as an allegory. One needs to focus more on the subtext rather than the context, as if taken too literally the story is going to prove very frustrating.And even then, the story can prove to be disturbing for all its apparent cuteness. Either way, one will bear (pun not intended) witness to a narrative interweaving stigma, repression, lust, segregation and hypocrisy.Nonetheless, allegory is not meant to be an excuse for certain writing issues I am going to note. First of all, the cast is often mistreated and there is much wasted potential. For one, almost all characters are mouthpieces, reduced to mere pawns in order for the allegory to work out, as the story gets too focused on a certain relationship, something especially apparent in later episodes.Many characters are unceremoniously tossed to the garbage bin, certain intriguing dynamics are never fleshed out (thus undermining any further thematic exploration on e.g. abusive relationships) and some characters turn into total extensions or satellites of others.Also, the story can occasionally be riddled with so much fanservice that it can bring into question where the allegory ends and where the pandering starts. And on pandering in general, sometimes it can become questionable for no reason, e.g. with a character essentially shipping their child relative with another child. And there is frequent silly and misplaced comedy, e.g. in scene climaxes, that often ruin tension and drama in a most awkward fashion.Any qualifications or drawbacks aside, there are also symbolisms not connected to homosexuality, such as a superego/ego/id one, and there might be a few references to literature, as a character is a reference to Winnie the Pooh.~~~ [3. Closing with notes on aesthetics…] ~~~There is not much need to elaborate on visuals. Quite alright, quite some cinematic shots, and given how a fair deal of imagery are symbols, expect lilies and the occasional surreal scenery.

Likewise, us humans as well are barricaded by our own barriers that keep us away from evolving to our highest selves.~~~ Happy New Year everybody! ~~~ the end of the journey, there it is. The port. But it is far from the pristine shipyard city you would envision. There is a whole new set of challenges to navigate, such as dealing with totally different people and the local market’s workings. At this stage, one bears their own biases, emotions and morals and has to learn to deal with a new whole set of biases, emotions and morals, plus any overarching set of rules.Why bother writing this odd parallel? Because I want to point out that some challenges during the journey of life stem from objective circumstances, yet others from intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. There are many totally subjective barriers dividing mankind, such as language, religion, culture, etc.But the greatest barrier might be the ego. Many people claim to be tolerant of differences, but in practice just want their feelings validated and themselves reflected in the outer world. When somebody truly different shows up, they often react with fear and aversion, even if in a more implicit, passive-aggressive matter. And quite often, it is exactly because they see themselves reflected in the “Other” that they react as such. You frequently are what you hate.How does this review fit with these? It happens that Yuri Kuma explores exactly that: the barriers of the heart and the barriers imposed by society. It is time to elaborate.~~~ [1. First with an introduction…]~~~Yuri Kuma could be summarized as a demented fairy tale with a few sci-fi elements, and an allegorical commentary on the inconsistent attitudes of Japan towards homosexuality.~~~ [2. Followed by details on its approach…] ~~~Yuri Kuma thrives on visual storytelling, with images as a narrative tool on their own right. The work is highly symbolical, the whole tale serving as an allegory. One needs to focus more on the subtext rather than the context, as if taken too literally the story is going to prove very frustrating.And even then, the story can prove to be disturbing for all its apparent cuteness. Either way, one will bear (pun not intended) witness to a narrative interweaving stigma, repression, lust, segregation and hypocrisy.Nonetheless, allegory is not meant to be an excuse for certain writing issues I am going to note. First of all, the cast is often mistreated and there is much wasted potential. For one, almost all characters are mouthpieces, reduced to mere pawns in order for the allegory to work out, as the story gets too focused on a certain relationship, something especially apparent in later episodes.Many characters are unceremoniously tossed to the garbage bin, certain intriguing dynamics are never fleshed out (thus undermining any further thematic exploration on e.g. abusive relationships) and some characters turn into total extensions or satellites of others.Also, the story can occasionally be riddled with so much fanservice that it can bring into question where the allegory ends and where the pandering starts. And on pandering in general, sometimes it can become questionable for no reason, e.g. with a character essentially shipping their child relative with another child. And there is frequent silly and misplaced comedy, e.g. in scene climaxes, that often ruin tension and drama in a most awkward fashion.Any qualifications or drawbacks aside, there are also symbolisms not connected to homosexuality, such as a superego/ego/id one, and there might be a few references to literature, as a character is a reference to Winnie the Pooh.~~~ [3. Closing with notes on aesthetics…] ~~~There is not much need to elaborate on visuals. Quite alright, quite some cinematic shots, and given how a fair deal of imagery are symbols, expect lilies and the occasional surreal scenery. There are also some nice fairy tale-inspired flashbacks.On sound: I don’t particularly mind most seiyuu picks, but some could sound too squeaky and whiny to appreciate. Take my complain with a grain of salt, as I usually prefer deeper voices.Yuri Kuma’s music is excellent, starting with its stunning OP, which is a hypnotizing and bittersweet electropop track, sang sultrily by Bonjour Suzuki.

And oh wow, it went for a completely different route from what I imagined, even when I had heard about it being dark and stuff. My attitude slowly went from loathing to adoring, and my rating somehow went from 6 to 9 lol. Just, when I could bear (pun not intended) the absurdity of the first few episodes it was so gripping I couldn’t stop watching till the end lol, with fairytale-like “story within story ” shits being my favorite, like in RevStar or Liz and The Blue Bird....Things only get better, trust me (or not, depends on your taste).This show has Revenging for loved ones troupe, Possesiveness, Prejudice, Lust, Guilt, Maginalization of the Minority, Forgivesness and ""Friendship"" among some other things I couldn\'t pick up, and the most recurring theme is ""Love"". Imbued with absurd social construct that doesn\'t feel real, sometimes I felt like watching Kill la Kill but with Yuri Bear transformations and fairytale.Here’s some main “reactions” I got from watching this from the first ep, if you wanna imagine the reaction you would have yourself:—Kicking off with some serious stuff. Hmm, good.—Oh my gah, what the HECK is this OP? I thought it was gonna at least be energetic cheerful 90s pop? What is this kinky singing? Hentai in disguise? Th-Threesome?! Oh dear, definitely cross off from the list of “anime recommendable to normies and your baby sister”. Oh dear, 17+, I forgot to look at the ratings. At this point I’m too ready to rate a mere 6 with only 1 ep in.—Well I guess you have put in uh, too much, um, “symbolism” and metaphor shits; I literally can’t comprehend how the behavior of the characters is normal, how odd compared to real life. Why the heck are they doing that, weird, weird shit! Uh wait, exaggerations are everywhere in other anime as well, understandable, please go ahead.—Are you sure this is not just to show off weird fetishes and fanservices, this is again, not hentai right? Um, ok, not Valkyrie Drive level yet, ok ok.—I started to believe the creators have some lose screws in their head. My eyebrows got exhausted from constant frowning and raising it hurts.—Why am I laughing? The characters are literally crying and dramatic music playing and why am I bursting out laughing every 5 minutes? Is it because the lines are too lame and weird and cringy and melodramatic they’re funny? My humor antenna tingled at such random at times.—Oh, how odd, it’s actually getting more and more wholesome and heartwarming as it proceeds. OP is listenable now, but I’m still shook. Oh, and things ARE making sense now thanks god.—Still laughing and grinning from ear to ear every 5 minutes.—Beauty, Cool, Sexy desu wa.Having heard of its reputation, I already buckled up and wore my helmet to defend myself from dark stuff. Thought it was going to leave me in a serious and somber mood similar to Meguca main series or HnK stuff with tragic stuff but NO: I finished it laughing hard as could be, celebrating, slapping my knees intermittently in satisfaction—now I can have my n-th pair of girls being Romeo and Juliet alternatives aka Our Love in A Society kind of story. Beautiful. Hilarious show. Based on my liking alone, solid high score. Pro critics and reviewers and bloggers had already have their fair share of symbolism analyses and other literature-class-like analyses, and I love these reviews, whether the show was just being, uh, allegorical and people are assigning more values than it intended to deliver. I’m dumb so I can just contribute my review about my appreciation and joy, while still nodding and naruhodo’ing as though listening to what my Literature teacher is passionately talking about. I’m happy that with this kind of show with theme and stuff where the creators went apeshits in their delivery and even though its messages can be understood through repetitions, some are more open to interpretation, which I like.Still have to admit this kind of anime is still quite niche that even when I marked it with the ""recommended"" tag lol; the look on the faces of the ones just started out in anime seeing this randomly for the first time must be priceless.

It is made with the essence of like nonsense literature and has some not too difficult message.I like this anime very much, but I can understand the naysayers.I recommend watching it if you can watch a few episodes and laugh at the strange expressions.

But oh, what kind of places.They are so magical, with a great amount of surrealism, artistic, unique.It leaves you wanting more. Always wanting to know what other kind of places he will visit. Places just beyond our imagination.The art is really simple, original,different. That's what makes it...so beautiful. For me is perfect.You feel like you're watching a painter working. And you're transported into the painting.The music is so relaxing, perfect for this piece of art. And is a well a piece of art. A great job of Kenji Kondo.I can almost imagine the instruments coming into scene while watching this.And I wouldn't be surprised if that happened ^^.The characters well let's see... have you ever seen a pig with legs thinner than a horse's?. Here you can see it. And you will love it.Tortov reminded me a little of Don Quijote. Thin and tall, using a hat too.(Maybe the pig is Rocinante.)And the things that Tortov writes on his diary gives us a more magical and pretty perspective. I love how he sees everything.I almost forgot about the bunny men! They are awesome.There's the lady of the flower hat too.And a big bear who proyects cartoons on his back ^^.I highly recommend this. I know it's not popular, but only people who are imaginative and can open their minds to appreciate  different and beautiful things and don't call everything new ''weird'' can really enjoy this.And if you're not one of those persons, try to see it anyways, it's worth it.The best way of watching this?.

Relaxing drinking a cup of tea :]"", ""Legitimately one of my favorite anime, although really not for everyone.The Diary of Tortov Roddle is a series of wonderful, beautiful, surreal, wordless (aside from text from Tortov's diary) shorts, starring the traveler Tortov Roddle and his strange long-legged pig mount and companion.  There's not really a story to speak of; the series is essentially a series of short vignettes.  Tortov goes somewhere, experiences something odd, and then moves on.What somethings they are, though.  The series is surreal, but unlike most uses of surrealism, it's not really symbolic.  The surrealism doesn't represent the mind of a character, or the author's opinion...of the Vietnam War, it's simply a weird, wondrous world that Tortov is exploring.  The series has a very Japanese focus on fleeting moments.  The events Tortov encounters aren't big, they're things like a fish jumping out of his coffee cup in a cafe, or watching a cartoon projected on the back of a bear, and once Tortov moves on, they're not mentioned again.  This sense of transience, along with the quiet, contemplative nature of the series gives everything a slight feel of melancholy that adds a bit of weight to the wonder.The art is gorgeous, and perfectly suits the series.  It really doesn't look like your average anime, instead going for a painterly story book look that's really nice to look at, and suits the dream-like nature of the show.  The use of color is also very well done, there's a lot of unified color palettes in the episodes to give things certain atmospheres.  It really does feel like a moving story book at times.The music is very nice.  It has a kind of French feel, with liberal use of accordion.  It's suitably whimsical, and again slightly sad.  It doesn't feel particularly prominent, but it's not really meant to.If you don't appreciate an effectively storyless series, or this sort of simplistic wonder, you probably won't like Tortov Roddle.

Aru Tabibito no Nikki is the diary of a man named Tortov Roddle. His diary is beautifully simplistic; he writes about what he sees and what he\'s doing. He writes about what is on his mind.There is no exaggeration. There are no women with massive breasts, there are no chibi scenes or outrageous expressions. This sentence explains exactly what this short is: ""Accompanied by his long-legged pig friend, Tortov takes us on an on-going adventure of peaceful contemplation.""And what a beautiful...process that is. It doesn\'t take hours; it only takes a quarter of an hour to accomplish what many, many anime cannot.This anime is storyless, and yet it isn\'t. What person\'s life can really be called an action-packed story? Life is not always interesting. The best parts of life include silence, contemplation, and mental exploration. But, then again, Tortov\'s story isn\'t uninteresting in the slightest. It\'s surreal. It\'s the picture of an unusual, creative world with flashes into the mind of a fairly normal, thoughtful, and almost melancholic man. In these moments, he is perfectly real - sometimes expressionless, sometimes excited, sometimes surprised, sometimes vulnerable, sometimes not.This atmospheric experience is, in a way, mellowed by an eccentric, beautiful art style and a slightly depressing array of gentle music. Nothing is pushed in your face. Everything is softened and warmed for you, but the story does not become dull. It\'s as though you are a child being spoon-fed these wonderful, calm musings. None of it dribbles down your lips and chin. All of it is just calmly swallowed, but never really completely digested. And I mean that in the best possible sense.Aru Tabibito no Nikki can only be described as an artistic masterpiece, with pressure on ""artistic."" Art is subjective; this is the king of subjectivity. How much you enjoy it depends on your current walk in life. How much you enjoy it depends on your mindset, on what you\'re looking for.

For me, Aru Tabibito no Nikki came at a time where I needed to be soothed, inspired, and impacted. All of this, it can achieve.So do not just pick this anime up just for the heck of it.

In the eye of an impartial observer, the six stories may seem a bit disjointed, with no obvious through line or extensive exploration into the character’s psyche.  Be that as it may, it would seem that The Diary of Tortov Roddle was not meant to be understood through the narrow prism of human logic, but, more or less, experienced via innate emotions.  A placid, visceral viewing experience if there ever was one.The surrealistic approach, along with the imaginative artwork, gives...the impression that the director breathed life into an oil painting.  The aesthetic — unadorned, yet bizarre —compliments the critical events quite nicely, imparting a useful “essence” into each story.  Furthermore, the use of natural sounds, like the wind blowing in The City of Light or the fire crackling in Moonlight Travelers, feel palpable, as if it were emanating through the screen itself.  These noises serve a useful function to enable the viewer to “connect” with the anime on a personal level, allowing the events, like the community gathering or the reminiscing about a past love, feel more impactful.Simply put: it’s a pleasant viewing experience.It harkens to a transient, spontaneous existence, in which exhilarating moments happen fortuitously in a most unexpected manner.  We observe, we react, and then we move on — similar to Tortov — to our subsequent eye-opening journey.  It may be aimless, it may seem futile, and it may feel positively chaotic; nevertheless, if we maintain an open-mind, we may enjoy ourselves on this haphazard adventure called life, and possibly learn something new along the way.8/10 — Enjoyment (the rating I used for this review)6/10 — Overall (the rating I use for my own personal list) the impression that the director breathed life into an oil painting.

While it's true that there's little room left for plot devices and character development if you happen to have a running time that doesn't even surpass half an hour, I still find this notion absolutely ridiculous. Rather than observing a short film and condemn it based on the lack of things you'd find in a movie, I've always been under the belief that the approach itself needs to be changed in accordance to the running time. Hopefully, viewers who happen to...come across the subject of these pointless scribbles will have their perception of animated shorts changed forever in the beautiful, mesmerizing and absolutely pointless creation that goes under the name: The Diary of Tortov Riddle.Now, visually speaking this little eccentricity plays out exactly like one would expect the incestuous offspring of Tim Burton and Cat Soup to do; character designs tend to be tall and slim; the color palette is muted to the extreme and there are enough semi-artsy oddities to give Yoji Kuji a heart attack. Story-wise though, the atmosphere seems a lot more inspired by Kino's Journey as the protagonist of the film, Tortov Riddle, travels on a pig with extraordinarily long legs, facing various encounters with other creatures as well as experiencing various strange things. His travels are documented in his diary which is shown at certain points, usually at the end of each story. Unlike Kino’s Journey though there are no fables or general lessons in moral to be found. Tortov is merely a lonely traveler whose motivations are never revealed and who seems to treasure his bizarre encounters more than anything else.All in all there are six stories that together create a running time of approximately 18 minutes. These minutes are well spent on beautifully surreal artwork that depicts everything from Tortov's encounter with a mysterious woman to a town hosting a cinema party by projecting an animated movie on the back of a peculiar bear-hybrid thingy. Keep in mind that few of the stories have actual conclusions and there is no continuity to find whatsoever. The best way to enjoy it is to take in the beautiful but simplistic visuals as well as the equally harmonic soundtrack that relies on everything from pianos to more unusual instruments to establish a dreamlike feeling few other movies manage to invoke.The world of animated shorts suffers from an over-representation from the admittedly masterful Makoto Shinkai whose Voices of a Distant Star continues to rightfully mesmerize. However, in recent years it's become quite apparent that there are other creators out there producing shorts that reach an almost similar kind of quality. The Diary of Tortov Riddle was directed by Kunio Katou who later went on to create the Oscar-winning La Maison en Petits Cubet which I also recommend. However, inside the realm of anime shorts, that I have explored somewhat thoroughly, Tortov Riddle stands out as one of the better creations I've seen. It's able to invoke a strange feeling of an almost childlike wonder that makes you absolutely content just witnessing the peculiarities the film exhibits rather than questioning them. Sleep is never an easy thing for me, but after I finished watching this for the second time I fell asleep almost immediately and although I can't remember any of my dreams I'm sure they were quite pleasant acid trips from the fascinating and beautiful world of Tortaria. come across the subject of these pointless scribbles will have their perception of animated shorts changed forever in the beautiful, mesmerizing and absolutely pointless creation that goes under the name: The Diary of Tortov Riddle.Now, visually speaking this little eccentricity plays out exactly like one would expect the incestuous offspring of Tim Burton and Cat Soup to do; character designs tend to be tall and slim; the color palette is muted to the extreme and there are enough semi-artsy oddities to give Yoji Kuji a heart attack.

The story starts where Tortov Roddle, the main character and somewhat the narrator, introduces himself and tells us a bit about his journey.During his journey, he encounters a lot of fantasized things, such as frogs, a fish, a bear, a pig, rabbits, etc. (I will not say specifically how they are related to fantasy since that would spoil the whole thing).

', 'As it has been expressed by my peers, the art alone is reason to watch. It really is like watching old Canadian or European cartoons - particularly, for me, The Man Who Planted Trees (which is one of my favourites). I love watercolours, personally, so this art style spoke to me immediately, because the textures and hues are those of a watercolour painting. As Tehnominator states ""the grainy look makes the images seem aged... like in a story book from one\'s childhood"" or in my case, a painting.This could also be due to the wonderful implementation of frames to tell a story, like...in the black and white motion pictures of the early 1900\'s. The music and  sounds all fit the images and art directions perfectly. They are whimsical and imaginative, as though every day (every story) were a new discovery! In watching, we become children again - excited to visit the moon, or build a a shining fortress made a sand from some distant star!Some of my favourite things about the art style:I love the subtlety of movement. It is sometimes so slight that it is barely noticeable at all.I also love that the backgrounds remind me of surrealism in their abstract qualities. Trees, for example (or at least what appear to possibly be trees, having a somewhat tree-like shape), resemble something more from a Dr. Seuss book rather than in anime. And in a way, this makes it even more like an anime, because the animation is both so futuristic, while remaining traditional and using techniques from the past.The creatures, which are unique in and of themselves, as well as Tortov\'s imagination are what really make the shorts an interesting experience. You never quite know where you will end up or with who/what.The storylines are very short (each is less than five minutes) and very simple. The way the language changes really makes an impact on the feel of the impact. I say this because sometimes  the language Tortov uses is the same as a child would use to phrase a sentence (ex. ""My name is Tortov Roddle. When I have a bad dream, I want to forget it as soon as possible."") and other times it is very detached, like that of a true explorer or scientist - one who observes more than they feel. And the art has a wonderful and specific way of explaining or illustrating (no pun intended) this to make a real story from the sentences we are introduced to (the sentences being characters themselves). This can be both simple and funny, while other times it is more transient and abstract.I will agree with the consensus that there are times I wish the storylines had given us even more depth and let us get to know these worlds a bit more, because while I love a good short, I love a rich world of possibility and flavour that I get to know slowly even more. I have this same idealistic complaint with travel journals - even my own. I want a puppet show as much as I want an exploration. This anime, however, is like sitting in a European bookshop or cafe and just contemplating one\'s most random thoughts and the places you\'ve been without a worry of what it all means or where it goes. It is a meandering river, but without a real finale.While not a great deal happens in terms of plot or character development in itself, there is a rich world to explore and more is happening before us than the stories narrate.

Tortov Roddle shares the name anime only in the sense that it wass animated in Japan, and the concept is from Japan. And though you could draw similarities from the latter, the former is difficult to see. Watching, I felt as though I was looking at a French arts short film. And that is what Tortov Roddle is, a series of artistic shorts, pushing surreal boundaries and supplanting reality for fantasy.The series...immediately left me intrigued. The character of Tortov is charming, and the whimsy and wonder reminded me of Miyazaki. The animation was simplistic, and yet incredibly detailed. By far it stood out from any other Japanese animation I\'ve seen, or, to be fair, any animation I\'ve seen. It is in a class of it\'s own. The soundtrack was delicate. Each noise, each shuffle, was carefully placed such that they carried utmost importance, and yet you could recognize them as anything more than simply noise associated with action. There are no spoken words in Tortov Roddle, only music, and perhaps laughter. The entire feel and flow of this series was determined by the music, powerful, pristine and overwhelming. Tortov himself was uncanny, and his companion bizarre.So what can I really say about Tortov Roddle. It\'s a series of shorts. I watched 7 episodes, though this site would have you believe that it ends at 6 (which is a shame because the 7th was by far my favourite). If you\'re looking for a short series you can watch by yourself to pass time, I would strongly recommend Tortov Roddle. However there is most certainly a mood requirement to truly appreciate this series. Save it for a rainy day, curled up in a warm blanket with a hot cup of cocoa . You won\'t regret it. immediately left me intrigued. The character of Tortov is charming, and the whimsy and wonder reminded me of Miyazaki. The animation was simplistic, and yet incredibly detailed.

A very artistic short series that leaves you wanting more. Soothing and relaxing music that forces you to clear up your mind. A beautiful masterpiece. ', ""A series of anime shorts by Robot/Oh! Productions who have also produced some similar, unrelated shorts. This series has 6 episodes that are all no more than 3 minutes. It is basically a very short quaint, episodic story with no plot whatsoever and no overarching story. The shorts usually place Tortov Riddle travelling to some location with his gigantic camel pig, and doing or seeing something for a few minutes. The art style is fantastic, a picturesque, surreal, somewhat French inspired look that fits the tone of the short perfectly. It makes every short enjoyable and is basically the most unique part about the series....The music is also quite nice, use of the accordian, piano, and violin. Goes well with the art style and the tone the shorts are setting, making the actual watch more enjoyable. The stories don't have alot of symbolic meaning, although there could be something I missed. But I think they are just meant to be rainy day stories and not supposed to be overthought, if anything it was a style experiment. All of shorts are worth a watch at some point, you can torrent the whole thing for like 300mb. The music is also quite nice, use of the accordian, piano, and violin.

Umineko no Naku Koro ni,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4896/Umineko_no_Naku_Koro_ni,"[""A few things before reading this review:-yes, I am one of those who have played the sound novel before watching the anime;-no, I will not make this an essay of comparison between the two, nor will I praise the novel over the anime; however, it is inevitable that certain comparisons will indeed appear, in order to explain the flaws of the anime;-this review might seem a bit unfriendly to someone who has no clue what Umineko is about. In fact, it's much more addressed to those who have partially or completely watched the anime/read the manga/played the game.Let me begin with a simple assertion. Umineko...as an anime is a bad experience. Note that I did not say horrendous nor terrible. The Umineko anime is not at all a complete train-wreck, despite all the hatred it receives from the fandom; it's simply nothing more than mediocre. In other terms, it feels similar to trying to bend a very detailed paper figurine in a jar that's too small and ruining it in the process. Yes, the figurine was remarkable beforehand. But no, it did not remain so afterward.There are two main reasons why the Umineko anime doesn't work:-adaptation decay (butchering of the characters and the plot for time's convenience) and-the very little effort Studio DEEN put into making it (bad graphics, right music at the wrong time, wrong character designs, overall wrong atmosphere).BUTCHERING OF THE CHARACTERSOne of Umineko's main put-offs is the fact that is has such a large cast of characters. You cannot help but forget who is who, who is related to whom, where someone popped out of, what the purpose of a certain character is and so on and so forth. The adaptation from the novel to the anime meant losing a lot of development for plot's sake, and that really adds to the overall confusion. Except for the very main two characters (Battler and Beatrice), almost all the other characters are uni-dimensional. Name one word that relates to Rosa - abusive. One that defines Maria? Whiny. One for Ronove? Cookies. See the point?While it becomes (or should become) clear after a while that in the wit game of Umineko, the humans are nothing more that chess pieces and the witches are simply devices to advance the arguments, that isn't an excuse. Why should you watch something where you don't care for any of the characters? Again, this is still the adaptation's fault. The original source material, while still keeping a few members of the cast undeveloped (I'm looking at you, Hideyoshi and Nanjo), at least managed to make all the characters likeable – therefore less likely to suspect. The anime didn't retain that; quite the opposite. You end up feeling exasperated most of the time by almost everybody.Now onto the main characters: Battler and Beatrice.Battler:-supposed to be the epitome of manliness, logic and determination [novel];-ended up being the most delusional of them all (ironically), has huge shoujo eyes and most of the times doesn't make any sense at all [anime].Beatrice:-complex character, acts all cruel, rough and unrefined in the beginning, but manages to melt halfway through and create a friendship/rivalry bond with Battler, to the point of finally being able to transmit to him the purpose of her existence [novel];-complete bitch who takes a 180 turn in the last episode and goes all helpless moe moe kyun for no reason [anime].BUTCHERING OF THE PLOTLike it or not, the original Umineko story is damn complex, a complete, subtle mindfuck, in fact. Perhaps that is why it doesn't work that well in the visual format of the anime. Anime watchers are used to taking something literally as it is. Umineko was not supposed to be like that – hence even the unfriendly red text. Unfortunately, Studio DEEN didn't manage to clear the misconception at all. To get to the point:One of the main questions that arose while experiencing Umineko (both in the sound novel and the anime form) was this – why the heck would Battler try to deny the existence of the witch when she's obviously sitting in front of him, cackling inelegantly and hitting him in the head with her pipe? It seems utterly ridiculous and pointless. A complete waste of time.However, that is not the case. The novel, having the advantage of underlining concepts in a textual form, managed to clear this. The anime didn't. To explain further on:Say Mary (Beatrice) is a multimillionaire and Ben (Battler) is a salary-man. There is a great business plan (the murders) going to unfold. Ben claims that you can manage that business with an amount of experience similar to the one he has (logic). Mary claims that you can only do it with a lot of money (magic). They decide to settle this in a game of monopoly (the anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery game).Now obviously, in a game of monopoly there are restrictions. You can only play with monopoly money. Had Mary played with real-life money, Ben would have absolutely no chance of winning. That's why, Mary's moves are restricted as well. It's a completely fair game.Proving the point, basically Battler doesn't have to deny magic, period. He would never be able to do that, with Beatrice appearing in front of him and whatnot. He has to deny magic on the 4th and 5th of October 1986 in Rokkenjima, based on the fake scenarios created by Beatrice. It's logical, it's fair and with the right ideas, it doesn't contradict itself at all, quite the opposite. That is the whole fun and magic of Umineko.Of course, some might say, how the heck were the viewers supposed to know this with the anime not explaining it? Unfortunately, by the explanations being cut, they simply could not know it. The novel had a lot of detailed sidelong concepts to help the whole logic battle (chessboard turning, Hempel's raven, Schrödinger's cat box) which the anime only briefly mentioned and never insisted on. In other words, a mystery which seemed barely solvable in the novel isn't solvable at all in the anime. That's why, if you're watching Umineko expecting to get a straightforward, definite answer, you won't get it. Which is sad, considering that the main purpose of Umineko was to make you have a brainstorming session. Besides, when in an anime you have to consult additional sources to realize what the heck is going on, that in itself is a problem. I'd say watch Umineko for some other aspects than the mystery, but honestly, there's nothing more to watch if for. And that is Studio DEEN's fault.EXCESSIVE FANSERVICE, COMPLETELY UNRELATED HIGURASHI ATMOSPHERE, UNSYMMETRYCAL EARS: I'm looking at you, Studio DEENThat's exactly as the title says. You could feel that the staff members of Studio DEEN were completely desperate by simply throwing a glance at the DVD covers. Or by the excessive amount of cleavage in all the female character designs (minus Bernkastel, who, funnily enough, did have quite the bust in the original material). It's very likely that DEEN themselves realized the Umineko anime was bad as it is; and that they had no other plans in which to compensate that.Now I don't have anything against this particular studio; but you as a viewer could definitely sense that they screwed up. There is a famous screenshot in which Eva has a huge ear on one side of her head as opposed to the tiny one on the other side. That goes beyond the excuse of lack of funds. It's simply not caring for. The other main mistake is probably the fact that DEEN tried to promote this as a Higurashi sequel as much as they could to be able to milk money out of the fans. Why should Maria have the Hinamizawa syndrome eyes? They are irrelevant and out of place. Why must there be those weird sideways camera angles? And that emphasis on the gruesome death scenes instead of, say, the reactions of the living (much more important to the plot themselves)?As for the art, while not being overly-pretentious, it manages to be above barely watchable. In fact, it's a nice change from the shiny shiny artwork nowadays. Still, it doesn't rise above the overall mediocrity of the execution itself.Let's stop this lament at once, though. For Umineko also has certain redeeming characteristics, though not enough. To name them:-the music. Yes, used mostly inconsistently, but taken as a whole, very good music. However, that is still thanks to the sound novel tracks remixes;-OH! DESIRE. A perfect ED theme. Almost as if it was the studio's message of 'You want to get trolled? Well get trolled till the end, then!';-OP theme;-good, fitting voices for the characters (surprisingly, Shannon's voice actress managed to suit her personality really well).ENJOYMENT AND OVERALLUmineko anime can basically be defined as a great story with a horrible execution. And that is not right; for, on an anime market with a lot of mediocre stories with great  visual/audio/atmosphere candies, Umineko is exactly the opposite, being hard to digest.For a sound novel player, it's a complete session of rage, of 'Why the heck was that cut?' and 'Hey, they did that wrong! Bastards!'.And for an anime-only viewer, it's a 'How do I make head or tail of this thing? Eh, never mind, someone's been killed again' reaction chain.To conclude with, I would recommend Umineko the anime only to those who are new to anime in general and have only watched around 20-30 series so far. More experimented watchers would definitely be able to sense the plot holes and lack of affective implication. And they will not enjoy that.(As a small parenthesis, this is quite opposed to my recommendation of the novel/manga; I recommend the novel/manga to absolutely anyone. Read it and you won't regret it.) as an anime is a bad experience. Note that I did not say horrendous nor terrible. The Umineko anime is not at all a complete train-wreck, despite all the hatred it receives from the fandom; it's simply nothing more than mediocre. In other terms, it feels similar to trying to bend a very detailed paper figurine in a jar that's too small and ruining it in the process. Yes, the figurine was remarkable beforehand. But no, it did not remain so afterward.There are two main reasons why the Umineko anime doesn't work:-adaptation decay (butchering of the characters and the plot for time's convenience) and-the very little effort Studio DEEN put into making it (bad graphics, right music at the wrong time, wrong character designs, overall wrong atmosphere).BUTCHERING OF THE CHARACTERSOne of Umineko's main put-offs is the fact that is has such a large cast of characters. You cannot help but forget who is who, who is related to whom, where someone popped out of, what the purpose of a certain character is and so on and so forth. The adaptation from the novel to the anime meant losing a lot of development for plot's sake, and that really adds to the overall confusion. Except for the very main two characters (Battler and Beatrice), almost all the other characters are uni-dimensional. Name one word that relates to Rosa - abusive. One that defines Maria? Whiny. One for Ronove? Cookies. See the point?While it becomes (or should become) clear after a while that in the wit game of Umineko, the humans are nothing more that chess pieces and the witches are simply devices to advance the arguments, that isn't an excuse. Why should you watch something where you don't care for any of the characters? Again, this is still the adaptation's fault. The original source material, while still keeping a few members of the cast undeveloped (I'm looking at you, Hideyoshi and Nanjo), at least managed to make all the characters likeable – therefore less likely to suspect. The anime didn't retain that; quite the opposite. You end up feeling exasperated most of the time by almost everybody.Now onto the main characters: Battler and Beatrice.Battler:-supposed to be the epitome of manliness, logic and determination [novel];-ended up being the most delusional of them all (ironically), has huge shoujo eyes and most of the times doesn't make any sense at all [anime].Beatrice:-complex character, acts all cruel, rough and unrefined in the beginning, but manages to melt halfway through and create a friendship/rivalry bond with Battler, to the point of finally being able to transmit to him the purpose of her existence [novel];-complete bitch who takes a 180 turn in the last episode and goes all helpless moe moe kyun for no reason [anime].BUTCHERING OF THE PLOTLike it or not, the original Umineko story is damn complex, a complete, subtle mindfuck, in fact. Perhaps that is why it doesn't work that well in the visual format of the anime. Anime watchers are used to taking something literally as it is. Umineko was not supposed to be like that – hence even the unfriendly red text. Unfortunately, Studio DEEN didn't manage to clear the misconception at all. To get to the point:One of the main questions that arose while experiencing Umineko (both in the sound novel and the anime form) was this – why the heck would Battler try to deny the existence of the witch when she's obviously sitting in front of him, cackling inelegantly and hitting him in the head with her pipe? It seems utterly ridiculous and pointless. A complete waste of time.However, that is not the case. The novel, having the advantage of underlining concepts in a textual form, managed to clear this. The anime didn't. To explain further on:Say Mary (Beatrice) is a multimillionaire and Ben (Battler) is a salary-man. There is a great business plan (the murders) going to unfold. Ben claims that you can manage that business with an amount of experience similar to the one he has (logic). Mary claims that you can only do it with a lot of money (magic). They decide to settle this in a game of monopoly (the anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery game).Now obviously, in a game of monopoly there are restrictions. You can only play with monopoly money. Had Mary played with real-life money, Ben would have absolutely no chance of winning. That's why, Mary's moves are restricted as well. It's a completely fair game.Proving the point, basically Battler doesn't have to deny magic, period. He would never be able to do that, with Beatrice appearing in front of him and whatnot. He has to deny magic on the 4th and 5th of October 1986 in Rokkenjima, based on the fake scenarios created by Beatrice. It's logical, it's fair and with the right ideas, it doesn't contradict itself at all, quite the opposite. That is the whole fun and magic of Umineko.Of course, some might say, how the heck were the viewers supposed to know this with the anime not explaining it? Unfortunately, by the explanations being cut, they simply could not know it. The novel had a lot of detailed sidelong concepts to help the whole logic battle (chessboard turning, Hempel's raven, Schrödinger's cat box) which the anime only briefly mentioned and never insisted on.

Read it and you won't regret it.)"", 'One must remember that the Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime is an adaptation. While the anime in itself may not necessarily warrant harsh scores of 2 or 3, in comparison to its source material, it is extremely, extremely lacking. I find it inconceivable that anyone could give this series, even if they never read the sound novel, a 9 or 10 out of 10 rating. While the sound novel may not have been a masterpiece, it was intriguing, exciting, and, at times, moving. In its adaptation into an anime, the entire thing was turned into something disgustingly shallow and one-dimensional.I doubt that any...studio or director would have been able to cram every single detail of the sound novels into 26 episodes. However, the way it was done was nothing but uncouth.I was looking forward to Umineko from the moment I heard of it. I wasn\'t a big fan of Higurashi, but the synopsis made it seem reminiscent of my favorite book, And Then There Were None, and more fitting to my tastes in general. After the first five episodes, I couldn\'t describe it in any way other than ""shallow."" I hadn\'t heard of or read the novels at the time, but from the very beginning it felt as though something was missing. I heard the novel really was amazing, though, and sought it out. While there were flaws, the first four episodes of the novel felt much more complete than the anime. The story is mostly reading and the atmosphere is set more by the music rather than the visuals. Despite this, R07 managed to make the experience very enjoyable. After finishing it, I then continued with the anime, hoping it would at least somewhat meet the level the sound novel did. Of course, it didn\'t come close.The anime really has no continuity or flow whatsoever. I found myself asking as the episodes progressed, ""Wait, did they cover event X?"" and holes simply cannot be left in a mystery story (what Umineko is presented as), other than intentional ones. Small things, such as Battler and Beatrice\'s reactions to each others\' actions were left out or glossed over, making the story incredibly superficial. A lot of fun from the sound novel came from these moments between them.The meaning behind events happening and secrets slowly unfolding is completely lost. In fact, the fight between Battler and Beatrice, anti-fantasy vs. anti-mystery, might as well not exist in the anime. It\'s supposed to be a detective/mystery story, albeit a strange one, and not simply that of a fickle witch murdering over a dozen people for fun, which is what the anime turned it into, at least until the very end where it does a rapid, poorly timed 180. Of course, the end was the ""same"" in the sound novel, but then it was clearly thought out and planned. The anime made it seem as if the producers/director forgot all about the end until the last five minutes of the final episode, then shoved it in.By the end of the fourth game, one should be able to determine the culprit. By reading the sound novel, I believe this to be possible. I don\'t see how it could ever be done watching the anime alone.The art is something that is clearly hit-or-miss. The main reason people seem to be put off from the sound novel is the ""horrendous"" art. Yes, different heads put on the same body and then turned into different characters. Yes, boxing glove hands. The art of Ryukishi07\'s works is clearly all about the faces. Whether the art of the anime is better or worse is something I\'ll let you decide for yourself. However, I think it\'s unquestionable that the facial expressions of the sound novel are exponentially better than the anime. I won\'t say that they are drawn well, but something has to be said of bad art that can manage to send chills down spines and make someone not want to read it at night because of frightening expressions. It would be hard for any animator to capture the riveting expressions of the sound novel, however I think they definitely could have tried harder, or at least have done a wider variation.Of course, the faces weren\'t the only things animated. Some characters (Rosa) clearly look better than others (Battler), however no one looked totally dreadful, though some people would beg to disagree with that point. In some cases I actually found myself preferring it (Maria actually looks like a nine-year old), but I can\'t understand why they felt the need change nearly everyone\'s eye color to blue.The sound was the most decent thing. The sound of the sound novel was excellent, as to be expected. The music really makes the setting, and even some scenes. The anime remixed some of the songs and used some of the original sound effects. Some fan-favorite songs were left out, but overall they did a decent job in this department.The song for the opening was very good; I was happy to see they used Akiko Shikata, who did the opening for the sound novel. While, other than ""yami o kirisaku OH DESIIIIRE,"" I disliked the ending song itself. I found it very fitting for Kinzo, however.While many characters aren\'t expanded on in the sound novel until Episode 5 and the anime goes up to Episode 4, the anime made it seem as if no one, aside from Battler and Maria, had a personality. Several scenes left out of the anime expand on many of the characters, mainly the adults. Every adult in the anime, aside from Rosa, the cruel, heartless, ""mother of the year,"" might as well have been there to simply add to the body count. For instance, a scene completely left out of the fourth game in the anime, known as the ""Krauss Counter,"" made Krauss (the only adult I actually disliked at the time) likable. While the scene itself was probably the most over-the-top out of them all and not vital to the story (though it actually was part of the group held underground escaping), it made it harder to be suspicious of Krauss, who seemed to care about money more than anything else beforehand. Several scenes that were included were done very poorly, such as Rosa and Maria at the end of the second game and the Sisters of Purgatory, Kyrie, and Rudolf fighting in the third game. It was these many moments centered around the adults that actually made them seem like people rather than warm bodies existing for the sole purpose of dying.The characterization is so important to the series. A mystery has three parts to answer: the whodunnit, the howdunnit, and the whydunnit. In this series, its easiest to focus on the whydunnit, as opposed to many other mysteries.Beatrice says that witches exist and that everyone is being killed by magic. Battler refuses to believe in the existence of witches and magic but can\'t deny that the murders are happening. If it\'s not magic, then one of the eighteen has to be the killer. One of the reasons the sound novel is so compelling is that every one of the possible culprits is likable in some way. As the it progresses, you don\'t want to believe it\'s any of them, but you know someone has to be guilty. Watching the anime alone, I wouldn\'t mind suspecting nearly anyone; I\'d have no attachment to any of the characters, and therefore the story.The saddest thing about this series is that it ruined what is an, if not great, at least enjoyable, story. Those who hated it are missing out on a story they could have gotten to really like. Those who loved it should definitely start reading the sound novel, if anything to read Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru, which will probably/hopefully never see an anime adaption. studio or director would have been able to cram every single detail of the sound novels into 26 episodes.

It\'s just sad that it has been quite underrated because of its comparison to Higurashi and that the Visual Novel was still a lot better. First of all, don\'t go thinking it would be close to Higurashi \'coz its plot is a lot different though similar. Higurashi\'s main point is horror while Umineko is more of a thriller or rather something like a mind battle like ""Death Note"" and even includes witches and magic. For me, this is one of the most unpredictable anime I\'ve ever watched and does...not deserve being underrated. It\'s a series that would actually even make you want to rewatch the whole series after completing it.Story: 9Now this is what you call an anime with a ""really deep"" story. Before enjoying this anime, let me tell you that the first 4 episodes were introduction only to the anime\'s plot. After that, episode 5 finally reveals the plot of the story so I suggest don\'t go dropping it before that if you think you already know the plot (well, if you really want to know the plot before you can continue, all I can say is this: Human vs Witch). Episode 6 will make you think this is getting boring, but let me tell you after watching Episode 7 you might finally like this anime. The major breakdown of the series is episode 10, as it would probably make you say ""WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING HERE!?"". Being unable to bear such breakdown might finally make you want to drop this anime, moreover, that the protagonist seems to have no chance (0%) in winning. However, let me tell you that the protagonist was just unprepared in those episodes and will finally show off his true might for the rest of the series. Regarding the breakdown in Episode 10, there\'ll be an explanation for that too. The last episode was satisfying, though you might think many of the mysteries were left unsolved, they were actually answered but in a way that you can already logically think how and just think of them yourself.Art & Animation: 6There\'s nothing special about the art and animation, but it\'s actually very good enough since I think it was given quite the budget.Sound: 8Though I\'ve heard other anime with really good bgms, this has actually good ones. It has a very thrilling background when the protagonist shows off, and I love it. Most of the sounds were taken and remixed from the visual novel it has a good variety of sounds and all...Characters: 8Aside from the protagonist and antagonist, all the other characters were also given spotlight to know their story and even sometimes see a cool side of them, which is a plus actually. The thing I didn\'t quite like was the inconsistency of Beatrice\'s character (the antagonist), you may think of her as one of the most evil creatures but she also sometimes makes a character of a good person and even gets a bit feeling of romance between her and Battler (protagonist). Another one with an inconsistent character would be Maria, she\'s cute and adorable in normal situations and you might even cry for her when you see her being abused by her mother. However, her character often changes into an annoying evil brat. My favorite character is of course Ushiromiya Battler, he\'s cool and funny.Enjoyment: 9I really enjoyed the scenes in Umineko and I was very satisfied. If you enjoy a battle of wits, you\'ll enjoy this too. The only reason I didn\'t rate the enjoyment 10 but 9 was because there are also some boring scenes.Overall: 10I liked it so much. It\'s a gem that should be appreciated more. not deserve being underrated.

While I wasn´t expecting TOO much of the story of chapter 1, chapter 2 has underlined my bad feelings......STORY:Overall, they followed the story well. Some keyfacts where sadly left out, like some explanations from Beatrice. Still, nothing too important was left out, but of course, MANY other funny or interesting things are missing; but in the end, you can´t push a whole book or...novel in a 24 - 26 episode anime.ART:When I saw the first pictures I thought ""OMG WHAT´S THAT?"", but after seeing it in action, it´s not so bad as I thought. Still, it can´t underline some characters like Eva and Beatrice very well, but I say more about that later.SOUND:I always like it when good music from a visual novel is used in the anime again. in Umineko, the recycled old music well and used many new tracks, too. Most of the time, the music is underlining the situation perfectly; but in chapter 1, it started to annoy me that 3 episodes ended with the same track in a row...CHARACTERS:And here we are, at the biggest weakness of this anime.While the parents like Rudolph, Rosa and Eva where intruduced as very nice people in the start of the novel (what changed not so much later), here we got to see only their ugly sides from the start.Evas ""lovely"" side was completely ignored, making her look like a b**** from the very start until now. Kyrie was nearly completely left out of the picture, even though she already played a good part in chapter 1 and 2, even though she may be the most interesting character out of the parents. The grand personality of Kinzo is nowhere to be seen, you see him crying most of the time. Maria´s creepyness is so exaggerated that it hurts. Jessica is only presented as a lovesick girl, but not the strong girl she really is.About Battler, he´s not half as fun as he used to be in the novel, since he´s reduced to to the tragic hero that has to oppose the witch, even though in the original it wasn´t like that.But the REAL annoyance is about Beatrice.Her funny, easy to tease character is completely left out, showing only the ""evil witch side"" of her, but not the interesting character she really is. The somewhat ""friendly rivalship"" between her and Battler is completely left out, as well as the fact that Battler calls her ""Beato"" since near the start of chapter 2l.Partly, the art-style may be at fault as well, I have trouble imagening a sulking or happily laughing Beatrice with the mostly ""serious"" style.ENJOYMENT:When you ignore that it is an anime to an existing story, it´s not bad, and I will still continue to watch it, since the really interesting stories are gonna start now.OVERALL:Even with the left out things of the story, it would be a great anime, if they only didn´t screw up the personalities of the characters so bad. Because they did, the story isn´t what it could be, especially because the relationship between Beatrice and Battler is totally different.Like that, many potential was thrown away, what makes me quite sad.

Hoping to capitalize on Higurashi\'s success, the same director and studio went to work adapting his spinoff visual novel series, Umineko no Naku Koro ni. Surely we could expect great things would come of it.We were dead f*cking wrong.This is anime at its most disgustingly deceptive, dragging you through 26 episodes of ""mystery"" and I cannot stress those quotation marks enough because half the time the mystery doesn\'t even exist. Hell I...could hardly tell what was the meta-world, the real world, the alternative world, THERE IS NO PERSPECTIVE! None! I don\'t even know where I am half the f*cking time so how the hell would I be expected to know what\'s going on?!The characters are a mess. We\'re rivaling Geass and Nanoha levels here in characters, and as such signifies, half of them have no personalities. Hell, you see them all die so many times over and over again that you just come to accept that\'s their purpose in all of this. In fact, there are some characters so f*cking annoying you cheer when its their turn to take the grotesque spill, but it\'s not even half as enjoyable as it could be because this anime is spammed with so much violence that it makes it seem uninteresting. I have never seen senseless violence become so BORING!The art is laughable. Studio Deen has clearly learned nothing from Higurashi, kept the same production values and amped up the facial distortions to a saturation point that makes them entirely unremarkable. Fortunately they kept the original music of the games which is quite good in some case if you can hear it over blood splattering and insane laughter. Oh, and another rare prop to this series for Sayaka Oohara\'s performance. I wonder if she got drunk before coming in on days to voice Umineko. I hope so. She at least made it halfway entertaining.But the real kicker is we aren\'t even close to solving any of the mysteries by the end of this and it ends with WAIT FOR SEASON 2 LOL. Now some of you may say ""Hey Splitter! You gave Higurashi\'s first season a 9 and it did the same thing!"" Yes it did, but it also got closer to the truth every episode and eventually made the big reveal that puts the whole series into focus while Umineko didn\'t do anything even remotely close to that. I\'ve heard the games are better (more times than should be heard) but this adaptation does nothing to make me want to invest days on end into playing them and the adaptation certainly doesn\'t make me want to stick around for 24-26 more episodes as I care nothing about anyone in it and could care less if they all stay trapped in this game for all eternity. In fact, put Chiaki Kon and her staff in this game for all eternity with the characters. That\'s a suitable punishment for making this grotesque travesty of a ""murder mystery"". Seriously, all you\'ve got is a good OST, a solid backstory with Maria and Ange (F*CK WHAT THEY DID WITH ANGE), and Beatrice\'s seiyuu performance. After that you have 22 eps of inane shit and characters you just want to see permanently shut up.Overall, I give Umineko no Naku Koro ni a 4 out of 10. could hardly tell what was the meta-world, the real world, the alternative world, THERE IS NO PERSPECTIVE!

Now if you were looking for a masterpiece that was craftily made by a work of geniuses, fully-fleshed out with minor discrepancies, this anime is not for you. If you enjoy a good the-gore-is-all-over-the-place-just-to-piss-off-the-main-character kind of anime, you\'ve found it. Let me begin my review by saying that this is not an amazing adaption, nor is it a terrible adaption, it\'s an adaption nonetheless and fans of Ryukishi07\'s other work will greatly enjoy this series. I also will be comparing the anime to VN (visual novel) quite frequently.Story:...10/10A very original story, but while it lacks the luster of the VN it still gets the job done. Battler, our hero, arrives on his grandfathers island after six years of absence with 17 other family members. A rumor a witch exists flies through the air that day and mysterious murders begin to occur at night. Your usual occult story? Not in the slightest. Battler encounters the witch and challenges her that he can prove that WITCHES DON\'T EXIST *WHILE* playing with a *witch*. The idea is a little crazy, but it sure as hell is interesting! Battler tries to solve the witches riddles to save his family from Ryukishi07 aspect is that the story occurs numerous times, each time a different way, but unlike Higurashi, the main character is aware of what is going via a meta-world perspective. The game he plays with the witch is like that of a game of chess, in which the witch will set up her trap, and Battler will counter with a rebuttal to try and out wit the witch. Full of twists and turns, it is sure not to disappoint.Art: 7/10Serious business here guys. Studio DEEN failed, but not too hard. It well... DEEN\'d. The animation varies from time to time, and sometimes experiences moments of QUALITY - but not on a Kampfer level scale. The character designs are all adapted from the visual novel and fit perfectly (although the female characters bust sizes undergo extreme inflation, typical DEEN). The fight scenes are really nice, and often very exciting. For those of who\'ve played the visual novel, watching your favorite battle scene surely won\'t let you down. The meta-world use of red text was applied really nicely and I was very impressed with the animators decision. The red text literally flies across the screen, because in the VN the red text is just said. A smart decision not to remove the red text (as it is very important to the story) and a smart way to use it. Some of the art was also imported from the VN, which is a really nice touch.Sound: 10/10Hot damn. Great soundtrack, awesome opening, solid ending, sound effects and seiyuu\'s galore. A fair amount (more than eighty percent) of the BGM comes from the visual novel, a doujin (self-made) game that had a ton of doujin artists compose songs to accompany it. The use of the same doujin music is what makes the anime that much better. Your favorite (or soon to be)  background songs make up for the sometimes silly animation. The opening ""One-winged Angel"" by Shikata Akiko (same voice of the VN OP) is really cool with a strong mysterious almost melancholic sound throughout. The ending ""Kinzo\' Madhouse of Divine Tragedy"" by JIMANG is a good kind of creepy and loud, which gives off the right vibe for this anime. A lot of the sound effects came from the visual novel (SURPRISE) and work well with the anime. Pretty much every other voice actor/actress decided to play a role in this anime, since the cast of characters is MASSIVE. Beatrice\'s voice is awesome, Daisuke Ono plays Battler, Yui Horie as Maria, and a ton more (go check \'em out! It\'s no joke that a ton of prominent voices are in this)!Character: 10/10Well you wanted sniper bunnies, right? How about trendy maids that represent the seven deadly sins? Oh, Victorian dresses and fancy-pants clothes? Come on down! Battler is a musclehead (poorly adapted by DEEN into a fabulous pretty boy in animation only) who probably isn\'t as intelligent as the nine-year-old cousin, but he\'s got guts. Rivaling Kamina in manly finger pointing and bro power levels, Battler yells, hits on his cousins and laughs in the face of death. A real manly man, who fights for his parents and his family.  Beatrice is the epitome of ""troll"" in the animated universe. A bitch, a trickster, a murderer, a liar, a cheater, and everything else you can think of. You\'ve really gotta see this chick in action to believe it. The rest of the cast is humongous, but there\'s a character for everyone (I think the author followed Tite Kubo with this: Not exciting enough? ADD A NEW CHARACTER), and I mean it in the best way possible. These are dynamic, interesting characters, not one-sided shallow flat designs.Enjoyment: 10/10The enjoyment is the most important factor in an anime I believe, and seeing as how I really liked the visual novel, I was very happy with this adaption.  If you were a fan of the VN, watching it get animated is really fun. Do I recommend this anime to everyone? No. This is NOT everyones slice of cake. I DO recommend the visual novel version of this to everyone though, which DOES flesh itself out (but actually game of the visual novel takes 10+ hours to play through, as oppose to the two and half the animators got to convert it). With what DEEN had, they did a pretty good job with the time alloted.Overall: 10/10Fun to watch and interesting to talk about.This anime does great with what it was given. Do I think 26 episodes was enough to fit in more than 45 hours of reading? No. I don\'t. I think this series would have been even better as an OVA released over time or four separate TV Series, but with the nine hours the animators had to bring this whole anime together, I think they did a wonderful job.Before or while you watch this anime, you may want to play the visual novel, but don\'t steer away from this anime just because I said that. The visual novel fleshes out the plot, while the anime covers the dramatic scenes and between the two, a great product is formed. If you\'re on the fence about this anime, give it a try; it\'s different and it\'s exciting. 10/10A very original story, but while it lacks the luster of the VN it still gets the job done.

Once you started the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni you were fascinated by the tension surrounding the secrets of Watanagashi. That\'s exactly what happened to me watching Umineko, I was completely...sucked into this world of terrifying witches and gruesome murders.To make one thing clear, I never read the novel or anything, so I basically had no background information on the story or scenario. This is quite important because people call the Umineko anime a bad adaption, so for me it was possible to watch it without being influenced by the original.- The Story:The basic story of Umineko no naku koro ni is very complex and complicated. At first you will find yourself in some ""who-is-the-murderer""-scenario, but pretty soon the story reveals its true face. On the one hand, this complexity of multi-layered storytelling is exciting and makes you want to dig deeper into the mystery, but on the other, due to some pretty confusing sequences, it becomes pretty difficult to follow (especially in the last arc). Sometimes you have to sit down and arrange all the information you got from the anime in your head to really see through. Since there are many characters in this anime, you cannot expect to get to know everyone in detail, but there are more than enough flashbacks of the important ones to understand their motives.- The Atmosphere:Similar to the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni, there\'s a special atmosphere surrounding the storyline of Umineko no naku koro ni. The level of tension is high most of the time. The anime plays with people\'s thoughts and feelings pretty often and you will find yourself surprised and confused by sudden story-twists as well as shocked by the level of gore and violence presented. As for that part, the violence in Umineko no naku koro ni is very harsh. While you travel into the puzzling nightmare of the witches, you will witness many scenes of brutal massacre and torture along the way.- The Design:Compared to the novel\'s deformed and quite bad original character designs (which I have seen at a friend\'s before) the design of the anime characters is more than satisfying. Of course there are some minor flaws with details such as the  exaggerated chestsize of most of the female characters older than 9 years (Yet another witch called Yoshika Miyafuji would probably like this design). All in all, the design fits the characters, Battler is a terrific protagonist while his opponents are evil and scary as hell.- The Final Conclusion:Umineko no naku koro ni has many good elements. The story is complex, exciting and in most parts far more convincing than Higurashi\'s story plot. This anime\'s problem is the presentation of said complexity. You have to be on your guard to catch up to the plot all the time. I have to admit that I lost it in the last arc a couple of times as well, so I can understand the people who prefer the novel, which probably gives you much more time and information to understand the storydevelopment. BUT that does not decrease the fun I had watching this mystery horror anime series.I even had a nightmare of the endless golden witch herself last night, so trust me when I tell you: Beatrice EXISTS, uuuh~ sucked into this world of terrifying witches and gruesome murders.To make one thing clear, I never read the novel or anything, so I basically had no background information on the story or scenario.

I have to admit that I lost it in the last arc a couple of times as well, so I can understand the people who prefer the novel, which probably gives you much more time and information to understand the storydevelopment. BUT that does not decrease the fun I had watching this mystery horror anime series.I even had a nightmare of the endless golden witch herself last night, so trust me when I tell you: Beatrice EXISTS, uuuh~', 'I\'m writing this review without having played through any of the sound novels.I went into Umineko expecting something similar to Higurashi- inexplicably creepy behavior from otherwise trustworthy people, grisly murders, etc. What I didn\'t expect, though, was that Umineko would be EXTREMELY CRACKED OUT.That was a mistake. Because I\'ve got to say, out of all the anime I\'ve ever seen, Umineko is one of the most cracked-out of all time. Just when you think things start to make sense, they throw in something that will make you spit your drink all over the screen. By the end of the series, it only made a modicum...of sense.STORY: 7/10. I wish I could rate the two parts of the story separately, because I enjoy one far more than the other. I didn\'t like the whole ""Battler tries to solve the mystery"" part at all, because I\'ve never been a fan of whodunnit mysteries. When he\'s explaining the ""this person could have been in this room and killed this person, and then this other person..."" shtick, I find myself completely and utterly lost. The whole situation really reminds me of the ""Remote Island Syndrome"" plotline from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, except ten billion times more complicated. I can\'t keep up with that kind of detective-style reasoning. It doesn\'t help that a lot of this comes many episodes after the murders themselves happen.However, the other side of the story- with the various witches and Beatrice attempting to prove herself as a witch- I found extremely compelling. Maria\'s story was the part of this that I enjoyed the most. The reason that Beatrice had to make Battler acknowledge her was very clever, I thought. The mythology of witches in this anime is really awesome.Some people have said that it\'s stupid that Battler continues to deny witches even as he is shown proof that they exist (he is teleported, separated from his physical body, etc.) and we, the viewer, get to see actual scenes of magic being used. The explanation for this is that magic scenes in this anime are pretty much just hypothetical. We don\'t know whether they actually happened, or if they\'re just a visual illustration of what COULD have happened if magic existed.ART: 8/10. When I was watching Higurashi, especially the first season, I was like, ""dang, Studio DEEN, you\'re not always that great at this."" But as time went on, I saw that art improve. I think that by the time this series came out, the art had improved a lot. I didn\'t have any complaints about the art in this series, nor do I remember even a single instance of animation that looked off-form or weird. The character designs are lovely and look great, the colors are rich, and the Victorian-styled setting is beautiful. Nothing really knocked my socks off about the art, but overall, it\'s pretty good, at least above average.Oh, and also, the particular videos that I got of this series were censored. They had pixelated censors over any particularly gory scene. Now, censorship scares me more than any creepy murdering witch ever could, and I have to say that the censorship here completely sucks the enjoyment out of the gore in this show. I hope some uncensored versions are released soon.SOUND: 8/10. I don\'t always notice sound that much in anime, but there were a couple instances where I was like, this soundtrack is pretty awesome. Some of the background music in this anime is truly great. I also love the OP and ED. The OP is just straight-up epic, very heartfelt and emotional, and it fits the anime perfectly.The ED took a bit longer to warm up to, since the guy who sings it has a pretty weird-sounding voice. However, as I got used to it, I really fell in love with it. It\'s raw, dramatic, and scary. The one thing is that I think for horror anime, sad songs work better as EDs- they really add punch to the tragic death scenes, while this ED sounds more angry. Then again, this anime doesn\'t give you much time to mourn the characters that die. They\'re really more like pawns in the game than people to feel sorry for.CHARACTER: 5/10. There are a LOT of characters in this anime, and they just keep adding more and more and more as it goes along. Even from the very first episode, you\'re hit in the face with at least 10 different characters, and I found it very hard to remember them. At least they all have the same last name. The sad thing about this is that, since there are so very many characters, none of them really get that much time to shine. Only a few characters (such as Maria and Ange) get background stories or character development.While most of the characters seem fairly well-thought-out, there are a few that left me asking, ""Why?!?!"" The prime offenders are the Siestas, who are just completely out-of-place in this anime. They look like stereotypical villains in a sci-fi magical girl fanservice anime. With bunny ears, crazy hair colors, whiny voices, and slutty costumes, they really took away my ability to take certain scenes seriously. Their hyper-precise death blows are very scary indeed, especially when they\'re ruining a touching scene by killing people out of nowhere, but why couldn\'t they have been more like the Stakes of Purgatory?Kanon and his laser-sword-arm also take away from the creepy gothic feel of this anime, but some of the other characters ARE really awesome. Maria reminds me of Rena from Higurashi, with her crazy pendulum swinging between cutesy little girl and psycho killer. Bernkastel and Lambdadelta (who have some connection to Rika and younger-Takano from Higurashi) didn\'t get nearly enough screentime to do justice to their awesome little side story, and I hope there\'s a second season that explores them a little more.ENJOYMENT: 7/10. A lot of the time, I was just sitting through the Beatrice/Battler deduction scenes, because I couldn\'t follow Battler\'s logic at all. The scenes I really enjoyed were the grisly murder scenes... the touching scenes between lovers, especially when they were suddenly killed right afterward... and the scenes exploring the Rosa/Maria relationship, anything with Sakutaro, Ange\'s past, et cetera. It was often hard for me to keep up with all the new characters being introduced, though. I had a pretty decent time watching the anime.OVERALL: 8/10. I think I enjoyed the concepts behind this anime more than the show itself. A lot of the time, the pacing was too fast to keep up with, and the events happening onscreen were too ambiguous to understand. However, when I finished watching the show, I found myself sitting and thinking, appreciating the concepts of witchcraft and the struggle between the humans and witches. For that reason, I think I\'m going to check out the sound novel, since it probably goes into depth about those things a lot more.I\'m hoping for a second season that will explain what\'s going on and unveil the mystery of the events on Rokkenjima Island. Kind of like what Kai did for Higurashi. The ending to this series was both satisfying and unsatisfying- it felt right, but left so much more to be explained. Ultimately, I\'m hoping that even someone like me, who can\'t grasp Battler\'s detective reasoning at all, will be able to comprehend Umineko. of sense.STORY: 7/10. I wish I could rate the two parts of the story separately, because I enjoy one far more than the other. I didn\'t like the whole ""Battler tries to solve the mystery"" part at all, because I\'ve never been a fan of whodunnit mysteries. When he\'s explaining the ""this person could have been in this room and killed this person, and then this other person..."" shtick, I find myself completely and utterly lost. The whole situation really reminds me of the ""Remote Island Syndrome"" plotline from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, except ten billion times more complicated. I can\'t keep up with that kind of detective-style reasoning. It doesn\'t help that a lot of this comes many episodes after the murders themselves happen.However, the other side of the story- with the various witches and Beatrice attempting to prove herself as a witch- I found extremely compelling. Maria\'s story was the part of this that I enjoyed the most. The reason that Beatrice had to make Battler acknowledge her was very clever, I thought. The mythology of witches in this anime is really awesome.Some people have said that it\'s stupid that Battler continues to deny witches even as he is shown proof that they exist (he is teleported, separated from his physical body, etc.) and we, the viewer, get to see actual scenes of magic being used. The explanation for this is that magic scenes in this anime are pretty much just hypothetical. We don\'t know whether they actually happened, or if they\'re just a visual illustration of what COULD have happened if magic existed.ART: 8/10. When I was watching Higurashi, especially the first season, I was like, ""dang, Studio DEEN, you\'re not always that great at this."" But as time went on, I saw that art improve. I think that by the time this series came out, the art had improved a lot. I didn\'t have any complaints about the art in this series, nor do I remember even a single instance of animation that looked off-form or weird. The character designs are lovely and look great, the colors are rich, and the Victorian-styled setting is beautiful. Nothing really knocked my socks off about the art, but overall, it\'s pretty good, at least above average.Oh, and also, the particular videos that I got of this series were censored. They had pixelated censors over any particularly gory scene. Now, censorship scares me more than any creepy murdering witch ever could, and I have to say that the censorship here completely sucks the enjoyment out of the gore in this show. I hope some uncensored versions are released soon.SOUND: 8/10. I don\'t always notice sound that much in anime, but there were a couple instances where I was like, this soundtrack is pretty awesome. Some of the background music in this anime is truly great. I also love the OP and ED. The OP is just straight-up epic, very heartfelt and emotional, and it fits the anime perfectly.The ED took a bit longer to warm up to, since the guy who sings it has a pretty weird-sounding voice. However, as I got used to it, I really fell in love with it. It\'s raw, dramatic, and scary. The one thing is that I think for horror anime, sad songs work better as EDs- they really add punch to the tragic death scenes, while this ED sounds more angry. Then again, this anime doesn\'t give you much time to mourn the characters that die. They\'re really more like pawns in the game than people to feel sorry for.CHARACTER: 5/10.

Only 5 eps are out finishing a story arc like Higurashi and the plot twists are amazing.

Most people who played the games and read the VNs are disappointed with the way Studio Deen presented Umineko to the big screen, particularly changes in the story and animation of the characters. My rating changed constantly throughout the series and resulted in a 5. It appeared as a show incredibly unique and original in the beginning but resulted in something totally bland and deficient in the end.Story (4):Umineko has an incredible plot consisting...of a philosophical war between fantasy and reality. The anime began on an intriguing note as it introduced a murder mystery, but it progressed into something far too complex for 26 episodes, leaving the story with a major cliffhanger. Numerous questions were presented throughout the series, and nearly all of them were left unanswered. The content is hard to consume as so much info is thrown at you all at once, not to mention the multiple characters. The viewer will tend to become confused with the alternate universes and misdirections. E.g. A character can appear as an undefeatable supernatural being in one universe and a defenseless human in another, affecting the mystery-solving case. Additionally, some supernatural aspects were not explained.The anime revolves around a fantasy vs. reality battle. Battler, one of the murdered family members, participates in a one-on-one logic battle with the Golden Witch Beatrice. Beatrice aims to make Battler acknowledge her as a witch, and Battler fights to prove that the murders were not the result of magic by providing logical explanations behind the murders. He does this by observing him and his family get murdered repeatedly in alternate universes. This strategy makes Umineko appear unique from other mystery anime, until Battler and Beatrice turn the gameplay into something dramatic. Their drama causes several distractions when they turn away from the mystery by throwing random insults at each other and going on non-speaking terms. The drama overshadows the main point of the story: the mystery. Their immaturity causes the series to become something silly instead of serious, and the anime ends with the mystery unsolved.Umineko served several misdirections in its plot. The game has rules that seem helpful in solving the mystery, but some rules were not presented until late in the game. One of those rules was the “red truth.” Beatrice uses the red truth in the game, declaring that everything she says in red is indeed the truth. The rule was that only a witch is able to use the red truth, but Battler does the same thing later. Like the “red truth,” some of the rules were misused, making them appear to be null and void. It would’ve been a good strategy to solve a mystery, if it was actually factual and all rules were introduced at the start of the game.Characters (5):There are a massive amount of characters (>30 people), and they quickly increase as the anime goes from one arc to the next. The game would’ve been more enjoyable if it remained with the approximate 20 characters in the first arc. Because of the various characters, the mystery becomes even harder to solve as you have to understand the reason for their presence. The introduction to some characters were used to become observers (and interferers) of Battler and Beatrice’s game, and it causes the drama to worsen throughout the series.Some of the characters appear unbearably annoying in the beginning, but character development progresses as the story unfolds. It explains the meaning behind the characters’ behavior by going into their past or behind-the-scenes during the murder cases. Thankfully, it focuses on the important characters and not waste time on the less active ones.Beatrice and Battler are the two MCs that people tend to either hate or love. Beatrice’s personality changed constantly. She goes from fulfilling her role as the evil witch with clever tricks to a good witch by showing sympathy and being emotional, and the cycle repeats itself. I eventually gave up on trying to understand her and just watched the series.Battler is introduced to the series as a pervert, immediately giving the viewer the wrong impression of the series. Some of his points in the argument doesn’t make sense, and he appears as a wimp by sometimes becoming emotional during the game. However, he’s quite the persistent being who’s determined to prove the non-existence of witches and magic, despite the various supernatural beings surrounding him.Art (10):Similar to the Higurashi series, it’s basically your typical Shōjo artwork with big-eyed characters. Readers of the VNs and players of the game would most likely be appalled to see their characters drawn with big eyes. I exceptionally loved the artwork and European theme. The gory scenes, especially dismantled bodies, and well-animated backgrounds were drawn to fit the horrific theme of the anime. The characters' faces were drawn perfectly according to their emotions. E.g. The terror in their eyes is enough to terrify the viewer as murders commence. Also, Beatrice's face changes along with her personality. One moment she looks innocent, and she's looks evil and terrifying the next.Sound (9):The OP and ED were amazing songs, and the lyrics give teasers about the series. The lyrics of the OP describe the night of the murders itself: “The banquet of the irregular night repeats itself again and again” and the game between Battler and Beatrice “Destroy these captured illusions.” The ED is fast-paced and scarier with the creepy dark hallways of the mansion. The lyrics describe a person’s desire to encounter Beatrice: “Oh beloved demon, grant me a wish.” Creepy organ music played in the background sometimes, boosting the suspense of the series.The characters reacted appropriately to numerous situations. The witches had their whole-hearty laughs. People mourned for their loved ones, and their reactions are so realistic.Enjoyment (4):Honestly, this is the worst mystery anime I’ve ever seen. I was excited in the beginning with the unique plot and introduction of the game, thinking that I was in for a treat. However, I was disappointed and confused, especially with the ending. It was a major cliffhanger, and I found it mostly to be a drama instead of a mystery anime. I started reading the manga where the anime left off (Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru - Episode 5: End of the Golden Witch), and the drama worsened so much in the first few pages that I gave up on the Umineko franchise altogether.Overall (5):Umineko appeared as a promising anime and turned into something tedious. Fans of mystery anime may become disappointed with a misleading story and a horrible ending.

I will not be comparing/lamenting the adaption quality.Umineko no Naku Koro ni is a fantastic story. Taking elements of both Eastern and Western mythologies, we are thrust into a battle between witches. A battle of fantasy vs reality, where we can trust nothing we see, and are forced to reason our way out of a labyrinth of lies.The music is strong, if not particularly noteworthy. It supports the scenes well, but one will not be humming the themes walking down the street. The OP/ED are excellent, though. By now, we know that DEEN...is not a fantastic animation studio. It would come as no surprise that occasionally, there are some art problems.A very large part of the appeal of Umineko though, are the characters. By the end of the show, you know each character and love most of them. Each member of the family receives a time to shine. This is also supported by one of the most complicated, and interesting antagonists I\'ve seen in anime, the Golden Witch, Beatrice.The other main draw is the story. The issue with this, is that one cannot discuss it without giving away large plot points. Suffice it to say, that there are layers upon layers of plans, lies, and rules, both written and unwritten.Umineko is going to be a tough sell to later viewers, as a large part of the charm of the series is wildly speculating the questions of who and how. Ryukishi07 is a gifted writer, and anything by him will be an interesting journey, if nothing else. Do yourself a favor and don\'t rush through Umineko. Umineko isn\'t for everyone, but those who ""get"" it, will love it. is not a fantastic animation studio.

Even if you have zero interest in VNs (I was like that), just forget about the series, since you might someday change your mind.The original is a masterpiece. I personally gave it a 10/10 in vndb; the story is among the best I\'ve ever seen in any medium. The anime, on the other hand, is nothing special; you\'ll run into entertainment of similar value everywhere. It\'s barely worth 6/10.I was introduced to Umineko through the anime. I had watched (and liked) Higurashi and had never read VNs before, so the idea of doing so...here never even crossed my mind. I was amazingly lucky, though, as after the first 9 or 10 eps I decided to try the VN for no real reason (I wanted to check whether it had a certain type of gameplay - it didn\'t). I found the visuals ridiculous, but I soon realized that the execution of the story was far, FAR better than in the anime. Once I had gotten used to the graphics, I was hooked.The tldr reason for why the anime shouldn\'t exist: it leaves out tons of detail and butchers the emotional content of the rest of the story with its ridiculous pace. Calling this mediocre series ""Umineko no naku koro ni"" is pure blasphemy. here never even crossed my mind.

How can I like a perverted guy who is SO SMART to see the witch right infront of him, giving him hundreds of proofs she exists and still say witchs doesn't exist like a stubborn idiot? And besides, you can see all those other characters who got a rather sad story of lost loves, or beating mothers and...all of that and they made him look rather perfect, I don't know anything about him.And I really just don't understand Maria, what's up with that stupid character - Just a girl being abused and saying creepy things about witchs.And I hate Beatrice's voice, but that doesn't matter, right?After episode five you can barely understand what is going on there, and as more characters being added you start wondering what about the main story line, like the creatores decided to change their minds at some point.I thought this series is going to be an amazing psychological thriller and all I got was pathetic main characters, a story that is hard to follow and no psychological things so ever, and yes, using the chess-board thing is not that psychological or genious.In short, up to episode 4 this show is pretty good, but it just goes down hill from there.I gave it a 3, and it might even deserve less. all of that and they made him look rather perfect, I don't know anything about him.And I really just don't understand Maria, what's up with that stupid character - Just a girl being abused and saying creepy things about witchs.And I hate Beatrice's voice, but that doesn't matter, right?After episode five you can barely understand what is going on there, and as more characters being added you start wondering what about the main story line, like the creatores decided to change their minds at some point.I thought this series is going to be an amazing psychological thriller and all I got was pathetic main characters, a story that is hard to follow and no psychological things so ever, and yes, using the chess-board thing is not that psychological or genious.In short, up to episode 4 this show is pretty good, but it just goes down hill from there.I gave it a 3, and it might even deserve less."", 'It\'s been a long while since I was active in the site.Umineko is somewhat of an ""sequel"" to the fantastic Higurashi series, although with almost no link between the two except for possibly 2 characters (which I will neglect to name to prevent spoilers). In October 1986, a group of 18 people, including members of the Ushiromiya extended family and their servants, decided to hold a meeting in their island, Rokkenjima, with the purpose of discussing how the wealth of the family is to be distributed after the death of the current head, Kinzo. Unfortunately, after the arrival of the entire family, a storm traps...the 18 people, mysteriously preventing contact with the outside world. At this same point of time, members of the 18 slowly gets murdered one by one, usually in a bizzare manner, which was credited by Maria, the youngest member on the island, to be done by the endless witch Beatrice. However, her cousin, Battler, rejected any existance of witchcraft in the world, and thus, attempts to answer all the deaths via logic, an attempt which interests Beatrice herself...StoryFirst of, I\'ve never played the game, read the novel/manga or whatsoever. Thus, my only experience of the story is via the anime. Possibly based on that alone, I thought hte story was very well structured, with the exception of the 1st 2 episodes, which were absolute messes. However, I found it puzzling at a few aspects, including the fact that various supposed main characters, like Battler\'s stepmother Kyrie, to have so little screen time, and how some of the story plot just doesn\'t flow. Nevertheless, the story as a whole is above decent, and deserves praise.ArtThe characters, the background, the golden butterflies representing Beatrice all look decent, but the blood as been censored too much IMO, but it\'s decent enough.SoundMusic is an absolute nightmare, and I do not think the opening and ending themes match the anime at all.CharactersNow, for the long list of criticisms. As mentioned earlier, Kyrie was neglected any real screen time, which is a big nono, since she was supposed to be hte source of Battler\'s ""turn over the table"" motto. Characters were supposed to be interesting, but I found most of them to be annoying. Maria\'s just irritating, with her over-emo/creepy combo. George is a real... eyesore, Kinzo, supposedly a ruthless powerful man, was seen constantly crying, while Shannon and Kanon have been given inconsistent personalities as the story went on to the third arc. Battler, a supposedly intelligent person with a great logical view on the situation, has been seen just moaning about how he can\'t think of hte solution. The creators should really have looked to their efforts on Higurashi\'s characters while making this.EnjoymentTHis is given a 7 only because the story keeps me on the edge enough to want to watch ti weekly, rather than to force myself to complete the series.Asking a player of the game would get you a bad review on the story department as well, but if you\'re like me, and haven\'t played the game, the show is watchable, but beware of creepy lolis and a league of extraordinarily bad characters. the 18 people, mysteriously preventing contact with the outside world.

Nevertheless, the story as a whole is above decent, and deserves praise.ArtThe characters, the background, the golden butterflies representing Beatrice all look decent, but the blood as been censored too much IMO, but it\'s decent enough.SoundMusic is an absolute nightmare, and I do not think the opening and ending themes match the anime at all.CharactersNow, for the long list of criticisms. As mentioned earlier, Kyrie was neglected any real screen time, which is a big nono, since she was supposed to be hte source of Battler\'s ""turn over the table"" motto. Characters were supposed to be interesting, but I found most of them to be annoying. Maria\'s just irritating, with her over-emo/creepy combo. George is a real... eyesore, Kinzo, supposedly a ruthless powerful man, was seen constantly crying, while Shannon and Kanon have been given inconsistent personalities as the story went on to the third arc. Battler, a supposedly intelligent person with a great logical view on the situation, has been seen just moaning about how he can\'t think of hte solution. The creators should really have looked to their efforts on Higurashi\'s characters while making this.EnjoymentTHis is given a 7 only because the story keeps me on the edge enough to want to watch ti weekly, rather than to force myself to complete the series.Asking a player of the game would get you a bad review on the story department as well, but if you\'re like me, and haven\'t played the game, the show is watchable, but beware of creepy lolis and a league of extraordinarily bad characters.', 'I\'ll start off with that i have not read the visal novel. This will be a review from someone who just watched an anime adaption without knowledge to its origin. The other review scores on MAL for this anime is such a rollercoaster, you have to make a choice. Is this really worth it to watch? I enjoyed this anime more than i hated it, hence the low overall score. But there are many things about this anime that is good if you count it as ""another anime"" and not an adaption.I\'ll skip the intro and get to the points:Story:What appears to be a simple...murder mystery turns into a mind battle of lies and truth in death note style. As in higurashi, you have several scenarios. One person go crazy, kill all, then it restarts with another person etc. In umineko\'s case it works the same. Just that it gets more and more... crazy involvements and for each reset is a new game which needs to be solved. It\'s a witch vs. Man battle. Where the man will deny the existence of witches, while the witch want the man to aknowledge them. With lots of confusing back stories, flashbacks which makes you go ""What the...?"" Many times. It\'s confusing but there is thoughts behind it. It\'ll be a 7.Art:I don\'t understand why people slay this anime for it\'s ""horrible"" art. I think the art is one of the more beautifull i\'ve seen. The art in the visual novel looks alot worse in my eyes(hence a reason why i don\'t want to play it). Sure all the females have big breasts except the little girl but i don\'t complain about that. But variaton in sizes is nice. I thought the art and details to environment, clothing, characters was gorgeous! A 9 from me here.Sound:I think most reviewers here will agree that the soundtrack in this anime is the strongpoint of it. I simply love the soundtracks, opening and ending! The music really sets the mood and i love how they put ""cartoon"" sounds into the funny moments. It really did give it a fuzzy charm. Another 9 from me!Character:I\'ll agree. It\'s quite a large cast in this anime. And only being 26 episodes not all the characters have a chance for a backstory. But everyone has their own unique reactions and decisions which makes it good. You have the annoying little girl who can turn crazy at times. The objection pointing protagonist. The tsundere witch who is also evil. There are many characters here and i liked most of them. But i just can\'t stand those guys who have classes and act all sexy and hero. Too bad there is one of those here. I think the characters are given just the right amount of screen time for their roles and importancy. And they all look nice! An 8 from me.Enjoyment:This is a hard one. I enjoyed this anime very much. It got a beautifull soundtrack and gorgeous art to follow! A very big cast of characters is both nice and confusing. The amount of going back in time, flashbacks, backstories can really get on a person\'s nerve. I think anyone who watches this will go ""WTF?"" at least once. As i am not sure where this stands i give enjoyment a 6. The amount of ""good"" enjoyment overweight the ""bad"" enjoyment.To end this review i\'d like to remind you reader. You don\'t need knowledge from the visual novel or mangas to enjoy this. You will get ""WTF?"" moments and you will get mind-raped. About the ending? It was an open one for sure. And i don\'t know if there will be a sequel. But in return for the mind-rape you will experience a very colourfull cast of characters, beautifull soundtrack and very nice visuals!I recomend this if you like occult themes, blood, gore and violence, murder mystery, magic and mind battles. What will your decision be? murder mystery turns into a mind battle of lies and truth in death note style. As in higurashi, you have several scenarios.

An interesting story reminiscent of Higu No series I find that this series carries a love/hate relationship (either you like it or you do not).

Without giving much away I'd like to introduce one of the two side s imperative to this series.[b]Fantasy[/b]You believe in magic, witches and uuuu~ scary things that go bump in the night. this series relies on the premise that the outcomes are already decided...but who is really behind these gruesome murders.

While one particular character stands out, Battler (who names their kid that anyway), interjects his quest to prove that no magic is involved often throws quite a few logical fallacies our way).

If you've seen it's precedes Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, then you should have about half a clue about what's going on. Umineko is similar to them, but WAY to different.Don't expect the same thing, but be prepared for alot of mind screw as the plot proceeds.Story - The story is great. I love how everything fits into place at some point. The anime is following the game's story fairly well, some things were left out, but no big deal.Art - The art, at a first look,...I would rate it an 8. Very well done, but not the greatest. Once you start to watch the anime and game more, the way everything is designed fades, but still maintains a good level.Sound - Probably my favorite part in Umineko. The sound is simply to wonder for words. Some of the BGM music was left out for certain things in the anime, but they still kept alot of important BGM's. The music is one of the reasons I've come to love this show.Characters - All of the characters in the show are fine. Battler, the main character, I think he is being interpreted well in the anime, but he still differs from the game in a huge way. Maria is probably one of the cutest in the show, and one of the creepiest, which the anime plays horribly straight. Jessica is a great character, but the anime isn't showing her great side. They only show her as a damsel in distress, and haven't even began to show her better side, very sad. George isn't getting as much attention as he should in the anime. Like Jessica, he isn't getting his better side shown.The parents, specifically Rosa and Eva, aren't getting what they should in the anime. Eva is being portrayed as a total freak in the anime, and Rosa, I bet her fan base has declined because of the anime. She was introduced as Eva x10 to me. All of the other parents are ether barely shown or don't have much known about them, including Kinzo.Now for Beatrice. She is only shown as some sadistic witch who only has pleasure in trying to get Battler to surrender. Her playful side isn't even shown. At some degree, her character is actually being portrayed well though, more her tsun side instead of her dere side.Overall - The show is about to enter Episode 4. I have to say, even though alot about the characters and some parts of the story was left out, it is a very good show. I have high hopes for the last question arc, and I know it should end well.

This way, it would be easier for you to spot any bias that might seep in later in the review:)1) I am a HUGE Higurashi fan: I breathe Higurashi, I think it is the best thing since hot water, blah, blah , blah, you get my point:)2) I have NOT read the Umineko Visual Novel , so I won\'t have any complaints...of the sort ""OMG, they left out ____""Alright, with that being said, here\'s my opinion:Story:For me this is the most intriguing story that was never told.Why? I believe the setting of the novel is perfect for a mystery.Sure, it might be a blatant copy of Aghata Christie\'s ""Ten Little Niggers"", but having a group of people on a secluded island with mysterious murders going on always makes up for some good suspense.Plus, most characters seem to have interesting back stories.So , what went wrong? Well, this potential remains totally unexploited, since the story chooses to focus on the supernatural world, whose inhabitants are the least complex characters of the entire cast.Let\'s face it, demons and witches are made to represent certain human traits, so how can we really make them into fully fleshed out characters? I found myself enjoying the ( sadly too brief ) insight in the stories of Ange and Kyrie much more than the entire logic battle between Battler and Beato, the latter being way too confusing at times ( especially when the event discussed happened a couple of episodes ago and you hardly remember the details of it ).In short, the anime failed to create the deep bond between the viewer and the main characters that we had in Higurashi.Art:In general, very good.However, mouths and noses seem to disappear all too often.Also, censorship ticks me off on general principal, you either let an artist do a scene with gore , or you don\'t, pixelated cover-ups don\'t help the overall look.Can patches be released for an anime? We\'ll see with the dvd version, but untill then, art remains at 7/10Sound:Very good voice acting, nice music ( very very epic OP and ED in my opinion ), what more can one  want?Character:As stated in the story section, great cast of characters, but we don\'t see much of any of the interesting ones. If ( hopefully ) there\'s a next season, that might change ...Enjoyment:It was actually a good show.Although it was far from my expectations ( as I\'ve said, higurashi fanboy ), it was quite enjoyable and I was constantly looking forward to my weekly golden witch fix.I do believe that I should re-watch all episodes back to back in order to fully appreciate it, since that would probably clear up a lot of confusion.So, if you\'re wondering if the show is worth it, give it a shot.And if you have that option DON\'T read the VN beforehand:):) of the sort ""OMG, they left out ____""Alright, with that being said, here\'s my opinion:Story:For me this is the most intriguing story that was never told.Why?

In Higurashi, on the other hand, you have many ""Slice of Life"" scenes you can ignore for an anime adaptation, and that doesn\'t affect the plot at all. no Naku Koro Ni, and you probably think ""It\'s from the same studio and time period, how bad umineko adaptation can be?

But after watching the first two episodes I was like WOW this is good. If you like mystery and psychological stories with a mixture of gore and violence then this series is for you.

All in all this is a good series and i cant wait for the next episodes to come out. rather u can just watch the series and let the main protagonist solve it for u but i like solving these sort of things myself before they do. All in all this is a good series and i cant wait for the next episodes to come out.', 'Umineko no Naku Koro Ni could be considered the little brother of the oh so high praised Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. This being, the expectation were exceptionally high for this series. Many say though, that the Adaption itself was shit. I, who hasn\'t read the Visual to neither Higurashi nor Umineko can\'t tell. But what I can tell is what I got as an Anime itself. And that shall be presented here:Story: The story of Umineko is just as Higurashis really complex and seems to quite equal to it. But as soon you reach a certain episode you might realize, that it is not!The...story takes place on an island called Rokkenjima. One day the head of the rich Ushiromiya family, Ushiromiya Kinzo, invites all his children and grandchildren to come to his island. Here the actual story is going to get started. After a bit of talk and backgroundknowledge, some people get brutally murdered. Soon it turns out, that those shouldn\'t stay the only ones getting killed. One after another the whole supporting and even the main cast gets wiped out. The end? No. Not even close. As you might have guessed the whole thing works the same way as Higurashi does and different archs continue this slaughter in different ways.The whole story has a heck of a lot of twists but it sometimes fails in keeping you concentrated and you might get a bit confused about how everything worked out this way.8Characters: The whole character list for this Anime is far too long to list everyone here, so I\'ll just name the few that get the most screentime, which are Ushiromiya Battler, who is the one that has to solve the whole riddle. He is more of a fighting style character, but does lose his confidence sometimes, which makes him a bit more human.The next one is the golden eternal witch Beatrice, which is a cruel witch, that kills everyone for the sake of her revival. She is the opponent of Battler and is our typical psycho-antagonist.The supporting cast is as I said earlier really big, with it holding every single bit of the Ushiromiya Family and their servants. They are giving a lot of careful attention to them though, explaining a whole lot of background, which makes everything much more deep.8Art: The art isn\'t really a master piece. It is well done for it\'s time but by now quite aged. The character design, does look good if you compare it to the original one (which I saw on some pics). I mean...seriously the original one was crap.6Sound: The Sound of Umineko does always fits well to the tone the Anime does currently have, but never is somewhat memorable. I found myself listening and singing with the Opening many times though. Espacially the ending always made me hyped for the next  episode. The Opening just fit really well to the whole show (even though I liked Higurashi\'s more at this point)Enjoyment: If Umineko no Naku Koro Ni lacks one thing it is continuity. There are many points, that just make you go ""wtf? What just happened?"" If you aren\'t prepared for some oddly placed Shounen scenes and some random fanservice (it is not much though), that sometimes don\'t really fit the show\'s theme, than you will be really surprised by this (at least I was). There were points in the show where I almost sopped watching during an episode due to boredom.On the other hand, there were also parts, that hooked me so much, that I actually jumped out of my seat (I mean...literally). Combined with the ending that effect was even better.7Summary: In total, the whole plot of Umineko is really interesting. It has a good idea, has a lot of good characters and a heck of a fanbase loving the VN. But as we know DEEN, they like to disappoint us whenever we are expecting the highest. They had many points, were they executed it brilliantly but also many points, were they did it just as poorly. It got me hooked and it got me bored.

Still, it does some justice with the talented seiyuu and beautiful artwork, but it's just better to read the visual novel.The story and character development are better in the visual novel, as is the audio. If you actually find the time to read all of it, it's also more enjoyable than the anime. The anime is only superior when it comes to art, but after awhile, the visual novel's art becomes attached to you.Long story short, the anime feels like a cut in...half experience of the visual novel.

However, my main problem with the soundtrack...was that, apart from two songs (Thanks for Being Born and Katayoku no Tori), the music wasn't very memorable.Characters = 7/10 The characters' designs were amazing and all of the characters had a clear cut personality. Also, all of the voice acting was very well done (Beatrice's especially). I would also like to add that I really enjoyed how all of the women in this anime were all very strong and powerful. It's rare to see that especially in anime because they are usually perceived as cute and weak. Unfortunately, the main problem with this anime's characters was that there is no room for true character development within the game board because every time a character made any form of character development, they would simply reset. As a result, only those that were watching the game board could have any form of development (AKA Beatrice and Battler). Unfortunately, none of them ever go through character development, which lead for the score to be a 7/10 instead of a 10/10.Enjoyment = 9/10 I did enjoy this anime very much. It was very creepy and I never got bored whatsoever. My only issue, like I mentioned before, was that it got very confusing at times. Otherwise, I really did enjoy it.Overall = 8/10 This anime was definitely not bad. It did many things very well but it also failed in certain aspects. And although I did enjoy it, I wouldn't really recommend this anime if someone were to ask me which one they should watch. This isn't the best anime for sure, but if you have nothing better to do, this would be an efficient and fun way to consume your time. was that, apart from two songs (Thanks for Being Born and Katayoku no Tori), the music wasn't very memorable.Characters = 7/10 The characters' designs were amazing and all of the characters had a clear cut personality.

I watched the first 6 episodes of this anime without having read the VN. At first I hated it because it confused the hell out of me. When I started to understand at least some bit of what was going on, I started really wanting to like it. But so much seemed missing while watching the anime. I decided to do what I have never done before, and I read the VN. That is when I realized that the story is not at fault, but the anime adaptation itself. Now...after completing both the anime and the VN (1-4), I can see why so many people are upset.Story (5/10)The pacing. YOUR GOING TO FAAAST. SLOOOW DOWN!

When anime adaptations have to cut a lot to fit the anime's length, character development is usually where it hits. And it really did.

If season 2 gets animated, I'll watch it too with this same logic.Overall (6/10)Overall the anime while generally enjoyable was pretty mediocre; however, if you think the story of Umineko no Naku Koro ni in general is mediocre, you should give the visual novel a try.

So everybody started  searching for the culprit which is believed to be this witch. But there is someone who doesn't believe that the murders were caused by supernatural powers.It's a story full of suspense and characters with mystic auras, where everybody tries to be a detective and solve the case. "", 'I enjoyed the story and thought it was good but poorly executed.The characters didn&#039;t have enough development,  Atleast the opening and ending were good as well as the original music from the sound novel. Art pretty much consisted of walrus face Nanjo and magic inflating boobs, I enjoyed going through and seeing everything wrong with it. I blame Studio DEEN! ', 'There were two reasons why I decided to watch Umineko: [1] I heard it was a ""sister"" anime of Higurashi (I liked Higurashi) and [2] I was expecting a lot of killing and blood and killing and blood and...oh you get it :) Umineko no Naku Koro ni revolves around the Ushiromiya family, who have gathered in the family\'s island for the first time during the year 1986 to discuss the inheritance of the family-head-status.Suddenly, someone from the eighteen people - the family, five servants, and the family doctor - is murdered after every few hours...or minutes. These murders seem to be point to the fictional character (to the characters in the anime, of course) Beatrice the Golden Witch. Battler Ushiromiya (the main protagonist), who doesn\'t believe in magic but doesn\'t want to blame anyone of the 18, tries to find another person to blame. In the end, however, everyone is killed and Beatrice shows herself to a shocked and suspicious Battler. The story then becomes a battle of wit to prove (on Beatrice\'s side) or disprove (on Battler\'s side) the existence of witches.Story: 7Like Higurashi, Umineko was crazy enough to incite repulsion because of all the gore and curiosity because of its twists. Unlike Higurashi, however, it wasn’t interesting or exciting enough to keep the viewer interested with the constant repetition of what happened during that time. Moreover, the logic puzzles presented in the anime were more exhausting, rather than stimulating, to think of.Art: 9On the other hand, the art was cool. Since the story was set on 1986, their clothes were pretty, big, and elegant Victorian dresses (that I would like to wear ~grin). Since it’s also a recent anime, the animation was good too.Sound: 10The sounds were my favorite (loving music doesn’t have anything to do with it! *pinky swear)! They totally got me into mood from excited (0.0) to nauseous (-.-) to shock (‘o’). It was even better than the Avatar soundtracks! Okaaaaay, that last sentence was random :)Character: 7Just because the characters look good and wear cool clothes, doesn’t mean that the characters are cool too. In fact, this is the first anime that I couldn’t choose a favorite because all the characters were either not interesting enough or just really annoying (it isn’t just because of my hater-ism! ~smile). Although there were times when Battler was cool, he got really stubborn and had poor logic reasoning (as if I was THAT good in logic ~grin). I also like Beatrice at one point until she laughed that annoying, loud laugh and then “poof!” she became an annoying, loud, ugly frog (witch->frog. Get it?? ~laughs at self) :DEnjoyment: 6Like I said, there wasn’t enough exciting logic puzzles or cool death scenes for me to enjoy the anime. Haaaaa… I really miss the Higurashi gores (~evil laugh).So I guess that if you’re looking for the gore and wickedness that Higurashi delivered, you shouldn’t expect much from this film. It was just bloody. Uhm, if you like thinking, though, you might want to consider this. That’s it I guess :)Nwah! (o‘.’o) or minutes.

Please read the novel or manga instead.The only thing worthwhile in this adaptation is the music, and you can just listen to that without subjecting yourself to Studio Deen's mistakes.The character songs are worth looking up if nothing else, though the OP/ED hit like a truck if you've read the VN. But the worst thing about all this is that Deen rushed through key parts of the story and characters that almost completely ruins it for anyone trying to solve the mystery. And this isn't even mentioning the AWFUL animation.One of the greatest stories of all time did not deserve this treatment "", 'I\'ll warn about spoilers, but they\'re pretty much identical to most complaints already listed here so not much in the way of spoilers. They relate to the completeness of the anime.You\'ve been warned.Ok, so this anime doesn\'t actually have an ending. It\'s such a mess you can hardly tell if you\'re still looking at the same anime from episode to episode, as things such as alternative timelines, alternative realities, fake scenarios and pure and simple lies appear on screen for most of the run time. I am purely an anime viewer; I don\'t know where this came from, and to be completely honest I don\'t...really care either. I heard quite a lot was cut out of this show, and that originally it did follow some resemblance of structure, rules and viewers could actually tell scenarios apart. However, that much is not true here.If I had to establish a comparison to what watching this show feels like, I would probably say this is the ""Lost"" of anime. There\'s intricate plot right at the beginning that pulls you in; the uncertainty of whether what\'s happening is supernatural or cold blooded murder was, to me, quite fascinating to watch. Then it\'s set aside. Then there\'s another one. Then the flashbacks begin. Then the flash forwards. Except the flash forwards are of an alternate timeline. Come to think of it, this might be a straight adaptation of lost. However, Lost certainly had one thing over this show: at least when it ended, for better of for worse, it was truly the end. Without wanting to spoil it too much: No, you won\'t be told the accurate answers to the riddles put in place (they even taunt the viewers about it near the end in a post-credits scene). No, you won\'t be able to re-view the events as they actually happened.I consider this failure to wander in the mystery/horror category, although there\'s not much in the way of horror after a few episodes when everything starts happening in the open. So it fails as horror. And considering that it doesn\'t even bother to actually solve the mystery it suggested in the first place in any way, shape or form, it also fails as a mystery. An argument could be made that part of the fun is finding out by yourself. The issue is, there\'s simply not enough info at play here. Towards the end it\'s hard to even tell what the show is trying to do, considering the focus of the show shifts from solving a mystery about a possible supernatural murder to... punching the hell out of demons and then trying to justify that it didn\'t happen. I hear that makes more sense in the source\'s setting, where everything was correctly explained. However, here, it feels like they\'re quite literally punching the shit out of Jesus and then claiming he doesn\'t exist at the same time.Story: 0I don\'t consider this show to have a story. A story has a beginning, a development and an end, and preferably those three acts are at least vaguely connected. The beginning is there, and it is undoubtedly the best part. The middle is unrecognizable from the beginning, and often times you\'ll be wondering what you should be trying to figure out as a viewer of a show that is supposed to be about solving a murder, as the show drags on about character development in flashbacks, alternate settings, flashforwards, alternate realities, et cetera. I\'m not saying that character development is bad. I\'m just saying it shouldn\'t stand in the way of the show, but it should naturally accompany it, not hold it up for a whole episode and then resume the murder mystery scene.Art: 4I don\'t care about the art. It didn\'t look amazing. There was a bit of gore. Yay.Sound: 5I care even less about the sound. The kid was unbelievably obnoxious. There was some nice classical music. Most of the ""young"" voice actors made me want to punt them, hard. Realistic, I guess.Character: 3If I were to remove about 10 episodes in the middle of the show, I would probably rate this higher. However, at a certain part around the middle of the show character development got really, really weird. It would be a safe bet to say most of the ""evil"" characters were off their bipolar meds when they woke up that month. I somewhat enjoyed the MC for once (in an endearing sort of way), shame it was wasted on such a mess of a show.Enjoyment: 1It\'s hard to make things retroactively bad. I enjoyed the first mystery. I enjoyed the first ""red text"" interaction. That being said, I enjoyed them because they provided me with the tools I thought I would need to put together to figure out the true nature of what happened. It\'s like buying a box of legos, assembling the build only to find out that while you have the wheels, the steering wheel and the spoilers for your f1 lego car, the whole chassis and the pilot are missing.Overall: 1Whole lot of hype for no reveal.

The art is fine, the story gets really interesting and you find yourself trying to solve the mystery before you realize. The torture scenes are a bit overexaggerated but still at an acceptable level. So if you like mystery, blood, tragedy and cool characters you can watch this one. ', 'After watching this series, a scene from Matrix Revolutions had always entered my mind:Smith: Why, Mr. Anderson? Why do you do it? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you\'re fighting for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Yes? No? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. The temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although only a human...mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can\'t win. It\'s pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?Neo: Because I choose to.Personally I enjoyed the series. Why do I like it so much in contrast to the harsh opinions of my peers?One thing is for sure, people lose sight that the most important thing about being human is that we choose to be human, we choose to be stubborn, irrational, and ignorant despite the fact the truth is right in front of us. Human tenacity is simply amazing, how we constantly fight on and on. Despite the odds despite the fact we may be wrong, we can choose to fight and persist in what we believe in and this is precisely the case with Battler, who constantly denies the existence of magic throughout the series despite the fact it\'s right in front of him. You\'re probably thinking, ""This reviewer is a complete idiot."" People make the mistake tenacity is always the bad ignorance that exists in this world. At times they are the same thing, but we cannot forget that it is the same tenacity that led to the exploration of ideas and creation of inventions we use every day. Before the space travel was possible, people believed anyone who dreamed of traveling to the moon as mentally unbalanced or just plain stupid. Those scientists who had the drive to make space travel possible constantly ignored the harassment and ridicule of their peers through their own tenacity and perseverance to make their own dreams come true. As a result those same people that were called ""loony"" are the most respected people in our society and they\'ve bestowed upon us technologies, such as cell phones and silicon computer parts, for our everyday use that we usually take for granted. I liked Battler\'s constant endurance throughout the series, he never gives in despite the odds. Call him stupid, but just like us, he never knew what was going to happen in the end. He fights not because he\'s denying magic, but because he refuses to accept such a fate as a mysterious and brutal death. Battler fights for what he believes in despite what others may think and this catches on with all the other characters toward the end of the series. Jessica, George, and many others begin to fight fate rather than accept it, because it\'s fate that denies them their dreams and hopes of the future. Sometimes we don\'t realize this, but fate can be changed. Despite the fact the world comes down around us, we can make the best of it and change the current environment into something positive in order to bring about a better tomorrow. We can criticize their character and actions since we have hindsight of the entire series, but, everyone\'s, especially Battler\'s, tenacity, sense of justice, and value for life is something to be admired until the end of the series.On the flip side, Beatrice we can all the ""sum of all fears."" She in the beginning, is the epiphany of cruelty, sadism, and blindness. She is what I see as the people who harass and ridicule those who believe in something that they truly put their hearts in. However, I\'ve learned, especially in the recent months, that people aren\'t cruel on purpose. I\'ve began talking with peers at my school who have harassed and constantly put me down. I discovered that while some of them acted out in blind ignorance due to their superior status as the Valedictorian or star athlete without any past consideration for feelings (much like Beatrice), a lot of them have personal problems, problems that really dwarf my own problems. Most of both parties forget that I\'m a human too, not just that little quiet person in the classroom and, as a result, cause a lot of unnecessary tension and anger. Of course when people begin to understand each other, that\'s when they can put aside differences and work together toward common goals. You can always simplify Beatrice being a tsundere character, but I always like to find deeper meaning in any anime I watch rather than criticize it for some bad faults. We should always keep in mind the there are messages that the author sometimes wants to get across and uses the cover ""entertainment"" to keep that message hidden. Why? Well if the message was so obvious then we wouldn\'t be able to appreciate it more would we?However, everyone is blind to the one invisible magic that brings about happiness in the world. That magic is love. Without love we wouldn\'t have actions such as forgiveness or kindness. We would fuel ourselves with hate and anger and lead very self-destructive lives in the process.  There\'s also the magic of choice, because we choose to do something that we do it. Battler fights against magic not necessarily because he hates it, but because he refuses to acknowledge defeat that would forever leave the fate of his family a mystery, and a cruel fate that would be.The actual game is something very interesting because of its unstable and volatile nature. So many lopsided rules and its very tricky. For the most part, I was able to keep up with non-magic conjectures and I came out with a few of my own that could have worked out. The text colors were the really difficult parts because they can slash out a ton of conjectures that were once viable and now null. I thought it was fun, though I was looking forward to the use of the purple text from the original sound novel.  It\'s disproving that a murder was caused my magic. Despite the fact it is perceived that it was caused by magic, there\'s always Schrödinger\'s cat: Battler wasn\'t there during the incidents, neither were we. Although the witch presents it to us as magic, it could have been done by human hands. Who knows? Maybe the Beatrice never needed the sacrifices, she was just playing God the entire time using magic. Maybe Beatrice is Battler\'s near-death experience, Battler fighting himself to live for the sake of his family. Maybe Beatrice is completely real and all that magic is presented to us as complete truth. We can never be certain. Just as there\'s no way we can prove that even our reality is corporeal or illusion, we cannot prove if the visible ""magic"" presented to us it physically real or false.Onward with the review:Story (8): We can all the story a game. A game that tests our wits and creativity. A game the really tests us to see whether we can find plausible solutions to an increasingly difficult dilemma. It\'s almost like an advanced science, where deeper and deeper research into more vague and difficult problems become close to impossible. It\'s a gamble, you never know what\'s going to happen. But we know the more risk we take, the less we would succeed. However, the payoff is much greater, therefore at times it\'s worth the risk. It applies to us in real life. In science, the more difficult problems scientists tackle, the less likely they\'ll come up with solutions to those problems. However, if they do come with solutions then they\'ve contributed a lot more to society and built a new bridge into larger, unknown territory of study than if they took small problems and solved them easily. Battler faces an ever daunting battle with Beatrice that tests his resolve, wits, and risk. He takes a huge risk facing all odds for the sake of living, for the sake of avenging his family for such misfortune and sadness, for the sake of love. He might lose over and over again for taking such an enormous risk, but if he wins in the end, it will payoff substantially. I liked the game a lot, therefore I gave the game or the ""story"" it\'s high rating.Art (6): Victorian-styled, wealthy class art was smooth and clean. The background and setting were all done really well. Character design was simple, but got across their personality really well. The one thing that really turned me off was the obvious fan-service done to most of the female characters. I mean if you\'re planning to do a serious series of wit and thinking, then at least make the characters serious. I mean yes breasts would be pretty obvious with the Victorian dresses they wear that tightly holds their waist and show off their busts, but the size of those breasts are enormous. On top of that, they add bunny homunculi halfway through the series, bloody bunny homunculi! If I knew any better this series would have been a blasted hentai game in disguise. It\'s a mystery-psychological series. If they made the breast sizes of most of the female characters more natural and regular, as well as keep to the wealthy, Victorian style of art, then it would have contributed to the overall serious mood of the series.Sound (9): I loved the OP. In one word, it was epic. The overall music and voice acting was done really well, none of the voices stood out of place and the background music contributed to the overall mood of the series quite nicely. In fact, the voices of the characters were done extremely well. I really was disgusted by characters such as Eva and Rosa whose voices contributed so well to their overall despicable characters.Character (4): Despite the fact I loved heroes such as Battler and Ange, as well as antagonists, like Eva and Rosa, I really hated the lack of character development for most of the characters. Yes we know it\'s a psychological-mystery thriller and you\'re supposed to include a lot of characters for red herring purposes to keep us busy, but none of those characters can be used as red herrings, or even culprits, because the lack a defining characteristic or fact that helps describe their alibis. I\'ve read a a good number of mystery novels, and each one always gives at least a defining detail of character that may have helped us solve the mystery or drove us into the completely wrong direction with the red herring. Heck they might have left even a small quirky hint that would allow us to make conjectures to certain characters we read about in the mystery. Unfortunately Umineko doesn\'t accomplish this in the slightest bit and just puts out characters in this story just as lambs for the slaughter, serving no purpose other than to be killed rather than to lead us off and trick us.Enjoyment (9): It was fun playing the game. One thing is for sure. If you\'re looking for a mystery that resolves itself at the end, then Umineko is not the series for you. If you\'re looking for something that constantly makes you brainstorm, use your wits, and makes you ponder quite a bit, then Umineko is something youwould enjoy.Overall (7): Basically speaking, the series is good if you like to think quite a bit and can find a lot of positives and reflections in the series. If you\'re looking for straight out entertainment or emotion, this is not the series for you. mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can\'t win. It\'s pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?Neo: Because I choose to.Personally I enjoyed the series. Why do I like it so much in contrast to the harsh opinions of my peers?One thing is for sure, people lose sight that the most important thing about being human is that we choose to be human, we choose to be stubborn, irrational, and ignorant despite the fact the truth is right in front of us. Human tenacity is simply amazing, how we constantly fight on and on. Despite the odds despite the fact we may be wrong, we can choose to fight and persist in what we believe in and this is precisely the case with Battler, who constantly denies the existence of magic throughout the series despite the fact it\'s right in front of him. You\'re probably thinking, ""This reviewer is a complete idiot."" People make the mistake tenacity is always the bad ignorance that exists in this world. At times they are the same thing, but we cannot forget that it is the same tenacity that led to the exploration of ideas and creation of inventions we use every day. Before the space travel was possible, people believed anyone who dreamed of traveling to the moon as mentally unbalanced or just plain stupid. Those scientists who had the drive to make space travel possible constantly ignored the harassment and ridicule of their peers through their own tenacity and perseverance to make their own dreams come true. As a result those same people that were called ""loony"" are the most respected people in our society and they\'ve bestowed upon us technologies, such as cell phones and silicon computer parts, for our everyday use that we usually take for granted. I liked Battler\'s constant endurance throughout the series, he never gives in despite the odds. Call him stupid, but just like us, he never knew what was going to happen in the end. He fights not because he\'s denying magic, but because he refuses to accept such a fate as a mysterious and brutal death. Battler fights for what he believes in despite what others may think and this catches on with all the other characters toward the end of the series. Jessica, George, and many others begin to fight fate rather than accept it, because it\'s fate that denies them their dreams and hopes of the future. Sometimes we don\'t realize this, but fate can be changed. Despite the fact the world comes down around us, we can make the best of it and change the current environment into something positive in order to bring about a better tomorrow. We can criticize their character and actions since we have hindsight of the entire series, but, everyone\'s, especially Battler\'s, tenacity, sense of justice, and value for life is something to be admired until the end of the series.On the flip side, Beatrice we can all the ""sum of all fears."" She in the beginning, is the epiphany of cruelty, sadism, and blindness. She is what I see as the people who harass and ridicule those who believe in something that they truly put their hearts in. However, I\'ve learned, especially in the recent months, that people aren\'t cruel on purpose. I\'ve began talking with peers at my school who have harassed and constantly put me down. I discovered that while some of them acted out in blind ignorance due to their superior status as the Valedictorian or star athlete without any past consideration for feelings (much like Beatrice), a lot of them have personal problems, problems that really dwarf my own problems. Most of both parties forget that I\'m a human too, not just that little quiet person in the classroom and, as a result, cause a lot of unnecessary tension and anger. Of course when people begin to understand each other, that\'s when they can put aside differences and work together toward common goals. You can always simplify Beatrice being a tsundere character, but I always like to find deeper meaning in any anime I watch rather than criticize it for some bad faults. We should always keep in mind the there are messages that the author sometimes wants to get across and uses the cover ""entertainment"" to keep that message hidden. Why? Well if the message was so obvious then we wouldn\'t be able to appreciate it more would we?However, everyone is blind to the one invisible magic that brings about happiness in the world. That magic is love. Without love we wouldn\'t have actions such as forgiveness or kindness. We would fuel ourselves with hate and anger and lead very self-destructive lives in the process.  There\'s also the magic of choice, because we choose to do something that we do it. Battler fights against magic not necessarily because he hates it, but because he refuses to acknowledge defeat that would forever leave the fate of his family a mystery, and a cruel fate that would be.The actual game is something very interesting because of its unstable and volatile nature. So many lopsided rules and its very tricky. For the most part, I was able to keep up with non-magic conjectures and I came out with a few of my own that could have worked out. The text colors were the really difficult parts because they can slash out a ton of conjectures that were once viable and now null. I thought it was fun, though I was looking forward to the use of the purple text from the original sound novel.  It\'s disproving that a murder was caused my magic. Despite the fact it is perceived that it was caused by magic, there\'s always Schrödinger\'s cat: Battler wasn\'t there during the incidents, neither were we. Although the witch presents it to us as magic, it could have been done by human hands. Who knows? Maybe the Beatrice never needed the sacrifices, she was just playing God the entire time using magic. Maybe Beatrice is Battler\'s near-death experience, Battler fighting himself to live for the sake of his family. Maybe Beatrice is completely real and all that magic is presented to us as complete truth. We can never be certain. Just as there\'s no way we can prove that even our reality is corporeal or illusion, we cannot prove if the visible ""magic"" presented to us it physically real or false.Onward with the review:Story (8): We can all the story a game. A game that tests our wits and creativity. A game the really tests us to see whether we can find plausible solutions to an increasingly difficult dilemma. It\'s almost like an advanced science, where deeper and deeper research into more vague and difficult problems become close to impossible. It\'s a gamble, you never know what\'s going to happen. But we know the more risk we take, the less we would succeed. However, the payoff is much greater, therefore at times it\'s worth the risk. It applies to us in real life. In science, the more difficult problems scientists tackle, the less likely they\'ll come up with solutions to those problems. However, if they do come with solutions then they\'ve contributed a lot more to society and built a new bridge into larger, unknown territory of study than if they took small problems and solved them easily. Battler faces an ever daunting battle with Beatrice that tests his resolve, wits, and risk. He takes a huge risk facing all odds for the sake of living, for the sake of avenging his family for such misfortune and sadness, for the sake of love. He might lose over and over again for taking such an enormous risk, but if he wins in the end, it will payoff substantially. I liked the game a lot, therefore I gave the game or the ""story"" it\'s high rating.Art (6): Victorian-styled, wealthy class art was smooth and clean. The background and setting were all done really well. Character design was simple, but got across their personality really well. The one thing that really turned me off was the obvious fan-service done to most of the female characters. I mean if you\'re planning to do a serious series of wit and thinking, then at least make the characters serious. I mean yes breasts would be pretty obvious with the Victorian dresses they wear that tightly holds their waist and show off their busts, but the size of those breasts are enormous. On top of that, they add bunny homunculi halfway through the series, bloody bunny homunculi! If I knew any better this series would have been a blasted hentai game in disguise. It\'s a mystery-psychological series. If they made the breast sizes of most of the female characters more natural and regular, as well as keep to the wealthy, Victorian style of art, then it would have contributed to the overall serious mood of the series.Sound (9): I loved the OP. In one word, it was epic. The overall music and voice acting was done really well, none of the voices stood out of place and the background music contributed to the overall mood of the series quite nicely. In fact, the voices of the characters were done extremely well. I really was disgusted by characters such as Eva and Rosa whose voices contributed so well to their overall despicable characters.Character (4): Despite the fact I loved heroes such as Battler and Ange, as well as antagonists, like Eva and Rosa, I really hated the lack of character development for most of the characters. Yes we know it\'s a psychological-mystery thriller and you\'re supposed to include a lot of characters for red herring purposes to keep us busy, but none of those characters can be used as red herrings, or even culprits, because the lack a defining characteristic or fact that helps describe their alibis. I\'ve read a a good number of mystery novels, and each one always gives at least a defining detail of character that may have helped us solve the mystery or drove us into the completely wrong direction with the red herring. Heck they might have left even a small quirky hint that would allow us to make conjectures to certain characters we read about in the mystery. Unfortunately Umineko doesn\'t accomplish this in the slightest bit and just puts out characters in this story just as lambs for the slaughter, serving no purpose other than to be killed rather than to lead us off and trick us.Enjoyment (9): It was fun playing the game. One thing is for sure. If you\'re looking for a mystery that resolves itself at the end, then Umineko is not the series for you. If you\'re looking for something that constantly makes you brainstorm, use your wits, and makes you ponder quite a bit, then Umineko is something youwould enjoy.Overall (7): Basically speaking, the series is good if you like to think quite a bit and can find a lot of positives and reflections in the series. If you\'re looking for straight out entertainment or emotion, this is not the series for you.', ""If you're going to watch Umineko no Naku Koro ni... Do NOT expect any answer to the Mystery you are going to see. You won't have any answer. Is this a Bad thing ?... It can be but, if you watched Higurashi before... by now, you should get it : This is how the Story is told ! So... Yes, i am telling you. After 26 episodes, you still won't get it.What was great with Higurashi it's that even after 26 episodes, you had a little bit of the answer... not all of them but, still. AND... there's another season of Higurashi. Umineko don't...have any... and I'm not sure it's going to have one so... you will propably never have any answer to your questions. You will want those answer really bad tho !And that's where the Sound Novel comes in !Umineko is kind of 'like' Higurashi in the way the story is told. You will have the 'Question Arc'. Four of these. That's where the anime stop. Those are just... completely... Confusing.For the Answer... you'll have to rely on the Sound Novel and that's not a bad thing because the Sound Novel is awesome.- STORYLet's be honest, Umineko is having a really original story also very complex and that's what's getting you into the story asking yourself all the question you should be asking yourself until the Answer Arc. The Anime failed at this part. To have a change to get the mysterie, you need details. You need to know the character. You need to know everything. Who's wearing the Golden Wing on his outfit ? Who isn't ? Who was where at this moment ? Who could have done this or that ? It's a Mystery and if Battler wants to say Beatrice isn't the culprit... he will definitly need a real culprit. Then... Who is it ?Lots of thing were left behind making people misunderstanding that show. They sure had to cut stuff because they're so much more in the game but... maybe they tried to do that too much or cut the wrong stuff. I don't know.I would have done 10 for sure in the Novel but since the anime screwed up it's going to be a 8.- ARTI liked it. The Troll face were nice ( I'm thinking of Eva-Beatrice and Beatrice herself here, eheh! ) It's definitly not the Best Art i've seen but it was good. Really good if I think about the horrible art Higurashi had...- SOUNDI have nothing to complain about the sound. They took the music from the Novel and put it into the anime and the Music in the Novel is good. It's not called a Sound Novel for nothing, eh ! The only thing I would complain about is that they put the song at some random moment at time but it wasn't out of place really it was just... different. I'm thinking about Mirage Coordinator. That song wasn't played at the Scene with Maria and her mother but it made the scene epic in the anime somehow.- CHARACTERSThis is probably the place were everything went... an horrible way. In the anime, Battler looks like a Kid arguing about something he can see. He looks ridiculous even if some scene still show him the 'badass' way he actually is when he's all mighty in front of Beatrice. Then, he goes down to crying like a crybaby and it doesn't make any sense in the Anime when actually.. it does !Let's make something clear right away...This goal of Battler isn't to deny magic everywhere. It's just about denying magic at this moment on this island. He doesn't care about what's outside. He's not fighting for that. All he wants to show is that this could have been done by a human therefore he have to suspect someone ! Until then... Magic can exist at this moment in this island.All of this wasn't made clear at all in the anime making people confusing about stuff they shouldn't be worrying about but instead use to understand.Beatrice just looks like a Tsundere Girl it can be annoying at times and she looked maybe too kind at times.And let's not talk about all of the relatives... None of them got enough air time to make the viewer understand them, know them and finally love them and reach Battler's issue : Being unable to believe one of his loved relatives killed the others !- ENJOYEMENTI don't know if that's just me but... I loved the show. I wanted it every week when it came out. I could watch the same episode twice and finally, it made me try to be able to play the Sound Novel.Now... Let's talk about the Ending of the Show. I said before the ending wasn't suposse to, and isn't going to, answer any of your question. Actually the Ending of the anime feels like a joke. Everything ! All of it. That's where the lacks of character developpement couldn't help the ending at all so... it failed. I would recommend another ending if found on youtube. It was kind of Fan Made I think but it was awesome and really helped.Anyway, I'll try to find it back. Tell me if you want the Link.

IT IS A MUST that you watch those to understand what is actually happening in umineko no naku koro ni, or else you will be in a WTF moment. Some similar characters are introduced in Umineko compared to Higurashi, but they are not exactly the same people. It gets really confusing and mysterious, and you have to bare with it until the end. There is this never ending cycle of death in these animes, and you will wonder why, but later on, it will...be explained why these conflicts are happening; actually, it will pull you in, and it will make you wonder.

Well, at least you didn\'t write the script for this series.Umineko was an anime that showed great promise, trying to be an intellectual puzzle that would have viewers trying to analyze details and scramble for nuances. After all, it has much to live up to its predecessor Higurashi. The basic premise is to solve a mystery through logical means rather than the magical ones that show up and are far more convenient.While it seems counter intuitive that you\'d use magic to deny magic, it\'s important to...realize that magic could exist, but there\'s still a logical (non-magic) reason to explain the story . (Even if there are magical means to do something, it doesn\'t mean you have to use magic to do it.)Anyhow, that was pretty much all I gathered from the show before it decided to meander into the realm of nonsense. I\'ve never played the original game, but it\'s obvious facts were left out, because the connection between events are minimal and was left wondering ""what does that have to do with anything??"" at every turn.The plot seems to take so many dead ends and go off into random tangents that later parts feel more like a Family Guy episode. In other words, the storytelling is laughable and there\'s no cohesion whatsoever. It makes no sense!The main issue was the pacing. With poor prioritization of events, it was hard to follow the show. It did good in some spots, but it would dwell a bit too long, hurting other parts that get fast forwarded. For the most part, sometimes the intention is there, but not the execution. The result is that you get events that should make you feel for the characters and what could happen, but it just lands with a thud because it gets rushed. There are of course a few exceptions that were handled very well (typically at the end of a chapter) but those tend to be rare.In other words, it\'s just not enough to list events A,B,C,D.The animation is ok most of the time, but it suffers from the stupid faces Higurashi liked so much. The music is arguably the best part of the anime, but it was oddly misused at points. However, I would definitely say that\'s one thing memorable I got from this show. The opening is epic, and the ending is crazy, much like the series.The characters are largely bland, but that\'s a bit forgivable since there\'s so many of them. The ones that they do focus on, particularly Maria and Beatrice are well done. There are also quite a few emotional moments to be found near the end; I guess the writers sobered up. There is one character near the end that is exceptionally done-- you\'ll know when they appear. The antagonists are extremely... colorful.Despite all of this criticism, this is hardly a terrible show. I found it more enjoyable when I stopped taking it seriously and went along for the ride-- how does someone enjoy something by nitpicking constantly?  It\'s a pretty good comedy actually (Some intentionally, surprisingly) Every week, I\'d tune in to see what other increasingly ridiculous outfits and twists the show could come up with.  Add in a few legitimately touching moments, and it becomes a good watch that makes you morbidly curious.I reject the pretentious notion that a show has to be all deep and coherent, and must excel in all categories to be considered of quality. Anime is an entertainment medium and the most important thing is that it makes you want to watch. And it did keep me watching.The very end is unforgivable though... it kinda just leaves you out there and probably had some of the worst execution ever-- a wasted opportunity to have the show really leave an impact.Umineko is not a good show, and it is most certainly not well done.

The anime is centered around a game played by the Witch Beatrice and Battler (a member of the Ushiromiya family) and the goal of the game is to have Battler either admit that witches exist, or prove how the murders of each...chapter can be done by human intervention.You will be first introduced to this game setting about 4 episodes in.I thought this series was good, however, I often found myself getting bored and confused. Because of the magic aspect, I sometimes had a hard time following the story, but that doesn't mean there isn't some awesomely insane sequences.There was tons of blood and gore and dead bodies everywhere, however, the gore was often censored. There is a deep psychological aspect to this story that shows up near the end of the series, but what I liked the most, is how the show depicts how devious the witch Beatrice can be. Sometimes the story would completely mislead you, until you found out at the very end that they were pulling your leg the entire time, making me feel stupid, yet impressed. But what I was most impressed about is how the artists depicted the family members and how they would act in order to receive unimaginable wealth. In 2009 the Ushiromiya families 10 tons of gold would be worth 20 billion yen, in 2011, the gold would be worth 40 billion yen, I would probably be an uptight douche bag too if I could get wealth like that.The art was very consistent and at times down right creepy, however, since a lot of the gore was censored, I didn't get to see the full glory of the horrifying scenes. And even though magic was used throughout, the art was consistent during those sequences. And for some reason, Victorian dresses can still look frilly and extremely complex... I wonder if that is just a natural thing for anime's.Anyway, the dialogue sometimes moves to quickly and at times too slow. A lot of the time the dialogue is to help you understand the setting of the current chapter, but it is also used to create character development. Music.... what music, I guess I was too bored or possibly too engaged to notice the music.Like I said, I did enjoy the series, yet found myself getting bored sometimes. The story at times would really just drag along and when you see the same setting multiple times, things tend to get boring until you come across the one aspect or part of the story that changes everything forcing the story to go down a horrifying path.Overall, I give this alternative setting a 7/10. I think the show was good, and if I had seen the show when I would be more engaged, perhaps it would've received a better score by me.And mind you, Einzo did not resurrect Beatrice, but rather, Beatrice uses the epitaph as a reason to continuously murder the Ushiromiya family.

A lot of the time the dialogue is to help you understand the setting of the current chapter, but it is also used to create character development. Music.... what music, I guess I was too bored or possibly too engaged to notice the music.Like I said, I did enjoy the series, yet found myself getting bored sometimes. The story at times would really just drag along and when you see the same setting multiple times, things tend to get boring until you come across the one aspect or part of the story that changes everything forcing the story to go down a horrifying path.Overall, I give this alternative setting a 7/10. I think the show was good, and if I had seen the show when I would be more engaged, perhaps it would've received a better score by me.And mind you, Einzo did not resurrect Beatrice, but rather, Beatrice uses the epitaph as a reason to continuously murder the Ushiromiya family. If I got anything wrong, it may be because some of these things may have been explained in those times I was bored."", ""When I saw the first episode of Umineko I got impressed. I like mystery and terror animes. Thats the reason That I began to watch Umineko.The beginning was simple: some mysterious murders are been commieted an the killer is a misterious person. A peerson is killing the Ushiromiya family? Maria, the youngest one of the Ushiromiya believes in Beatrice, the Golden Witch.I really like the story: Battler vs Beatrice. The game between this two characters is lke a chess game and Battler wants to win: He believes that no magic was used to kill his family. Beatrice will demostrate Battler her power.All characters well excellent:...a great personality. I really like the participation of Ange, Eva Maria and Virgilia in the game. Maybe the anime only focus on the witches and battler. But are moments in you can say: What did he/she did that?The art was good, acceptable, not a great art, not the worst but the animation has a lot of mistakes, but  to me it doesnt matter. All things (in this case the animation) can have mistakes. I Ignore them. Yes, there are a lot of obvious mistakes. You have to ignore them to finish the anime.I enjoy the anime, but in some pats I got bored. The songs and clips of the opening and ending are so good. I like the changings of the secuense of mages in the opening: little changes like the picture of Beato, for example. This changes change in each game.In Overall I gave an 8. The end of story wasnt good: I really want to see battler and Ange together, this doesn't happen. The final of the anime wast great. Acceptable. I was waiting for a best ending.Note: Before this I didnt see Higurashi, but in the furutre I will see it. So I cant compare Higurashi vs umineki a great personality.

After finishing I was bored and found umineko chiru the sound novel containing episodes 5-8 (anime shows 1-4). After playing all 8 games now I really appreciate umineko as an amazing game but I don't think it translated well to animeStory: 3The problem with the story is its rushed but on a level that its so fast a lot of the subtleties are lost. It's just a mess by the end of episode 26 I was the one asking to be killed. There are...also lots of moments that are amazing in the SN but disappointing in the anime, like when Virgillia opens her eye in chapter 3 which is left out or Kyrie and Rudolph fighting the seven sisters. I think the fact that Ryukushi leaves the mysteries to be interpreted and solved by the viewer doesn't work well with the anime setting especially since a lot of the clues are left out of briefly covered. Overall feels very weak and confusingArt: 7I'm a big fan of the art in the anime, from the characters to the gorey scenes. Maybe it looks a bit too anime with the DisneyTM eyes but hey I'm a sucker for that kinda thingSound: 9This is my favorite part of the anime, the great soundtrack from the creepy opening to that menacing ending sound track is strong. The music throughout sounds amazing and I think it really is a work of art to be appreciated.Character: 3This is what breaks the anime, you get into episode 1 and all of a sudden who the f are these characters? Until I saw them next to eachother I thought rosa and Eva were the same person… and how would you describe them? Eva: evil Rosa: bad parent Maria: Creepy Kinzo: will he ever shut up??? In the SN when we're introduced to Eva shes a sarcastic but funny aunt to Battler. Rosa seems to be a kindhearted loving individual, Maria starts of as very cute and friendly. And Kinzo… well he's the same. Anyway they needed to atleast get this much out of the way before having the characters we know nothing about getting brutally murdered. Battler and Beato's characters have been dumbed down too but that's okay maybe more time will be spent on the stor.. Oh waitEnjoyment: 5Both times when I watch t it's been a ok experience and I get to the end and its kinda like wat did I just do. If you want some mindless horror with a bit of suspence it's not a bad anime.

Not that I actually like random anime, but this is one awesome random anime.Anime revolves around 18 people gets brutally murdered in all different ways. I\'m sure you know the rest of the info....So...Lets get straight to the review, shall we?Story- Story is.....Kinda difficult to explain. What is the Genre of this anime? hmmm...Is it Mystery? Hell yeah. Is it Horror? Well, quite. Is it Romance? Sometimes. Is it Comedy? Definitely. Then what kind of anime is it? All of the above. MysteryHorroRomanComedy. Yup, the anime was so random the...type of anime also became so random. The anime follows Higurashi style, you know where everyone becomes alive the following episode just after being killed in the previous episode. Yes, that kind. If you played the game Phoenix Wright:Ace Attorney for the DS, then this anime is the same. The protagonist, Ushiromiya Battler is the cocky but cool dude who doesnt believe that witches exist. While, a witch named Beatrice challenges him in game to make him believe that Witches and Magic exist. Thats the story. Mainly focused on Battler trying to talk his way that witches don\'t exist, even when they actually did. As the story progresses, it becomes more and more random which is why many people didn\'t liked this anime.Story= 6 out of 10.Art- Art/animation/graphics whatever is great. Well, Its kinda obvious since this is made in 2009! Art= 8 out of 10.Sound- Despite having a weird OP and strange ED left me to ""fast-forwarding"" it. Voice-acting? Awesome. Everything here was good, only the OP and the ED were the flaws. I didn\'t liked the OP and ED. Sound= 7 out of 10.Character-  Loved the characters, especially the 7 Stakes of Purgatory and Siestas. I REALLY LOVED THEM. Who wouldn\'t want them in the anime?. Well, Character designs was definitely over-the-top. Character= 9 out of 10Enjoyment- Most of the enjoyment came from the randomness, well for me. The Uber-randomness made the anime hilarious. It even was funny when it wasn\'t supposed to funny. Did I mention the anime is very violent? Yeah, probably more bloodier and gorier than Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni. But the violence didn\'t even satisfy me one bit. The randomness is even better. Some parts of the anime was very dumb and pointless though not to mention very random which is why this anime can also be included in the Comedy genre. Hilarious even when aren\'t. Enjoyment= 7 out of 10.Overall- I personally enjoyed Higurashi a LOT more than Umineko, but Umineko is still pretty good. I won\'t recommend it to everyone, despite its uber-randomness. But Why an 8 for this anime? Without the 7 sisters of Purgatory, this anime would receive a 6 out of ten. This anime has mixed opinions. No matter what kind of genre you hate or like, I would give you one advice= Just watch this anime. Who knows? You might actually end up loving it just like I did.OVERALL= 8 out of 10. type of anime also became so random.

Now, Umineko is an adaptation of the Visual Novel (VN) with the same name - a VN with high emphasis on atmosphere, a VN with complex characters that are all related to each other with a lot of backstory progressively revealed, a VN with a complex narrative structure, a VN that contains over 1.3 million english words, a VN that needs well over 120 hours to complete. I want to ask...you a simple question: Do you really think an Anime with only 26 episodes (~8 hours) can do the VN justice? If your answer is yes, then congratulations, you can skip the rest of this review and go watch Umineko.The point of my review is not to praise the VN over the Anime. I do believe every piece of art has a standalone value. An Anime does not get worse just because a VN exists - Anime has its own merits. However, Umineko is flawed in many areas and to fully understand why, you have to take a look at the source material. That is my intention. Not saying ""the VN is better"", but I want you to understand why the Anime is bad.1.) StoryFirst off, the Anime covers roughly half of the story from the VN. It may sound weird, but that was a rather good decision on Studio Deens part, as a full story adaptation would have made Umineko probably the worst Anime ever due to being even more condensed. However, stopping after the first half leaves many many questions and plot points open that are resolved later in the VN.Another problem is the high density of events that are happening. Every ""episode"" (this is what chapters are called in the VN) usually takes 20+ hours to complete and has been stuffed into an arc of 4 to 6 episodes length. Many dialogues and key story elements have been omitted and as such, it\'s impossible to get to the truth behind every murder. Every arc in Umineko is full of plot holes because scenes from the VN were randomly selected, adapted and stacked together. One such example of a plot hole is during the second ""episode"" (chapter) when Shanon commits suicide. In the anime, the stake is stuck in her forehead, which should be impossible since she committed suicide and it should be lying by her side. As such in the Anime, this case seems like a perfect closed room murder and is not solvable even though it should. There are other inconsistencies thoughout the plot, also some minor ones (like in ""episode"" (chapter) 3, Rudolf and Kyrie are killed in the corridor and then shown in the grand hall), but yeah, you should get the general idea of my point.Umineko is a work focused on mystery. Mystery is the most interesting when the reader (or viewer in that case) is able to follow the mystery and is able to craft his own theories based on the clues presented throughout the story. This is possible (though insanely hard) in the VN, but at times impossible in the Anime. This partly because the story is not complete but also due to the aforementioned plot holes. As such, I think the Umineko Anime misses its goal of being a good mystery Anime.2.) CharactersUmineko has a diverse cast of mostly adult or young adult characters and a complex weave of relationships between all those characters. Every character has a lot of focus throughout the chapters in the VN but nothing of that remained in the Anime. The characters were mostly reduced to their single most defining personality trait and due to the nature of such traits, some characters ended up utterly detestable. One such example would be Rosa, who has sparked many memes throughout the community. Yes, she is extremely unlikable in the Anime due to the way she neglects and at times physically assaults her daughter, but the Anime does not do her personality justice in any way. It is only the VN that gives insight on her difficult relationship to her siblings and the circumstances that made her a single mother.Due to the fact that most characters are (at best) plot devices, it\'s hard to feel anything about them. They are shallow and one dimensional, why should anyone care if they are killed off?3.) Art & SoundWell, Studio Deen has never been known for their outstanding production quality, at least not during the 2000s. Fate/stay night and Higurashi have already suffered from extremely bad animation und as you may guess, Umineko has suffered the same fate. The character designs look simple and shabby, faces or shapes are deformed and background images are lacking detail.Probably one of the few positive aspects of the Anime is that some of the VN soundtracks are used in the Anime. Uminekos sound collection in the VN is huge and consists of over 200 classical-like music pieces to support the atmosphere. It was definitely a good choice to reuse them. The opening and ending theme were also relatively good, much to my surprise.4.) Conclusive wordsLooking at the Anime alone, we have a rather interesting setting (murders within a family on a secluded island) but only an average story with common plot holes and bad characters. I cannot list many positive aspects of Umineko as the Anime doesn\'t do anything outstanding besides its uncommon setting. I cannot understand how anyone would perceive the Umineko Anime as a masterpiece when in fact it has plot holes all over the place (which is extremely critical for a mystery Anime) among severe other flaws.Yes, the Anime managed to keep the narrative structure mostly (though I found the visual indicators to distinct between the gameboard and the meta world not clear enough, but maybe that\'s just me) and some of the atmosphere but besides that it just used a pre-existing story and characters and chopped them together into an unwatchable clusterfuck. Do yourself a favor and read the VN (or at least the Manga) if you\'re seriously interested in Umineko.In my opinion, Umineko is a candidate for the worst VN adaptation out there.2/10 you a simple question: Do you really think an Anime with only 26 episodes (~8 hours) can do the VN justice?

She wants him to admit she used magic to...commit the murders, he denies that, saying there must be a non-magical explanation to that.Here we find the MAIN issue with this Anime. After the first 4-5 episodes, where everything proceeds smoothly, the battle/game starts.We find Battler yelling ""Magic doesn\'t exist"", ""I will neevr admit the existence of witches"". But still, he is dead, he is in a different dimension, he and the witch can disappear in golden butterflies...but Magic doesn\'t exist....OK, we can say that he is focusing only on whats happening on the island, where people die WITHOUT the help of Magic.But this is the point i stopped watching this thing. Beatrice starts summoning Demons, Goat-Headed butlers. Shannon and Kanon start to use superpowers to fight these demons. And in the end....these demons transform themselves into knives and kill the residents of the Island.What is the point of this Anime? The main guy keep saying magic doesn\'t exist, and the Murders are done by Humans, not magic......but HEY, some of the murders are done by Demons, summoned by Magic, after a Magical/Superpowered battle....so what the hell is the point of the Anime?DO i have to keep watching the Main character saying magic doesn\'t exist, when the scene before we see demons fighting Superpowered Humans?...cmonI could also talk about how the little girl start using psycho expressions since episode 1, making you wonder why no-one seems to care/notice a psychopathic 9yo when people start getting murdered.How some characters die as Humans in a world, and reveal themselves as powerful immortal beings in the next...meaning an immortal witch was killed only to be brought back alive....This Anime, makes NO SENSE. It is not a Magic/Spernatural anime. It is NOT a mystery anime, since you cannot solve a mystery that doesn\'t make sense....i see people killed by magic but i must explain how they were NOT killed by magic....and with this i\'m done. commit the murders, he denies that, saying there must be a non-magical explanation to that.Here we find the MAIN issue with this Anime.

This is a trial that can only be completed by those with iron resolve, or really bad taste. Each arc felt like a different anime and the characters and motivations were so under explained that it felt like a different anime every arc. I came into this expecting a murder mystery, I got...a comedy? I still don\'t know. In the end this anime got me to want to buy the game so ten atta ten.Story: The story left a lot to be...desired, it was all over the place and went nowhere. Don\'t expect a decent ending either because everything just follows the status quo. Battler trying to explain events made it feel like the show was trying hard to be serious but came off as comedic because of how bad it was.Art: The art all in all really wasn\'t that bad, sure there were a few times where the animation looked derpy, but it looked okay most of the time. The faces were great, being a ""sequel"" to Higurashi you can expect to see some great ones. The gore was also better than I would have thought.Sound: Music was pretty great, and so were most of the sound effects. The 7 Stakes of Purgatory made the stupidest sound as they traveled through the air though. The most annoying of the characters named Maria will constantly be making an uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu sound, so be prepared for that, there is a compilation of most of the times she says it in the first episode and it spans 2 minutes.Characters: I almost don\'t even want to touch this, but here we go. Battler is an idiot and our main protagonist, his purpose is to deny the existence of witches and magic as he plays a game with one, while being helped by one, while existing in a separate dimension viewing a timeline of alternate realities. Maria is the most annoying 9 year old who is constantly getting beaten by her mother Rosa. Maria makes up for it by having the most character development and delivering the best scene in the anime. Beatrice is an insane witch who uses magic. No one else really matters because they barely get development until the end, which would be spoilers.Enjoyment: I\'m sadistic desired, it was all over the place and went nowhere.

However was that wait really needed and animated well at least some of it.Story:Be ready to had some what happened that scene and that time in this anime many time. Also this anime has a lot of story twists so after watching episode it can change dramatically when you watch another one. Story is dark and it will...easily keep viewer having new information all the time. This is also story that let's you think how it's going to go and why did that and those events happened. This is basically story that some guy is want to believe that there is no supernatural events happening and then there is other side who wants to get that guy to believe that supernatural things exist.Story is great and enjoyable at least some parts of it. so right grade is 9/10Animation / Art:Rokkunjima looks really frightening and scary place that will make any viewer to have goosebumps at some point when watching this anime. Environment is not all the time same which is good we get to see many themed environments in this anime. Some of animated scenes are censored because this is actually quite brutal and gory anime.Animation / Art is OK if you don't pay much attention to those censored scenes. So it will be given 8/10The Music:The best this anime can really give viewer is a big music collection. OP is really sad and make some emotional feelings to viewer also ED theme is a little scary and sad too. But I liked both in the end.Music is definitely big trump card for this anime. Because every tune is different and somehow related to this anime. I will give 10 /10Characters:This series had a lot of different characters but sadly all of them didn't got developed in the end. However most of these characters have their own painful stories to tell and anime really wants to viewer to understand logic behind these.I believe right grade for characters is 9/10Enjoyment:Still I enjoyed this anime and that will tell my episodes. Like I watched 10 episodes per day. So I was really caught up on it.My Enjoyment points are 9/10Overall:Umineko isn't perfect anime series it lacks certain characters developments but it can make you really feel the characters pain they going through in the anime. But let me say this after watching this anime you don't now all the answers for riddles that you should because Studio DEEN couldn't finished it properly and that's why many people will encourage to read VN (Visual Novel) if you want to now how the story is going to continue. I should read it also because I haven't read it yet.My Overall and final score this anime is 9/10 easily keep viewer having new information all the time.

The mystery, the murders, the slightly psychological play, the strange characters and the parts of it that you\'re just not meant to understand completely.While watching the first segment of the anime, I was absolutely amazed. In fact, I couldn\'t stop watching at all. Maria, the absolutely strangest child I\'ve seen in anime, is such an interesting character from the very moment she appears. Another thing that adds spice to the story.I have a hard time writing this without spoiling. Let\'s say that the first segment...of it, the first ""game"", was very exciting and interesting, but when I realized what the coming segments would be containing, I felt myself slightly disappointed. Now it was no longer a secret, and not as confusing. However, when Battler and Beatrice start their own game, it becomes interesting again.I can\'t think of anything certain that I didn\'t like about it - perhaps the repetitiveness, yet that is part of the point. At first it seems slightly annoying, but when you come to the later episodes, after ~15, you realize that the repetitiveness is for a reason.A short and brief review perhaps, but maybe it will be helpful to someone? There have to be more people than me that want to watch a mystery anime of which you don\'t completely apprehend all of. Or maybe it\'s just me being stupid? Let\'s just say it satisfied me, and I\'m picky about my psychological animes. of it, the first ""game"", was very exciting and interesting, but when I realized what the coming segments would be containing, I felt myself slightly disappointed.

The first 4 episodes is amazing classic murder mystery horror, near peak as far as anime horror goes. The first 4 eps are definitely worth your time to watch, and I can't recommend them enough. But once you reach ep 5 that is the start of where the story massively changes and turns into something huge, drawn out, and overly convoluted to follow. The first 4 eps earned it a higher rating than I would give it based on the remaining episodes. Not saying that the remainder isn't good, it is just a lot...to follow and overwhelmed me a bit. It twists people and events a lot and made me feel lost, conflicted, and confused at points. The driving concept from ep 5 onwards was cool, but in practice was not well received by me. It did have its select great moments throughout that make the rest of it still worthy of a watch if you have the time and patience. But if you like a tightly structured and to the point plot then this might not be the show for you. Because in my opinion the remaining 22 isn't worth the time investment. Note that this is my opinion and I am sure there are plenty who played the game and are experts on the various routes and lore, and those people probably had a much better time of watching than I did. So please don't let me dissuade you from watching all of it if you're genuinely interested in the show. Many of its characters show up only after ep 4 anyway.Also it can be corny at times, though that is to be expected of 2000s anime, but be aware there is a spooky little girl who made me cringe most times she spoke. to follow and overwhelmed me a bit.

I will also voice out my opinion at the end of this review wich I will keep short.I have not read the novel and my review will not include any comparissons between the two.(Story 6/10)There has been a lot of strife between those who have watched solely the anime and those who have read the novel and also watche the anime version of it. Always arguing about the story (for the most part).So the story is basically about the Ushiromiya familly which...is so very wealthy coming to their private island were the head of the familly lives to discuss the inheritance. However on their first day there the head of the familly (Ushiromiya Kinzo) is found murdered. As they suspect eachother about the murder there are even more unexplainable murders happening.So here comes the main male character Ushiromiya Battler (or Buttler to some) trying to explain the murders when the witch named Beatrice arrives and says that she killed them with magic. So to sum up they end up in a deadly game of wits, in which Battler tries to prove that the murders were commited by human means and Beatrice tries to make him admit that they were commited by using magic. If Battler wins they can all return safely however if Beatrice wins they will all die.To the point now, as a plot it had a lot of potential and it also sounds awesome, right? However there are major flaws and unexplained phenomena and certain cliffhangers that could have made the anime a whole lot better if corrected. As you can imagine there are a lot of murder scenes and that includes a lot of gore. Unfortunately the camera focuses more on the deaths than on the reaction of the witnesses (or those who found the bodies). Even though I said that I enjoyed the plot although I certainly wouldn't mind if they had paid more attention to it.(Art 7/10)The art is pretty amazing. There are some faults at certain scenes but that's about it. The characers look cool and all that.. However all or if not all then most of the female characters have a huge cleavage which kinda runs it because although they look good and all it means there is fanservice, which kinda ruins the whole mystery-horror-psychological atmosphere.(Sound 8/10)There are some very very nice songs and themes in it and the only reason that the anime doesn't get a 10 rating from the sound aspect is that the music is often misplaced. Many good themes are placed at the wrong time and vise versa.(Character 6/10)Battler Ushiromiya: A young boy whose mother is (or was) a detective and is the main male protagonist of the story. He's passionate good-natured and cares a lot for others. He's also calm and is able to think rationally under pressure.Beatrice: The main female antagonist of the story. She is the witch that killed everyone and decides to play a game with Battler out of boredom with everyone's lives being at stake. She is mostly cruel, ruthless and also both seductive and confident. She hates losing and will do anything in order to win.Many say there are more protagonists than Battler and Beatrice but those are the main two for me.Although the characters start out nicely, they have a sudden change of hearts especially during the last few episodes. Even more of them Beatrice.(Enjoyment7/10)Even though there are major flaws and cliffhangers I certainly enjoyed the anime and it encouraged me to read the novel. Many people will say otherwise but do not be influenced too much..(Overall 7/10)You may find it lacking in certain sections and it is a good anime to watch if you're not a detail freak. If you're a begginer in watching anime you will enjoy this even more than I did. Then again it is a double-edged sword. If you've seen plenty of other series you'll start to notice flaws that may not even be that big of a deal. is so very wealthy coming to their private island were the head of the familly lives to discuss the inheritance.

It lacks any kind of direction in every possible aspect.There are numerous themes constantly fighting for center stage, every single one of them lacking the subtlety and thought necessary for such an ambitious endeavor to work. It\'s like watching a toddler try to jam together the pieces of five different puzzles. For one arc, the focus is entirely placed on ideas of greed and money\'s control over people. Yet another arc tries to explore how pain in one person breeds their cruelty to others. Umineko is incapable of choosing a...main theme and it results in a big pile of half-baked philosophies that don\'t fit together as seamlessly as they should.There are far too many characters, many of whom are wildly inconsistent in their characterization. This is a huge problem with the main villain, Beatrice, who will go from cruel witch to wise woman at the drop of a hat, with no explanation whatsoever. A great majority of the cast just feels like props to be killed again and again, with no heart. Once again, we see a problem with all of these characters battling for narrative control, each one sharing their motives and sob stories and such, only to be thrown aside again once it\'s time for somebody else\'s turn in the spotlight. It doesn\'t help that half of these characters are downright irritating, without a single redeeming trait.The last bit of icing on the inconsistency cake comes with the tone of the show. It\'s no secret that it\'s supposed to be a Gothic psychological horror, but certain details completely detract from whatever atmosphere Umineko has going for it. For instance, there is a scene that is supposed to be rather gruesome, where one character repeatedly kills two other characters in a variety of different ways. At one point, she decides to kill them by... crushing them with a giant cake! After seeing so many brutal murders and feeling genuinely immersed in the manic breakdown, this one silly insert feels out of place and takes you out of the moment. So many stupid, silly, anime-cliche things are thrown in out of the blue. Some other offenders are three magical sniper girls with animal ears and a lion-boy-ghost that makes a mockery of the relatively serious plot point that he is associated with.As far as animation goes, Umineko isn\'t quite as bad as Higurashi but it\'s still  ugly to look at. Even some of the character designs are ugly, if not utterly ridiculous. The music is decent - the opening song is absolutely gorgeous and probably one of the best things about this anime.The ending is just plain awful. The one main story line isn\'t even resolved! In fact, absolutely nothing is resolved! We\'re given plenty of answers for questions we never even asked, while our actual questions are just ignored, as if entire scenes didn\'t even happen. I was debating on how I felt on Umineko while watching it, but the ending solidified my negative opinions toward it.Don\'t get me wrong; Umineko is not a hundred percent terrible. The logic games between Beatrice and Battler make for solid entertainment, and when the tone of the show is not being screwed up, it actually nails the isolated, Gothic atmosphere. The magic in this universe is quite fascinating, if not confusing. Some arcs are better than others: they range from brilliant to absolutely stupid and everywhere in between.All in all, it\'s not something I would recommend. Being from the same writer and director as Higurashi, I figured Umineko would be a story of similar caliber. Sadly, it is not even close.

Though the ending was kind of annoying, I found that it did offer up some good plot and story when it came to the main portion of the story.Starting off with the bad. Umineko didn't really end, it left with an uncomplete ending that ends halfway through the game series. This makes less sense then it would have for Higurashi, Ryukishi07's other famous work, because Umineko is more straight forward than Higurashi was as a game series. I have to say that that's where the story was lacking, other than that, it was a...very good adaptation of the original Umineko game franchise up until the 4th game.The good things do far out number the bad things though. When it comes to character development, you have all these family members that are all wanting control over the family's inheritance and mansion. A couple are in it for financial gain, one of them wants to gain the acceptance of her father, and the other just wants to screw over the rest of the family. When it comes down to actual character development, the series takes on the development of Rosa and Eva as two very close sisters, but at the same time hating each other. This is all without spoiling anything in the series, I can promise you that. Then you have the Youth in the family who just want their parents to get along and stop fighting over the inheritance. Later on you even get character development for characters that were really only supporting characters for the first part of the series. Moving on to the story, I wouldn't expect less from Ryukishi07, he really takes certain times to blow your mind in this series and create characters that you can just despise while telling a story, the story was awesome. I love Ryukishi's art style in anime so that was a highlight for me and the soundtrack was just amazing. I have to say that I really enjoyed watching this series.Final Verdict:You should give it a chance and don't let the ending bother you too much. very good adaptation of the original Umineko game franchise up until the 4th game.The good things do far out number the bad things though.

Yes I do think the anime is less good.Note: less good, not awful.Having watched Ryukishi07's previous series, Higurashi, I started watching Umineko with high expectations... and it met them, kinda. Not the whole way, not by any means, but while watching it, I experienced one of my favourite feelings while watching a show: a desire to watch it all, and understand everything.Unfortunately, it does fall short on the explaining part, and by 'fall short' I mean doesn't make anything clear. Again, drawing a comparison to the VN, the novel explained everything that...needed explaining, leaving you to work out the rest as you saw fit. After watching the anime, you're left wondering 'So this guy is trying to disprove witches... by arguing with a witch?'It was an enjoyable ride, but afterwards, you were left wondering what the hell just happened.Another problem was that the anime tried to squeeze the plot of a vn which takes several hours per story arc to read, into about 10 hours. Unfortunately, this means a lot is missing, and I mean a lot.In and of itself, the anime a decent, a good watch, and worth spending the time watching... but you could spend that time reading the first story arc in its original format, and be far better rewarded. Given it's necessary restrictions, it's not bad, could have been better, but did all right.But I, as many fans, feel sad at the thought of what it could have been. needed explaining, leaving you to work out the rest as you saw fit.

"", 'Well, the whole concept of this anime sounds great, the battle between logic and magic is really interesting idea, so the description of this anime sounded rather promising.But the realization... it\'s rather hard to explain my point of view without making any spoilers, but I\'ll try. I expected to see a good detective story with the interesting puzzles and solutions, and what have I got? There is no logic in battle between Butler and Beatrice. Ho many times he had solved Beatrice\'s puzzles? almost not once untill the last episode, and even then his solution was too suddenly. He just told her about every puzzle...in every world, but he didnt share any of his thoughts with the viewer. It looks like the authors didnt wanted to think, HOW could the main hero solve this puzzles, they just told him the solution. And all the rest time we can see only his mood swings between ""ok, Beatrice, give me some more time and i\'ll beat ya"" and ""I have ruined everythig"" and this repeats for several times.I was rather close to drop this anime, and I only watched it to see the last episode, but even it worth not seeing. in every world, but he didnt share any of his thoughts with the viewer.

There seems to be a general consensus among Umineko fans (and 07th Expansion fans in general) that the Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime is an unpalatable bastardization of the original visual/sound novel format.  Not having played through the novels myself, I can\'t say if that\'s true or not, but I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by this series.The Umineko no Naku Koro ni anime (hereafter just ""Umineko"") does a couple of things very well.  The premise itself is a classic ""And Then There Were None"" motif with...a supernatural twist that is mostly a welcome addition.  The pacing is quite good; there is just enough action to keep things moving, and generally the dialogue doesn\'t bog the show down.  The soundtrack contributes greatly to the tension and suspense, and the allover mysterious atmosphere of the show and a number of the characters (particularly the witches) makes it easy to stay interested.  If you\'re watching for the first time, you will definitely be curious to see what happens next, provided you can stomach the violence.  (This series definitely holds one, if not several, contenders for the title of Anime\'s Craziest Death.)The vast majority of the characters are little more than character designs with names; they have simple motives (love, money, power), and simple connections to one another (family, lovers, etc.).  I\'m generally really turned-off by flat characters, but this works for Umineko as most of the people on Rokkenjima (as well as the witches\' ""furniture"") are basically pawns on a chessboard.  It\'s the game being played that is important, not the pieces on the board.The first three ""episodes"" (which are more like mini-arcs but are perhaps better thought of as rounds in a game) are fairly well put together and enticing.  This creates a non-linear story line, which was simultaneously intriguing and frustrating.  It adds multiple dimensions to the plot, offering alternative scenarios and sometimes exposing questionable motives or allegiances (again, this is definitely true of the witches, but also of Kinzo, Eva and Rosa).  On the other hand, multiple outcomes obscure the truth, which is part of the point, but makes for a sometimes irritating viewing experience.Things start to fall apart during the final round, though, as the story diverts in a new direction.  Without revealing any spoilers, I\'ll say that a number of new characters are inserted in the final few episodes, right as the climax begins to build, and diverts the story away from Battler\'s struggle with Beatrice and the murders occurring on Rokkenjima.  As a result, there is very little worthwhile buildup to the final confrontation, which ended up being immensely anti-climactic.  These episodes seem to bear the message that magic is what you make of it, but this is extremely muddled with the utter confusion created by the new characters and their interactions.  Aside from offering some redemption for Maria, the final round of the game felt woefully incomplete to me, and be warned, the ending is far from conclusive or satisfying.In short, I liked this series for its intriguing premise and found it thought-provoking and interesting.  I did not like the mess of loose plot ends left at the conclusion and the confusing and arguably pointless side quest during the final act.  If you are looking for a series with soulful characters, an unambiguous plot with a clear delineation between good and evil, a conclusive outcome, and little to no gruesome deaths or violence, I\'d suggest you pass on this.  Despite this, I certainly don\'t feel that this series is guilty of being the pernicious garbage I\'d come to expect from its reputation.

Most anime it's written in black and white and easy peasy to follow. But Umineko challenges you to think, become a part of this Battler/Beatrice game. See is Battler right, see if Beatrice right. Are they both right? Or is one completely wrong.It is a mind anime to me. I payed a lot of attention, remembering little details from everywhere. It made much more sense when you pay attention and think yourself.Beatrice tells Battler that only stuff she did is possible by magic....Battler tries to disprove her theory. Maria, the 9 year old girl who idolizes Beatrice, gets frustrated at her family who wave off Beatrice as a figment of her imagination.Like I said, it makes you think. Who's dead? Who's alive?The characters are based off the Higurashi characters a little but the story line and characters couldn't be more different.Umineko is not a follow-up to Higurashi, it is a different anime all together. It is as gorey, if not more, than Higurashi but it is a fantastic anime.People who are unable to follow it have not payed a lot of attention. Before starting this anime, I knew I had to pay a lot of attention. I hung onto every word each character said instead of just listening to what happens.I adored this anime for the reasons it made me think, a very good story line and the art work is fantastic.Not many people will agree with what I said, but I think this anime is fantastic.

May be that is why I am here.I, as a sorcerer of theatergoing, demand blood. In my other capacities I demand other things....I will review and analyze the anime together with visual novels without making comparison between two.This is a very unconventional show, that makes you not only think outside of the box, but even outside of the box in which the original box is located. If such stretches of intellect are too hard for you, you should probably turn back now while you still can, before I started turning chessboard around and twisting it allover the place.For the rest of you, you are in for a rare treat. You will hardly find anything this deep elsewhere, even if you search for it eternally like Bern for the fragments.On the surface it is a mystery novel, just like Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. However this one does not have a detective who will give you a straightforward answer of who killed them. There are just hits, many. However you have to figure it out yourself.I will rule out the so called ShKanonTrice theory from VN Ep7 since it is an obvious lie. Even short story about maid at the very beginning of episode 7 hints to that conclusion. Decalogue of Knox and 20 wedges also forbid the culprit to be a servant.The tea party at the end of ep 7 tells you what really happened.Despite many fans writing plenty of their own theories on culprit, as far as I seen and remember none of them manage to arrive to this rather obvious answer: Eva.You can figure it out right after the first twilight in the first episode. After 6 people were just killed most of those who remained are concerned about safety as they try to pull out guns to defend themselves. Even if you are seasoned killer you would be concerned if something like 6 simultaneous murders happened on the cut-off island with just 18 people on it.There was just one person who was more concerned with not being blamed for the whole thing then with her own safety. Cousins talked to her in the parlor. I mean how much more obvious you need this game to spell this out for you.Most importantly, Eva pretty much the only one who had motivation to do it. \'Why do it\' thing. Krauss and Natsuhi already have control of the island, there was no reason for them to do anything since they already have everything and nothing to gain from mass murder. Rudolf and Rosa did not want to be a successor ot Kinzo. They just needed money. Kyrie is also not too aggressive or ambitious to pull anything on her own. Same with Natsuhi, even if she despised Krauss she did not have enough guts or ability to slaughter everyone. Both she and Kyrie are outsiders in the family so it would be double hard for them to pull anything out without husbands support.So Krauss could easily cut a deal that all of them would be happy with. Kraus will be the successor and keep the island, money will be split. Everyone would be happy, except for Eva.Eva always wanted to supplant Krauss and be named successor. She married early, got Hideyoshi into Ushiromia family rather than join his family, the way women normally should do. She gave birth to George earlier than Natsuhi to Jessika and put a lot of effort into raising him a worthy successor. Finally she trained heavily in marital arts, not a suitable hobby for a woman tbh. All to no effect. Krauss was still successor.So when Kinzo died, gold was found everyone else agreed to the final settlement that put final nail int the coffin of Eva\'s mad dream, she snapped, gone berserk and killed them all. Because that was the only way for her to be Kinzo\'s only successor. She succeeded, see episode 4 of VN to see how it all went. How no one believed she did not killed them, because she did.This is the only theory that holds water, other then the one where it was done by Battler, Ryukishi07 or the one where aliens from Trafalmador kidnapped them all to display them in their zoo together with protagonist of Slaughterhouse 5 and that fashion model.That leads us to the second truth of this sojourn. There is no truth at all. Like a Schrodinger cat: you cannot know if it is dead or alive without opening the box. Since island is destroyed by explosion and all the evidence is buried by this explosion there is no longer any way to find out what happened there. From there on any theory is as good as any other and nothing can ever be proven. Red truth is impossible. Period.Then the third truth. If author of the story does not give the answer, and sometimes even if he gives, then the story ends up just like a Schrodinger cat\'s box, there will never be an answer. There can only be a subjective truth from there on, or an infinite multitude of truths if you look at it from a different angle. Ryukishi07 made just that and now enjoys looking at how you all try to discern what a truth is when there is no one single truth here at all.By now it is no longer a story but a gameboard to flex logical muscles, just like these debates between Beato and Battler in metaworld. Any story can become something like that but this is probably the first time when someone done it deliberately, and then illustrated the whole process within the same story.In fact the story even depicts the whole process: characters in the Meta World take turns in making up their own stories in Chiru. Episode 5 told by Lambda, 7 by Bern, 6 and 8 by Battler. All of them just make up their own stuff, often not compliant with original story.Forth truth: the whole thing is a made up story and did not happen at all. No one killed anyone and Ryukishi07 just made the whole thing up. Then he is the only culprit. He also got away with so many murders. That makes him a golden which or a golden sorcerer. That also leads us to the question of Ryukishi07 gender. After all how you can reasonably expect someone who writes this king of out of the box stories and uses pseudonym Ryukishi07 to be 100% honest about own identity.Epilogue. There is one other kind of story in there. Beato\'s love story. Beato\'s long and futile attempts to make Battler love her. She even asked Virgilia for help. May be it is a metaphor of a story trying to appeal to reader. Or, may be, an author hope for someone to understand and love him/her. Beato even let him destroy herself in the end of episode 4, to satisfy him, his views. She is very accommodating in that regard.I do wonder if answering \'What do I think of Beato after it all\' question from a personal perspective matters in any way in particular or not. What such an answer could lead to... I can somehow tell that author wants to know but they should not be expecting a simple answer for something like thaaaaat from someone like me. Whahahaha...Final Epilogue. Somehow I can relate to this family a lot more than to other families in fiction, not in the good way though. Does that mean that my relatives are as upper class as Ushiromiyas or that they are as insane and cruel as them. Probably both. I wonder if this family is relatable for anyone else.

I wonder if this family is relatable for anyone else.', ""This review of Umineko no Naku Koro ni is based solely on its anime and nothing else. I will not be comparing it to anything else and will judge it solely on what the anime showcased.Story(5/10)Umineko no Naku Koro ni's story is rather difficult to understand because of how it is told. The anime follows Battler as he battles the Golden Witch Beatrice to try and save his family. This story could have worked if not for 3 main problems. The 1st problem in this anime is that the main plot quickly becomes repetitive to the point where you are just hoping to see...someone get killed in a cool way and no longer care about the actual story. The 2nd problem is the mystery side to the story where it try's to get you to solve its puzzles but doesn't give you all the necessary pieces. 3rd and the largest of all the issues is the fact that the anime itself is unfinished. Its ending hardly explains any of the problems showcased throughout the story and instead tells you to simply guess what might've happened in the show.Art(8/10)I actually enjoyed the art style of the show. Not only were the characters designs are great and fit each character quite well to their personality but the way people moments of insanity are done greatly compliment the anime and its music. The gore and magic in the anime is also done very well and showcase the shows brutality brilliantly.Sound(9/10)The best part of this whole show is definitely the soundtrack which has some great mood music. But the best part is definently the OP and ED which are both done beautifully showcasing both the animation as well as the song to its fullest potiental.Character(6/10)Another flaw within the anime is its flimsy characters. Whereas normally you care when a character is savagely murdered in this you are typically happy when most of them die. The adults are all made out to be heartless creatures who only care about their own greed. However during many of their death they attempt to showcase some sense of humanity which is always just annoying, because by the time they do you honestly don't care. The servants and demons/witches are actually interesting and needed to be explained in much greater detail. The grandchildren or our main characters have strong personalities but this also gets annoying due to the story. Beatrice is so messed up and when I say this I mean her character is flawed (notice how I focus on her while I put everyone else in groups) she starts off as complete antagonist performing grizzly crimes and simply laughing at the murders (her laugh is  so annoying to where its more evil than her crimes). However her greatest flaw is the ending where she commits a giant 180 and is temporarily nice for no apparent reason... I wont even go on.Overall(7/10)Mystery animes typically follow straight and linear paths giving clues to the audience of how certain murders or crimes take place to show how the culprit committed the crime and is then caught as is usually done this allows us the viewer to feel like we are part of the anime...  this doesn't do that. Even during few times that it does the show will completely ruin an intense mood by throwing flashbacks and backstory into the show completely ruining the mystery aspect of the anime. This causes the viewer to be completely disconnected from the show and not feel attached to these characters in any way. Its becomes repetitive very quickly and stops being an mystery anime completely. The few redeeming factors would probably be its animation and music which actually compliment the show quite well.This anime needed another 25 episodes to be able to actually be completed as it is now the anime is literally incomplete causing everything story related to suffer, until such a thing happens there are too many plotholes to actually enjoy the anime. someone get killed in a cool way and no longer care about the actual story. The 2nd problem is the mystery side to the story where it try's to get you to solve its puzzles but doesn't give you all the necessary pieces. 3rd and the largest of all the issues is the fact that the anime itself is unfinished. Its ending hardly explains any of the problems showcased throughout the story and instead tells you to simply guess what might've happened in the show.Art(8/10)I actually enjoyed the art style of the show. Not only were the characters designs are great and fit each character quite well to their personality but the way people moments of insanity are done greatly compliment the anime and its music. The gore and magic in the anime is also done very well and showcase the shows brutality brilliantly.Sound(9/10)The best part of this whole show is definitely the soundtrack which has some great mood music. But the best part is definently the OP and ED which are both done beautifully showcasing both the animation as well as the song to its fullest potiental.Character(6/10)Another flaw within the anime is its flimsy characters. Whereas normally you care when a character is savagely murdered in this you are typically happy when most of them die. The adults are all made out to be heartless creatures who only care about their own greed. However during many of their death they attempt to showcase some sense of humanity which is always just annoying, because by the time they do you honestly don't care. The servants and demons/witches are actually interesting and needed to be explained in much greater detail. The grandchildren or our main characters have strong personalities but this also gets annoying due to the story. Beatrice is so messed up and when I say this I mean her character is flawed (notice how I focus on her while I put everyone else in groups) she starts off as complete antagonist performing grizzly crimes and simply laughing at the murders (her laugh is  so annoying to where its more evil than her crimes). However her greatest flaw is the ending where she commits a giant 180 and is temporarily nice for no apparent reason...

It does NOT get better.I gave Umineko a fair chance, delving at least 14 episodes deep in HOPES that the story would get interesting, or some characters would be fleshed out.If you're coming from Higurashi then don't. After watching and being forced to search up plot many times for this garbage, it has only damaged it's predecessor in my mind. It's really depressing to see what they have done with the series.STORY - 2Umineko takes place primarily within a mansion, and you'd think that would open up some cool opportunities for murder mystery and character interactions.Nope....I see no character development, except for maybe a little in the protagonist.

I searched it up and it's STILL bullshit.ART - 6Art is kind of weird and not the best, but honestly it's tolerable and you forget about it in lieu of the awful everything else.SOUND - 6I like the orchestra in a lot of the themes, other than that it's bland.CHARACTER - 4There's little to no apparent character arcs from my extended viewing.There are a few moments where you think people begin to stand out, but all hope is quickly crushed by the awful story which immediately dismisses it with random unexplainable bullshit.Everyone is one-dimensional with their personality. Once you've seen how they act, it does not change. Despite the apparent adversity, they do not seem to emotionally develop like real humans.ENJOYMENT - 4This should probably be lower, but I viewed it with a friend and so I won't lie that some of the bullshit they tried to pass off as story got me laughing in tears. It's so bad that laughing was my coping mechanism.OVERALL - 4Please just skip out on Umineko. You're not missing out on anything, I promise.

Knowing this I can start the review.Does magic exist? You won\'t even know anyway from watching this.This is what I would call the Demo edition of Umineko; You don\'t need to spend money ( not much if you getting it legally ) and you don\'t even need to spend 100+ hours on it. This is what you get for how little effort you decide to put into it; an unfinished/resolved mystery with plot points...that make 0 sense, very little character development and mediocre fight scenes.Story: The idea of the story is interesting however the anime executes this rather poorly. When I was watching this I felt like it was like splicing "" clips "", kind of like if you imagined making a show but remove all the ""unnecessary "" bits, you just get a show that jumps quickly to the next scene without any transitioning and some moments they skip so far that what they mention has you confused as to how, when and why they even got there.Another issue is with Battlers reasoning\'s, the point of the show focuses on the battle between Beatrice who is trying to convince Battler that witches/magic exists ( which she call it ""surrendering"" ) vs Battler who is using rather stupid outrageous reasons to deny the existence of this. Battler\'s meant to sound smart but since the story is limited, Battler comes out as being an absolute idiot who can just say something like "" oh they ate tiny bombs and that\'s how their stomachs were destroyed "" and the witch can only just laugh at it and accept it without arguing back. You get the point.Art: The arts alright, it looks like there\'s a light glare constantly shone on the screen which can get rather annoying but it\'s not too bad. Most the efforts on the gore and some of the magic flash shows.Sound: Sounds literally the only good part of the anime, it\'s not as loud and High quality as the VNs tracks but the tracks are good. As every person ever who has heard the Opening, it\'s impossible to skip that amazing opening, can\'t get sick of hearing it for 25eps straight. Oh, the voices are alright too.Character: Lack of character development is a big issue in this, really the only ones who get decent development is  Maria, heck the MC Battler and Beatrice actually barely got any development. Every other character probably got like the basic background knowledge and that\'s it.Enjoyment: I\'ll be perfectly honest, I only went through those 26eps only cause I have read the VN and was interested in seeing what its like animated. That\'s basically the only thing that kept my enjoyment there.Outside VN experience i\'d say ep 1 and 2 are the hardest to endure, ep 3 and 4 does pick up the enjoyment a little... ehh if you into Battler/Beatrices rivalry.Overall: It\'s straight up a bad adaptation, you basically just watch this than if you curious you will go to Manga/VN for further information. This only covers half of Umineko so yes you will feel bad after watching this and either crave for more or just give up. After all this is what you get for not spending the effort in reading 100+ hours of text. that make 0 sense, very little character development and mediocre fight scenes.Story: The idea of the story is interesting however the anime executes this rather poorly.

The art is meh, it has its up and down. The design is decent, but the animation quality is uneven.

However, after seeing some mixed reviews about the anime, I didn\'t know if I wanted to watch it. Well, I did. So, this short review will primarily be for those who don\'t want too many spoilers about the plot, but still want something to quickly describe the overall experience.The style of story reminds me of Deathnote, in that there is lots of talking and reasoning/mystery solving. However, if you liked Deathnote because of its plot\'s strongly analytical nature, you will be horrified upon watching this anime. I don\'t...want to say too much, but let\'s just say it\'s no Sherlock Holmes (or Deathnote P:). In this respect, Umineko no Naku Koro ni is a big, smelly turd of an anime.Now, IF (a very big if). IF you can look past a plot that doesn\'t make any sense at times, you will find a excitingly paced story that is always changing. Yet somehow, it resembles the original Higurashi\'s style as well. Everything else about the anime is pretty decent borderline enjoyable.All in all, I don\'t regret seeing this anime. It wasn\'t the most impressive, but it wasn\'t too bad (except some elements of the story) either. If you liked Higurashi, and can look past some major story flaws in this one, there\'s a chance you might like this*. But just keep in mind that the two anime are not of the same caliber.* I would watch up to episode 6 or so before deciding whether or not to continue. want to say too much, but let\'s just say it\'s no Sherlock Holmes (or Deathnote P:).

It was well paced, had good characters, and offered genuine horror. I was excited to see When The Seagulls Cry as well, but it ended up being a little frustrating to watch.The time loop format of both shows make things complicated enough on their own, but When The Cicadas Cry kept the story itself simple. The characters were just trying to make it through the loop without dying. Seagulls, on the other hand has plenty of things that make the story more...complex than it needed to be. Battler and Beatrice (the two leads) are in a battle of wits to determine if the mass murder of the loop they are in could only have been accomplished by a witch. This sounds simple, but the list of loose ends and questions involving the premise is staggering. They don't explain much at all.Even so, the actual game between Battler and Beatrice is very interesting to watch. If that had been what the show was, it would have been much better. The problem is that things keep getting in the way of the show's best aspect. Both players try to quit at points, Beatrice starts to feel guilty about all her murders for no reason, the timeline jumps around and shows the future while a game is happening, and a whole new main character is introduced. So many things are introduced that don't seem worth the trouble.When The Cicadas Cry got strength from its simplicity, but When The Seagulls Cry is too convoluted to have the same impact.

Is it the horrendous crime that\'s committed? Is it the brilliant mind game between the detective and the criminal? Is it how charming and shocking the story\'s twist might be? Or is it the impactful ending that have you surprised? If you\'re looking for any of these I mentioned, turn your back now, it\'s not too late because Umineko no Naku Koro ni or When Seagulf cry portrayed none of those.DEEN is not a bad studio despite lots of people don\'t like its art style and the low-quality production values which many of their projects possess. I had...a great time with many DEEN\'s anime like Konosuba, The tales of Melodies/Memories and of course, When They Cry. When They Cry showed that DEEN is capable of handling a mystery. It was an interesting anime that keeps people guessing after every arcs. When They Cry accomplished that by creating a mysterious atmosphere surround all over the place along with strong and determine characters, every bits of mystery is revealed bit by bit so the viewers can join the journey and solve the case in its runtime though most of us failed. Sadly, I can\'t say the same about Umineko no Naku Koro ni.""Tomorrow, when the seagulf cry, we will be safe."" Well, they never cry but I do because of boredom. Umineko no Naku Koro ni is a mess of a story with no redeeming quality. It provided a mystery with no clue or whatever so we never follow along the story.

"", '*This is not a spoiler-free anime, as it is very hard to describe it without loss of generality.*Before watching this anime, I thought to myself: wow, another higurashi? must be pretty decent. And now I know that I was indeed very wrong.If it wasn\'t for my personality - I don\'t like leaving anime unfinished - I would have dropped this anime at the beginning of the second arc.So the story started off, like every other anime, setting up the environment and introducing the cast\'s relationships and importance to the plot. I would say, until the end of the first arc, it would\'ve passed as a...decent higurashi v.2. However, many things were vague as to why things happened the way they did in regards to the murders, so I continued to watch this anime, hoping that an explanation will come to give the audience a realization of what has happened.Onto that ""explanation"" that this anime tried to pull off:So there exists this witch named Beatrice that supposedly caused the murders, and she cannot be a full witch without everyone surrendering to her existence. And that is where the main character Battler, comes into challenge her because he denies it. At this point, the story gets good, as the mystery of the murders are supposedly cracked by Battler with intense logic and mind blowing but viable theories. Well, there ain\'t none of that in this anime until the final episode where he supposedly puts it all together from around episode 6 to 25, and literally sprouts bullshit that conveniently fits the pieces together.From episode to 6 to 25, it is painful to watch because of:- slow pacing- confusion- ""wtf"" moments - why does he/she have powers? Is he/she good or bad? What kind of punishment is this? Why is Maria watching a television episode of higurashi? (LOL)- random flashbacks to the past- conveniently trying to explain another bullshit created during the episodes.As for the art, nothing spectacular, but there are some ""gory"" scenes that aren\'t really gory but nasty in a way... I\'ll leave that up to you to decide if you really choose to watch this.One of the things that made me really dislike this anime was the characters.It lacked any kind of character development (one could argue that Beatrice changed over a few episodes, but she really didn\'t, or about the girl that looks like Rin from fate/zero - she becomes a main character for a few episodes).In addition, there were so many annoying characters, not because they act their roles badly, but because they had additional ""Modus Operandi"" (i.e. Maria\'s annoying ""UuuUuu"" and her laugh that scares you only at first but becomes overly tiring to look at, or Beatrice\'s laugh and her constant reminder to the audience that she is Beatrice, and the infamous ""flip da chessboard"")Simply,Uminkeo is a rip off Higurashi.I think the producer was trying to put all kinds of genre into one anime (magical girls, martial arts, crime, mystery, horror, suspense, romance, time travel ... etc) and it clearly didn\'t work.I would not recommend this anime to anyone, unless they specifically look for as MAL users put ""a train-wreck"" decent higurashi v.2.

The anime cannot be discussed without grasping at least a minuscule amount of knowledge regarding its predecessor: the Sound Novel. Usually, an adaptation falls short, disregarding what made the original special in the first place and replacing it with either too much...sound design or an alternate art style that conflicts with the intention of the original's. Sometimes, it goes a step further and removes so many fundamental elements of the story compiling it to a render of an anorexic husk. Umineko's adaptation assimilates into an anime format without even trying to recant what made the Sound Novel special - the story & characters.Umineko's adaptation moves at an almost supersonic speed through the Question Arcs, skipping literal hours of character interaction and story. In perspective, Part 1 of the Sound Novel took me just under 23 hours to complete. That simply ends at episode three, just an hour or so into the anime. There feels like a physical time-crunch to get production finished and an absentminded ignorance to the source material. That being said, there would be a lot of dialogue to inject into the anime making the series (if represented correctly) over 100 episodes in length. In other words, this series should have only contained Part 1 of the Sound Novel and not all four parts of the Question Arcs. It is a dreadfully rushed mess. Not to mention the Answer Arcs will never be put into anime format but that's simply for the reasons listed above.If you go blindly into this adaptation you'll be confused entirely and won't be able to appreciate the source material.

I won't dwell on other technical elements since I do not have enough knowledge on those, but for the story, the most unsatisfying part of Umineko is that the series literally ended with the plot only getting halfway. The first four arcs were adapted and these are four different sets of events shown with magic, but Battler needs to solve...it with a logical approach to deny Beato and the witches' existence. The intrigue was there along with the thrill, but the series literally left the viewers in the air when they didn't adapt the next four arcs or at least an anime original ending where Battler explains how the murders happened. (I just researched and found out that the other half is not yet completed at the time they made the anime, but they could have made another season for it, just like Higurashi's Kai, right?) I was left hanging and confused about all the mindfvckery of the first arcs, and if not for a YouTube video explaining all the murders and the true perpetrator, I might have lived my entire life thinking how the heck everything happened. As for the characters, my favorites were Battler, Kanon, and Shannon (oh well, this definitely hits different after knowing the resolution) and I also liked Kyrie, Natsuhi, Eva, Rosa, and Ange.

On one hand, I have the gift of hindsight and may not have experienced the same disappointment as those who watched the anime when it first aired, so I like to think of myself as slightly less biased. On the other hand, I did read the entire visual novel and thought it was one of the best literary experiences I have ever had. It\'s one of those works where I consider it to have changed me both as a person and as a writer from now on.With the anime, I found that the change in media may...have made it really hard for people to follow, especially for those who did not read the visual novel. Particularly the dialogue between Battler and Beatrice really suffered in this adaptation. While I sat at the edge of my seat trying to guess the truth behind the mystery while reading the visual novel, I really felt the mystery part of the story got lost in translation from one media to another.

This anime upon my rewatch was a disappointment.The story was passable for an adaption but they left out half of it stopping at Alliance meaning they left out End, Dawn, Requiem and Twilight which hold some of my favourite characters (Lion and Willard). Leaving out the plot...was not a good choice, especially when you leave out the answer arcs.

If you want my opinion on this, the VN is my second favourite ever VN and you should definitely read it. The anime is and has always been an incomplete adaptation and an inferior way to experience the series. And no, the manga is not an adequate way to experience the series.The Umineko Anime is infamous within the fanbase for its low quality to the point of being regarded with non-existence. Given that it's by the same team who made the fairly decent Higurashi anime, I've decided to give...this a watch to ascertain for myself why the anime is so derided by many and to see whether it's at all possible to make an anime out of Umineko at all.What may surprise most people, especially those who didn't watch it, is that Umineko follows its source material very closely, too closely in fact. Whereas Higurashi took a lot of liberties and concentrated on being an entertaining anime first, and a faithful adaptation later (to the point where R07 needed the Studio to make an anime original arc to supplement previously missing plot points). Umineko on the other hand follow too closely to the original novels, and several moments that worked brilliantly in VN form do not translate well onto TV. I don't envy the task the team has been given, seeing as at the time of airing of the anime, the Umineko VNs were far from completed (EP 5 was released around this time) and several key plot elements were either not established yet or are hard to foresee so early on. Some of the most memorable scenes are completely omitted, which reduces the enjoyability of the show considerably.To its credit, several plot points that would later come to fruition in the later novels were adapted in the anime. Beatrice's true identity for instance, as well as Battler's role as the detective. Knox's Decalogue for all 4 Episodes are preserved as is the original VN even before the existence of Knox was established in EP 5. I did say several, not all. The anime contains some deviations and some omissions, for length and pacing purposes. Some are understandable, others are baffling such as Battler actively engaging the painting at the end of EP 1, or leaving out that Maria's jaw was found alongside the bottles, alluding to the true nature of the Rokkenjima incident. Of course, the true culprits cannot be deduced from the first 4 Episodes and thus aren't given much prominence or foreshadowing in the anime adaptation, so I do forgive the anime for this.The episode previews were fun. They're funny and reminiscent of Higurashi Kai's joke episode previews. At the very least they were the best part of this anime.One more positive. The anime brought in an impressive voice cast for Umineko, which would later be incorporated into the PS3 remakes. While their performance in the anime can be spotty at times (Rosa in particular is very inconsistent and sounds like Koshimizu Ami doing her tomboy voice most of the time), I am still thankful that their performances improved considerably in the VN remakes (where Rosa's voice is so convincing it gave me trauma).There really isn't any more positives I can lay onto this. Even if you were a newcomer, you would find it difficult to enjoy the anime in its own right. Following the VN too closely means the pacing is all off. The anime moves too slowly compared to the nearly perfectly paced VN. The low budget didn't help either, most of the show looked positively ugly, especially by 2009's standards. Even Higurashi looked better than this 3 years prior. While I'm glad they included some of the VN tracks in this, their placement is questionable at best. Important scenes like Eva discovering the gold, Eva's coronation, George's duel, and Battler's duel are missing their respective tracks, making the scenes completely lifeless by comparison.Umineko is a poor adaptation but it isn't impossible to adapt Umineko into anime form. Watching this made me realize what can and cannot translate easily into the anime format, and some of the compromises they made (Blue Truths and Red Truths being literal flying words) are creative enough to skirt around the medium transition. Still, this anime is in incredibly poor form and you would be better served reading the actual VN. With the BGM turned to max of course. this a watch to ascertain for myself why the anime is so derided by many and to see whether it's at all possible to make an anime out of Umineko at all.What may surprise most people, especially those who didn't watch it, is that Umineko follows its source material very closely, too closely in fact.

The anime moves too slowly compared to the nearly perfectly paced VN. The low budget didn't help either, most of the show looked positively ugly, especially by 2009's standards. Even Higurashi looked better than this 3 years prior. While I'm glad they included some of the VN tracks in this, their placement is questionable at best. Important scenes like Eva discovering the gold, Eva's coronation, George's duel, and Battler's duel are missing their respective tracks, making the scenes completely lifeless by comparison.Umineko is a poor adaptation but it isn't impossible to adapt Umineko into anime form. Watching this made me realize what can and cannot translate easily into the anime format, and some of the compromises they made (Blue Truths and Red Truths being literal flying words) are creative enough to skirt around the medium transition. Still, this anime is in incredibly poor form and you would be better served reading the actual VN. With the BGM turned to max of course."", 'got good but not bad. that is the impression i got from this anime. the first couple of episodes got me intrigued and i started to get into it and i started to connect the pieces to the plot. but then BAM! somehow all the dead characters are talking about how they died and shit like its normal!!! i was sooo confused. i mean why r they alive again? i understand a plot twist and everything but this was like wanting the reader to run straight into a wall right when they start to get it. anyways, i continued to watch it a bit more...in case it started to explain what happened but that didnt happen fast enough so i dropped it. i was to confused to follow it but the first episodes were good. there was this whole mystery murders/ family issues vibe to it so it wasnt that bad. and the characters were interesting enough because you know some of them had their own skeletons in closet while others were a little crazy. overall it wasnt terrible but not amazing either. in case it started to explain what happened but that didnt happen fast enough so i dropped it. i was to confused to follow it but the first episodes were good. there was this whole mystery murders/ family issues vibe to it so it wasnt that bad. and the characters were interesting enough because you know some of them had their own skeletons in closet while others were a little crazy. overall it wasnt terrible but not amazing either.', 'to be honest i was not impressed. if anything i was actually left with a bitter feeling. i understood that there must be a deeper story and a much more interesting plot going on in the sound novel, but the anime was quite disappointing. the story is not very clear, there is not much  suspense or horror and the characters seem to have no background whatsoever. after higurashi my expectations where sky high but this one lacks something. maybe more episodes or more seasons would have allowed the plot to unravel in a much more comprehensible way and give the chance to the extra...characters who pop out seemingly from thin air all the time more depth. however i think it is a decent anime for new fans. characters who pop out seemingly from thin air all the time more depth. however i think it is a decent anime for new fans.', 'tl;dr: An anime that is literally just building up mysteries haphazardly without pushing towards solving any of them.Umineko no Naku Koro ni is a series based on a series of visual novels that is set in the same universe as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. A lot of reviews seem to involve comparisons between the anime and visual novel from those that are already fans of the visual novel and seem to dislike the anime as a bad adaptation. This will definitely not be one of those as I simply have not read the visual novel and thus literally can’t make such a comparison. I...will however have some brief comparisons to Higurashi, in that both series of visual novels as far as I can tell seem to follow the same structure, but at least in terms of the anime it worked much better in Higurashi than it did in Umineko.To put it simply for the sake of avoiding spoilers, ultimately this anime is about a logical battle between the protagonist Ushiromiya Battler and the antagonist Beatrice. Ushiromiya is an incredibly wealthy and powerful family with their own private island. They gather on that island for a family meeting where they are to discuss who will take over as the next head. However, a series of mysterious deaths occur, seemingly parts of a ritual at the end of which the witch Beatrice is summoned. However, Battler refused to acknowledge the existence of magic or witches. More mysterious deaths occur up until the climax of the ritual, but Battler still refuses to acknowledge the existence of witches, even when Beatrice appears before him.Apparently the ritual isn’t complete and Beatrice isn’t fully summoned until he does. Thus, Beatrice pulls Battler outside of the world, which is henceforth referred to as the gameboard, and causes it to loop back to before the ritual. I should note that Battler himself stays outside the gameboard, with a different Battler that has no knowledge of previous loop present on the gameboard in his place. The ritual repeats, though with a different scenario where different people die under different circumstances. Thus, the core conflict of the anime is mysterious deaths occurring and Battler having to explain how they could have occurred without the existence of witches or magic. This looping occurs a number of times with a different scenario to the deaths each time.This seems pretty contradictory from the get go. Why is someone in such fantastical circumstances as being pulled out of the world to watch over the world looping so strongly denying the existence of magic? I don’t think the anime ever explains the answer to this explicitly or implicitly, which can make things seem kind of confusing and dumb at first. Still, as it goes on, it becomes clear from context that it really doesn’t matter what Battler truly believes. Before he encountered any of the obviously supernatural phenomenon, he firmly refused to believe in witches or magic, and somehow he lucked into that disbelief being an obstacle to Beatrice. Thus, regardless of what the truth is, the victory condition for Battler, or at least a condition where he doesn’t lose, is to continue denying the existence of magic or witches.The premise gets even more complicated from there. While in the first arc Battler didn’t encounter any actual supernatural phenomenon until he was pulled outside of the gameboard, every subsequent arc has the deaths shown as occurring through supernatural phenomenon, such as with having demons teleport into locked rooms to kill people. But apparently, due to the rules of how magic works, the supernatural and realistic explanations exist simultaneously, in what is somewhat confusingly analogized to Schrodinger’s Cat. While what the viewer and Battler are shown is clearly supernatural, what matters is the circumstances at the end, and for each of those a realistic explanation also must exist. Showing these supernatural phenomenon and their results is the moves that Beatrice makes to attack Battler, and Battler counters those moves by substituting them realistic explanations.This brings me to my first fundamental issue with this anime. From what I understand, there is an actual solution to each of these mysteries that completely makes sense and is satisfying. But neither the viewer nor Battler are given enough information to determine it. I think to at least some degree the confusion this causes for the viewer is unintentional. There is no clear differentiation made between what falls under the realm of the supernatural and what doesn’t. Thus, it isn’t entirely clear what requirements the realistic explanation has to satisfy. Thus, someone watching with the intention of actually trying to figure out the solutions will not find such an experience pleasant because the anime seems to actively fight against people doing so.And ultimately, as far as the anime gets, the true answers to all the puzzles are never revealed. A satisfying explanation for the puzzles may exist, however as per the rules of the game Battler and Beatrice are playing Battler doesn’t actually have to find it. He just has to come up with some sort of explanation that works, no matter how ridiculous or how implausible it is. For example, for a locked room murder of three people he can explain it away as all three killing each other simultaneously or as one of them killing the other two and then accidentally killing themselves. These explanations are clearly dumb and if that’s what the actual solutions to the mysteries were that would make this entire franchise dumb, so I’m going to go out on a limb and considering all the praise it gets assume that that is not the case. But as far as the anime gets that’s the only explanations the viewer gets as that’s all Battler has to give.Why none of the puzzles are properly solved in this arc has to do with the structure of the original VN. How that was structured is that there were a series of question arcs that essentially just presented the mysteries, and a series of answer arcs that revealed the answers to the mysteries. Thus, these arcs don’t have the answers because the reveal of all of them in the answer arcs will flow better according to the narrative the writer came up with. This is also something that was done in Higurashi, so I’m certainly not doubting that such a structure can work. However, as previously mentioned, I think it worked a lot better in Higurashi’s anime than it did in this one. The first reason for that is that while the first season of Higurashi didn’t have all the answer arcs for it’s questions arcs, it did have some of them, so while everything certainly wasn’t resolved, there was at least some explanation for some things. The anime for Umineko is purely question arcs without any answer arcs so absolutely no explanation is properly provided, which is really unsatisfying.The second reason is the difference in genre. The first season of Higurashi was mainly a horror anime. Even if what’s going on doesn’t make all that much sense, the horror aspect can still work really well and in the case of Higurashi it absolutely did. Even without any answers, just as a horror anime it’s enjoyable to watch. However, Umineko is pure mystery, and unlike with horror which is much more journey oriented, the destination for mysteries is critical. A mystery story needs a satisfying explanation in order to work. Thus, for an anime relying solely on mystery, without a satisfying explanation for at least some of it’s mysteries the anime itself just doesn’t seem all that functional.The third reason is that Higurashi felt like it had more to it beyond the core plot. Higurashi had a good amount of comedy and slice of life that worked well in getting the viewers invested in the cast and circumstances surrounding them. Umineko has nothing close to that. We get a bit on a lot of characters, but not enough to get really invested in any of them. That may come down to there being a lot more character in Umineko compared to Higurashi, and Umineko also focusing on them more evenly as compared to Higurashi which focused on a key character each arc. The end result is that I found certain characters kind of cool or charismatic and was also able to empathize with certain characters to a degree, but the level of investment in the characters was still pretty low compared to where it would need to be for the story to matter to me because I cared about the characters involved.The same applies to the world building. There’s a lot of overarching mysteries regarding a lot of things with various hints dropped throughout that are pretty intriguing, but they’re left way too abstract, ambiguous, and hard to really get into. Compared to more down to earth concepts in Higurashi, like the town of Hinamizawa, its history, and the lore surrounding those, it’s a lot harder to get invested in discovering the truth behind the overarching plot. Ultimately, it’s quite possible that all this build up does lead somewhere worthwhile, and given how popular the franchise is I will give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that it does. However, as far as the anime goes, it’s just 26 episodes of build up things that are never used well, which results in the anime most of the time simply being pretty dull, badly paced, and not that enjoyable to watch.In terms of art and animation, I felt it was pretty great. The general sense of style to things was nice and I especially liked the character designs. There seem to be a lot of complaints regarding that, but I feel they’re mostly nitpicky and the production values overall were pretty solid. The soundtrack too I think fit well and had a couple really nice tracks for key moments. The OP is pretty great overall. The visuals change as the anime goes on in ways that feel they fit the anime really well. The audio has some Italian in it which I suppose fits the western opulence theme pretty well, and is otherwise pretty good music too. The ED was also decent enough. will however have some brief comparisons to Higurashi, in that both series of visual novels as far as I can tell seem to follow the same structure, but at least in terms of the anime it worked much better in Higurashi than it did in Umineko.To put it simply for the sake of avoiding spoilers, ultimately this anime is about a logical battle between the protagonist Ushiromiya Battler and the antagonist Beatrice.

The setup is pretty intriguing - 18 folks trapped on an island, getting offed one by one by a witch who claims to be doing the bidding of the head of the family. By the second episode, six are already pushing up daisies, and you\'re left wondering if it\'s the witch\'s spooky mojo or something else. Keeps you on your toes, you know?Animation-wise, it\'s solid, and the characters look sharp. Plus, the opening and ending tunes? Absolute bangers.But here\'s where things start to unravel....Once the first storyline wraps, the witch comes out of hiding, flaunting her magical powers. And then there\'s this dude, Battler, who\'s part of the family but refuses to buy into the whole supernatural shtick. Like, seriously? You\'re teleporting all over the place, witnessing demon summonings, and you\'re still playing the skeptic? It\'s a bit hard to swallow.See, the problem is they spoon-feed you the magic stuff without much explanation. Demons pop up, characters suddenly sprout powers - it\'s like they want you to believe in magic without earning it. And then they hit you with four different versions of the same story, which just feels like they\'re stuck in a rut, killing characters on repeat.Sure, the family dynamics and conversations are well-crafted, but this whole showdown between the witch and Battler feels like a hamster wheel of nonsense. You\'re left hanging till the very last episode for any real answers, which is beyond frustrating.In a nutshell, the series has a killer premise, slick animation, and some snappy dialogue. But it falls flat on its face with a story that goes nowhere fast, all while trying to act clever. It\'s like they\'ve got all the right ingredients but mixed them up in the wrong order. And trust me, that\'s a recipe for disappointment. Once the first storyline wraps, the witch comes out of hiding, flaunting her magical powers.

All Out!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31588/All_Out,"['With the rise in popularity of sports anime in the recent years, a lot of shows about different types of sports have been appearing on the last decade, from volleyball and swimming to ping-pong and ice skating. However, All Out!! is the first anime to deal with rugby, a rough sport which has been on the rise in Japan these last couple of years.Having grown up in a house with three brothers who play rugby and a father who played on his youth, I have a basic knowledge of this sport, which was what drew me towards this anime in the first place. And I\'m...glad i decided to check it out tbh, because it was an amazing watch.Story: 8/10Now, let me get one thing clear. The story isn\'t something extremely wild or out of the box that hasn\'t been seen before. You have two protagonists who join their high school\'s rugby team, and the teammates start interacting and becoming friends as they train to reach their ultimate goal: winning the Hanazono, the biggest high school rigby competition.Having said that, however, I have to admit that even though the plot isn\'t the most original, it was entertaining enough to keep me watching. The characters were likeable and the cast had good chemistry, which was a huge plus in my book. Also, the story does get really intense at times, just like a rugby match can get at certain points, and at times it gives you a breath by having the characters take a break from training (and using that time to delve into their backgrounds and develop them) so it doesn\'t get too intense.Character: 10/10In my opinion, the characters were one of the strongest points of the anime. The main reason why I think this is that they were the main reason why I kept coming back for more; if the characters were unlikeable, I probably would\'ve dropped this after like five episodes.While it looks like the protagonists are Gion and Iwashimizu, the truth is that All Out!! is an ensemble show; the anime also gives a lot of focus to Sekizan, Oharano and coach Komori, as well as the rest of their supporting cast. And it does have a really large supporting cast; yet it manages to balance them well and the character interaction are always interesting and fun to watch.I felt like the majority of the cast was pretty memorable and very enjoyable to watch. It was easy to root for Gion or Sekizan to win because they were just that likeable. And I was surprised with how it manages to develop their characters with only 25 episodes; not only with Gion, Mutsumi or Iwashimizu, but even supporting characters such as Ise, Kifune or Suwa get their time to shine as well… just like in rugby, where not only one player gets to shine, but all 15 of them get their moments of glory.Art & Animation: 9/10I personally think that the art can be the most subjective aspect of an anime. I found the art really cool, and beautifully animated; as usual, Madhouse does not disappoint in this aspect. The character designs seemed pretty unique, making it easy to identify which character was which by having certain characteristics that simply made it obvious; you have three blonde characters in Iwashimizu, Oharano and Ebumi, but it wasn\'t hard to remember who each one of them were despite their initial similarities.The most outstanding bits of animation that I want to point out, however, is when the action is happening. I was worried about how they were going to animate the rugby matches, but again I was pleasantly surprised; the animation of the matches was fantastic and really dynamic, which was needed for a game as dynamic as rugby.Sound: 10/10Let me just say this: the soundtrack for this show is AMAZING. It\'s mainly composed of rock songs that really fit the series, and when they play it in the background during rugby matches or training scenes (specially when they\'re about to start) it really gives you the sensation that you\'re feeling the same excitement that the characters are feeling when they\'re getting ready to go out there and give it their all.At the same time, there are some tracks that have a more soft and smooth vibe to them, and that play during less intense scenes. Those are just as memorable, specially the first ending… and while we\'re at it, the first opening is fantastic. The second one was good too imo, but the first opening, ""Flower"" by Lenny Code Fiction is thrilling; haven\'t heard such a fantastic op since SnK\'s ""Guren no Yumiya"".Overall: 10/10Now, I\'m the kind of gal who  mostly rates her animes out of the enjoyment that I get out of watching them. If it\'s boring or a chore to watch, it won\'t get a high score overall… and this was far from the case. It was enjoyable, and a really fun watch!Before I end, I just want to say that you don\'t need a background knowledge of rugby to watch this; because Gion is new to rugby, he serves as a way to introduce the sports and its\' many rules to the viewer, so you\'ll have characters such as Iwashimizu and Umeno teaching you a bit about the sport.So, to sum up… give this show a chance! Thank you for your time :) glad i decided to check it out tbh, because it was an amazing watch.Story: 8/10Now, let me get one thing clear.

Thank you for your time :)', 'Fall 2016 was meant to be a pretty stellar season for sports anime, and I for one was incredibly hyped for it. And I definitely wasn’t disappointed with it as a whole. The third season of Haikyuu!! proved to be just as good as the first two, and Yuri on Ice!!! made itself out to be an unexpectedly thrilling series. However, I can’t say the same about All Out!!. It was the Fall 2016 anime I was most looking forward to – after all, rugby is basically just men in tight shorts violently glomping each other. It should have been perfect. So what went wrong?...Well, everything about All Out!! can be summed up in one word: lazy.Madhouse has produced some stellar anime in the past (Death Note, One Punch Man, Parasyte), and I guess they used up all their effort creating them, leaving absolutely none left for what could have been a brilliant sports anime.Firstly, and most disappointingly, the animation is some of the shoddiest and least dynamic I’ve ever seen in any anime, let alone a sports anime, where movement and energy is a key factor. There is literally nothing going on in the majority of the scenes in any given episode, and this becomes most apparent in the match in episode 3 (or 4? It’s probably bad that I can’t remember…). The whole pitch seems to be covered up with this bright white fog of war, so the animators don’t have to animate anybody but the character(s) at the forefront of the scene. The scrums, one of the most exciting and homoerotic parts of rugby, are still frames with lines drawn on them to express movement. Even the ball looks bad, as somebody thought it was a good idea to animate it in CGI, making it look awkward and out of place next to the hand-drawn everything else. Everything about the animation is lazy, and makes the anime as a whole incredibly dull. I guess that’s why they made all the colours so saturated, to try and make up for it…The character designs also make me want to rip my eyes out. They looked pretty decent in the manga, nothing special but still fairly nice looking, but I guess this didn’t translate as well into the anime as everybody looks like a Dangan Ronpa reject. This would be (a bit more) fine if this anime wasn’t trying to be realistic. When have you ever seen a kid with hair in the shape of devil horns? The stupid hairstyles and face shapes only serve to try and differentiate the characters from each other, as none of them have any personality. Even the main characters, who should be walking stereotypes (does a comedy, shippable duo made up of a tall, experienced guy and a short, angry, more energetic and DETERMINED guy sound familiar..?), don’t even have enough character development to be stereotypes. All sports anime have essentially the same plot – underdog team wants to get to nationals and win, so the audience has to be kept entertained by the characters and their journey and development from losers to winners. All Out!! is unable to do that. There isn’t even enough shipping potential to make it watchable, and what potentially yaoi moments there are are so forced (eg. when the Robbie Rotten looking dude straddled the captain man and professed his love for something or other of his) that it’s just offputting.Other, more minor irritations of mine about this anime are the absolutely inappropriate and generic choices of background music (half of it sounds like it was ripped directly from a comedy ecchi, the other half is generic rock guitar), everyone’s eyelashes (they look like they have spiders on their eyes) and the skintight sports kits (seriously, clothes do not work like that. Another example of laziness). I’m only continuing to watch this anime to make my past self happy, my sweet, deluded past self who didn’t know how terrible this would be. It’s the definition of a disappointment.

It’s the definition of a disappointment.', 'All Out is a very mediocre anime and a bad sports anime.If you want to watch this because it\'s a sports anime, don\'t bother, but if Rugby is the only premise that is strong enough for you to keep watching, then go for it. That was why i initially started watching.All Out isn\'t your typical anime. In itself, it\'s rather mediocre. It has characters, animation, music and voice acting, but besides that, not a whole lot to write home about.The story is as generic you can get away with in a sports anime. The main character begins in high school and wants to join the...rugby team. He isn\'t very good at rugby and he is physically not very strong or tall, but through training he very slowly gets better.The composition of a normal sports anime starts with the main character playing against other teams in training matches, so he (and the viewer) can be taught the rules of the game, what roles there is on the team and who his new team members are and what they are like. The problem with All Out is that it jumps back and forth between in the composition and even skips some of it.There is no sense of progression of the story in All Out. They keep talking about how they want to go to Hanazono (which is where the high schools compete against each other in a tournament) and how they want to go ""all out"" but they didn\'t even reach the starting line. They don\'t play any qualification matches in order to get to Hanazono. They just keep playing training matches on an empty field, with no spectators apart from the 2 teams that are playing.Madhouse. The name alone has set a standard for the level of animation you can expect. Hunter x Hunter (2011), One Punch Man, Death Parade. All well-known shows with great animation and a fantastic sense of artistic direction. Seeing that Madhouse was making All Out was a reason in itself to watch it. (Spoiler, it wasn\'t..)What we got was a lot of still frames with speed lines dashing on either sides of the screen, few frames of animation with a zoom and a pan over to the person who was catching the spinning ball and a few panning shots that ends with someone stepping forward.Just look at the first opening if you don\'t know what i\'m talking about. A 20 second slow pan towards the sky with ""ALL OUT"" written in all capital letters.The soundtrack is very poor, meaning that there is very little variation. Music is the ultimate mood setter or mood killer, depending on how you use it. But in order to use it properly, you need a repertoire of music that can fit a wide range of moods and themes. All Out doesn\'t go ""all out"" on this.There is no memorable tracks in the show. That is not entirely true. There is maybe 2 or 3 memorable tracks, but they\'re only memorable because I\'ve heard them so many times throughout the series that it drives me crazy.There\'s the track that starts with the guitar, which is shortly after accompanied with the drums and then the bass. That music is used when they train (Which is 70% of the show). Then there\'s the track where the team gets the ball and the track for when they\'re goofing off and being high school kids.There is shockingly little variety.Remember when i talked about the composition of a typical sports anime? That also applies to the characters. There has to be a generic base level where a character can be build and then later be expanded upon with personality, so you have a unique and interesting character.Guess what All Out doesn\'t do.Some of the characters are purely identified by 2 things. How they look and what generic type of character they are.There\'s the aggressive guy with spiky hair, who thinks the entire team is holding him back. Then there\'s the ""kinda happy"" guy with hair shaped like 2 small horns. Then there\'s the manager who is a girl. There is also 3 really fat dudes, who has very similar personalities. So the only way to distinguish them was to do make their faces different.One has weird eyebrows, another has really floppy chins that constantly points upwards and then there\'s the third fat guy who has a headband and likes to verbally remind everyone that he really ate a lot and that he reeeeealy likes food a whooooooooooooooole lot!To give the show credit, there were some unexpected developments with the characters in a good way. One had an abusive brother, another one completely lost all motivation to continue playing rugby, but didn\'t want to quit in fear of letting his teammates down. But once those developments were brought up, they were dealt with in half an episode and then never mentioned again.I honestly don\'t know why i enjoyed the show as much as i did. I was considering dropping it but then episode 9 came along and changed my mind. Then after the hype had died down i was about to drop it one more time, but once again, a really good episode comes on and i just had to find out what happened next episode.There were something oddly interesting about the show. The second opening really grew on me. The coach really seemed like a monotone guy, but it turned out that he had a good and relatable reason to be their coach.Overall, the show grew on me. I was interested in seeing how far the boys could go and how they would develop throughout the story.Too bad that neither the character nor the story got that development. rugby team.

First of all, if you are not a fan of sports anime then you will probably not enjoy it, so be warned. I am, however, and All Out!! is ticking all the right boxes for me. In the first episode a short, feisty character, Gion, meets a tall, shy, character, Iwashimizu, and gets introduced to the world of rugby. As the story progresses Gion meets the rest of the team, amongst them the captain, Sekizan, who seems to take rugby very seriously and looks a little scary.The story is...not really original, as it seems to be a typical-newcomer-finds-out-about-a-sport-and-joins-a-team plot, but that's not why fans love sports anime: Fans love sports anime because there are awesome characters, great action and lots of humour. Judging by the first few episodes, All Out!! delivers on all three counts.If you don't know anything about rugby, don't worry. Like many other sports animes, in All Out!! you are introduced to rugby through the eyes of a newcomer (Gion) who has to learn all the rules, allowing the viewer to learn about rugby as well.I gave Characters and Enjoyment 9 for Great and Art got 8 for Very Good (especially if you like muscles). Story I rated 7 (not really original and a little predictable, especially if you have seen a lot of sports anime) but I enjoyed the Sound, especially all the heavy rock tracks so I rated it 8 for Very Good. Overall I rated All Out!! an 8, but I might change it to a 9 later, especially if the story gets any better once the big championship starts.Basically, so far All Out!! is everything you want a sports anime to be.

Hope you will enjoy it as much as I am!"", ""Putting the exaggerated art aside (even though it's charming in it's own way and grew on me), rather than playing and winning rugby matches, perhaps All Out is about personal development and team building (at this point, at least)... together, they want to get stronger.I do appreciate the fact that All Out doesn't put all focus on the main character, Gion, but also hints on backstories on individual team members and how that affects team dynamics and growth. Also, there's no one super strong team member, just players with their own strengths and own internal battles that game by game they seem to get...better at overcoming and show us what they've got.  It's a slow build up, but it's happening.One more thing I like is that Gion being new at playing rugby is just about clueless about everything... HOWEVER, for people who don't know the rules of rugby (like myself), Gion serves as that bridge since I can learn the game through his eyes. So far (ep. 9) he has improved, partially because he's the naturally wild and aggressive type but he still has ways to go and he knows this and therefore strives to get better. What I also like about Gion is how unexpectedly observant he is... not just about watching the game but how his teammates play and their mood as well.All Out is not perfect but it has this thing about it that makes you want to cheer for the team... so even if like me, you don't understand the rules, then perhaps you'll enjoy watching the characters grow and eventually you'll get into the game. Now, I know when they score a 'Try' lolMy one minor bone (which is laughable) is that they use a soundtrack that sounds like one regularly used in Naruto, so each time I hear it, my mind shifts to Naruto with shinobi training and flying through trees lolAnyway, give it a try! better at overcoming and show us what they've got.

I've been binge watching sports anime since last month. I have watched Eyeshield 21 before which kind of has the same game play but since that was football and this is rugby, there's a difference.I am really choosy with the animation but this one is good and unique. High school students with bulky muscles isn't that common but it kind of made the anime intense. They sometimes have awkward and gay poses which made me laugh my ass off but I did enjoy it.However, the anime had a lot of...flashbacks that I think didn't really matter. It makes most out of the episode instead of a game play with strong schools or training. I remember a flashback of a player from another team which kind of confused me because I didn't really care with the other players. Also, the protagonist wasn't given more focus than I am expecting. I was expecting more focus on Gion and how he evolves and learn more about Rugby. Well, that's actually what I am expecting from a sports anime - starting from the beginning when the protagonist joins the team, how he learns more about the sport, how he evolves and improves in playing.But, I managed to finish the anime and that only means one thing - I enjoyed it. I am looking forward to Season 2, if there's one which I probably think there will be but maybe aired for about a year or so.After saying all of that, I can say it deserves a chance to be recommended.

I was intimidatingly disappointed.Gion is established as the out-going, charismatic, yet humble on the account of his limits lead; approximately 8 ep in, the show is not about Gion anymore, but instead it\'s a backstory of the week on other members of the rugby club, some of which play no part in the story and whose names you can\'t recall towards the end of the series. Later, Gion takes center stage again for 2 episodes, but is quickly overlooked by the story, and I\'m not joking when I say that I think that, out...of the last 5 episodes, Gion probably didn\'t even get 20 minutes of screen-time.It starts off very well. There are some minor issues, like the obviously low budget this project had; it shows all the symptoms of being under-funded: shots that are overly long and drawn out to fill time; shaky-cam tricks to give the illusion of motion, as well motion and emphasis lines to elude to movement like mangas do...The other aspect I\'d consider a flaw is how every character - except Gion, the coach and a character with yellow eyes and a sweet tooh - is annyoingly effeminate. It doesn\'t really matter until it\'s just absurd and irritating.It\'s a real let-down, since at the beginning it seemed like it was going to be a particularly good story about overcoming limits, and what it meants to live a life going ""all out"".

This anime showed what everyone wanted to see in the trailer and the first 2 episodes, then took a nosedive so far that I have decided to stop watching it.Warning, there are slight spoilers. It doesn\'t have much impact to the story, but if you wish to watch the anime with 0 knowledge, I suggest you stop reading this now.Before I start ripping into it, I do want to point out that Rugby League is a 13...person sport, so that\'s a lot of characters to go through in 25 episodes if you chose to flesh out every character. Because the developers chose to make every team member important, I would have wished to see this as a shounen rather than a 25 episode seasonal anime.Why? Well, here is why:Story - 5The anime moves at a snails pace. It is incredibly slow. I understand that this is the point of developing a team and showing how they progressed as one, but the supposed main character, Gion, has had the most convenient shortcuts given to him. This is contradictory to what I said about the anime moving at a snails pace, but this is only because we don\'t get any actual noticeable improvement from our main protagonist, in order to save screen time for the other characters you don\'t care about. The only time I can remember Gion having any real improvement was when he learned how to tackle in the first 2 episodes. After that, he\'s stayed exactly where he was. There was another point where *Spoilers* he learns how to predict where people are going to move before he tackles, but that\'s very quickly forgotten when the other team easily maneuver anyway *Spoilers End*. I\'m sure he\'s going to become a menace to teams in the All Out!! universe later on, but the fact that it\'s been 17 episodes and I feel he\'s in the same place as he was in the start, I just don\'t want to commit my time to more convenient plot devices later on like ""I\'ve been practicing a lot off screen while you were talking about boring character No. 5""SPEAKING OF CONVENIENT PLOT DEVICES, Gion hired a Japan wide known Rugby coach to coach his team for... nothing? Yeah, right.Then on the latest episode (17), after everyone ran to the footy field, they were soaked in sweat and were out of breath, right? That\'s nothing for this 16 year old girl who was carrying dessert for all members of the team, and don\'t tell me that she took a taxi or some crap, because it would have taken 2 seconds of animation or explanation to clear that up, but why would they when that 2 seconds could go towards talking about the next guy you don\'t care about?Look, I respect the idea of fleshing out the entire team, but in the anime, I only really care about 5 characters at most.GionTree TrunksIwashimizuEbumiSekizanEveryone else just seems like a distraction, yet we\'re wasting what little screen time that we have for this 25 episode seasonal anime on them. We\'re slowing down the pace of the entire anime for the sake of worthless teammates, and because of that, we\'re forced to enforce convenient plot devices and shortcuts.As a teacher once told me ""Does your story revolve around the interesting characters of the story, and if not, why isn\'t it?"".Art is fine.

This is contradictory to what I said about the anime moving at a snails pace, but this is only because we don\'t get any actual noticeable improvement from our main protagonist, in order to save screen time for the other characters you don\'t care about. The only time I can remember Gion having any real improvement was when he learned how to tackle in the first 2 episodes. After that, he\'s stayed exactly where he was. There was another point where *Spoilers* he learns how to predict where people are going to move before he tackles, but that\'s very quickly forgotten when the other team easily maneuver anyway *Spoilers End*. I\'m sure he\'s going to become a menace to teams in the All Out!! universe later on, but the fact that it\'s been 17 episodes and I feel he\'s in the same place as he was in the start, I just don\'t want to commit my time to more convenient plot devices later on like ""I\'ve been practicing a lot off screen while you were talking about boring character No. 5""SPEAKING OF CONVENIENT PLOT DEVICES, Gion hired a Japan wide known Rugby coach to coach his team for... nothing? Yeah, right.Then on the latest episode (17), after everyone ran to the footy field, they were soaked in sweat and were out of breath, right? That\'s nothing for this 16 year old girl who was carrying dessert for all members of the team, and don\'t tell me that she took a taxi or some crap, because it would have taken 2 seconds of animation or explanation to clear that up, but why would they when that 2 seconds could go towards talking about the next guy you don\'t care about?Look, I respect the idea of fleshing out the entire team, but in the anime, I only really care about 5 characters at most.GionTree TrunksIwashimizuEbumiSekizanEveryone else just seems like a distraction, yet we\'re wasting what little screen time that we have for this 25 episode seasonal anime on them. We\'re slowing down the pace of the entire anime for the sake of worthless teammates, and because of that, we\'re forced to enforce convenient plot devices and shortcuts.As a teacher once told me ""Does your story revolve around the interesting characters of the story, and if not, why isn\'t it?"".Art is fine. Music is very repetitive. Characters are boring and I had no enjoyment from this.Maybe you\'ll enjoy it better than I did if you weren\'t spoiled with previous sports anime that I mentioned, but if you are spoiled, then I can\'t recommend this to you.', ""To me this show never gets boring. I enjoyed how the members of the Jinko's rugby team interact with one another and spend their time alone. I liked how each episode focuses on an issue with a few members of the team. However, I would like to see a bit more chaos with how each members arc conflicts and reinforces one another. Sure some of the issues may be already covered by other great sports anime and may seem as cliche's, but you have to watch this show while appreciating the effort that this show put into making these characters feel real based on how...their experiences shaped their perceptions. It makes you appreciate that these characters are not treating these issues as cliches but as obstacles they have never thought much of or dealt with before. You have to notice that they are utilizing whatever resources they have at hand to overcome them and that they have to put in effort to notice what resources they have at hand even when it doesn't seem obvious to anyone. Despite being disappointed with how the show was wrapped up in the last episode it was still a moving experience all the way till the end. their experiences shaped their perceptions.

I came away from this anime with a strong urge to play some Rugby!The animation (done by one of my faves Studio Madhouse) portrays Rugby surprisingly realistic for an anime. This isn’t Prince of Tennis with outlandish special moves that chracters shout out as they perform them. It’s gritty and brutal, just like the sport in real life. There’s no leveling up. There’s no underdog who becomes the star of the team through sheer determination. It’s just a group of guys, each with their strengths and weaknesses, learning and growing as a team and as individuals. The impacts of the players clashing on the field is palpable. The soundtrack is nothing amazing, but there are couple of tracks that will get your blood pumping every time they start. The only unrealistic aspect to the anime was the lack of injuries.The cast of characters is really well developed. The character who we assume would normally be the central protagonist doesn’t consume too much of the spotlight. Instead we get a look into the lives of at least a dozen of the team members, each with their own motivations and stumbling blocks to playing rugby. I think anyone who’s ever played in a school sport will be able to find a character they can closely relate to. The character designs are varied and the story’s pacing is such that the viewer is never overwhelmed or confused by the large cast, instead coming to appreciate characters who may have existed more in the background as the story progresses.This anime has some big gay energy, which is not my cup of tea, but it’s not overt...just very, very heavy handed subtext lol. And if this is something you enjoy in your anime, that’s totally fine too. awkwardly placed exposition.

The storyline was absolutely perfect, and I learned a little about rugby; the show demonstrated good sportsmanship, and it showed so much resilience between the characters and their goal to go to nationals!

Even the obese people had muscles!  I was really surprised by that, but it demonstrated what happens when you workout in only certain areas of your body; it's a good show.If you decide to watch this, I can assure you that you definitely will not regret it; it will get you so emotional and motivated about working on yourself and improving your lifestyle!

It kept with a common anime theme of overcoming insecurities and difficulties then yelling ""I got this!"" or ""I won\'t give up!"".  The...rugby playing scenes were also intense and fun to watch.  I always wanted to go train or hit something afterwards.As a woman, I also found it refreshing to have a break from busty girls.

You can argue the story doesn't progress far in terms of the show's goals but I would say it was a nice ride and if anything gains interest in the manga.To talk on the reviewed points. The story starts following somewhat of a main character, his interest of rugby... or if anything interest of tackling. The story then slowly expands on the members of the team instead of the small few and them bettering themselves and growing in foals and skills. A review made a clear point...to say you see the build up to the start of the challenges (in terms of competitions) but still a fulfilling story.The art took a few episodes to adjust to, the variety of buff builds was weird but eventually it grew on me. Animation in my opinion was good, but they really put a great deal of work into clashes and tackles.The characters, how to say. As mentioned before it starts focus on a small group mainly 4 or 5 characters but as episodes go on you see the focus on the team and you get to learn some things about the other members, while not fully fleshed out you get some nice side stories and interactions. Sure only a few characters are memorable by name mentioned alone, but you do feel you get to understand them all working together if not some of their personal lives, stories or hangups.I would say this show was very enjoyable. It starts a bit slow at first and not that interesting but as the team starts to train and develop themselves the show starts to take on a much more enjoyable feel and as you get more and more character development. I started the show with almost no knowledge of rugby and while I finished with some VERY basic knowledge of the rules I think this was still an enjoyable anime and worht watch to try a new sports anime, maybe not the most dedicated rugby fan might love it but I am sure all can find some value in it. to say you see the build up to the start of the challenges (in terms of competitions) but still a fulfilling story.The art took a few episodes to adjust to, the variety of buff builds was weird but eventually it grew on me.

But as I kept watching, I started to grow a fondness towards it.What makes this show so enjoyable is the dynamic characters that continuously surprise you.

He meets a slightly taller guy named Iwashimizu, who despite his immense height is a total pussy. Kenji has never been accepted into any sports clubs because of his lack of height. However, not unlike a certain Eyeshield 21 he finds out that rugby is a nice, peaceful and happy sport where even a smurf could have a meaningful position. The captain takes him into the club with open arms and gets tackled. Here is the basic setting where all sorts of hijinks develop from. Very basic, very cliche, but interesting...nonetheless since I have never heard about a rugby anime before. Kenji works as a main character because he\'s a novice and hardly anyone watching this actually plays rugby, and thus that sort of justifies the over-explaining of basic rules - so we know who\'s winning, who\'s losing and what is actually happening. I happen to love training montages and authors explaining actual tactics and techniques, so it\'s intriguing to see what Gion decides to do in different scenarios, e.g. tackling a bigger opponent, dealing with feints and so on.Characters:As there are many positions to play in rugby, there are many personalities in play as well. Gion being the hotheaded MC who miraculously turns the match around in one tackle / pass / piss or whatever, Iwashimizu being the suppressed genius that holds himself back, Sekizan being the great captain that isn\'t as great as thought after all, Ebumi being the slacker tough guy who actually practices the hardest etc. I don\'t mind cliches and tropes, but c\'mon now. The voice actors do a good job, though. With time, I also found myself somewhat immersed in their stories, despite them being quite unoriginal.Sound:I don\'t remember any of the soundtrack, so I guess nothing special in that regard. As I mentioned above, the voice actors do what they do well.Art:Otherwise I wouldn\'t have a problem with the art style since it brings a very dynamic and vivid feeling, but some of the guys look like they came straight outta Chernobyl. Like seriously, the brown haired jaw guy must have some facial bones broken or a growth disease. Another one has two devil horns for hair, Sekizan has toilet paper in his and Ebumi is Hiruma with hair wings. The last one wasn\'t even a joke, he literally says ""Ya-ha"" in some cases which was Hiruma\'s catchphrase originally.Also, I don\'t think the author knows how clothing works. The rugby players look like they just arrived from a wet t-shirt contest. I guess you could think that they sweat furiously, and the fabric sticks to their tight clothing or something like that.Enjoyment & overall:I feel a bit odd bashing the show while I watch the episodes from start to end without getting distracted. Even though I realize that this show is the type that grows on you, it still feels lacking at times. That\'s why I decided to give it a 6, also considering the studio\'s other releases and how they handled them far better.

But when it comes to everything else, its just a mixed bag of things. I don\'t know why this story is over 25 episodes when it barely goes anywhere. Every character on that friking rugby team has at least one annoying  character trait, and from episode one to the final episode, they do not change in a good way, they develop a little in that cliche feel good family way, but they still keep their annoying ass traits. Doesn\'t...help the fact that so many of them pop up here and there.What I was not digging at all was its sense of humor, this anime is one of those anime that thinks being super loud and annoying is funny, and we all know the best sport shows are just nothing but har har tharsdays. But meandering the story to be funny is  really a no go for me. The main character yells basically every sentence ever and is just overall not that enjoyable to watch.What little charm he had at first wore off later because throughout the rest of the season he was just a dumbass who barely did any of that crap in the opening sequence.This is a bit of a weird compliment to the show, but  it gets like super cringey at times, but its that type of cringe you see in real life. I have played sports before, and seeing a teammate who start to yell at another one thinking they are like some movie character while everyone else is just staring awkwardly is super uncomfortable, and this show captures that uncomfortable feeling many times.IT\'s not pulled off in a sincere way like Haikyuu because the characters suck ass.But credit where credit is due, some of the rugby games were very fun to watch and just super over the top at points.The coach was the best character in the show who had very compelling backstory and developed really well.Also the show decides to make things like domestic abuse a funny funny haha moment and i was just impressed on how terrible they handled a sensitive topic like that.The animation is good but the character designs are just straight up whack.Reminded me a lot of Eiken club where the design were so weird but I just couldn\'t stop looking away. For some reason the thighs, legs,and butts on these guys were so well drawn, and then you look at the ripped duct tape eyebrows on the main character and its like whiplash.

I feel like you would be making a mistake to just disregard it...""I Just finished ALL OUT !! and I genuinely have a lot to say about it. Also, even though I gave it a pretty high score I\'m going to try my best to be 100% critical about the Anime - and leave out any bias until the end.I loved the show.I have to admit the first thing that stuck out to me was the unique art style. You know that one very bough character thats in almost every show? Yea well imagine...all of those characters you can think of jammed into one anime. That\'ll give you an idea of the art style this Anime tends to lean on. It\'s also one of the first animes I\'ve personally seen who really takes emphasis on the ""Bara"" Genre.Moving onto the story.I can understand why some people might not like the anime solely because of the story.I will Admit ALL OUT !! lacks character development. Or... at least they don\'t execute it to the potential it deserves. While watching the anime in my opinion there are really only a few memorable characters. For example in the team there are about 15-20 players - Out of those 15-20 we really only get familiar with about 8 of the players. There were times where I forgot a few players were even on the team.I feel like the people working on the anime (or Manga) noticed this too, just maybe a little too late. Characters I didn\'t even know existed or I ""Saw that one time in that one episode"" were given a little story to maybe have the viewers know who they are. The only problem is... they weren\'t really done.... great. All of them were too short and maybe only focused on for one episode, sometimes not even that much.For example theres a character in the team that I\'m going to be honest I never knew he was there. I thought at first it was a new character we were going to be introduced to, only to find out hes been on the team all along. He ends up talking with one of the more known characters and its revealed that he has a lot of major insecurities about his position in the team. Rather than focusing more on who this guy is as a character it felt like the only reason he was there was to give a slight bit more information about the other more known character (due to the more known character connecting the lesser known characters problems with what he had to deal with with his brother.)Or even another example - Theres a character in the anime where hes given an entire episode about his backstory. And actually its a pretty deep one too, something in my opinion a lot of people would be interested in learning more about. Granted unlike some of the other characters he was actually given an entire episode. But even this ONE episode felt like it was just too short. It felt like as soon as we were about to get really into the drama it was cut short and the problem he was facing seemed to be ""fixed"" at the end of it.In a way you kind of feel cheated. Because your\'e given a character that has the potential to becoming your favorite and then the show doesn\'t even properly expand on him. This is done with a lot of the characters, and I understand people who don\'t want to watch it and eventually drop it midway. The only way to get a grasp of who at least 95% of the players on the team are, is if you completely watch it all the way to the end.It\'s hard because a lot of the side characters aren\'t really that distinguishable from each other. Especially when they have their hats/helmets on. Usually people can distinguish anime characters by their hair (if they don\'t have any other striking features about them) but when the hats are on you aren\'t even given that much, you\'re left trying to think harder on who\'s on the screen. There were times where I got lost and thought to myself ""Okay so he got the ball!... but... who is he again?""This is just my opinion but I feel like the people who were creating the anime didn\'t think it would be picked up for a second season therefore in the 25 episodes limit they were given, they tried making sure majority of the story was fit into that space. In which case some elements the story needed was cut short and squished together.Still don\'t let what I have just told you discourage you or make you turn away from watching this anime.Weirdly theres something about this show that keeps you interested. And I feel like it only works BECAUSE its a sports anime. If it was any other Action, Fantasy, Romance driven anime I think generally everyone would hate it. But because its a sports anime, theres a trait to the show that not a lot of animes have.When I was watching the show there wasnt an episode where I was bored or wanted to skip. Every episode was generally interesting in its own way. Though some side characters are hard to remember, the main characters (those 8 I talked about earlier) keep you grounded into wanting to see more of the show. This coming from a person who knew nothing about rugby before watching it - other than that its a sport that you\'re allowed to tackle someone in.I think it\'s because (and again this is just my opinion) this show drips with potential. It has the potential to be even greater than what it is. This is a show that a lot of people can hop onto if done just a smidge more differently.I feel like for some if you watch the entire anime - afterwords you\'ll be given an answer to what the show is kind of about. You\'ll be left with ""Ohhh, this is the type of show it is"" even if you don\'t know what direction its going in while watching it.This is where my bias starts to come in. I can agree universally it isnt ""The Best"" Anime out there - however it is a darn good one. It has its flaws but it isnt so prominent where its distracting. It kind of just goes with it\'s own flow - and I think thats exactly how you should watch this anime. See it\'s flow and then try to follow along with it.If you\'re not too.... ""critically moved"" when watching stuff - meaning for example: Theres a flaw within the show so that means I should just drop it. Or, Ehh this show sucks in this particular area so I guess I won\'t watch it anymore. If you stick with a show even when noticing a flaw in it - I think You\'ll like this Anime. And agree somewhat with me.I really do think everyone should give it a proper chance. Overall in its entirety it is a really good show. I feel like you would be making a mistake to just disregard it and move onto something else. all of those characters you can think of jammed into one anime.

For example in the team there are about 15-20 players - Out of those 15-20 we really only get familiar with about 8 of the players. There were times where I forgot a few players were even on the team.I feel like the people working on the anime (or Manga) noticed this too, just maybe a little too late. Characters I didn\'t even know existed or I ""Saw that one time in that one episode"" were given a little story to maybe have the viewers know who they are. The only problem is... they weren\'t really done.... great. All of them were too short and maybe only focused on for one episode, sometimes not even that much.For example theres a character in the team that I\'m going to be honest I never knew he was there. I thought at first it was a new character we were going to be introduced to, only to find out hes been on the team all along. He ends up talking with one of the more known characters and its revealed that he has a lot of major insecurities about his position in the team. Rather than focusing more on who this guy is as a character it felt like the only reason he was there was to give a slight bit more information about the other more known character (due to the more known character connecting the lesser known characters problems with what he had to deal with with his brother.)Or even another example - Theres a character in the anime where hes given an entire episode about his backstory. And actually its a pretty deep one too, something in my opinion a lot of people would be interested in learning more about. Granted unlike some of the other characters he was actually given an entire episode. But even this ONE episode felt like it was just too short. It felt like as soon as we were about to get really into the drama it was cut short and the problem he was facing seemed to be ""fixed"" at the end of it.In a way you kind of feel cheated. Because your\'e given a character that has the potential to becoming your favorite and then the show doesn\'t even properly expand on him. This is done with a lot of the characters, and I understand people who don\'t want to watch it and eventually drop it midway. The only way to get a grasp of who at least 95% of the players on the team are, is if you completely watch it all the way to the end.It\'s hard because a lot of the side characters aren\'t really that distinguishable from each other. Especially when they have their hats/helmets on. Usually people can distinguish anime characters by their hair (if they don\'t have any other striking features about them) but when the hats are on you aren\'t even given that much, you\'re left trying to think harder on who\'s on the screen. There were times where I got lost and thought to myself ""Okay so he got the ball!... but... who is he again?""This is just my opinion but I feel like the people who were creating the anime didn\'t think it would be picked up for a second season therefore in the 25 episodes limit they were given, they tried making sure majority of the story was fit into that space. In which case some elements the story needed was cut short and squished together.Still don\'t let what I have just told you discourage you or make you turn away from watching this anime.Weirdly theres something about this show that keeps you interested. And I feel like it only works BECAUSE its a sports anime. If it was any other Action, Fantasy, Romance driven anime I think generally everyone would hate it. But because its a sports anime, theres a trait to the show that not a lot of animes have.When I was watching the show there wasnt an episode where I was bored or wanted to skip. Every episode was generally interesting in its own way. Though some side characters are hard to remember, the main characters (those 8 I talked about earlier) keep you grounded into wanting to see more of the show. This coming from a person who knew nothing about rugby before watching it - other than that its a sport that you\'re allowed to tackle someone in.I think it\'s because (and again this is just my opinion) this show drips with potential. It has the potential to be even greater than what it is. This is a show that a lot of people can hop onto if done just a smidge more differently.I feel like for some if you watch the entire anime - afterwords you\'ll be given an answer to what the show is kind of about. You\'ll be left with ""Ohhh, this is the type of show it is"" even if you don\'t know what direction its going in while watching it.This is where my bias starts to come in. I can agree universally it isnt ""The Best"" Anime out there - however it is a darn good one. It has its flaws but it isnt so prominent where its distracting. It kind of just goes with it\'s own flow - and I think thats exactly how you should watch this anime. See it\'s flow and then try to follow along with it.If you\'re not too.... ""critically moved"" when watching stuff - meaning for example: Theres a flaw within the show so that means I should just drop it. Or, Ehh this show sucks in this particular area so I guess I won\'t watch it anymore. If you stick with a show even when noticing a flaw in it - I think You\'ll like this Anime. And agree somewhat with me.I really do think everyone should give it a proper chance. Overall in its entirety it is a really good show. I feel like you would be making a mistake to just disregard it and move onto something else.', 'When the narrative actually tells said viewer the story can’t be bothered to introduce the players on the team because of pacing issues, something is probably wrong.In the case of All Out, that was the first sign that this particular sports Anime wouldn’t tick all of the boxes of what makes a good sports Anime, but if I didn’t actually know this series came out as a Manga in 2012 and was later adapted to an Anime in 2016 I would have mistaken this for an older sports Anime series from the 90s or earlier – a time when the formula was still being figured...out.One of the things a good sports Anime does is create a narrative which even a person who’s not a hard-core fan of the sport can follow. In narratives where one of the focal characters has never played before, this is achieved by having the reader learn the rules as the player goes, but there are other ways of achieving this.This is often complimented by another thing a good sports Anime does and that is show the actual game play motion as realistically as possible so the viewer can follow what is actually going on, almost as if it were a real game, but in slow motion when needed. In fact, one of the joys of watching sports Anime is the action sequences and how well the artist can capture this.All Out fails majorly in both of these regards, but is the pacing issue just the Anime, or does it extend to the Manga as well? Major moments end up skipped over, almost as if things felt cut from the original work. On the other hand, this sports series utilizes an older style for the characters which over exaggerates muscle structure to the point said style seems like the main focus if not the selling point.Another thing a good sports Anime has is well rounded characters. What sets each sports Anime apart lies in the characters and how the narrative unfolds from the way the characters interact. On top of this, well rounded characters add to the team dynamic and how the characters work together both on and off the court.The characters for All Out are unfortunately all over the place.

With a complex web of character relationships across a large cast, anime-fied take on tactics (actually more enjoyable when you don\'t know the sport, and in this case, I didn\'t know rugby), and ability to vicariously live the simple up and down emotions of winning and losing, the basic hallmarks of a sports anime is an easy well-worn track for All Out!! to follow. Beyond the blueprint, however, All Out!! does a few things very well and one thing not so well.Starting with the pros:1. All Out is very self-aware. When the main character Gion first joins the team, the show...realizes an alphabet soup of names is not going to be helpful for the audience, and realistically not helpful to someone meeting a gigantic group for the first time. So they tell Gion and by extension, the viewer, oh well, you\'ll pick it up as we go. And it follows through with mostly organic introductions and interactions, rather than strictly regimenting meeting one or two new side characters per episode.(Also, rather than having a character seem suspiciously too similar to Hiruma from Eyeshield-21, the show instead goes full homage complete with the ""ya-ha"")2. Characters do not remain boxed in cliques. Everyone interacts with everyone else. The dynamics within the third years and between the second years and third years, and between people in the same grade across different schools flourish independently of their relation to the main character.3. The adults interact with each other and offer viewpoints beyond the X\'s and O\'s of the game. It\'s difficult to elaborate without spoilers, but the adult characters in All Out are more fully realized than other shows that have mouthpieces for training techniques and game tactics.And now the con:All Out does not sustain drama. Main character Gion\'s issue is that he\'s short, but it\'s quickly evident that the people who recruited him weren\'t lying, plenty of rugby players in this show are of similar height. His bigger issue to being new to rugby, which also isn\'t really an issue unique to him at all. Also, while some themes are carried through the show (club was not competitive when the current third-years were first-years), the heaviest drama is reserved for sudden punches of serious issues with little foreshadowing and little follow-up.So in conclusion, if you like sports anime, realistic feeling group dynamics, or just a total blank slate looking for the basic flow of a rugby game, you should watch All Out!!Art: 8 (some very...unique character designs can be hit or miss, animation-wise, there were a few places were stills were noticeable, but overall the rugby movements and character expressions are well done)Sound: 6 (I rarely notice voice acting unless it\'s particularly amazing or atrocious. All Out\'s VAs were fine, and the first OP/ED were decent. The second OP/ED were not my cup of tea, but All Out mostly loses points due to its lackluster background music.) realizes an alphabet soup of names is not going to be helpful for the audience, and realistically not helpful to someone meeting a gigantic group for the first time.

The story definitely picked up after they got the new coach, and it was nice that they explained some of the rugby rules and strategies throughout the show so even if you didn\'t know much about rugby you could still pick up a few things. I liked that this anime didn\'t fall into the ""friendship/team mates"" or ""work hard and you\'ll beat the best team after 1 practice session"" trap which a lot of sport anime tend to do. I hope this gets a second season...because I\'d like to see how the story develops and how the team does at Hanazono. because I\'d like to see how the story develops and how the team does at Hanazono.', ""This was my very first venture into sports anime, because I really don't like sports all that much. With that in mind, I came into it not expecting much. I was wrong. This anime surpassed my expectations, and I was hooked after the first episode.This was an amazingly fun anime to watch. The story was solid and enjoyable, and very positive. The characters were also extremely likable in general. It was just a feel-good anime overall, with a strong emphasis on pushing yourself to become better, and building bonds.Regarding the sports aspect of the show, I can say that I know absolutely nothing about rugby...other than you tackle people. Thanks it's. And I only know that from an episode of Friends. However, they explained the concepts in an easy-to-follow way, so you can follow along if you are a novice like me. At the same time, they didn't over-explain, so I imagine people familiar with rugby won't feel put off.For folks who are not big on sports, so avoid sports anime, I would say grab this one and dive in.

Nothing is particularly bad and nothing stands out. As a result, you sure as hell have a sports show about rugby. That\'s about it. Each character is heavily archetyped, and while the show seems to be pretty slow-paced when it comes to character development, at the same time, it\'s not. The most important thing to a character is obviously the introduction to them. The show rushes the most important introductory arc for our main characters. Gion...gets fascinated by the sport merely by watching a single practice match. Why? Because he wants to ""tackle"" big people. Not exactly the intro we would like to have. Sumiaki, the other ""main character,"" actually wants to quit the sport due to a particularly traumatic experience he had in middle school. Not a bad approach, but when he just picks up the sport so easily, his past becomes forgettable. This is accentuated at the practice game he plays, where he freezes up in front of his former teammate that he injured, but gets over it after a few minutes of interaction. It\'s going through the motions of someone recovering from trauma without actually giving any time to the character.Then, the other characters that are just super archetypes; they don\'t even matter. Yes, the rest of the show gets into the groove of introducing the team to the audience while never expanding upon the main characters too often or much. The backlash of this action is clear: no characters stand out, not even the main character. That\'s the motif of this show. It doesn\'t stand out, and it certainly doesn\'t suck. It just is.Compared to Eyeshield 21, All Out lacks the distinctive cast of characters that pepper the show. Hiruma from Eyeshield 21 is a character you would love or hate for the amount of screen time as well as the bombastic personality he has. You just don\'t have characters like that in All Out. Even with animation, I would say that All Out is much better in the movements, but still lacks projecting the overhead view and flow of the game.Again, I\'m not going to nitpick over everything the show has to offer. Just know that it\'s inoffensive, and whether or not  you like generic, orthodox shows about sports is going to heavily influence your enjoyment of the show. gets fascinated by the sport merely by watching a single practice match.

Anyways, in the Japenese dub, the original cast for the characters return, which is nice to hear them.As for the dub... I gotta be honest... I don't hate the dub *avoid sharp objects being thrown* HEY! Hey! Listen to what I'm going to say next! Yes, I know this dub is consider to be the weakest of the Di Gi Charat dubs but it's not as bad as some people made it out to be. Okay yeah, the who “Akari” as “Akali” can be annoying but other than that, it's not that bad of a dub. I've heared worse... much...worse....ANYWAYS, onto to the licensing, and BOY there is a lot to say bout this and the way it was handled. During the time, Bandai only licensed and dubbed 72 episodes.... I am not joking when saying this. They left the other 32 episode unlicensed. That has to be the dumbest thing I have witnessed from a company like Bandai. And it's mind boggling because it's Bandai! The same people that gave us Gurren Lagann pulled this move! *sigh* This is why it's debatable rather Mike and Rinna were cameos. I'm hoping that Sentai Filmworks re-license this series and get all 104 episodes. It doesn't have to be re-dubbed. A re-license is all I'm asking.As for subtitles, well here's a quick one. 1-72: Good 73-104: Not Good. (No thanks to ARR fansubs kinda screwing with the character names)Overall:All and all, Di Gi Charat Nyo! is a entertaining anime overall. If you like the original series or want to see something funny, I suggest giving this a try. If you're looking for a ground-breaking story with heart throbbing emotions, this is not for you.I'm just happy to finally see the anime that introduce me to the Di Gi Charat franchise and Rinna from Panyo Panyo appeared in this series. Rather they were cameos or not is debatable but that's a story for another section. As for the new characters, they're pretty alright. I like characters like Aqua and Yu-Rei, I very glad to see them. They are some characters I didn't like (Kumagaya Kintarou) but hey, those are the type of characters that aren't meant to be liked.Music:Outside of the OP, ED, and some insert songs (Usamimi Chan for example), majority of the background songs aren't that memorible.

If you're looking for a ground-breaking story with heart throbbing emotions, this is not for you.I'm just happy to finally see the anime that introduce me to the Di Gi Charat franchise"", 'The Di Gi Charat franchise is perhaps one of my favourite anime produced (that I\'ve watched ). It\'s more than just a classic to me  it\'s an example of what 2000s moe anime is supposed to be by combining a cute magical girl and GENUINLY good humor. And while  people will glance over di gi charat as it may seem to be like a standard mahou shoujo anime , However there is a lot more depth here within not just \' Di Gi Charat Nyo\' but infact the entire anime franchise as a whole .The premise itself is to me not like any...ordinary magical girl anime ( if it\'s even considered a magical girl anime but judging by Dejiko\'s supernatural abilities id say probably yes). This series follows Dejiko  the ,princess of planet Di Gi Charat, who is a lazy character who causes mischief for her servants as she ""eye-beams"" them. Because of this in order to get Dejiko to become a good princess, her mother sentences her to a trip another planet ( earth) to learn to become a well behaved princess. To prevent Dejiko from coming back too early, her mother  fills their spaceship with enough fuel for a one way trip so whilst on earth, Dejiko stays with Kiyoshi and Yasushi Omocha in their toy shop, while Puchiko stays at the Ankorodo Cake Shop where she is happily adopted by a sweet elderly couple .- its worth mentioning that different situations occur within the different Di Gi Charat mediasShoujo series tend to have a main character who is a pure little angel who would do no wrong but this isn\'t exactly the case for Di Gi Charat as Dejiko ( the main character ) can be violent at times and will resort to using her special ability being her eye-beams, to inflict damage onto others. But despite her bad nature she still has good traits and is typically helpful to anyone, and especially cares for her friends. But either way I think its hilarious to have a character who contrasts the common innocent magical girl cliché. As any other anime it is good, but as a comedy? it is excellent.Di Gi Charat is mainly a light-hearted and fun series. The type of series you\'d watch just for shits and giggles. the majority of what happens in Di Gi Chart is not to be taken seriously as nobody truly watches it for the plot but rather the comedy which you\'d think is mainly crappy toilet humor but some of the shit in there actually got me laughing or maybe my sense of  humor just SUCKS :v but in all honesty at no point did I feel that the show ever felt too silly or too serious it felt like a perfect blend of the two with each episode creating a fun new story with your favourite 2 cat girls.Interestingly, there are several elements that drew me to get into the \' Di Gi Charat\' series one of them being Dejiko and her outstanding design ! She has big , bright green eyes and green hair which is actually unusual for a main character in a magical girl series as most main characters wear lots of pink and have pink hair for example: Madoka (Madoka Magica ) , Ichigo ( Tokyo Mew Mew ) etc etc the list goes on so it surprises me to see a female protagonist in anime like this with such \'tomboyish\' colors buy honestly i think its unique and i love it ! Dejiko\'s maid-like uniform consists of a white and navy blue dress with big cat bells tied to her hair as hair ornaments (these signify her status as royalty)  with navy blue ribbons. On the top of her head she wears a pair of cat ears, which are white with pink inside and have a set of large, non-functional lime-coloured cat eyes. She always wears white gloves and boots (with the exception of her sleeping outfit) and she has a cute little white tail. She is consistently seen in this costume in her various series ( with the exception of Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat ) which can be considered unusual as most magical girls have their own transformation scene but sadly we don\'t see this in any Di Gi Charat series.That being said, Ill admit Di Gi Charat is definitely not without flaws.One of my biggest complaints is from the incredibly long length of the anime. At 104 episodes it can certainly drag on at some parts in the story. Whilst some episodes it can be engaging and interesting but it is expected that some episodes are weaker than others and that some events can become a bit predictable at times leading you to watch what\'s going on on the screen but not truly being focussed.  As much as I enjoy Di Gi Charat  I can’t help but feel like it would have benefited from a shorter episode count in order for the story to flow better or maybe even have the episodes shortened.i can also understand why people may not like Di Gi Charat  due to a few childish aspects but i suppose its to be expected from a show for children.While not quite flawless, this is a classic anime that may or may not be familiar to all otakus but i believe that with how much I\'ve enjoyed not only enjoyed Di Gi Charat Nyo but also Di Gi Charat as a whole you may to !- I was inspired to make this review only seeing 2 reviews left on here from years ago which I don\'t think fully capture the whole deal with di gi charat. I haven\'t yet finished the whopping 104 episodes but when or if I do I might update this post hopefully with more detail !UPDATE: I noticed in ep 79-80 there is a whole new opening and plot where dejiko and all the whole bg characters she met within di gi charat nyo all go to Princess school ?!

As the name of this title says, this version of the series is simply a 4 minute prologue to the first season (ef - a tale of memories).  It gives little samples of what is expected to come in the actual anime. From Miyako and Kei\'s rivalry, to the growing friendship between Hiro and Chihiro! There really is little to anything new with this...addiction, basically it show scenes from the actual series, but differs somewhat between them. For example, one character who was not in a certain scene during the series, has been added briefly to it. Or it may show a similar looking scene but shown from another angle. So yeah, other than a few tweaks here and there it remains pretty much the same. It gives a great taste of things to come, which is rightfully so since this prologue was released on DVD in Japan a few months before the actual anime aired. It overall does a good job of showing off the ""artistic ways"" of the series to come. Still, since this is only a 4 minute video which contains clips from the anime, it won\'t be anything in the way of special when compared to the actual series.The art style is the same crisp and well detailed version from the anime, with great character design, smooth looking overviews, and well detailed backgrounds and environments.The one thing I really enjoyed from this prologue, was where Yuu played the instrumental version of ""Yuukyuu no Tsubasa"" on the violin, truly a wonderful piece of music. Plus you get some great samples of the character voices through each scene! It really shows off what a moving soundtrack awaits!They pretty much show every staple character from the series, from Miyako to Kyosuke, they are all here and accounted for.

All ""mysteries"" about the characters will unwind as the series progresses.The prologue is presented as a brief quarrel between the two female main characters over the person they both like - a main conflict of one of the two stories in the series. However, it is, in my opinion, much more interesting to watch the series without the conflict already revealed. After...all, the series is created such that viewers have to resonate and grasp the emotional turmoil of the characters and so gradually appreciate the conflicts.Conclusion: DO NOT WATCH this prologue before viewing the actual anime!(The rating scores are intended towards the actual series.) all, the series is created such that viewers have to resonate and grasp the emotional turmoil of the characters and so gradually appreciate the conflicts.Conclusion: DO NOT WATCH this prologue before viewing the actual anime!(The rating scores are intended towards the actual series.)', ""Rate a 4English SubbedStoryFood for thought passage was a nice way of starting.

Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yattemita. OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30988/Futsuu_no_Joshikousei_ga_Locodol_Yattemita_OVA,"['The Locodol Specials, 2 episodes that continue the adventures of Nanako and Yukari as they become Nagarekawa\'s local idol group in order to promote the town\'s attractions and increase its popularity, are something that fans of the main series should not miss.This review will be light and simple as these specials are just that, but what they came to do, they did very well.If you\'ve watched the main 12 episodes of this series, we know that the story is quite a straightforward slice of life based around a couple girls that were chosen to represent their town in order to increase its overall popularity. What...better way than to take a few cute girls and have them spotlight the town with oozing charm?The first episode focuses around Christmas time, while the second takes place a bit later and focuses on making a promotional video for Nagarekawa using our main girls.I felt that the first episode of this OVA was spectacular in the warmth that it brought to the coldest season of the year. The bond between Nanako and Yukari grew even more, and it was nice to see. Fans of ""yuri-bait"" [raises hand] should enjoy it, even if it\'s very subtle. It didn\'t feel out of place and I thought it worked well within the context of this series.The second episode puts a bit more highlight on Nat-chan, the extremely shy girl, and does it ever so gently as if the script itself was being careful not to make her feel too uncomfortable.There weren\'t any other reviews on these specials at the time of this writing, as there really isn\'t much to say about this series in general. The plot is simple, wholesome and positive, kawaii girls helping their town survive financially via promotion gigs. These OVA eps simply continue that, and do it slightly even better. If you enjoyed the main series, be sure to give these a go. better way than to take a few cute girls and have them spotlight the town with oozing charm?The first episode focuses around Christmas time, while the second takes place a bit later and focuses on making a promotional video for Nagarekawa using our main girls.I felt that the first episode of this OVA was spectacular in the warmth that it brought to the coldest season of the year.

It\'s an old-school little girl anime (and nobody really makes anime like this anymore). It\'s reminiscent of Tamako Market, a show not about the plot or characters but about the lively market atmosphere.Some of the best episodes of Fun Fun Pharmacy involve the market people and Popuri\'s interactions with them. Of course, being an old school mahou shoujo and all, you do see silly magical and supernatural...elements. But they\'re actually secondary to the characterization of the townspeople.

Great Mazinger,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5658/Great_Mazinger,"['Great Mazinger is a fun follow up watch after Mazinger Z, but it is not quite up to par with it. That\'s not to say it isn\'t worth while though, it was still a good series. I\'ll do my best not to make the entire review a Mazinger Z/Great Mazinger comparison, but it was hard for me not to constantly compare the two since I marathoned them back to back. Plus, I don\'t really see why anyone would watch this without having seen Mazinger Z first.When the show first starts it\'s almost like you never stopped watching Mazinger Z. Mazinger Z directly transitions into this...series and even introduces the new robot and some characters. Things pick right up and mankind\'s battle against the Mikene Empire continues, now with more of a focus on the Mikene Empire rulers themselves. Gorgon returns as a recurring henchmen, and Boss and his crew stick around with Boss Borot. Kouji, Sayaka, and Professor Yumi are absent for most of the series. Tetsuya Tsurugi is the new protagonist and pilot of Great Mazinger. He\'s a very manly character and one of the highlights of the show. You\'ll see him doing plenty of hand to hand combat, as well as driving around a motorcycle that can use rocket punch. Jun Hono replaces Sayaka as the female sidekick. Watching these two characters interact is quite a bit different than watching Kouji and Sayaka, Tetsuya and Jun are far more responsible and mature. There is little comedy that goes on between them, something constantly around in Mazinger Z. Boss is goofier than ever though, so the comedy still makes it\'s way into the show. The new professor character is Kenzo Kabuto, who is actually Kouji and Shiro\'s biological father. Supposedly he is a much grizzlier character in the manga, like he is in Shin Mazinger, but here he\'s mostly a collected leader and acts very similar to Yumi. The new cast is good and gets the job done, but the chemistry that Kouji, Sayaka, and Boss had is irreplaceable.One area I thought Great Mazinger was particularly lacking in was the henchman department. You gotta have good henchmen to make a good episodic robot show. The Ankoku Daishogun (also introduced at the very end of Mazinger Z) was probably the most memorable one, but even then he paled in comparison to the legendary cast of henchman in Mazinger Z. Gorgon returns, but he is ultimately under-utilized. The character design of the henchmen is whacky, creepy, and sufficiently Go Nagai, but there are too many of them and none of them really stick out. There were like a dozen of them and most of them look and act the same. Eventually I had a hard time keeping track of who was who, and then eventually just stopped caring. Aside from Gorgon and the Ankoku Daishogun, there was a surprise henchman that was kind of cool to see, but you\'ll have to see that for yourself.Music and art is basically on the same level of quality. Like Mazinger Z, there is really classic old school insert songs galore that you find stuck in your head and anticipating. Somehow these songs never get old and always bump your attention level up. Most episodic robot shows have a song or two that always plays during the pilot docking/combination sequence, but having a vocal theme (other than the OP) that always plays is something pretty unique to the 70s Mazinger shows. As I said before, art is pretty much more of the same thing, which is a good thing. The apocalyptic red skies that are always in these old monster of the week shows are present and the cool 70s art is pleasing to watch. Great Mazinger has it\'s own repertoire of attacks, most of which are based on Mazinger Z\'s. Great Mazinger has a sword though, so that changes things up a bit sometimes. One of the best and most memorable episodes was a brutal sword fight with the main henchman.Plot wise, there really isn\'t all that much to talk about or criticize. Little happens in the way of plot aside from the beginning and the last stretch of episodes, but I will say that the last stretch of episodes were very good, it was a satisfying ending for sure. Something that made Mazinger Z so unique was how Kouji had to start from scratch and learn how the use the machine. I remember thinking that the show was more in-depth in training the pilot, showing his development, and explaining the cockpit more than any Gundam show I\'ve watched. With Great Mazinger though, Tetsuya is already a trained expert so there is no development with him really. The other major difference, which I kind of alluded to a little bit while talking about the characters, would be the tone. Everything is more ""serious"", mainly due to the leading characters being more stoic and professional. Sexual jokes are toned way down, and the only humor we really get is through Boss\' crew and this bizarre supporting character that is an annoying talking Crow. I should note that having Boss around is really one of the show\'s greatest strengths. It was probably my favorite part of the entire thing if I\'m being honest.So if you enjoyed Mazinger Z it only makes sense to give this a shot. You may not like it as much, but it\'s a solid sequel to one of the most successful mecha franchises of all time, and perhaps worth watching for that reason alone. series and even introduces the new robot and some characters.

The new professor character is Kenzo Kabuto, who is actually Kouji and Shiro\'s biological father. Supposedly he is a much grizzlier character in the manga, like he is in Shin Mazinger, but here he\'s mostly a collected leader and acts very similar to Yumi. The new cast is good and gets the job done, but the chemistry that Kouji, Sayaka, and Boss had is irreplaceable.One area I thought Great Mazinger was particularly lacking in was the henchman department. You gotta have good henchmen to make a good episodic robot show. The Ankoku Daishogun (also introduced at the very end of Mazinger Z) was probably the most memorable one, but even then he paled in comparison to the legendary cast of henchman in Mazinger Z. Gorgon returns, but he is ultimately under-utilized. The character design of the henchmen is whacky, creepy, and sufficiently Go Nagai, but there are too many of them and none of them really stick out. There were like a dozen of them and most of them look and act the same. Eventually I had a hard time keeping track of who was who, and then eventually just stopped caring. Aside from Gorgon and the Ankoku Daishogun, there was a surprise henchman that was kind of cool to see, but you\'ll have to see that for yourself.Music and art is basically on the same level of quality. Like Mazinger Z, there is really classic old school insert songs galore that you find stuck in your head and anticipating. Somehow these songs never get old and always bump your attention level up. Most episodic robot shows have a song or two that always plays during the pilot docking/combination sequence, but having a vocal theme (other than the OP) that always plays is something pretty unique to the 70s Mazinger shows. As I said before, art is pretty much more of the same thing, which is a good thing. The apocalyptic red skies that are always in these old monster of the week shows are present and the cool 70s art is pleasing to watch. Great Mazinger has it\'s own repertoire of attacks, most of which are based on Mazinger Z\'s. Great Mazinger has a sword though, so that changes things up a bit sometimes. One of the best and most memorable episodes was a brutal sword fight with the main henchman.Plot wise, there really isn\'t all that much to talk about or criticize. Little happens in the way of plot aside from the beginning and the last stretch of episodes, but I will say that the last stretch of episodes were very good, it was a satisfying ending for sure. Something that made Mazinger Z so unique was how Kouji had to start from scratch and learn how the use the machine. I remember thinking that the show was more in-depth in training the pilot, showing his development, and explaining the cockpit more than any Gundam show I\'ve watched. With Great Mazinger though, Tetsuya is already a trained expert so there is no development with him really. The other major difference, which I kind of alluded to a little bit while talking about the characters, would be the tone. Everything is more ""serious"", mainly due to the leading characters being more stoic and professional. Sexual jokes are toned way down, and the only humor we really get is through Boss\' crew and this bizarre supporting character that is an annoying talking Crow. I should note that having Boss around is really one of the show\'s greatest strengths. It was probably my favorite part of the entire thing if I\'m being honest.So if you enjoyed Mazinger Z it only makes sense to give this a shot. You may not like it as much, but it\'s a solid sequel to one of the most successful mecha franchises of all time, and perhaps worth watching for that reason alone.', ""Toei Great Mazinger is a darker  follow up of Toei Mazinger Z , its a little weird at first seeing this is a Super Robot show , it's pros are the music and Kaiju designs,  its cons are the storyline,  and lack of Jobbers , this show is not long , nor is it drags like OG Toei Mazinger Z , this is a worthy sequel towards Z , also the opening is killer too ,  Its a shame the next show got rid of both Mazingers , Great Mazinger is a good Super Robot Anime , with flaws of its...Episode by Episode writing , and it's very Monster of the Week Formula heavy episodes Episode by Episode writing , and it's very Monster of the Week Formula heavy episodes""]"

Happy Birthday: Inochi Kagayaku Toki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9931/Happy_Birthday__Inochi_Kagayaku_Toki,"['You owe it yourself to watch this movie. I agree with most of what the previous person stated in their review.I find it sad that a movie of this quality (ignoring the animation and sound issues) can go unnoticed and unappreciated for so long.This English sub is quite good, again the animation and sound are not the best, but I think anyone who really loves Anime and wants to see everything Japan has to offer should watch this.My personal opinion (keep in mind it is my opinion) is that if someone re-made this movie for western audiences it would be very well received. ', ""I can't believe I never knew of this thing's existence until JUST now! I seriously can't believe it! Where has this movie been all my life?! This thing is just amazing! Wonderful, sublime, awesome, tear-jerking, emotional, beautiful, heartbreaking, I'm running out of adjectives! Worst of all, WHY IS THIS THING NOT SUBBED YET?!? Well, Licca Subs seems to have interest in subbing it, but they better do so once they have time, because this anime movie NEEDS a sub! How did I see this, you ask? Well, the only footage of this movie I could find was from a Russian fansub group, and I don't...understand Russian, but I did manage to understand the core of the story and some of the dialogue (yes, the Japanese version exists). Now, onto reviewing Happy Birthday: Time When Life Shines (or Happy Birthday: Inochi Kagayaku Toki)!So basically the story's about a sweet but weak-hearted girl named Asuka Fujiwara who goes to a school full of bullies and cowards. Her mother doesn't give her much attention. She seems to favor her big brother, Naoto, over Asuka. Asuka feels better when she befriends a severely disabled girl named Megumi (who I think might have cerebral palsy or something). But when her mother intentionally forgets her birthday and says it'd be better if Asuka didn't exist, Asuka is so traumatized that she loses her voice. Naoto, feeling angry at his selfish mother, decides to send Asuka to her grandparents' for a while. There, she learns everything she needs to know about the beauty of nature, her mother's reasons for being the way she is, and, most importantly, the fact that life is precious.I'm gonna get to the good parts first, and believe me, there are TONS of good things about this movie. Wanna know the thing about this movie that got my attention the most? The fact that THERE'S ACTUAL DISABLED KIDS IN THIS MOVIE!!! Yes! There are ACTUALLY disabled kids with illnesses like cerebral palsy or something like that! No anime I've seen has ever been gutsy enough to show actual disabled kids before! No wonder this anime is so criminally underrated and under appreciated! Yes, someone gets it! Someone gets that NOT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN JAPAN is physically and mentally beautiful (no offense intended). Seriously, why are most anime nowadays making all their characters look physically perfect? Jeez! It's like they have a complex against flaws or something! Even most American cartoons acknowledge that not everyone is perfect, both physically and emotionally! Heck, they don't even give their characters braces! Well, I'm glad to say that this beautiful gem not only acknowledges that not everyone is perfect, but acknowledges that that doesn't have to be a bad thing. Bravo!Now onto the characters! I'm just so happy that this anime portrays all of it's characters realistically and makes them into real, down-to-earth people with flaws and reasons for doing what they do. Asuka's a great lead character. She starts off weak and broken, but thanks to the kindness of her grandparents and other people she meets, she evolves into a bold, warm-hearted, and outspoken young girl who isn't afraid to stand up to bullies who are being mean to her friends. Plus I love the friendship between her and that girl Megumi. They're so cute together! When I first read the plotline of this movie, I thought her brother was going to be just as selfish and cruel as his mom, but when I watched it, I was proven wrong. While he's still kind of a guy, he not only cares for his younger sister, he disapproves of his mom's cruel ways and even berates her at one point! You go, Naoto! Asuka's classmates are awesome too, turning from a bunch of bratty and cowardly kids to kind and respectful people. I found Kobayashi's transformation to be very convincing. I didn't get what happened to him, but he has his reasons for being the way he is, and he changes when he and Asuka get into a fight. The same goes for Asuka's mom, who goes from disliking her daughter to remembering the pain she used to feel when she was a child. I'm glad they didn't make Asuka's mom a totally evil person. But out of all the characters, my favorite has to be Megumi. She is just awesome beyond belief. Just her very presence makes this anime shine. She's pretty much one of the center characters of the story. I wish there were more characters like her in anime nowadays!As much as I'd love to keep glorifying this movie, I have to admit that yes, like other anime, it has its flaws. For one thing, this anime was made in 1999, so of course the animation is rather dull and a little inconsistent (some faces looked weird at points), but it doesn't try to be anything it's not. Yeah the animation's not stellar, but that doesn't stop the movie from being really good! Plus the footage I found of this anime has REALLY BAD sound quality. At first it nearly turned me off, but I had to convince myself this is better than nothing, so I endured it. Also, the OST isn't really all that memorable, but that's fine.However, as much as this anime has both flaws and good points, I feel that the single BEST thing about this anime are it's themes and moralistic values. Basically, it's an anime about life and the joy of living, but it has other strong themes too, like undying compassion, true friendship, the fact that supposed evil deeds always have a reason behind them, the beauty of nature, love, social injustice, and the power to heal. Lots of anime touch upon these themes, but they're rather poorly executed. However, HB: IKT does everything right and knows what it is. It's simple, but it definitely strikes an impact. It did on me! I cried at this movie! Twice! At totally different scenes! One of which I absolutely CANNOT spoil because it will ruin the entire movie if I do. But if you don't cry at this movie, then get your eyes and heart checked! In a way, this reminds me of Amuri in Star Ocean (Crazy, right?). Yeah yeah, that's a sci-fi anime while this is slice-of-life, but they actually have a lot more in common than you think. They both focus on social injustice, true friendship, and the power to heal. Seriously, why don't they get more attention?!Happy Birthday: Time When Life Shines is a wonderful jewel that MUST be in any collector's collection! Come on, people!

Sub this thing and give it the attention it deserves already!"", ""*Warning! Heavy Spoilers!*Story: 3Art: 3Sound: 5Character 3Enjoyment: 3Overall: 3This will be a review for the anime “Re-Birthday”, a film that so few on MAL have seen yet is considered a hidden gem. Were this film to reach the wider public by some obscure, low-budget, 70s kids anime-oriented youtube channel like “AnimeEveryday” I have no doubt that it would be absolutely beloved by the entirety of MAL. As you can infer I didn’t really enjoy this movie and there are good reasons for it....As those of you can plainly see: this anime was directed and animated by Magic Bus, a low budget hentai making studio and the same people who are unfortunately famous for making schlock like Mad Bull 34, Wounded Man, and only around 3 anime to their name that is considered to be of any real value (though nearly all of them were produced in joint projects with Madhouse or Shaft). Most famously of them is Legend of the Galactic Heroes, an anime that is so praised on MAL that it is erroneously considered the single best anime ever and of all time. This of course is the only reason why Magic Bus isn't looked down upon by our beloved MAL Church of Good Taste like A1 Pictures, White Fox, or such. These of which on average not only produce better content on average than Magic Bus but get a worse rep due to sensationalism brought on by our beloved wannabe loli, underage crossdresser fanfiction writing, brony lolcow, bootleg John Lennon looking dweeb Conrad Collins as he watches from behind the screen at his domain of the AniTube downing a bottle of week-old whiskey paid for by his girlfriend among other things. The director of Re-Birthday, in particular, is our very own Satoshi Dezaki who unlike his younger brother Osamu Dezaki, the man responsible for creating some of the greatest anime series ever made, has mostly made low budget unmemorable flicks, OVAs, and a few forgotten TV series as well as the above mentioned Mad Bull.I would like to mention first and foremost that unlike most people I am generally okay with what other people as pure unadulterated cheese. Some of my favorite anime include Elfen Lied, SAO, Nagi no Asukara, and pretty much anything by Key that is not Angel Beats, etc. In all of these shows, I could probably find one idea that I liked which made me appreciate regardless of whether the plot didn’t make sense or if the characters were generic or unoriginal. Be it learning to share your niche interests with others, learning to adjust to a new place, or just having fun slapstick comedy that most people can appreciate. The theme of Re-Birthday is that “everyone is inherently good” and that all evil actions have a reason and motive behind them. This theme that Re: Birthday has chosen to convey through its writing is not unique as many, many, many anime have expressed variants of it such as One Piece, Naruto, Yu Yu Hakusho, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Monster etc. The former all having handled it well as an addition to their own main ideas. Well being a relative term. However Re: Birthday or as I like to call Re:Tarded handles its theme with the same lack of self-awareness that something seemingly innocent show like Captain Planet might handle a serious issue like AIDS or deforestation.Our story centers around a young girl named Asuka (not to be confused with infinitely better characters with the same or similar names) Fujiwara from an unknown town in Japan who is just an absolute darling, little cinnamon roll, cherub, angel, and paragon of virtue who enjoys going around helping kids with cerebral palsy at the local disabled children's school and protecting her classmates from being bullied without a care in the world. Which goes on through nearly the entire film.But hold on there's a catch. Later on, it is made clear that Asuka’s mother Shizuyo, has been secretly favoring her brother under the pretenses of her daughter having lower grades than him. Asuka's brother Naoto admits, to her upfront that Shizuyo had throughout her life on this earth never felt even an ounce of affection towards her daughter and that every birthday party supposedly dedicated to Asuka's name was only done so to keep her quiet. Asuka, grieving over her mother's outburst, loses her voice the next day and winds up having a severe fever lasting roughly 2 months. After getting the shit beaten out of her by her mother, the girl then had to be taken by train to her maternal grandparents' farm where she completely recovered from her fever the day after arriving with her vocal cords repairing themselves the following day.Later on, after returning home from her grandparents' house, Asuka and her friends proceeded to confront the class bully and track down a character named Germy who had been routinely skipping class. They then had to confront her as their classmate is grappling with thoughts of killing herself. The 4 then did the unthinkable, the monumental Herculean task of telling the teacher that Germy was being bullied. All of a sudden a parent-teacher meeting was put in place and everyone who had bullied Germy for the last 2 months broke down into tears and say they're sorry. EXCEPT for the main bully seen at the beginning of the film picking on Germy, the likes of whom was not fazed at all and whom we will refer to henceforth as Caillou.  This is followed up by Asuka yelling at her mother who then has a forced change of heart and the movie ends. Notice anything wrong with this? You bet your ass there is!First, we need to talk about Asuka. She is the blandest character in any anime that I have ever seen but the thing is: I don’t generally expect every anime character I see to be completely original and different either. Most anime characters tend to reflect the trends of the demographics that consume that specific genre in their designs and age groups. Usually, a character can be humanized by giving them defined interests, goals, and plans for the future as well as an outlook on life influenced by the various external factors around her. Asuka has none of that, She starts off as a boring mary sue character or something to that effect whose only traits are that she’s a brunette and she’s an elementary school champion of justice. She feels like more of a cringe PSA advertisement for “everyday heroes” than an actual factual character. Asuka losing the ability to make use of her vocal cords and then falling into a fever because her mother forgot her birthday is probably one of the dumber plot points in this series and the fact that it took only two days to get rid of a predicament that had gone on for 2 months is absolutely beyond me. The power of love doesn’t heal vocal cords Dezaki you putz!Not to mention that this movie has more face turns than Naruto. I shit you not. Half of the characters in this movie are nigh irredeemable assholes or bystanders who end up not preventing most of the conflict from occurring when they have the power. Asuka's mother has hated Asuka forever solely because of the fact that the girl resembles her dead older sister (which is not even really true since they look completely different). This was the same sister that Asuka's grandparents had to spend more time growing up with because of her sickness and had an apricot tree planted for her instead of Shizuyo, the mother. At her age, she should have gotten the memo a long time ago but I guess not. Then after nearly a decade after Asuka being born and a child yelling at her she suddenly regains her maternal instincts. The brother who was initially in on it with the mother and who was initially cheering her on for her actions suddenly becomes very saintly and kind when Asuka gets sick for reasons that are never explained. He also drops out of school to “become his own man” (presumably under a bridge) and no one questions a thing.The movie also never goes fully explains why Germy was being bullied…...or why she was even being called Germy in the first place. The whole suicide subplot occurs without any real buildup or explanation. Usually when a bully picks on someone that person has to possess undesirable qualities that one can exploit or has done something to anger the bully. Throughout the film, she has her backpack stolen from her, her desk drawn on, and is prevented from entering the classroom and the teacher doesn't even notice a thing. That same teacher even broke down into tears when Asuka and friends informed her of Germy’s bullying and responded that she thought her class was perfect. With the principal and teacher involved and supposedly taking this very seriously, you would think that suspensions would be issued and expulsions considered at the very least but no! All they do is recite Germy’s suicide letter to the class and the little turds go from talking about how “hot” one of the parents is to sobbing their eyes out and talking about how sorry they are. Caillou, like the brother, goes from being a rotten little bastard who scoffs at suicide letters, bullies his classmates without being reprimanded in the slightest, denies his own crimes in public and beats up Asuka for calling him out then becomes kind after the disabled girl is about to crash and drown in the lake. Then admitting afterward that he was in fact locked in a closet as a child and scalded with hot water by his mother for reasons that are never explained.Megumi, the disabled girl who Asuka had been visiting periodically, unlike all of the other characters is honestly more of a stage prop. I’m not sure what her purpose in the film was other than to look creepy, smile, and laugh all the time. Even when she’s hurtling towards her death. When the director tried to make me cry and feel sorry when she did die and “live on in everyone's hearts” because of her disorder I didn’t feel as though any of it was earned. The least they could have done was give her a personality and not make her look and act like a clone of my creepy Aunt Nina but to no avail.When you come to the conclusion that the average panhandler from the streets of Dharavi, Mumbai is spending more money on himself in a year than the budget of your feature-length film you know you’ve done something wrong. The soundtrack (which is too good for a show of this caliber) was pretty emotionally sterile but decent at best. You could replace the entirety of it with an airhorn version of Only Time by Enya and insert it periodically and the end result may end up actually improving the movie slightly. With the ending credits consisting of the Trololo song as a clip of Dezaki laughs at us in the background, doing the windmill in our faces.The art as you may have guessed as of now is sort of abysmal for the time and doesn’t befit a film with a synopsis such as this. There's an awful light filter that ruins the serious moments like the bullying scenes, Asuka losing her voice and makes any part of this movie that takes place in the daytime look like it was being filmed inside a Gundam space colony that was in the middle of getting pulled a quarter of the way into the sun. Most characters tend not to have more than 4 or so facial expressions which severely lessened the emotional impact of scenes like the ones where Junko is yelling at Asuka to never approach her again. The designs looked like they had been made out of a bunch of amorphous lines and squiggles that were arranged to make a person with no real detail or intricacy. “bUt LaMp ItS JuST a StyLE”. Need I remind you that all of this was produced in 1999, I get that the Summer 1999 anime season wasn't exactly the most promising with GTO being the only somewhat high budget anime with good production values coming out but the thing that everyone has to realize (and probably instinctively knows) is that nearly every noteworthy anime movie created BEFORE 1999 has better animation and art either compared to Re-Birthday or for its time. The art and soundtrack in re-birthday look like they would fit better in the late 70s. But then again stuff like MSG 0079, Lupin 111, and Ashita no Joe have better character art, better soundtrack, and don’t have that god-awful light filter. As those of you can plainly see: this anime was directed and animated by Magic Bus, a low budget hentai making studio and the same people who are unfortunately famous for making schlock like Mad Bull 34, Wounded Man, and only around 3 anime to their name that is considered to be of any real value (though nearly all of them were produced in joint projects with Madhouse or Shaft).

The 4 then did the unthinkable, the monumental Herculean task of telling the teacher that Germy was being bullied. All of a sudden a parent-teacher meeting was put in place and everyone who had bullied Germy for the last 2 months broke down into tears and say they're sorry. EXCEPT for the main bully seen at the beginning of the film picking on Germy, the likes of whom was not fazed at all and whom we will refer to henceforth as Caillou.  This is followed up by Asuka yelling at her mother who then has a forced change of heart and the movie ends. Notice anything wrong with this? You bet your ass there is!First, we need to talk about Asuka. She is the blandest character in any anime that I have ever seen but the thing is: I don’t generally expect every anime character I see to be completely original and different either. Most anime characters tend to reflect the trends of the demographics that consume that specific genre in their designs and age groups. Usually, a character can be humanized by giving them defined interests, goals, and plans for the future as well as an outlook on life influenced by the various external factors around her. Asuka has none of that, She starts off as a boring mary sue character or something to that effect whose only traits are that she’s a brunette and she’s an elementary school champion of justice. She feels like more of a cringe PSA advertisement for “everyday heroes” than an actual factual character. Asuka losing the ability to make use of her vocal cords and then falling into a fever because her mother forgot her birthday is probably one of the dumber plot points in this series and the fact that it took only two days to get rid of a predicament that had gone on for 2 months is absolutely beyond me. The power of love doesn’t heal vocal cords Dezaki you putz!Not to mention that this movie has more face turns than Naruto. I shit you not. Half of the characters in this movie are nigh irredeemable assholes or bystanders who end up not preventing most of the conflict from occurring when they have the power. Asuka's mother has hated Asuka forever solely because of the fact that the girl resembles her dead older sister (which is not even really true since they look completely different). This was the same sister that Asuka's grandparents had to spend more time growing up with because of her sickness and had an apricot tree planted for her instead of Shizuyo, the mother. At her age, she should have gotten the memo a long time ago but I guess not. Then after nearly a decade after Asuka being born and a child yelling at her she suddenly regains her maternal instincts. The brother who was initially in on it with the mother and who was initially cheering her on for her actions suddenly becomes very saintly and kind when Asuka gets sick for reasons that are never explained. He also drops out of school to “become his own man” (presumably under a bridge) and no one questions a thing.The movie also never goes fully explains why Germy was being bullied…...or why she was even being called Germy in the first place. The whole suicide subplot occurs without any real buildup or explanation. Usually when a bully picks on someone that person has to possess undesirable qualities that one can exploit or has done something to anger the bully. Throughout the film, she has her backpack stolen from her, her desk drawn on, and is prevented from entering the classroom and the teacher doesn't even notice a thing. That same teacher even broke down into tears when Asuka and friends informed her of Germy’s bullying and responded that she thought her class was perfect. With the principal and teacher involved and supposedly taking this very seriously, you would think that suspensions would be issued and expulsions considered at the very least but no! All they do is recite Germy’s suicide letter to the class and the little turds go from talking about how “hot” one of the parents is to sobbing their eyes out and talking about how sorry they are. Caillou, like the brother, goes from being a rotten little bastard who scoffs at suicide letters, bullies his classmates without being reprimanded in the slightest, denies his own crimes in public and beats up Asuka for calling him out then becomes kind after the disabled girl is about to crash and drown in the lake. Then admitting afterward that he was in fact locked in a closet as a child and scalded with hot water by his mother for reasons that are never explained.Megumi, the disabled girl who Asuka had been visiting periodically, unlike all of the other characters is honestly more of a stage prop. I’m not sure what her purpose in the film was other than to look creepy, smile, and laugh all the time. Even when she’s hurtling towards her death. When the director tried to make me cry and feel sorry when she did die and “live on in everyone's hearts” because of her disorder I didn’t feel as though any of it was earned. The least they could have done was give her a personality and not make her look and act like a clone of my creepy Aunt Nina but to no avail.When you come to the conclusion that the average panhandler from the streets of Dharavi, Mumbai is spending more money on himself in a year than the budget of your feature-length film you know you’ve done something wrong. The soundtrack (which is too good for a show of this caliber) was pretty emotionally sterile but decent at best. You could replace the entirety of it with an airhorn version of Only Time by Enya and insert it periodically and the end result may end up actually improving the movie slightly. With the ending credits consisting of the Trololo song as a clip of Dezaki laughs at us in the background, doing the windmill in our faces.The art as you may have guessed as of now is sort of abysmal for the time and doesn’t befit a film with a synopsis such as this. There's an awful light filter that ruins the serious moments like the bullying scenes, Asuka losing her voice and makes any part of this movie that takes place in the daytime look like it was being filmed inside a Gundam space colony that was in the middle of getting pulled a quarter of the way into the sun. Most characters tend not to have more than 4 or so facial expressions which severely lessened the emotional impact of scenes like the ones where Junko is yelling at Asuka to never approach her again. The designs looked like they had been made out of a bunch of amorphous lines and squiggles that were arranged to make a person with no real detail or intricacy. “bUt LaMp ItS JuST a StyLE”. Need I remind you that all of this was produced in 1999, I get that the Summer 1999 anime season wasn't exactly the most promising with GTO being the only somewhat high budget anime with good production values coming out but the thing that everyone has to realize (and probably instinctively knows) is that nearly every noteworthy anime movie created BEFORE 1999 has better animation and art either compared to Re-Birthday or for its time. The art and soundtrack in re-birthday look like they would fit better in the late 70s. But then again stuff like MSG 0079, Lupin 111, and Ashita no Joe have better character art, better soundtrack, and don’t have that god-awful light filter."", ""It's needless to say that i cryed and got a lot of cold shivers through spines from this movie. So if you are in any case reading this before movie, i should warn you that it's so sad.  My eyes were watery 15 mins intro movie, so i had to pause it for 5-10 minutes.Story: We all got through some trouble in our lifes ( well someone didn't ) , wheter it's family problems or school problems or anything similar to that. This is exactly about that. If you ever felt like a leftout that no one cares about, this story is right for...you. It's not kinda unique ( it was probably for that time when it was writted )This movie is about young girl Fujiwara Asuka that get's rejected by everyone, including her brother and mother, which leaves most impact on her life. She is strugling and don't tell anyone about her problems cause she doesn't have anyone... As she goes through her sad life, finally a little bit of sympathy and care for her and she's gone to her grandma and grandpa so she could recover from weakness and voice which she lost. But after storm comes sun, and story develops more and more about her having happy life, while bringing sad things that ends up good.Animation: I love this animation. I know it's not that good but in 1999 it was pretty much awesome. They managed to bring me back to my childhood with those scenes in the village, when Asuka is helping her Grandpa and Grandma to find a chicked that hides in bush to lay eggs. Everything was almost perfect.Sound: OST in this movie was sad yet happy. Also voice acting was very good.Characters: Now this is the best thing. With clearly character development and other things, they managed to get you to hate some characters, and than love them. Everything was perfect in every aspect of characters.Overall: Everything is working in this movie, it's enjoyable, it isn't too long. I completely enjoyed this, and got a feels trip gratis with movie. Anyways i suggest you to watch it, but if you are reading this review and this sentence, it just means you found movie with lack of popularity, which isn't known that is like a gold nugget in anime world.Also you will notice one character that doesn't even talk ( Megumi ) which will just prove you how good Asuka is :) you.

At its core, it's about bullying. What makes the movie interesting is that it portrays the lives of several people and shows how they deal with their problems and overcome obstacles. At the end, I felt like I understood why some characters acted the way they did.Some scenes made me really angry and I had to calm myself down since sometimes, despite being a work of fiction, it didn't feel fictional at all. However, there are also a lot of heartwarming moments, like those in which the main character...gains self-confidence and speaks out for herself or where other people show genuine acts of kindness.What I didn't like was that there were several instances where characters almost instantly changed their behavior. It felt a bit unrealistic and sometimes cheesy. Part of the movie also dealt with disabled people, but that honestly felt more like an unimportant side-plot because the overall time you see the main character interact with the disabled children was very short and not very significant. Therefore, the movie would have benefited either from being longer or from leaving out some of the side-characters/plots.I would not recommend this movie to those who dislike sudden character transformations and I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you are easily triggered by bullying scenes.I would however recommend it to those who want to watch a bittersweet character-driven drama where you might shed a tear or two. gains self-confidence and speaks out for herself or where other people show genuine acts of kindness.What I didn't like was that there were several instances where characters almost instantly changed their behavior.

Kemurikusa (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/37302/Kemurikusa_TV,"['[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––[A Seriously Underrated Show]From the studio and creator that brought us Kemono Friends comes their latest show: Kemurikusa. This original show is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi that hooks the viewers with its slow revealing mysteries and excellent world-building, dynamic character interactions, wide set pieces, and great soundtracks. The 3DCG may take some adjustment and getting used to, but it’s not necessarily awful. In short, anybody that’s familiar with Tatsuki’s work should watch this anime.And also, did you know that Kemurikusa translates to “smoke grass”, “smoke plant”, or “smoke weed”. Yep, this is literally Winter 2019’s dankest anime. Thank you, Tatsuki....STORY:Synopsis: A trio of red-haired sisters, living in a post-apocalyptic world overwhelmed by a red fog, must fight against red robotic ‘bugs’, while searching for water and other resources. One day, the sisters find a large source of water and encountered a “human” named Wakaba; an encounter that would forever change their lives.For a show that has a short and simple synopsis, the story is more complex than that. There are many unanswered questions regarding our main characters and the world they live in. Some questions include: where do all the red bugs come from, what is a “Kemurikusa” leaf and what does it do, who is Wakaba, what happened to the world and how did the destruction occur, who is the first human, where did the blue walls come from, what are blacked out words in the memory leaf, etc. These question will not be answered in the first episode nor the second, but rather over many episodes. And the show does an amazing job at revealing these answers and truths.Each episode reveals a tiny bit about the world and its characters through dialogue, visual, and audio context. Some examples include: robotic ‘bugs’ come in various shapes and sizes and can be good or bad, Kemurikusa have many powers with multiple usage, the world is divided into several large islands, etc. There are also many different locations, such as abandoned office buildings, amusement parks, the “Sky Bridge”, villages, railway tracks and stations, etc, and they are stunning to look at; the world-building is well done and throughly explored. With the help of Wakaba’s curious nature, these areas, the nature of the Kemurikusa leaves, and several main characters are also explored. All of this combined makes Kemurikusa a very intriguing and engaging anime.ANIMATION/ART:Upon viewing the first episode it should be no surprise that this show uses 3D character models, which I believe is good, with CGI animations. Now, usage of 3DCG in anime has mostly gotten a bad reputation, mainly the art style could appear strange or the animations could be stiff and janky.This show, in my opinion, doesn’t have a bad or strange art style, in fact, its usage of lighting and color are amazing, for example, 1) a stale gray and black world is lightened up with bright colors of red and green with the occasional blue and yellow, and 2) when a character or bug ‘dies’ their body deteriorates into glowing leaves and drifts away. Both examples highlight how beautiful colors and lighting effects can have on a show. Now, the composition is fantastic; the use of abandoned villages and tall office buildings, ruin houses, decaying trees and vegetation, etc, are all framed and shot to provide a sense of desolation and passing of time. It’s haunting and intriguing.The show’s animations are sometimes smooth and fluid, and other times they are stiff and janky. The fight animations and choreography are okay and not very exciting, thankfully, they are brief and few in numbers. Also, there is the occasional still images that provide context for what is happening on screen. Overall, the animations and art are good.SOUND:The voice acting is hit-and-miss with Rin’s and Ritsu’s voices being the most standout and noteworthy, while Wakaba’s and Rina’s voices are too high pitched and somewhat annoying. Wakaba’s voice is most annoying when he’s saying his favorite catchphrases, such as “So Interesting!”, “Wow!”, or “I see!”, and when he’s being ‘too curious’ about everything that surrounds him. Rina’s voice, on the other hand, is just too high pitched and tries too hard to be the typical loli character. However these complaints are very minor and negligible after a few episodes.The sound design is pretty good. Its opening song titled ""KEMURIKUSA"" by nano features heavy drums, multiple guitars, a piano, and the singer rocking it out to our characters walking in various settings and fighting the red bugs. The ending song titled “INDETERMINATE UNIVERSE"" by Yuuyu is your standard J-Pop that features background images showing our characters connected to a red-string and when some characters die, they deteriorate into glowing leaves and drift away. The endings’ background images heavily implies whether our main characters are die or alive, this is a disturbing and interesting way to reveal answers. Both songs are great and well worth listening too. The background music is also pretty good as it sets the perfect mood and tension.CHARACTER:The show heavily revolves around its central characters, i.e., Rin (tsundere), Rina (Loli), Ritsu (cat girl), and Wakaba (“human”), to drive the narrative and progress the story. Moreover, there are many moments of character interactions, which enhances the development of our characters. Along with our central characters, we have some secondary “characters”: Midori-chan (Kemurikusa tree), Ai-chan (Kemurikusa fish), Shiro (beeping Roomba bots), and the mysterious “dead” sisters (Ryo, Ryoku, and Riku). These secondary characters play a vital role in progressing the story and strengthening the development of our main characters.Our main male character, Wakaba, is unique in that he can sense and detect “warm spots” through the thick red fog. These warm spots can be anything\xa0 related to the red bugs, or red trunk and tree branches. He talks a lot in a high pitched voice and is very curious about everything that surrounds him. This is both good and bad. It’s good because we, the viewers, learn more about the world, the Kemurikusa powers, the red bugs, and who the characters are. In general just about everything. On other hand, it gets annoying and somewhat tiresome after awhile. Still, he’s nice, kind and willing to help the sisters whenever they need it.Our trio of red-haired heroines, namely Rin, Rina, and Ritsu, are sisters who are not normal humans, i.e., they drink copious amounts of water, they use Kemurikusa leaves for numerous activities throughout their lives, they jump and leap further than normal humans, and they emit a bright glow when fighting the red bugs. Rin is a self-determined, serious, and tough girl, who has a reverse ponytail and white scarf. Rina is a short, energetic, and exuberant girl, who has the ability to make multiple clones of herself, eats many types of metal, and wears maid clothing. Ritsu is a soft-spoken and caring girl, who always appears tired and has cat ears; she also controls a Kemurikusa tree named Midori-chan, and uses it to scout for enemies or for transportation.ENJOYMENT:From its simplistic and short synopsis to its robotic and apocalyptic setting to its trio of red-haired heroines with masked background details. Everything seems to be shrouded in obscurity. But, like most series, not everything will be explained in the first or even second episode. It takes time. And this series is no different, it slowly and methodically reveal answers and truths over the course of the series. This coupled with its excellent world building hooks the viewers in wanting to learn more about the story and setting. Accompanying the setting and story is the good sound design, mainly its rocking opening and ending song. Additionally, while its art and animations, at times, appear janky, its composition and lighting are outstanding. The character interactions are frequent and provide many moments of character development, still some characters like Wakaba can be somewhat annoying. Overall, though, this series provides entertainment in the form of a slow-revealing mystery, great soundtracks, stunning compositions and lighting, and proper character development. A good series in my opinion.

At the beginning I felt like the characters lacked depth and life, but it all makes sense as the episodes go by. The story was definitely not developed on various important...points they wanted to connect and most of the tense situations or discoveries are set up very predictably. Nonetheless, I loved every aspect of it. The show carries a very ingénue air to it and opens up various psychological discussions on what personalities could emerge as as a new society rises. The characters always lack humanity but it somehow plays into the story line.As a concept:This an original piece of work. It is very often seen how anime adaptations are hyped up because their manga/light novel has great reviews, yet when the anime airs, it can feel butchered or -on the contrary- made greatly. With that said, one can tell that Kemurikusa is an anime meant to be displayed on a screen; not because of the 3-D artwork (which I\'ve just now learned to love), but because of the rawness of the development. Watching it, it almost felt like an indie production because it was free from preconceived notions. No review would be able to describe the structure of the story objectively, because it could very well be defined as:A) a genius, new perspective on isekai animeB) the messy execution of an apocalypseC) a thought-through story on a paradoxical cycle that has finally burst.D) an extreme commitment to mystery and philosophy.As a story:As hinted before, the plot is not over-analyzed nor unpredictable, but the premise of it never claimed to be. The very concept of an artist who has an idea and wants everyone to see is exactly what this has written all over it. The story doesn\'t have these vices that big production companies have, where they do something to polarize an audience, to please the fans,or try and make the viewer suspect something and then have it be the opposite. It works from the ground up. without context that can be fully deduced until the story allows you to piece by piece. points they wanted to connect and most of the tense situations or discoveries are set up very predictably.

It looks more like Foodfight than an actual anime, the characters look awful, the animation is frankly appalling, to put it mildly. It looks like a high school student project more so than anything else, I cannot find a single redeeming...factor artistically, other than a random ""oh that looks cute"" which isn\'t exactly a high wall to climb.It is at its best when everyone is still and talking as little as possible, while the action scenes are pure unadultered junk, they\'re so bad you\'ll start to wonder if you\'re watching a parody rather than a show taking itself seriously.Sound: It doesn\'t help that the voice acting direction is dreadful, too, and that almost all voice actors range from ear-bleeding bad to just mediocre. I\'m extremely thankful that Mikako Komatsu is Rin\'s voice as she\'s the only one that didn\'t immediately annoy me while talking. In fact, I don\'t know how her agent blackmailed her into voice acting for this series but I\'m glad he did. She\'s by far the only one that can bring her wax-looking character to life and the only one that is actually able to convey different emotions (imagine that) rather than droning on in the same tone, whatever happens.I found Wakaba\'s (the guy) seiyuu to be particularly irritating, the only emotion that you\'ll get out of him is mild surprise or childish interest for something. Whether he\'s eating, walking or someone\'s dying, the tone of his voice is always the bloody same.Sound design and mixing is frankly poor too, things you\'d expect to make LOUD sounds don\'t have any at all, you\'d think it was a glitch of some sort. Rin in the last episode gets an arm and a leg cut off (don\'t worry, they\'ll grow back 20 seconds later) and you\'ll be wondering how did that happen since there was NO sound at all that even remotely suggested it.Music is ok but nothing exciting at all.Characters: oh boy. If you want an assortment of archetypes you\'ll get them here.Tsundere? Check.Nyan-girl? Check.Lolis with blackboard-scratching high pitched voices? Check.Cute robot sidekick? Check.Stupid boy with a heart of gold? Check.It\'s uncanny. If I\'m honest though, I didn\'t find the characters all that offensive. There\'s nothing new or surprising about them at all but they don\'t milk their archetype to death like you\'d expect from an anime of this kind.You\'d expect me to write more about them but there really isn\'t more to it than that. They\'re not developed much if at all and even when they are, there isn\'t anything eye-opening, rather just confirmations of behaviours that were already apparent.Story: This is the only part of the anime that I\'d give a pass to. We\'re in this world where there is basically one enemy, a red fog that takes control of robots (called mushi, although I preferred the ones from mushishi) which then proceed to kill any living thing. Kemurikusa, these different-looking (and different-acting) leaves, are pretty much the hearts of almost all characters, who are obviously trying to survive and then, logically, destroy whatever is causing this red fog to occur. In this journey (well, right at the end of it) there\'ll be also a clear explanation for pretty much everything that lead to this situation (granted, there\'s a lot of painstaking stupidity in those explanations but whatever). The concept of kemurikusa is not one that I\'d heard of or read about before watching this show so it was nice and interesting. It would have been far more interesting if it had been explored more but that would have meant more episodes and my eyes and ears can only take so much. The very end is extremely convenient, blandly clichée-d and phoned in but again, for this kind of anime I wasn\'t expecting anything more so I\'m fairly happy with it. Be aware that there are A TON of huge plotholes in it so don\'t stop asking ""wait what"" or ""wait why"", just take it in stride and move on.Enjoyment: I know I pretty much panned this show to hell and back and I do stand behind everything I said. Still, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit, although I can\'t really point at a single reason why. Kemurikusa won\'t waste your time, won\'t drag its feet and it doesn\'t try to do things that it knows it won\'t be able to pull off (well, most of the time anyway). It\'s a nice journey and one that has a very obvious ending but thanks to its relative brevity, it\'s a journey that can be worth undertaking, if this anime resonates with you.TLDR: watch the first 2 episodes, if you can stand the art and the characters, it\'s all uphill from there.

If you can\'t, you\'re not losing out on anything special at all.', 'Director Tatsuki has been on a turbulent journey these past few years. He became a household name after the unparalleled success of Kemono Friends in 2017. Kemono Friends was a no name franchise from a failed mobile game and manga until the airing of the anime, which turned it into the industry giant it is today. That was largely thanks in part to the talent of Director Tatsuki. The man is a master of mystique and a world building wonder. He incorporates adorable characters into dark and sometimes even twisted stories, but in a meaningful and endearing way.After the success of Kemono Friends, we...all thought the sky was the limit. But thanks to corporate greed, Tatsuki was kicked to the curb when they thought his usefulness had ended. Following this incident was a massive social media outcry from not only Japan, but around the world. Despite the hardship,Tatsuki and Studio Yaoyorozu picked themselves back up and went to work to tell another compelling story. This time, with an entire fandom in tow.Kemurikusa is a brand new series by Tatsuki and animated by Studio Yaoyorozu. It\'s set in a dystopian world following the sisters Rin, Ritsu, and Rina. I have to preemptively say, there are a large amount of similarities to the first season of Kemono Friends. Obviously because they both share the same director, but it\'s something worth pointing out. This time around the story is much darker and bleaker than Kemono Friends. The characters are constantly trying to survive as they attempt to find water and fight off Red Bugs. They come upon a mysterious person named Wakaba, who may very well help them find the paradise they\'ve longed for.The characters are the first thing I want to touch on. I found this cast of characters delightful and a joy to see them interact with one another. Tatsuki is incredibly good at making adorable, likable characters. They contrast very well with the dark, mysterious, and dystopian backdrop. And again, like Kemono Friends, the characters have a synergistic relationship with one another. The sisters have special powers and are able to fight the Red Bugs, while Wakaba is both intelligent and is able to think outside the box thanks in part to his insatiable curiosity. This relationship works so well because it allows everyone to be useful, and no one is left to irrelevancy. Rin is serious is always on the lookout for the enemy, Ristu is motherly and kind, Rina is goofy, innocent, and childlike, and finally Wakaba is easy going, sometimes air-headed, and easily frightened. It\'s a nice mix of personalities that you are quickly charmed by. Seeing these cute, endearing characters struggle in this twisted world only made you cheer for them more.Continuing on the story itself, it\'s a story of survival and trying to find a better life with the ones you love. The plot strings you along the entire time as there are numerous mysterious elements that keep you hooked. This is another aspect Tatsuki is very good at; his stories never lack mystique. How did the world get this way? Where did everyone go? What\'s the story behind the mysterious, yet powerful Kemurikusa leaves? Because of the survival element, tension was consistently present. The characters\' lives were constantly in danger as they walked into the unknown; be it from fighting off Red Bugs or running out of water.I did however, find myself bored a handful of times. At least one or two times an episode it\'s nothing but showing the characters walking and getting around difficult terrain. While it is interesting to see the world unfold in front of us, I just couldn\'t shake my feeling of boredom at times.There are a number of things that I don\'t feel as though they were explained well enough, which left me feeling a little disappointed. However, the entire story is contained in the 12 episodes. Which to me, is a breath of fresh air. There always seems to be room for a sequel nowadays, but this resolves the entire story from beginning to end which gives you a feeling of fulfillment and completeness.Visually, this was a big step up from Kemono Friends. Studio Yaoyorozu now has more experience, and it shows, but this may have also got more funding behind it as well. While it still retains the simple looking animation, the character designs are attractive and the animation is much smoother and more intricate. However, the animation still looks rough at times and at best it\'s only middle of the road, at least for industry standards. I think what helps set it apart is the art style, which is cute and round. It\'s basically becoming iconic at this point.As for backgrounds, it was filled with crumbling buildings and structures, empty cars filling some streets while others are completely barren. You\'ll see a variety of structures like an amusement park, a residential district, an industrial district and more. What happened to what appears to be this once great society? Tatsuki uses this to his advantage as a ""show, don\'t tell"" technique that he did so well in Kemono Friends.The music wasn\'t anything to write home about. It served it\'s purpose as I don\'t have anything particularly positive or negative to say about it. And from what I can tell of the voice acting, it was great. Everyone had a distinct and innocent sound to them that I just loved.It\'s been a long road for Tatsuki since the end of Kemono Friends. But I can happily say he has another winner on his hands. At the time of this review, volume 1 of Kemurikusa has sold 15,000 units. Kemurikusa is an interesting world with a great cast of characters. The story leaves you with a sense of satisfaction and is an overall enjoyable experience. While it does lag behind in couple of key aspects, Kemurikusa is still a memorable show that I found myself loving by the time episode 12 rolled around.After the way he was treated, it\'s terrific to see a director like Tatsuki land back on his feet with Kemurikusa. His blending of cute and dark along with a twist of mystery, Tatsuki has found a successful formula that works, and I can\'t wait to see what he has in store for the future. all thought the sky was the limit.

I thought it was bad at first, but now I see how it works better than 2D. The CG looks really beautiful with the backgrounds, and I started liking it. Even though its good, it could be better. What I like the most in the art style are the colors, the shining colors make an gorgeous contrast with the black and gray backgrounds.<SPOILER ALERT> I can't say anything sure about the story now. Yes, the story is doing just ok...right now, nothing really special. But with all of the post-apocalyptic theme, the appearence of that girl I forget the name who everyone thought was dead, the blue insects, that things written in Wakaba's kemurikusa... I can see some big things happening with the story. <SPOILER END>The characters are good and their development is really great. I don't have much to say about it.Anyways, the idea and style of this anime are really unique. It makes me wanna know what will happen the next episode, its fun to watch... <SPOILER> made me feel kinda sad for the robots in episode 8, <SPOILER END> and makes me curious to know what happened and is happening at that world. The strongest point and what made me start watching the show was the art style, the colors are used in such a beautiful way... Its not perfect, some people may not like its style very much, but its a really great anime. right now, nothing really special.

The plot is inherently a mystery, and after watching the first episode I had a dozen ideas of how it might play out. Halfway through the series I had enough clues from the dialogue and set pieces to put some parts together. In the end, nearly every thread of the story was tied together into a conclusion which answered every question I had and even some I didn't know I had.In...my opinion the animation is a huge step up from Kemono Friends, Yaoyorozu's most prevalent previous work. There are still some moments where you'll notice cut corners, but this is the case for virtually every television anime series. For the most part the animation is fluid and effective. The character designs may look goofy at first but I quickly grew fond of them. The technical and creature designs are fascinating, with a combination of both familiar and alien elements. The titular Kemurikusa is visually striking and provides a strong over-arching motif which is drilled into your head throughout the series for reasons that become increasingly and alarmingly apparent. There is also a great deal of beauty in the environments, which often have hand-painted background art that plays nicely with the moving CG pieces.If you aren't bothered by the animation or characters, and you approach the series with an open heart and mind, then I wholeheartedly recommend sticking through Kemurikusa as it becomes increasingly endearing as the story progresses and characters develop. The only man I envy is he who has not yet watched Kemurikusa, because the emotional payoff in the end is immense. my opinion the animation is a huge step up from Kemono Friends, Yaoyorozu's most prevalent previous work.

They stumble upon a mysterious person named Wakaba who can\'t explain how they ended up there.The story is well executed and well written. It keeps the viewer interested: Why is the world destroyed? Where did all the humans go? And so-on. Yaoyorozu has a fetish for post-apocalyptic styled settings as evidenced by their work on Kemono Friends prior to this anime. They do a really good job on making their...worlds have that ominous sense that something isn\'t quite right.The characters are interesting and also well written. Yaoyorozu really knows how to make their characters charming and cute.The CGI in this anime is similar in style to Kemono Friends so if you\'re upset by that sort of thing then you might not like it. I thought it was decent. The SFX and voiceacting are fine, nothing crazy but nothing awful.(Small spoiler alert)My complaints with this anime are mainly with regards to the plot. The writers never really explain to the viewer at any point how Wakaba just suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The anime also never really explains to the viewer why the characters are all inside of a ship landed on a planet. Is it crashlanded there? There are some questions the viewer might have about characters that never get answered as well: If Wakaba isn\'t human, what is he? I suppose they might leave this unanswered to create a sense of mystery but I think there are some things that shouldn\'t be left unanswered in an anime like this that\'s only meant to be a single season long.Overall, Kemurikusa is a well written, mysterious sci-fi story told brilliantly. The setting, plot and character design are all top-notch. I think it certainly deserves a 9 out of 10 and I am eager to see what new projects Yaoyorozu has in store. worlds have that ominous sense that something isn\'t quite right.The characters are interesting and also well written.

Like Made in Abyss, there's no way to guess what the characters will see next because the world is so unique.Story's good, though it's a basic quest.The art's pretty bad.

Good voice acting, okay sound effects, okay music.Characters are very trope-y and some of them are a bit annoying in that they are too cutesy. The main character is a paradox. On the one hand, he has all the beta male behaviors and affectations and appears to be a complete and utter wuss, but by his...words and actions, he is bafflingly courageous and noble. Even one of the other characters notes this in dialog.Overall, I enjoyed the series and watched it all the way to the end. I give it an 8/10. words and actions, he is bafflingly courageous and noble.

This time it\'s about Kemurikusa.To start with, Kemurikusa is a 12 episode original full-CGI anime done by Studio Yaoyorozu who previously did the very successful Kemono Friends, and which has been their only well-known show. Since the show is done in CGI this will instantly put off some people.Story: Since I only saw the first 4 episodes my take on the story is not complete so bear with me, I might be taking thinga wrong or certain things might improve later on in the show. The story so far is about a group of girls living...in a what seems to be dystopian world that is partly covered with red fog. The girls themselves have certain abilities that they achieve through glowing transparent leaves. The world they live in is also inhabited by red mechanical-looking creatures called Mushi who are (so far) always hostile. In the midst of one of the girl\'s expeditions they meet a guy who mysteriously appears out of nowhere.That\'s the story so far. While watching I was actually counting on the plot and believing it would get stronger and deeper later on. It seemed promising. However, 4 episodes in the story hasn\'t progressed in any actually interesting direction and has been stagnant in excitement since the start.Art: I\'m gonna be quick and ruthless here. This is not Land of the Lustrous. But it is also not Dimension High School (from this season) or Berserk 16/17. That being said, the CGI is not very good but it is not the worst. CGI in anime is still a problem child and most full-CGI anime struggle in that regard. Apart from the CGI there is no notable aspect for art.Sound: If there was background sound I forgot it already. I guess the sound is....there. But that should be obvious. So no praise here.The opening is good and done by the talented Nona, who somehow lately always does openings for ""not so good shows"". The ed is forgettable, I already forgot it.Characters: Oh boy, let\'s go. To start with, I forgot all their names but that won\'t do any bad. The characters are....boring. They don\'t give you that feeling when you watch characters who actually have character, apart from sprinkled stereotypes. Since I can\'t give a lot of spoilers, let\'s just say that the female main lead quickly falls into a well-known and old pattern, and it\'s not good. However, the single worst and actually bad character is the guy who appears out of nowhere. His character personality is somehow infuriating. He acts very ""knowledge-hungry"" but in an annoying way. The way he acts and articulates makes you not like the character at all. I understand that everything is new to him but can he..like just calm down. I\'m not exaggerating when I say that he is the sibgle thing that made be not wanting to watch the show, which eventually was the case.I dropped the show after episode 4.My verdict is a 5/10. While the guy is a terrible character I have to give the show credit for trying to go the mystery route, but you gotta give the viewers the mystery, instead of holding it back and just leave the room empty. Do I recommend this anime? No, I don\'t.Even if the show in the end ends up being a great mystery show, not catching me in the first 4 episodes is a bad sign and I do have things I rather do than watching Kemurikusa. If you have enough time to watch this show, go ahead. You might even get a good finale. But if your time is precious to you or you don\'t want to miss anything good, I can assure you. You won\'t miss out on anything great.And that\'s it for my review, I hope everything was made clear what I wanted to say and I see you in the next review. in a what seems to be dystopian world that is partly covered with red fog.

But the world made me curious so I decided to keep watching. The longer I watched the more curious I become. Who are these people? Who made them?what happened to the world?To me, this anime has a similar feel as Girls\' Last Tour.  Both exploring a post apocalyptic world. They experiment with what they find, but for the most part, they are so focused on surviving that they don\'t wonder too much about the world around them. Girls\' Last...Tour had better art and characters, but it was a slice of life. Kemurikusa has a lot more action and danger.Story: 9Art: 6 (CGI was kinda bad, but I got used to it after the first episode. Otherwise, there are some amazing scenes in the anime.)Sound: 9 (used well to create a mysterious and oppressing atmosphere)Character: 7 (some are a little plain, but I\'m not sure they are actually human anyways)Enjoyment: 9Overall: 7I rated my enjoyment as a 9/10, but I kinda have a thing for exploring abandoned buildings and stuff. The mystery and wonder of how things work, but also the nostalgia and sadness when I think about how millions of people used to live there and they all put so much into building it up, but now its all abandoned and falling apart. The people going through now don\'t even know how to use the simple tools and technology that was left behind.It probably only deserves a 7/10 though. Most people were probably turned off by the slow first episode and the CGI. Honestly, some anime fans treat CGI the same way ""normies"" who only watch live action, treat all anime.

Kemurikusa is an exceptional anime despite its appearance.The story is really quite written well. It is quite similar to Kemono Friends, except we see and get more of the world explained, which I liked. If you haven\'t watched Kemono Friends, then to TL;DR Kemurikusa and this one: people go explore an apocalyptic landscape.So, I give Story 10/10.As for art: I gave it a 6/10 because I docked points for the bad animation, but the imagery and backgrounds were really good. So that kept it afloat.Sound 7/10 I didn\'t think much was memorable personally.Characters 7/10 - it turns out the...""personalities"" that each one had had a purpose (the details will be revealed when you watch).

I have included a warning in the text itself, so you\'ll know where to stop reading if necessary.For those who haven’t seen Kemurikusa yet, I\'d say: if you like this show\'s premise, then go for it, it\'s a harmless watch. Following the characters on their adventure is somewhat enjoyable, and the worldbuilding is intriguing. The ending - my least favourite part - isn\'t offensively bad either. I actually feel bad for giving this little show a 5, since it does have a lot of heart. It almost feels like some kind of indie project from...a small, unknown creator. So I need to get my problems with it off my chest.Playing into the indie feel, is the low budget – immediately one of its problems, sadly. This is especially evident by the CGI, used to animate every single movement in the anime. The animation of the Mushi (\'bugs\') still looks passable, but the character designs are just off, and that\'s hard to ignore in the beginning. The expressions of characters show zero emotion and their movements look incredibly awkward. An overload of stills also makes watching this anime quite a static experience. Luckily, there\'s still something I can compliment the art section on. The usage of moody colours in the background art is very effective, and helps conveying the post-apocalyptic setting.Many points of critique I have centre around the characters. I bear no heavy dislike towards any of them, but I\'m afraid they didn’t contribute much to me. Wakaba, for example, is filled with childish wonder about Kemurikusa and the world that surrounds him. It\'s nice that we have a character sharing our curiosity about the universe built in the show, but too much of his dialogue consists of him saying things like ""How interesting!"", and him being overly hype so often makes it seem like he barely takes things seriously – in heavy contrast to when he’s suddenly surprised at the dangers of the situation, even though those should already be known to him. The Rinas exhibit a similar air of carefreeness, as they mainly seem to care about being able to eat new things. And I feel the need to note that I’m not talking about normal food here. Oh well, at least their iron uptake won’t running low anytime soon… But that aside, these characters serve for a lot of retread comedy and dialogue, and it isn’t especially entertaining.The more serious characters aren’t outstanding either, but they mostly serve their purpose. Ritsu is a meek but kind-hearted girl, who cares deeply for her sisters and Midori-chan, her Kemurikusa tree. Then we have Rin, a turbulent but strong-willed girl doing everything in her power to protect her sisters from the world’s dangers. The dilemmas she faces in this endeavour are easy to relate to, and make her the most intricate character of the bunch. Sadly, there’s still something about her that annoyed me. She’s in love with Wakaba, and that receives quite a bit of focus, but there’s never any actual romantic development. The interactions between Rin and Wakaba are all too often rehashes of earlier dialogue.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. If you haven’t seen the show yet, this is where you should turn away.There are still three other sisters: Riku, Ryoku, and Ryo. All of them are pretty fun characters, but I won’t focus on their personalities, since they don’t get a lot of screentime. More importantly, those sisters are thought to be dead by Rin & co. It turns out that this is not fully accurate, as they somehow ended up merging into one Kemurikusa after dying. The thing is, these three girls all came to their end at different times and in different places, and it’s never explained how this Kemurikusa was able to revive each of them. And that’s not the only problem. When Wakaba encounters Riku, he is told to keep her still being alive a secret, but no single reason as to why this would be necessary is given.Building further on my point about Kemurikusa, I unfortunately have to say that the conclusion poses problems yet again. The range of abilities among Kemurikusa is seemingly infinite, and the show uses that as an excuse to just do whatever the hell it wants with them. The keystone in the whole story is the ‘First Person’, a little girl, and in the end it’s revealed that she split herself up in a Memory Leaf and six people – the sisters. Maybe I’m thinking about this too seriously, but I just don’t get how these Kemurikusa can create six people with widely varying personalities and abilities out of one person. To elaborate on Rin’s feelings for Wakaba, it’s a safe bet to say that Rin received those in the process of the First Person splitting herself up, and some of the other sisters seem to be aware of this, as they make fun of Rin for not understanding her own feelings. Thing is, this information should be locked up in the Memory Leaf, so the only conclusion I can draw is that the other sisters are somehow clairvoyant.And the single biggest issue I have with this thing is the trigger for the whole story. Combining a few colours of Kemurikusa apparently enables the First Person to make the strongest one ever, and apart from destroying the other Kemurikusa as intended… it destroys most of the world. Additionally, all the Mushi the group encounters during their adventure were spawned by this one Kemurikusa. This comes off as a giant asspull, since there’s barely any explanation as to why this Kemurikusa she created would be so powerful.One might beg the question: what did she seek to accomplish with her actions? You see, Wakaba was a scientist occupied with extensive projects involving Kemurikusa, which means little of his time could be spent together with the First Person, who cared about him deeply. The reasoning behind her decision, as stated by the anime, is that she wanted to relieve Wakaba of his high workload. However, it should have been obvious to her that Wakaba was actually very passionate about his job. What this signifies to me is that the loneliness she felt during Wakaba\'s absence is what actually drove her. The problem I have with this, is that we\'re given no reason as to why she would be so attached to Wakaba. Their relationship isn\'t fleshed out at all. And Wakaba himself? He immediately forgives her, and tries to cheer her up, since she did it for him. I’m not asking for him to full-on scold her, since that would be out of character, but he doesn\'t even show a hint of remorse. It\'s weird, to say the least. To summarize, the entire world ends up being destroyed because of the love of one little girl for someone else.

Kikou Souseiki Mospeada,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3670/Kikou_Souseiki_Mospeada,"['I just finished Genesis Climber Mospeada this evening, and to be honest, it feels like I\'m still absorbing what took the past three (or so) days to watch!  The fact that it\'s still on my mind so strongly is, for me, a good sign of a plot that extends far deeper than surface action.  My overall impression?  Though it has its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed ""the ride"" of watching the series.The story is easy to grasp but at the same time a little difficult.  Earth was invaded by aliens known as the Inbit.  Humans have either already been living on...other planets or perhaps flee to other planets after the arrival of the Inbit; they try twice to liberate Earth and fail.  The main action follows Stig (Stick) Bernard, a member of the Second Liberation Force and the only survivor from his squadron, as he journeys to the Inbit headquarters in hopes of completely obliterating it.  The Inbit are mysterious creatures who were seeking a peaceful place to live, but that\'s all I really feel like I understand about their intentions.The characters and their travels are what made this series so enjoyable for me.  My favorite is Stig, the uptight soldier who has trouble seeing things beyond the simple good/bad dichotomy.  Ray and Mint are always hilarious and adorable.  Hoquet is lively and strong, and it was nice to see a capable female fighting alongside the men.  There wasn\'t a single member of the cast that I found myself disliking, even Jim, the big coward of the bunch! :p  Their growing relationships were a joy to watch and cheer for, especially those between Ray/Houquet and Stig/Aisha.  The latter seemed a little less natural (as in, you couldn\'t really watch it develop step by step), but strangely enough I still felt really drawn to them as a pair.My favorite aspect of Mospeada is the soundtrack because, let me tell you, it\'s BEAUTIFUL.  The opening theme, ""In Search of Lost Legends"", is incredibly lively and fits the series so well.  Yellow Belmont\'s songs (performed by Mine Matsuki) are haunting and beautiful, to the point where you may be moved to tears after listening.  The background score is by Joe Hisaishi, who went on to compose the music for all of Hayao Miyazaki\'s films; though Mospeada is older, his compositional brilliance still shines through.  I can\'t recommend the soundtrack enough to do it justice!I never saw the adaptation of this series in Robotech: The New Generation, so unfortunately I can\'t give a comparison to the original.  However, I will say that the original is a strong series that stands on its own two feet as a great work of art. other planets or perhaps flee to other planets after the arrival of the Inbit; they try twice to liberate Earth and fail.

However, I will say that the original is a strong series that stands on its own two feet as a great work of art.', 'A fond childhood memory of mine is watching ""Robotech"" airing on TV. It was one of my first contacts with mecha anime, and it\'s not hard to see the appeal a cartoon full of battling robots holds for someone under 12. ""Robotech"" comprised three arcs, the last of which, ""The New Generation"", was my favourite.I now know that ""Robotech"" is just the editing and mashing together of three anime with virtually completely independent stories, and that ""Robotech: The New Generation"" is just an edited version of an anime called ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"", which I managed to dig up following my reacquaintance with ""Robotech"" thanks to...the internet.Like the other two series that made up ""Robotech"", ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" is about humans vs aliens, the aliens in this case being the Invid (or Inbit, which sounds a lot crappier, so I prefer ""Invid""). The differences between the plot of ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" and ""Robotech: The New Generation"" is small. The version-neutral core premise is as follows: Earth was invaded by the Invid. After being part of a failed attempt by Earth\'s space fleet to recapture the planet, Stick/Scott (depending on which version you watch) Bernard crash lands on it. Determined to continue his mission, Stick begins a journey across the land in order to launch an attack on the Invid\'s main hive at Reflex Point. Tagging along with him is a ragtag group of freedom fighters made up of random people he meets along the way.The thing about this anime is that it\'s the only series part of ""Robotech"" for which the ""Robotech"" version is better than the original. This was largely thanks to the music that ""Robotech"" brought to the table. Although the original music weren\'t bad, the ""Robotech"" tracks were better and more effective at setting the mood. Also, surprisingly, the original Japanese voice acting is more lacklustre than the ""Robotech"" English dub.What I was looking to get most out of watching ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" is the story, because I found ""Robotech: The New Generation"" baffling at points. Unfortunately, the original isn\'t much better. Granted, it doesn\'t have the whole protoculture thing that was crowbarred in to make it fit in with the rest of the ""Robotech"" arcs; but aside from these merging issues, the rest of the story didn\'t change too much. The ending to ""Robotech: The New Generation"" had been so bad that I was convinced it was the result of editing, but the original ending from ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" turned out to be similarly rough. It felt hurried, as though they had to finish the show prematurely. Not only that, they seemed to do a u-turn towards the end, portraying the Invid in a completely different light compared to the start of the series.It\'s not hard to see the reason Harmony Gold brought this into the ""Robotech"" franchise: it shares a number of elements with the other two series, for instance the obligatory human-alien love story (which was getting quite stale by this point), certain stylistic aspects in the battle sequences, not to mention the very ""Macross""-esq fighter plane/mecha hybrid designs. ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" does have its own unique aspects as well. For example, the bio-mechanical, insectoid nature of the Invid and the transformable motorbike armour are all pretty cool. (Useless info: The motorbike armour actually gave rise to the title of the show - MOSPEADA stands for Military Operation Soldier Protection Emergency Aviation Dive Armour, which refers to the said motorbike armour.)The reason why ""The New Generation"" was my favourite arc of the ""Roboech"" franchise is because of the colourful characters and their interactions. Stick\'s group is filled with different personalities (though a few of them aren\'t that great, like that loud, annoying girl), there\'s plenty chemistry as well as tension within the group as they make their way across the desolate, war ravaged land. The series is mostly episodic, painting a bleak picture of life under Invid occupation with its stories full of fear, betrayal and hardships. But they also show the best in addition to the worst of human nature, as there are many instances of bravery, friendship and heroic sacrifices. A lot of the one-off characters found in these episodic adventures are quite interesting in their own right, and I found myself caring about what happens to them, despite their brief screen time.Other than the names, very little of the characters was changed as ""Genesis Climber Mospeada"" made its transition to ""Robotech: The New Generation"", which means that the best parts of the show were left intact. Add to this the superior music production in ""The New Generation"", and you have yourself an anime where the Americanised version outdoes the original. Well, who\'d have thought that was possible! But anyway, whichever version you like to think of it as, the anime doesn\'t fare too badly even today - I still found it enjoyable at least. Admittedly that might just be nostalgia speaking, but I reckon there\'s a bit more to it than that. the internet.Like the other two series that made up ""Robotech"", ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" is about humans vs aliens, the aliens in this case being the Invid (or Inbit, which sounds a lot crappier, so I prefer ""Invid""). The differences between the plot of ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" and ""Robotech: The New Generation"" is small. The version-neutral core premise is as follows: Earth was invaded by the Invid. After being part of a failed attempt by Earth\'s space fleet to recapture the planet, Stick/Scott (depending on which version you watch) Bernard crash lands on it. Determined to continue his mission, Stick begins a journey across the land in order to launch an attack on the Invid\'s main hive at Reflex Point. Tagging along with him is a ragtag group of freedom fighters made up of random people he meets along the way.The thing about this anime is that it\'s the only series part of ""Robotech"" for which the ""Robotech"" version is better than the original. This was largely thanks to the music that ""Robotech"" brought to the table. Although the original music weren\'t bad, the ""Robotech"" tracks were better and more effective at setting the mood. Also, surprisingly, the original Japanese voice acting is more lacklustre than the ""Robotech"" English dub.What I was looking to get most out of watching ""Genesis Climber MOSPEADA"" is the story, because I found ""Robotech: The New Generation"" baffling at points.

One person of note was involved, Katsuhito Akiyama. He is the same episode director from Macross and a few other notable anime (Last Exile, Bubblegum Crisis). However, where Macross stood high and even falling into much of the same name and fame, Genesis Climber Mospeada falls way short.Aliens invade Earth and wipe out humanity to the point that the remaining humans flee to Mars. Humans fight back with a second force to try and take...back the Earth from the invaders (Inbit), and this is where the anime begins. It does start out strong with good action, an interesting plot with loads of potential. Even the plot behind the reasons behind the Inbit invasion and how evolution plays a role, all are interesting and great. However, the anime and this “done before” plot does everything it can to ignore a story and fill air time with almost meaningless action, and no progression to the overall goal. The entire anime is the journey of one group of main characters from southern South America to the Great Lakes of North America. At the same time, nothing happens, other than the same re-hashed fight sequences over and over again.The animation is weak being that there were more interesting and exciting things done already in the early 1970’s. One could actually think the entire show was episodic in sense after episode two. Music wise, this screams 80’s go-go dancing. The soundtrack is fun the first time heard, and then repeats over and over again. Lucky it is by Joe Hisaishi (music in many Ghibli films).There is almost no character development other than some characters kind-of falling for one another. Each one is incredibly one-dimensional. The most interesting character is the comic relief character, which is a red-headed ball of fun, but really has zero business being in the group. How the Inbit can wipe out Earth’s forces twice, but cannot manage a small group of scrubs is beyond understanding.In short, this might as well be a re-hashed super-robot show from the 1970’s trying to be real-robot. The only good episodes after the first two were the last three. It's just nowhere near enough to save this anime.

Nonetheless it surprisingly shares a series of commonalities to the other titles that it fits quite in and makes sense why this title was incorporated, or maybe it was just the trend of the time for many shows and this title just got lucky. As for the show by itself, it\'s a bit of a disappointment. The best description would be that it\'s a decent show buried underneath terrible decisions.The story takes place in...a sort of post-apocalyptic earth where aliens have successfully invaded and taken over the planet. Humans still live on earth but have become ""slaves"", but for the most part are actually just complacent to the invaders. Another group of humans live in space such as on the moon and mars and par-take in operations to liberate earth. The main protagonist, Stig participates in this operation but it goes horribly wrong and Stig crash lands on earth and assumes that he is the sole survivor of the operation. This begins his journey as he travels across the earth to hopefully find other survivors and find a way to defeat the aliens.Early along his journey Stig meets and travels with a variety of other people, creating a ragtag group of fighters. The first one is Ray who serves as a deuteragonist, and certainly looks like one due to his character designs and being more of a poster boy compared to Stig who has a more mature and controlled look and demeanor. Stig comes of more as a commander or mentor type while Ray is the more common young hothead protagonist you’d expect from the genre at the time. The other characters include Houqet a former member of a biker gang. mint a young girl looking for love. Jim, a soldier from a previous liberation operation. And yellow a man guised as a woman pop idol.The recruitment of each of these members made the show interesting. Giving each character a basic background to build from and in some way showed a sign of progress. However as soon as they get all the characters get together the show begins to stagnate. While the objective is still clear and the way to get there is laid out via a map, the show becomes a muddled mess by being episodic with whatever the writers can get by with.

Not to mention how hard the show tries to keep a status quo with the character especially on two episodes that are back to back. The first one having mint leave the group after finding someone to marry (although a bit questionable due to her character), and the next episode having some people deciding to disband. Yet in the end Mint comes back for some reason, and the other members decide to travel with them still.The closest thing the show has to getting back a narrative is an amnesiac character named Aisha. She is found and goes along with the group on their journey. Along the way it’s shown that she has some connection to the aliens, and as it turns out she is an alien just like in Macross and Southern Cross. The difference being that they aren’t really humanoid aliens, but take the form of humans to be best accustomed with earth. But it’s these knew forms that hinder them as few becomes sympathetic to humans unlike the monstrous crab mechs of before.The production value is ok at best with the only thing interesting being the mech designs.  First being the motorcycle that transforms into a battle suit for the wearer. Unlike other mech suits that are wildly big this one is about the same size as the wearer. It’s more akin to power armor which makes it sort of unique in the anime mech landscape. The other one is that aircraft which is basically the same as in Macross. Having three forms of a regular airplane, airplane with limbs, and finally a full on mech. It does look like kind of a rip-off, but it isn’t used that much compared to the motorcycle suits.It’s a shame that Mospeada panned out to be a disappointment of a show.

If you like mecha anime then watch this but unless you want to see a 13 year old girl's tits this anime has not much else.A glorified toy commercial. A Lonely Soldier Boy™ with a ragtag team of gold digging children and bland characters.What really confuses me is just who is this show marketed to? The themes are pretty standard for mecha anime at the time but the writing is so basic it feels like it was aimed at 8 year olds, yet it's filled with gold digging...children who have tit slips? Also there is a pink haired girl who's hair changes  color depending on the light conditions. They probably didn't know how to mix the inks on the animation cell. 80s anime has a lot of quirks like this that make it charming. They weren't enough to save Mospeada. Or should I say Crotch Eater.

I think a cause of this is the lack of new ideas and characters in season 2 as they really don't have any new additions and just rub on the relationship between the already existing circle.Another problem I have is how they pace the episodes.

First and foremost, I'm not inclined towards giving spoilers, so if you're expecting some, this is probably not the review for you. That said, let's get into it.Continuing the story from Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun, this season hits the ground running with a sports festival. Oh, geez. Well, Tomozaki's goals include motivating a character in class to give their all. He does so in a semi-underhanded manner, albeit not with intent to hurt...anyone. Unfortunately, there is hurt and despite his best efforts, it's a lesson learned for Tomozaki. Following that is a bullying arc, where Tomozaki helps a friend develop a positive trait that enables them to become more amicable to their peers. Well, it works, for the most part. Unfortunately, the season takes a nosedive beyond this point.The epilogue for the arc has Hinami and Tomozaki at odds with each other about the final confrontation with the bully. Hinami isn't really answerable to anyone for what she believes was acceptable (get used to that), and while Tomozaki does make some decent moral arguments, there isn't really much to dispute. How far is too far? Can we still call it retribution if we don't draw a line in the sand? These are really good questions that have no easy answers and require context. Unfortunately, this arc is over, and asking questions delays the next arc.And unfortunately, this is where the show dips in quality significantly. The final arc of the season is a cultural festival arc. The class agrees to put on a play and Tomozaki suggests one of the short stories Kikuchi wrote as their play. Now, I don't mind Kikuchi. She's creative, has an alright personality, and is a good background character. Unfortunately, the author, Yuki Yaku, seemed keen on spotlighting her for this arc, and it's... frustrating. The other character that got emphasis was Mimimi who steals every scene she is in.I'm not going to spoil anything, I promise. I will say, I am operating on a bias. But also, the writing is just so crap, and I know this is the author's fault, not the animation staff's. *Sigh* Okay, enough delaying.The problem with writing an arc with two diametrically opposed waifus is that if one of those waifus isn't that interesting, the majority of your audience is going to steer towards the interesting one. The other issue is, if your main character is written with a steep backslide that disregards EVERYTHING they recently went through (as in, maybe months of character development) there needs to be an in-story acknowledgement by others and/or an explanation for the regression. Instead, all of Tomozaki's development over the last two seasons takes a 3-mile back-step to the point he's giving bad advice to Kikuchi after she expresses that she wants to change in a significant way. I don't know why the author wrote him this way. On the other hand, every scene with  Mimimi and Tomozaki presents their chemistry in such a natural way that it makes me wonder why this is a choice.I won't remark on the music. I think the opening and ending are fine for what they are, and I wasn't exactly expecting the QUEEN BEE or Survive Said the Prophet. It's a dime-a-dozen romcom at this point which had a neat premise, but has now unfortunately steered itself into the same ditch the some-thousand other romcoms occupy. I will say that Mizusawa and Mimimi are the highlights of this season. Mizusawa is the hyper-competent and self-aware wingman we all seek for, while Mimimi is the ultimate waifu with her comedic timing and cheery demeanor. Honestly, I'd take a spin-off with these two running around getting into hijinks.Overall, if your expectation is plentiful character development and meaningful interactions, the first two arcs are as far as I would advise anyone to go. Anything beyond that is going to be frustrating. However, if you're averse to that kind of thing and the generic romcom shennanigans, I would say skip it. anyone.

I think the opening and ending are fine for what they are, and I wasn't exactly expecting the QUEEN BEE or Survive Said the Prophet. It's a dime-a-dozen romcom at this point which had a neat premise, but has now unfortunately steered itself into the same ditch the some-thousand other romcoms occupy. I will say that Mizusawa and Mimimi are the highlights of this season. Mizusawa is the hyper-competent and self-aware wingman we all seek for, while Mimimi is the ultimate waifu with her comedic timing and cheery demeanor. Honestly, I'd take a spin-off with these two running around getting into hijinks.Overall, if your expectation is plentiful character development and meaningful interactions, the first two arcs are as far as I would advise anyone to go. Anything beyond that is going to be frustrating. However, if you're averse to that kind of thing and the generic romcom shennanigans, I would say skip it."", ""Ah, behold the grand sequel, Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun 2nd Stage, where character exploration and thematic depth reign supreme!

The main focus was shifted from the first season and dealt more with other characters rather than Tomozaki, which was cool to see but I do think some of the parts dragged on a little especially the second half. I did still have a lot of fun every episode and the charm of season 1 was still here I just think it lacked a little bit of depth to the story and general direction.The first half was fun and I really...liked how more characters kinda came together but I really think the second half let this season down a little, it all felt a bit slow and I got quite bored of the scenes with Kikuchi. Without spoiling I really was not a fan of the ending either, I guess I can see how it went that way but man from the perspective of how the season was set up I don't really understand why that happened.I really do enjoy the cast in this show I think everything's handled in a way that's quite refreshing from most other anime I've seen, characters like Mimimi that completely steal the show are always so fun to watch and she had some really standout moments and jokes this season she's a joy to watch, the rest of the supporting characters are great too I think they all had their moments this season for sure and none of it felt forced.Overall this is definitely worth watching if you've seen the first season, whilst I didn't really agree with everything that happened it was still certainly a fun watch! liked how more characters kinda came together but I really think the second half let this season down a little, it all felt a bit slow and I got quite bored of the scenes with Kikuchi.

Shall we play a game of socialites? Because it\'s bound to become nasty this time.Back in Winter 2021, novelist Yuuki Yaku\'s Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun a.k.a Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki didn\'t exactly set the season on fire, especially in a season full of heavy hitters like Horimiya, Mushoku Tensei and the like. Yet, the majority who can really appreciate this show (like me) reeling into the MC\'s thought process into the human society\'s evolution from a NEET to a friend, it basically ""Character Growth"" the Animation on a small scale. Now, with Season 2...after 3 years, has Fumiya Tomozaki improved his skill? In a way, yes, and by large, tremendously.With Season 2 adapting Volumes 4 to 7 of the LN, Tomozaki-kun\'s character growth has seen an improvement in Season 1, but against the wills of his gamer-cum-social befriender guide of player IGN ""NO NAME"" alias and real-life school socialite Aoi Hinami, she claims that it\'s not enough and Tomozaki has not reached his peak, so the social lessons must continue. And the two huge lessons forming the base foundation of Season 2 that Tomozaki MUST overcome and be (in her eyes) the perfect social connoisseur: friendship-bonding cliques and in the most cliche of ways possible, find a romantic partner. In a sense, more character arcs that Tomozaki unfortunately lacks the experience and the social know-how of skills to deal with the matter and has to learn from his classmates and get better in the friendship game.Let\'s tackle the friendship-bonding clique matter first. In every school, there\'re bound to be cliques formed because people do have the tangibility to be together, shared by common interests or just the way they do things. It\'s EVEN more a matter when you bring in the infamous superior/inferior complex that exists in so many shows, once you\'ve seen one, you\'ve seen it all, and Tomozaki-kun displays this in a natural and utmost raw manner that we all definitely had this experience once in our school days, for better or for worse. And the person in question is Erika Konno, the Queen Bee of the class, and quite literally, an untouchable presence in the class when it comes to cliques. She\'s the stereotypical gal who acts like one, and when someone gets on her bad side, she\'ll start to assert her bullying stance onto the people that she doesn\'t like. Case in point, the victim in question: Hanabi ""Tama"" Natsubayashi. Tama has always been the blunt and unsociable character, but unlike Tomozaki, has tried to get out of her comfort zone and make friends, which is how Minami ""Mimimi/Minmi"" Nanami reached out to her in Season 1, and both girls are besties by the end of it. Her being the most affected and influenced by Erika\'s unreasonable actions, and the entire class is clasped into a cold war of sorts, not being able to escape nor resolve the problem at worse.That is where Tomozaki, neither out of options nor hope to resolve this crisis, decides to go straight to the side quests to figure out and break this cold ice for a much-needed icebreaker session. The person in question? Yuzu Izumi, the social and empathetic classmate who\'s a part of the queen bee\'s clique, she is a conflict-avoidant person who doesn\'t like conflicts at all, but she doesn\'t have the capability to stand up against Erika\'s whims. That\'s where Tomozaki comes in to help her partially resolve this conflict, as well as improve his interpersonal skills along the way. Likewise with the friends he\'d make during Season 1, Tomozaki being part of Nakamura\'s clique after said de facto leader lost to him in the Smash Bros.-inspired imitation game, Takahiro Mizusawa, Takei and Fuuka Kikuchi, among others, vy their support for Tomozaki to help Tama build her social skills, especially since her blunt nature only fuels discontentment, and is the centerpiece for Erika\'s harassment until the bullying subsides. Even if this matter didn\'t blow into the monstrosity that it is, an issue is still an issue to resolve, and Tomozaki would end up befriending even more classmates than he once had before, a thanks in blessing and disguise of the consequential duality to the dire social circumstances that plague our very own world and lives to this very day, no matter the generation.The second part of Tomozaki\'s issues: the romantic Game of Life. Ah yes, if socialite skills aren\'t enough yet, then having a partner will help improve his connections...if Aoi\'s really thinking on a positive level. There is no doubt that relationships come naturally when you have to deal with people different from you, and Tomozaki is no different in that regard. And the two viable candidates on offer that would strike a chord at his heart: Minami Nanami or Fuuka Kikuchi. I\'m not gonna spoil anything on this regard, so watch the sequel if you want to know who will capture Tomozaki\'s heart the most.Even after 3 years, Project No. 9 and director Shinsuke Yanagi\'s staff team have not faltered in giving Tomozaki-kun the adaptation it readily deserves, and to date, I would say is the most prized series of the studio by far. Even the idol girl group DIALOGUE+ came back for their new and updated song repertoires for the series, though I still find that Season 1 had the best of both OP and ED worlds with rather memorable and superior theme songs than Season 2, which while not a slouch, but is rather forgettable at best (though I kind of like the ED song, which is a good follow-up).Still, Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun a.k.a Bottom-tier Character Tomozaki, is far criminally underrated even with Season 2, since most people bowed out from Season 1\'s themes, which the sequel improved upon by being a character class on not just the MC alone, but his fellow classmates as well.

I really liked the concept of a person trying to improve his life, treating it like a video game. I could see him in myself a little bit.This season, however, was kind of a step down from the first. Or at least it was significantly different. There was more romance aspects, which I love. Also it tackled some issues, like bullying, in a very interesting way. Also watching my boy Tomozaki not get surprised at literally everything was character development I waited for a long time.Now, my biggest problem with this...season. I honestly couldn't care less about the script for the play. They were talking about it for so long with a lot of details, but I just couldn't get myself to care about it. Now, I understand that reading the script and especially the changes made to it along the way was so we could learn more about Kikuchi as a person. It really was an interesting way to learn about a person. But for some reason I just couldn't care. Maybe it was the super long but boring script. Or maybe it was just my disinterest in Kikuchi as a whole. But for those reasons, the second half of this season got really dull.The reason why I even wrote this review is because I love Mimimi. As soon as Tomozaki told his two options on who he'll date, I was sure who he was going to pick. But just maybe, I thought, maybe there's hope for Mimimi. But no. I was mad. I was angry, furious even. I couldn't control my emotions and started wanting to punch someone. But I barely managed to control my emotions and locked myself into my room. After calming down I cried and I cried until my tears wouldn't come out anymore.After a while I accepted the outcome. I wasn't happy, but I understood. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Reality is suffering. If there's something I learned, you have to learn to accept things even if they don't go how you want them to go. Even if your dad doesn't buy you the ice cream you wanted, life goes on. It's not that deep. Overcoming loss and accepting defeat may be tough, but it is a necessary step in life you just have to take. You have to push through the pain and learn to love life for what it is.Anyway the show's pretty good you should watch it if you've already watched the first season. season.

I was wrong.Tomozaki-kun is an instant classic. It is very clever, it is subtle but powerful. There are no meaningless lines. There are no soulless characters. By the current school anime standarts, this should be considered a masterpiece. This season (winter 2023-2024)gave us four great titles: Apothecary Diaries, Tomozaki s2, Shangri-La Frontier and, as some may say, Frieren. That's why I can't say that this is the best anime of the season. But in almost any other season Tomozaki...s2 would be a top dog.Witty dialogues, outstanding character development, clever humour, awesome director work, a story that sometimes is almost detective—this anime has it all.

Honestly Aoi herself has been giving me very weird vibes since the end of S1. She isnt in any position anymore to give Tomozaki tips or challenges. He is way more reasonable at this point.Spoilers:Class mate gets bullied for literally no reason and she doesnt stand up for herself? Her own fault according to Aoi.Another class mate is the only one that stands up for the bullied girl and thus becomes the next target. The result?...She is ruining the class harmony by calling out her bully. She should just take it like a champ and stop being so abrasive. Like wtf?And then Tomozaki asks her to skip school until the bully calms down (LOL?). Fortunately she disagrees... so they start giving her tips to not be as disagreeable... because she dared to call out her bully...This is an anime about SOCIAL SKILLS. There must be some huge cultural misunderstanding, but this cant really be it how they handle bullying. Literally no one even brought up the idea to involve teachers or parents.

The tl;dr can be summarized as ""great show with interesting characters focuses on character growth/development through a gaming lens."" If you enjoy character dramas with well-done romance/comedy and are intrigued by the gaming hook you should give it a try!I was honestly torn on whether to do a spoiler free review or not. I decided to have my cake and eat it too by creating this spoiler free review with...a separate blog post that goes into more details on the show with spoilers.Story/Plot 9Continuing from where things left off in season 1, we start with a brief refresher of what happened last season, including the change between Hinami and Tomozaki on their arrangement going forward, with a review of his longer-term goals as well as a new small task for him as part of his continued growth and development. Although, there is a new wrinkle to things now, with Tomozaki pushing back on Hinami’s tasks to clarify that he won’t act fake or make a false confession of love to achieve the tasks Hinami sets for him. It’s a nice callback to the climax of the first season, and a reminder of how things will be different going forward. Expect more pushback from Tomozaki towards Hinami going forward, especially over their conflicting views on ethics. After that, we enter the first arc, the sports festival, as Tomozaki starts gathering information, creating a plan, and then implementing it to try to achieve Hinami’s tasks. Much like the 1st season, while his effort is always there, he manages to succeed and fail in a myriad of ways for all the tasks in season 2. After the sports festival, we get the bullying arc, as Konno starts lashing out in class in the aftermath of the sports festival. Once that is over, we get the longest and last arc of the season, the school festival, with a greater focus on romance as Tomozaki is pushed by Aoi to consider whom he likes so he can decide who to pursue a romantic relationship with as part of his medium-term goal of getting a girlfriend.While this review is spoiler free, I do want to address the proverbial elephant in the room regarding romance. Whether it is in the reviews and/or comments on MAL, Crunchyroll, social media, etc. you will find a lot of discussion regarding the romantic direction of the show and Tomozaki’s decision for whom to pursue. Such is the plight of a dramatic romcom with multiple love interests. Watch out for that if you don’t want to be spoiled. Also, if you are the type of person whose enjoyment of a show is predicated on your preferred waifu/best girl winning, this might not be the show for you. While romance takes center stage in the last arc, this is still a character drama at heart. Romance just so happens to be the easiest way to add drama to a show given the emotions at play for the characters. I will go into greater detail on this issue with my blog post, so feel free to check it out after watching the show for yourself, or if you don’t care about spoilers. The one thing I will say here is that the decisions make sense to me given the developments across both seasons. I think part of the issue is the 3-year gap between the first and second season has left a lot of people forgetting some important details from the previous season, but it is ultimately a matter of differing opinions.The other thing I want to quickly note about the plot is that the changes made to the story used in the school festival have symbolic significance to the plot. They may seem irrelevant in the moment, but you will grow to understand their significance in time.On a separate note, it might just be my own bias since I read the source material after rewatching the first season with the dub earlier this year, but the pacing felt off for me at times this season compared to the first one. For reference, the first season adapted 3 volumes in 12 episodes, while this season adapted 4 volumes in 13 episodes. While the 4th and 5th volumes that make up the first 2 arcs are relatively short, it is clear the director prioritized cutting as much content as possible to end the season with the 7th volume. While I agree with his decision to end it where he did, the climax at the end is beautifully done and had me in tears when I first read it in the light novel, it feels like a little bit too much was lost trying to fit everything into 13 episodes. I thought a lot more of Tomozaki’s internal monologue was needed to help flesh out certain important scenes, including the climax itself. Some emotional depth from the LN was definitely lost in translation in the anime. Another testament to the brutally cutthroat nature of the anime industry? As if we needed more reminders...Art/Animation 7The character designs themselves remain gorgeous and stand out in the series. The overall production quality is mostly fine, but since the show is a character driven drama the focus is mostly on making the characters look good and their dialogue. I will note that there are a few occasions where the animation looks abysmal, usually involving hand clapping and characters running. The show does a good job of expressing the emotions of the characters through their facial reactions and body language, which is important given how much focus is on the dialogue of the characters.Sound 7Given the continuity with the VAs from the first season over to the second season, both the Japanese subs and English dub remain as good as the first season. Although I want to continue to shout out Ai Kayano again as I do strongly prefer her performance as Kikuchi’s Japanese VA over her English VA.The anime continues to reuse stock tracks for the sound for much of the season, although there are a handful of times that it elevates an important scene using dramatic pauses in the sound and different music than the stock tracks.Characters - 10I really enjoyed the characters in the first season, and they continued to shine in season 2. They remain well rounded and act in a realistic way given how their characters were established in season 1. Mizusawa becomes an excellent best male friend to Tomozaki as he navigates the social hierarchy of school and his drive for self-improvement. Mimimi is the funny outgoing friend everyone either wishes they had or treasures. Aoi is as sadistic as ever as Tomozaki’s taskmaster pushing him onwards towards his goals. Kikuchi is still the adorably shy bookworm whose insights help guide Tomozaki. Tama and Izumi are charming to watch as they navigate their own personal struggles with changing who they are. All these characters mentioned, with perhaps a notable exception for Aoi, receive development this season as they continue their own personal journey of growth during adolescence, inspired in part by Tomozaki. It is a testament to the character writing that I can imagine all 5 of Aoi, Fuuka, Izumi, Mimimi, and Tama as viable love interests for Tomozaki under the right circumstances when Aoi starts questioning Tomozaki about who he is interested in. They have all received enough development, and Tomozaki has spent enough time with all of them over the 6 months that have elapsed since he started changing, to connect with all of them and establish chemistry in different ways, even if most of them will just be friends.One of the great things about Tomozaki’s character is that despite the improvements he has had made over the past 6 months, he will backslide when confronted with situations that push him too far outside his comfort zone. He has spent too many years believing he is a bottom-tier character in life to overcome that self-doubt so quickly. For me, it is good character writing for him to fall back on his old ways of thinking and behavior in those moments until he starts making the biggest change of all: Changing his perception of himself via his own self-esteem.Enjoyment – 9Despite my complaints about a few issues with the show I still enjoyed it immensely. It’s a rare show for me that manages to be dramatic without feeling melodramatic, while also successfully balancing the romance and comedy together. It’s become one of my favorite series that I am happy to rewatch just because I enjoy the characters and story such that even knowing what happens doesn’t impede my enjoyment when rewatching it. That is an exceedingly rare thing for me to have for this genre of show, because too often these types of shows are either too unrealistic, too stupid, too boring, or just drag on way too long as we wait for the couple to finally get together for me to ever consider rewatching them, if I don’t just drop the show altogether. It is also notable that this show manages to stick out positively for me amongst the sea of self-insert wish-fulfilment fantasy shows that populate the genre. The girls are pretty, but they aren’t models with giant breasts flopping around everywhere for fanservice like a lot of shows. None of them are magically in love with the loser protagonist Tomozaki was in the beginning for little to no reason or are part of a harem of love interests.

In a sense, that is the highest form of praise I can give the show: Good enough to stand on its own merits without the usual crutches used in anime that prop up lesser works.Thank you for reading. a separate blog post that goes into more details on the show with spoilers.Story/Plot 9Continuing from where things left off in season 1, we start with a brief refresher of what happened last season, including the change between Hinami and Tomozaki on their arrangement going forward, with a review of his longer-term goals as well as a new small task for him as part of his continued growth and development. Although, there is a new wrinkle to things now, with Tomozaki pushing back on Hinami’s tasks to clarify that he won’t act fake or make a false confession of love to achieve the tasks Hinami sets for him. It’s a nice callback to the climax of the first season, and a reminder of how things will be different going forward. Expect more pushback from Tomozaki towards Hinami going forward, especially over their conflicting views on ethics. After that, we enter the first arc, the sports festival, as Tomozaki starts gathering information, creating a plan, and then implementing it to try to achieve Hinami’s tasks. Much like the 1st season, while his effort is always there, he manages to succeed and fail in a myriad of ways for all the tasks in season 2. After the sports festival, we get the bullying arc, as Konno starts lashing out in class in the aftermath of the sports festival. Once that is over, we get the longest and last arc of the season, the school festival, with a greater focus on romance as Tomozaki is pushed by Aoi to consider whom he likes so he can decide who to pursue a romantic relationship with as part of his medium-term goal of getting a girlfriend.While this review is spoiler free, I do want to address the proverbial elephant in the room regarding romance. Whether it is in the reviews and/or comments on MAL, Crunchyroll, social media, etc. you will find a lot of discussion regarding the romantic direction of the show and Tomozaki’s decision for whom to pursue. Such is the plight of a dramatic romcom with multiple love interests. Watch out for that if you don’t want to be spoiled. Also, if you are the type of person whose enjoyment of a show is predicated on your preferred waifu/best girl winning, this might not be the show for you. While romance takes center stage in the last arc, this is still a character drama at heart. Romance just so happens to be the easiest way to add drama to a show given the emotions at play for the characters. I will go into greater detail on this issue with my blog post, so feel free to check it out after watching the show for yourself, or if you don’t care about spoilers. The one thing I will say here is that the decisions make sense to me given the developments across both seasons. I think part of the issue is the 3-year gap between the first and second season has left a lot of people forgetting some important details from the previous season, but it is ultimately a matter of differing opinions.The other thing I want to quickly note about the plot is that the changes made to the story used in the school festival have symbolic significance to the plot. They may seem irrelevant in the moment, but you will grow to understand their significance in time.On a separate note, it might just be my own bias since I read the source material after rewatching the first season with the dub earlier this year, but the pacing felt off for me at times this season compared to the first one. For reference, the first season adapted 3 volumes in 12 episodes, while this season adapted 4 volumes in 13 episodes. While the 4th and 5th volumes that make up the first 2 arcs are relatively short, it is clear the director prioritized cutting as much content as possible to end the season with the 7th volume. While I agree with his decision to end it where he did, the climax at the end is beautifully done and had me in tears when I first read it in the light novel, it feels like a little bit too much was lost trying to fit everything into 13 episodes. I thought a lot more of Tomozaki’s internal monologue was needed to help flesh out certain important scenes, including the climax itself. Some emotional depth from the LN was definitely lost in translation in the anime. Another testament to the brutally cutthroat nature of the anime industry? As if we needed more reminders...Art/Animation 7The character designs themselves remain gorgeous and stand out in the series. The overall production quality is mostly fine, but since the show is a character driven drama the focus is mostly on making the characters look good and their dialogue. I will note that there are a few occasions where the animation looks abysmal, usually involving hand clapping and characters running. The show does a good job of expressing the emotions of the characters through their facial reactions and body language, which is important given how much focus is on the dialogue of the characters.Sound 7Given the continuity with the VAs from the first season over to the second season, both the Japanese subs and English dub remain as good as the first season. Although I want to continue to shout out Ai Kayano again as I do strongly prefer her performance as Kikuchi’s Japanese VA over her English VA.The anime continues to reuse stock tracks for the sound for much of the season, although there are a handful of times that it elevates an important scene using dramatic pauses in the sound and different music than the stock tracks.Characters - 10I really enjoyed the characters in the first season, and they continued to shine in season 2. They remain well rounded and act in a realistic way given how their characters were established in season 1. Mizusawa becomes an excellent best male friend to Tomozaki as he navigates the social hierarchy of school and his drive for self-improvement. Mimimi is the funny outgoing friend everyone either wishes they had or treasures. Aoi is as sadistic as ever as Tomozaki’s taskmaster pushing him onwards towards his goals. Kikuchi is still the adorably shy bookworm whose insights help guide Tomozaki. Tama and Izumi are charming to watch as they navigate their own personal struggles with changing who they are. All these characters mentioned, with perhaps a notable exception for Aoi, receive development this season as they continue their own personal journey of growth during adolescence, inspired in part by Tomozaki. It is a testament to the character writing that I can imagine all 5 of Aoi, Fuuka, Izumi, Mimimi, and Tama as viable love interests for Tomozaki under the right circumstances when Aoi starts questioning Tomozaki about who he is interested in. They have all received enough development, and Tomozaki has spent enough time with all of them over the 6 months that have elapsed since he started changing, to connect with all of them and establish chemistry in different ways, even if most of them will just be friends.One of the great things about Tomozaki’s character is that despite the improvements he has had made over the past 6 months, he will backslide when confronted with situations that push him too far outside his comfort zone. He has spent too many years believing he is a bottom-tier character in life to overcome that self-doubt so quickly. For me, it is good character writing for him to fall back on his old ways of thinking and behavior in those moments until he starts making the biggest change of all: Changing his perception of himself via his own self-esteem.Enjoyment – 9Despite my complaints about a few issues with the show I still enjoyed it immensely. It’s a rare show for me that manages to be dramatic without feeling melodramatic, while also successfully balancing the romance and comedy together. It’s become one of my favorite series that I am happy to rewatch just because I enjoy the characters and story such that even knowing what happens doesn’t impede my enjoyment when rewatching it. That is an exceedingly rare thing for me to have for this genre of show, because too often these types of shows are either too unrealistic, too stupid, too boring, or just drag on way too long as we wait for the couple to finally get together for me to ever consider rewatching them, if I don’t just drop the show altogether. It is also notable that this show manages to stick out positively for me amongst the sea of self-insert wish-fulfilment fantasy shows that populate the genre. The girls are pretty, but they aren’t models with giant breasts flopping around everywhere for fanservice like a lot of shows. None of them are magically in love with the loser protagonist Tomozaki was in the beginning for little to no reason or are part of a harem of love interests.

This has been about 3 years if not mistaken. This series certainly grows on you. It is slow and can be at times too caught up in the machinations of social interactions between high schoolers but that is also the fun in that. Pretty straight forward. It does show how social hierarchy and social interactions work in a typical Japanese co-ed high school. All the usual drama and going-on.The series is a bit more hard-edged at times with the bullying case and such. It deals with it pretty well and can be a bit too harsh aw well....In the meantime, it is inching towards romantic times for Tomozaki as he has to choose who he wants to take out for a date. Will it be Fuka or will it be Mimimi? Tune in to find out. In the meantime, it is inching towards romantic times for Tomozaki as he has to choose who he wants to take out for a date.

How many times do we need to hear the plot of the same play with slight variations. The ending of the season 1 gave me hope that the relationship between Tomozaki and Aoi would become more nuanced and that Tomozaki might start to challange her a bit more, and this seemed to be where we were going with how the two characters dealt with the bullying in the first arc, but instead we had a vapid romance arc take up the second half of the season where he chose (in my opinion) the least...interesting character in all of fiction as his gf.

(Think about any sort of foreshadowing of Mimimi’s infatuation...for Tomozaki and Kikuchi’s play here.) It alienates its viewers even during its most intimate because of the rigidity that it’s afraid of discarding for something truly sincere and resonating in its audience’s hearts. With an incredibly mundane script that’s degraded whenever the anime tries to color it with its shoehorned platitudes, the anime remains clunky even in stationary instances, and its delivery always seems insufficient.One particular aspect that I furrowed my eyebrows at whenever inserted in the anime’s already lackadaisical script was the occasional usage of video game terminologies and analogies among Tomozaki and Hinami, which are of a nature so ludicrous as to cheese in the savviness of the two characters in video games. It must then follow that the only notable development I ever found in this season was the virtual absence thereof throughout the second half of the story, of which it becomes more bearable without my personal issues with the bland script. However, the plot that carries such, as well as the presentation that burdens itself with that upon its back, erodes the majority of possible, positive comments that I could ever formulate in my head regarding the anime.Another feature inherent in TOMOZAKI that I would like to mention is certain characters’ adjustment to generic attitudes for the sake of soothing themselves into their environment, for Tama’s character demonstrates a development of that gone successful through the generic conversational jabs she learns from her friends, contrasting Tomozaki’s incapability to let a conversation he isn’t intrinsically drawn to flow. Note the following down: TOMOZAKI isn’t an anime about genuinely expressing one’s own feelings; it is an anime that aims for generic appeal, whether that be founded in its world or in a meta sense. Any hint of sincerity one may derive from TOMOZAKI is shattered the moment one finds that it is about reaching a level of social moderation; the factors contributing to such matter not. Hinami solidifies this whenever one allows her the moment of speech for Tomozaki. Her plans for him are merely only ways for him to reach a level of accessibility and openness to others around him, whether the way he conducts his strides towards the goals she’s arranged for him is inorganic or of sincerity. What matters first and foremost is the objective; the means through which one achieves such is of secondary importance.Tama\'s character arc is spoiled with a script that doesn\'t trust the viewer enough to make a point without pampering them. (No, Tomozaki, I would much prefer this scene without your monologuing an already conspicuous element prominent throughout it.) It is detached from provoking any pinch of engagement from the viewer with its convoluted developments and comical tamings of Tama’s character. This banality is only amplified more with its bleak presentation, utterly devoid of any visual literacy: in the most tense, mere pans and amateurishly but adequately stitched sequences; in the most sentimental, attempts at obfuscating a shred of intimacy by over-emphasizing lighting or tonal dissonance, much grounded in the anime\'s tactlessness to its surroundings. This inflexibility in presentation is elucidated in the latter half of the season, in which the narrative focuses more on character development, one awfully relative to others.Soon, Tomozaki, Kikuchi, and Mimimi enter a love triangle that shapes the latter half of the season, in which the most character development Tomozaki acquires from oscillating between the two main heroines is from the manifestation of such selections, when his introspection familiarizes us with his current discontents with his interpersonal relationships with those around him—soon resolved by the action of one of those he holds a comical attachment to, Mimimi. Once this detachment is enclosed, the character development of Tomozaki remains stagnant, and the nourishing of such shifts its focus onto the two, current main heroines: Kikuchi and Mimimi. Any sort of nuance to be possibly found in his self-resolve is disintegrated for the sake of polishing these two and their personal conflicts.Kikuchi’s main concern is the overreliance she’s refined in her comfort space, which includes her zealous interactions with Tomozaki and her taciturness, all of which have materialized a desire to branch out from her space of solace for what she obscurely describes as the “world’s ideal,” i.e., how she perceives others necessitates her to become, one she believes contrasts her nature to the presumable perfection of the class Madonna Aoi Hinami. Of course, this is all a confinement she has surfaced with mere assumptions of her environment, which ultimately disregards how she truly feels about certain objects significant to her and so is thus only a self-centered overview on the environment. However, instead of portraying the dimensions to her situation with a cohesive fragmentation that simmers the nuances within such, TOMOZAKI figures its best utility to be the iron ladle with which it brews an unengaging approach to her conflicts: So little attention is actually focused on Kikuchi’s development as a character because of the rushed pacing of the narrative as well as the narrative’s inclination to molding a character like a boring university lecture (or a dialogue of minimal stylistic endeavor, for that matter). Viewers are spoonfed the situation around Kikuchi whenever the narrative ever cares to showcase her direction of the class’s practices of their play—the script of which she wrote, and so she balances between directing and scriptwriting, though this feat is hardly ever probed upon, something I consider a missing piece in her character development—but the narrative never dares to come close to Kikuchi’s internal conflict aside from superficial instances of interlaced discord, thereby instead focusing on the environment rather than the character. One could argue that this is a commendable touch to the sort of “oppression” Kikuchi feels from her surroundings that are never controlled under her stead, but the dialogue between characters assessing the situation contrasts that notion by trying to empathize with Kikuchi’s inward discontents. Thus, disorientation is founded by an acute clash between two significantly equal layers of narrative in audiovisual form.It isn’t any less surprising to say that how the anime showcases Tomozaki’s attempts to trace Kikuchi’s behavior are as insipid as the ambivalence thereof. Again, this structure of the story is struck by its attempt to shoehorn the dynamics of all the characters in a rushed manner. As I previously mentioned, the story arc’s focus oscillates between Tomozaki’s relationship between the two main heroines, Kikuchi and Mimimi, of which the former bears a denser application in the plot. Consequently, whenever the focus of the story awkwardly shifts to Tomozaki and Mimimi’s adorkable interactions (with the subtleties in their expressions and bodies a refreshing touch to see, considering the anime’s abstinence from such in other departments), the perplexing abyss within Kikuchi’s character arc is only ever so enhanced. Though I could have tolerated this sort of attitude had it been handled with more tact, the narrative expects us to consistently understand that Tomozaki is brewing an adequate model of her character in the intervals between his charming banter with Mimimi. Indeed, it plays a role in amplifying the shared experience of the viewer and Tomozaki, both of whom lack the layers through which their lenses may operate under, but it is done at the cost of a contextualization that the anime continues to expect you to hinge upon.In the 11th episode, Tomozaki, upon remembering a Michael Andi book of significance to Kikuchi—THE POPPER ON RAPTOR ISLE—decides to leaf through it overnight. Unlike the several, vivid drafts of Kikuchi’s play, crudely titled MY UNFAMILIAR WAY TO FLY, that are iterated throughout the course of this story arc, the details of the book are simplified so as to deliver a single, direct unveiling of Kikuchi’s character. Naturally, in eschewing the fine minutiae—a characteristic that Kikuchi unequivocally scopes upon due to her inclination towards nuanced character writing, as implied throughout her numerous chats with Tomozaki—the impact intended in such a blow is lost, felt to be shoehorned at best, blundered at worst. This juncture only worsens as the scene progresses, as Tomozaki suggests elements that even the viewer is disillusioned about considering their unfamiliarity of the work being importantly referenced at the moment. He provides her a push that feels weightless to the viewer, so the only good the scene does then is to continue the plot with a forced development.Moreover, since Kikuchi’s play’s drafts are iterated throughout the story arc with the essential elements intact (thus decently forming a cohesive whole I shan’t complain about much), the whiplash upon seeing it being shoddily performed on the stage is of attention to my withered eyes. With already salient symbolism that abandons any nuance or subtlety in the concocting of the play and the visceral feelings Kikuchi holds for it, it’s a shallow enough article of reliance that the narrative frequently uses to express Kikuchi’s current states of thought. Bulldozing through the sordidly rigid-looking postures and actions of the actors—of which the characters they portray are representative of Hinami, Tomozaki, and Kikuchi’s personalities (although you already knew that considering the fact that Mimimi utters them with complete conviction, used as devices for maximized comprehensibility of the situation and plot progression, another nail to the head on the anime’s on-the-nose approach to its narrative)—numerous moments of spatial inconsistency, a condensed performance of the story that the viewer’s become all too familiar with, and the other pompous characteristics it blindly wears, one finds Kikuchi’s mundane attitude towards Tomozaki according to her “ideal world.”Again, since any shred of character development Tomozaki could’ve attained through this story arc is eschewed for the sake of developing the main heroines instead, Tomozaki is at a stagnance. Though he may have been dejected for a while after understanding Kikuchi’s intentions with that bewildering and perplexing conclusion, a little push from Mimimi sends him to convince Kikuchi in a world that would be ideal for her: not through her words, but through his. Throughout the anime, Tomozaki has always refined Kikuchi’s ideals by offering his own thoughts that then supersede her perceptions for the presupposed “better.” He tells her about refining her solace in the world instead, for that is what she is truly passionate about. Therefore, Kikuchi’s character development isn’t the embracement of a world by her unadulterated accord, but a refinement of it—pertaining to her personal desires—with her reliance on Tomozaki. Therefore, Kikuchi’s character development is practically nil. Of course, her relationship with Tomozaki has deepened, but her state as a character is essentially the same as always, a girl passionate about nuanced artistic expression through language and reliant on Tomozaki as a supporting pillar. However, this holds little difference to her starting square. The whole point of her taking the courage she needed to shape the class play was for her to develop as a girl who others could rely on, for she was dissatisfied with her preceding notions of bonds, but Tomozaki tells her that it’s okay to regress to that as long as she can still branch out while in that state, which is something that Kikuchi had already been doing. Him opening up about this only made her slightly more demanding of his attention—the absolute crux of this character development nonsense. As with how Tomozaki oscillates between Kikuchi and Mimimi in his romantic endeavors, Kikuchi’s story arc has been loaded with her oscillating between the “world’s ideals,” as perceived by herself which immediately questions the concreteness of such a phrase, and her desires—one tiresome, lackadaisical treatment of character writing akin to that of a ping pong match.On the other hand, Mimimi’s inner conflicts are more romantically centered than those of Kikuchi’s. Mimimi constantly finds herself in a conundrum with the mass of girls she finds to be held in a potentially romantic regard for Tomozaki, though a fair number of these are her little delusions, such as the moment in which she encounters Tomozaki’s co-worker Tsugumi Narita and her friends and proceeds to comically doubt his decency as a man. Mimimi’s character development is rooted more in resilience and acceptance, as she cherishes the transient moments she shares with Tomozaki while hiding herself with a face of acceptance of his state of affairs, a passive approach that contrasts Kikuchi’s active actions to cater to a world she deems “ideal” in her story arc.Besides a few savory moments ruined by the anime’s insipid production values, the moments in which Mimimi interacts with Tomozaki are brimmed with the appropriate atmosphere and tone. Though their snark is repetitive, it feels digestible from a mellow perspective of an adorkable couple of high school children with a romantic ambivalence tied to their relationship. Mimimi can act in rather exaggerated ways, but they complement the density and rigidity of an individual like Tomozaki. The script doesn’t particularly flourish around these instances, but it definitely has a standard that suffices the dynamics between the two, and it pertains to said dynamic enough to be free of acute criticism.However, as with the case of Kikuchi, I find the anime to be too afraid of shifting character perspectives for a satisfactory amount of time. Because of its adherence to unfolding through the lenses of the protagonist Tomozaki, it misses the moments in which Tomozaki’s presence cannot be savored by the environment. When Mimimi tolerates Tomozaki leaving the park to focus on the play with Kikuchi, I wish to see more of Mimimi’s conduct once he leaves. I wish to see the nuances that tug her heart to her desire for him. Most of the time the anime cares to show us Mimimi lamenting over her infatuation for Tomozaki, Tomozaki’s presence is there for her to consider and think about. This reliance the narrative holds for Tomozaki is a flaw that deters the viewer from thoroughly understanding the minutiae the characters bear in themselves, a characteristic I think enhances the resonating quality of a narrative set in one’s juvenile years. Subsequent to pushing Tomozaki to confront Kikuchi about her presumed rejection of him, Mimimi bawls with her broken heart, but that bawling is only a superficial layer to understanding her character, which, once again, eschews the significant reason why this love triangle was set in the first place (to develop its characters).In spite of its efforts to produce a raw sentiment among its cast, BOTTOM-TIER CHARACTER TOMOZAKI 2ND STAGE lacks a conviction in its delivery dichotomous to the one Mimimi has to support her loved one, even if it risks the structure of her relationship. The series is loaded with superficial elements that hinder any possible nuance in its progression as a truly sincere work. Its presentation is second-rate and insufficient to the anchor its content holds with its saccharine desire to reach a level of sensibility and relatability. At its best, one finds slightly nuanced interactions (not necessarily exclusive to dialogue) between characters. At its worst, an insipid, regressive work that lacks the vitality to achieve the humanity it shallowly emulates. Tomozaki is a banal work that cannot balance any of its layers, thereby propagating one mess of a script of character writing, symbolism, plot progression, all of which is never elevated by its rigid audiovisuals. for Tomozaki and Kikuchi’s play here.) It alienates its viewers even during its most intimate because of the rigidity that it’s afraid of discarding for something truly sincere and resonating in its audience’s hearts. With an incredibly mundane script that’s degraded whenever the anime tries to color it with its shoehorned platitudes, the anime remains clunky even in stationary instances, and its delivery always seems insufficient.One particular aspect that I furrowed my eyebrows at whenever inserted in the anime’s already lackadaisical script was the occasional usage of video game terminologies and analogies among Tomozaki and Hinami, which are of a nature so ludicrous as to cheese in the savviness of the two characters in video games.

Unlike the several, vivid drafts of Kikuchi’s play, crudely titled MY UNFAMILIAR WAY TO FLY, that are iterated throughout the course of this story arc, the details of the book are simplified so as to deliver a single, direct unveiling of Kikuchi’s character. Naturally, in eschewing the fine minutiae—a characteristic that Kikuchi unequivocally scopes upon due to her inclination towards nuanced character writing, as implied throughout her numerous chats with Tomozaki—the impact intended in such a blow is lost, felt to be shoehorned at best, blundered at worst. This juncture only worsens as the scene progresses, as Tomozaki suggests elements that even the viewer is disillusioned about considering their unfamiliarity of the work being importantly referenced at the moment. He provides her a push that feels weightless to the viewer, so the only good the scene does then is to continue the plot with a forced development.Moreover, since Kikuchi’s play’s drafts are iterated throughout the story arc with the essential elements intact (thus decently forming a cohesive whole I shan’t complain about much), the whiplash upon seeing it being shoddily performed on the stage is of attention to my withered eyes. With already salient symbolism that abandons any nuance or subtlety in the concocting of the play and the visceral feelings Kikuchi holds for it, it’s a shallow enough article of reliance that the narrative frequently uses to express Kikuchi’s current states of thought. Bulldozing through the sordidly rigid-looking postures and actions of the actors—of which the characters they portray are representative of Hinami, Tomozaki, and Kikuchi’s personalities (although you already knew that considering the fact that Mimimi utters them with complete conviction, used as devices for maximized comprehensibility of the situation and plot progression, another nail to the head on the anime’s on-the-nose approach to its narrative)—numerous moments of spatial inconsistency, a condensed performance of the story that the viewer’s become all too familiar with, and the other pompous characteristics it blindly wears, one finds Kikuchi’s mundane attitude towards Tomozaki according to her “ideal world.”Again, since any shred of character development Tomozaki could’ve attained through this story arc is eschewed for the sake of developing the main heroines instead, Tomozaki is at a stagnance. Though he may have been dejected for a while after understanding Kikuchi’s intentions with that bewildering and perplexing conclusion, a little push from Mimimi sends him to convince Kikuchi in a world that would be ideal for her: not through her words, but through his. Throughout the anime, Tomozaki has always refined Kikuchi’s ideals by offering his own thoughts that then supersede her perceptions for the presupposed “better.” He tells her about refining her solace in the world instead, for that is what she is truly passionate about. Therefore, Kikuchi’s character development isn’t the embracement of a world by her unadulterated accord, but a refinement of it—pertaining to her personal desires—with her reliance on Tomozaki. Therefore, Kikuchi’s character development is practically nil. Of course, her relationship with Tomozaki has deepened, but her state as a character is essentially the same as always, a girl passionate about nuanced artistic expression through language and reliant on Tomozaki as a supporting pillar. However, this holds little difference to her starting square. The whole point of her taking the courage she needed to shape the class play was for her to develop as a girl who others could rely on, for she was dissatisfied with her preceding notions of bonds, but Tomozaki tells her that it’s okay to regress to that as long as she can still branch out while in that state, which is something that Kikuchi had already been doing. Him opening up about this only made her slightly more demanding of his attention—the absolute crux of this character development nonsense. As with how Tomozaki oscillates between Kikuchi and Mimimi in his romantic endeavors, Kikuchi’s story arc has been loaded with her oscillating between the “world’s ideals,” as perceived by herself which immediately questions the concreteness of such a phrase, and her desires—one tiresome, lackadaisical treatment of character writing akin to that of a ping pong match.On the other hand, Mimimi’s inner conflicts are more romantically centered than those of Kikuchi’s. Mimimi constantly finds herself in a conundrum with the mass of girls she finds to be held in a potentially romantic regard for Tomozaki, though a fair number of these are her little delusions, such as the moment in which she encounters Tomozaki’s co-worker Tsugumi Narita and her friends and proceeds to comically doubt his decency as a man. Mimimi’s character development is rooted more in resilience and acceptance, as she cherishes the transient moments she shares with Tomozaki while hiding herself with a face of acceptance of his state of affairs, a passive approach that contrasts Kikuchi’s active actions to cater to a world she deems “ideal” in her story arc.Besides a few savory moments ruined by the anime’s insipid production values, the moments in which Mimimi interacts with Tomozaki are brimmed with the appropriate atmosphere and tone. Though their snark is repetitive, it feels digestible from a mellow perspective of an adorkable couple of high school children with a romantic ambivalence tied to their relationship. Mimimi can act in rather exaggerated ways, but they complement the density and rigidity of an individual like Tomozaki. The script doesn’t particularly flourish around these instances, but it definitely has a standard that suffices the dynamics between the two, and it pertains to said dynamic enough to be free of acute criticism.However, as with the case of Kikuchi, I find the anime to be too afraid of shifting character perspectives for a satisfactory amount of time. Because of its adherence to unfolding through the lenses of the protagonist Tomozaki, it misses the moments in which Tomozaki’s presence cannot be savored by the environment. When Mimimi tolerates Tomozaki leaving the park to focus on the play with Kikuchi, I wish to see more of Mimimi’s conduct once he leaves. I wish to see the nuances that tug her heart to her desire for him. Most of the time the anime cares to show us Mimimi lamenting over her infatuation for Tomozaki, Tomozaki’s presence is there for her to consider and think about. This reliance the narrative holds for Tomozaki is a flaw that deters the viewer from thoroughly understanding the minutiae the characters bear in themselves, a characteristic I think enhances the resonating quality of a narrative set in one’s juvenile years. Subsequent to pushing Tomozaki to confront Kikuchi about her presumed rejection of him, Mimimi bawls with her broken heart, but that bawling is only a superficial layer to understanding her character, which, once again, eschews the significant reason why this love triangle was set in the first place (to develop its characters).In spite of its efforts to produce a raw sentiment among its cast, BOTTOM-TIER CHARACTER TOMOZAKI 2ND STAGE lacks a conviction in its delivery dichotomous to the one Mimimi has to support her loved one, even if it risks the structure of her relationship. The series is loaded with superficial elements that hinder any possible nuance in its progression as a truly sincere work. Its presentation is second-rate and insufficient to the anchor its content holds with its saccharine desire to reach a level of sensibility and relatability. At its best, one finds slightly nuanced interactions (not necessarily exclusive to dialogue) between characters. At its worst, an insipid, regressive work that lacks the vitality to achieve the humanity it shallowly emulates. Tomozaki is a banal work that cannot balance any of its layers, thereby propagating one mess of a script of character writing, symbolism, plot progression, all of which is never elevated by its rigid audiovisuals.', 'Tomozaki-kun is one of the animes that best represents school life.The second season of this anime came to reinforce what was done well during the first. Reflect a real school life and not an idealized one. Tomozaki is a very real protagonist, because he reflects this desire for change very well. He starts out as a fairly introverted person, who changes thanks to the help of a classmate. Little by little he is generating changes in his life that allow him to relate better with his other classmates. I say it\'s real, because many of us also had that desire for change at some point...in our school life. Regardless of whether we achieve it or not, the anime is responsible for showing Tomozaki\'s change but without idealizing it, since he also has the same difficulties.When I say that it represents school life well, I mean both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side we have that circle of friends that we usually have, with the funny guy in the class, the girl who pretends to be perfect but about whom we know nothing, the dating couple and that friend with whom we share a single neuron. The classroom is so diverse that if you don\'t feel identified with the protagonist, sooner or later you will find a character to identify with based on the role you have had in your class. On the negative side, you can also see the issue of bullying, insecurities, jealousy, envy and manipulation that a person can generate in the classroom thanks to his or her status within it. The dilemmas that the work presents are dilemmas that we experienced when we attended school. Being the bully, being the victim, being the spectators, and in some cases, trying to be the saviors. The anime can touch your heartstrings if you were on the side of the bully or were the bully because it makes you recognize that those actions were and were wrong.We cannot forget loving relationships. The play takes us along the path of being the spectators, seeing how a couple in the classroom is formed and how someone feels jealous because they were ahead of them and the person they like is now already committed to someone else. On the other hand, it also takes us on the side of being the protagonist. Being rejected by the person we like, and at the same time declaring ourselves to the person we like. What it\'s like to spend time with that special person, how the conversation flows normally and how we find each other\'s hobbies interesting while learning a little more about their life with each conversation we have. It is undoubtedly an anime that can awaken memories.Regarding the topic of change, in the last chapters it touches on a quite interesting topic. Change for yourself and change to fit in with others. While the protagonist has this desire to change to be the best version of himself, there is another character who tries to change to reach the ideal version of him according to the rest of the class. Changing your favorite things and hobbies just to force a connection with others and have friends. In fact, something very interesting was said that I would have liked to hear in my school days. ""Just because there aren\'t people in your classroom to share your hobbies doesn\'t mean you\'re a weirdo. It just means you\'re looking in the wrong place.""In conclusion, I may be getting carried away by the feelings that the anime generated in me and praising the work more than I should. It just has that touch that makes it too personal, so if it awakens good memories in you, you will have an experience similar to mine. On the other hand, if your school life was not so good, it is better that you do not watch it because the memories it may awaken may not be so pleasant. in our school life.

Season 2 is a vast improvement in every way on season 1, which was already great. Tomozaki’s character development is apparent and you can’t help but root for the guy as he takes steps to become his own person in this season.I am admittedly biased about Tomozaki-Kun as it’s my second favourite light novel series however, even putting that aside, this season is amazing. When you realise that our boy has gone from not...even being able to talk to people, to solving classroom disputes and leading cultural festival planning activities, you can’t help but feel like a proud parents. What’s cool about Tomozaki-kun is that it doesn’t skip straight to this either. We’ve been on this journey with him, watching him as he stumbled but made gradual progress towards his goal. Even though I don’t agree with some of his actions in this season, I can’t help but respect that he chose his own path for once.For me, Tomozaki is a better Hachiman. The reason I think that is because of how relatable he is. Yes, Tomozaki isn’t perfect and he does dumb stuff. But the stuff he does is typical of a young teenager who’s in this position for the first time. All kids that age make mistakes and do dumb things, it’s part of growing up. There’s a level of realism that his character emanates that most other MCs in this genre don’t.This season is very much about him breaking free of Aoi’s directions and doing what he thinks is best. While Aoi helped him get to this point, he’s started to realise she’s not infallible and can be quite hypocritical. Instead of continuing to be a puppet, he finally pushes back and wants to handle things his way. This coming from a guy who could barely make eye contact at the start of season 1 just felt great. Really had a nice time seeing him grow closer with the other characters, particularly Mimimi, Tama and Fuuka over the course of the season and we even get some romantic developments! Again, while I’m not a fan of the choice he makes, I respect it. This season is all about Tomozaki being who he wants to be, not who Aoi or society wants him to be. He wants to be better and for himself, something we can all learn from.I didn’t like the first half’s arc too much. I thought the drama with Tama and Erika dragged on a lot even in the light novel, but after that this season really got going and never looked back. The festival and play are some of my favourite moments in the story and Project No.9 nailed them. Couldn’t have asked for a better job. This is one of the first anime I’ve seen that has pretty much 1:1 nailed the big scenes from LN illustrations. FLY sensei’s art is stunning, but Project No. 9 got as close as possible to recreating those moments in the anime, capturing that same magic. Hats off to them.Simply put, if you at all like Tomozaki season 1, you’ll really like this season too. You’ll probably find the first arc to be a little dragged out, but I hope you’ll see the significance of it and the impact it has on Tomozaki and those around him. The second half will no doubt be a joy for you, though. People who weren’t fans already probably won’t become fans now. This is more of the same, but even better. For which I’m grateful.

Here’s to a season 3.Tomozaki S2 gets a very easy 8 out of 10', ""Overall, I enjoyed this anime, but I think the ending is a bit disappointing.Throughout the series Mimimi had issues with always being second place, and then Tomozaki chose Kikuchi over Mimimi making her second place again.I think it would have been better if he had chosen Mimimi, because then she would have finally been first, and I think that would be better writing and character development.Plus, I also don't think Tomozaki and Kikuchi had very much chemistry, ya they both improved each other and that's great, but I think they are too similar, and for introverted characters that's not the greatest match. I...think it's a better dynamic when it's an introvert and an extrovert, since when they are together the extrovert will actively push the introvert out of their comfort zone, and in most cases the extrovert is popular and kind of disconnected from reality, so the introvert gives them a reality check and makes them realize that life is not as easy for some people.Though with Kikuchi's character development at the end I think if that continues she might become a better match for him.But I still like Mimimi better. think it's a better dynamic when it's an introvert and an extrovert, since when they are together the extrovert will actively push the introvert out of their comfort zone, and in most cases the extrovert is popular and kind of disconnected from reality, so the introvert gives them a reality check and makes them realize that life is not as easy for some people.Though with Kikuchi's character development at the end I think if that continues she might become a better match for him.But I still like Mimimi better."", 'I think there will be another season, since Aoi hinted that that not all relations ship stand together, and that they are not married yet. so i still think Aoi and Tomozaki will end up together in the coming season(s)loving the art style tho!I think there def has to come an another season, where the other characters atleast to come more out. since it was really focused on the triangle and the whole thing going on with that fight at the startthe story was somewhat predictable and somewhat not, since there are so many options for tomozaki, but overall good anime, liked the 1st season...more tho more tho', 'The cliche stories of JRPGs tell of the lowly peasant at level 1 turning into the hero by leveling up skills, gaining experience, acquiring resources, then finally defeating the big bad demon lord thus bringing peace upon the land.

See you at S3."", 'The second season of Jaku-Chara Tomozaki-kun targets the themes of fitting in and coming to terms with one\'s role in life presented in the first season, and applies it in a slightly different lens: with Tomozaki having ""developed"" in the first season, 2nd Stage works with how he applies what he\'s learned and whether he can truly process and apply his own perspective on these aspects of life and aid others. Viewers of the first season might take mixed stances on the direction of 2nd Stage, straying further away from the more methodological Hinami Aoi-led self-improvement plot of season 1 to focus more on how...Tomozaki responds to the world around him, but this direction grants an opportunity to explore Tomozaki\'s development of independence, confidence, and agency. With strong and confidently executed character interactions and character relationships, 2nd Stage is a well-rounded and recommended watch.2nd Stage\'s forte is in developing and maintaining substantive character interactions and interpersonal relationships. The relationships between all characters, even minor ones, are treated with respect and consistency, breathing life into the characters themselves. Many of the characters remain fresh and distinct without devolving into single-purpose characters. Importantly, the show is able to work with Tomozaki processing the world around him and play his character out in new dilemmas despite him having ""developed"" in season 1. Particularly in the first five episodes, the show is highly adept at pulling off the school drama atmosphere, demonstrating how high school molehills are escalated into mountains in a decently realistic, high school way. Crucially, not everyone shows their cards, and the show allows each character to (at least sometimes) act accordingly to their own thoughts.That the season executes character relationships well is important to emphasizing the show\'s thematic strengths: through character relationships, the show has a lot to say about how to act in life, fit in, react to others, the utility and purpose of putting up a facade, and the contrasts and similarities between improving oneself versus putting on a facade to get by in life. These certainly aren\'t novel themes, but 2nd Stage does well in letting different views on these themes play out among the characters. Tomozaki himself articulates how he\'s processing these aspects of life often, but while the show can be a bit heavy-handed at times in answering these moral questions, it is fun and engaging to watch how Tomozaki is able to apply his thinking to address them. The first season deals with Tomozaki developing his character. This second season deals with Tomozaki applying it.Somewhat strangely, the interaction between Tomozaki and Hinami is one of the weaknesses of the second season. Despite the massive importance of their arrangement to Tomozaki\'s growth in the first season, 2nd Stage treats Hinami\'s instruction of Tomozaki somewhat as scaffolding to propel the plot: in a way, Hinami\'s goals are essentially the show telling the viewer what\'s next. There is a lot of potential depth that goes unaddressed, or is only explored at a surface level. Although Tomozaki can grasp the toxic implications of Hinami\'s worldview and her methods, the show shies away from letting him truly work with his thoughts independently and tackle this tension, and avoids letting the naturally developing unease simmer. Hinami remains a black box that manages to keep things running in the show, which is a little disappointing.2nd Stage starts off with a habit of playing a bit fast and loose with the plot. Key events are skipped through and things seem a bit too ""easy"" for the protagonist to get what he wants. This rush to results does end up in a lot of tell-not-showing, and the show at times dumbs things down a bit too much in explaining situations as they are instead of letting things play out for the viewer to interpret. There are at times random feel-good, uplifting moments, which can be nice but does sometimes kneecap tension or opportunities for more thematic exploration. Thankfully, these weakness do lessen as the show continues. The latter 2/3rds of 2nd Stage takes on a more romantic framing, but does well in contextualizing this in the framework of Tomozaki growing and becoming more cognizant of the feelings of himself and of others. While this shift to romance does make the show much more predictable and leads to it tapping into fairly common romance genre tropes and cliches, the show is able to develop these romantic beats without constantly tripping into the pitfalls of making Tomozaki a one-dimensional character: he\'s able to experience a blend of desire, pessimism, and agency when it comes to life. While Tomozaki being a relatively mature character in 2nd Stage does mean the show loses the unique luster of his awkward season 1 self, it is nice that 2nd Stage\'s direction does not perpetually cast him as a fool. Tomozaki responds to the world around him, but this direction grants an opportunity to explore Tomozaki\'s development of independence, confidence, and agency. With strong and confidently executed character interactions and character relationships, 2nd Stage is a well-rounded and recommended watch.2nd Stage\'s forte is in developing and maintaining substantive character interactions and interpersonal relationships. The relationships between all characters, even minor ones, are treated with respect and consistency, breathing life into the characters themselves. Many of the characters remain fresh and distinct without devolving into single-purpose characters. Importantly, the show is able to work with Tomozaki processing the world around him and play his character out in new dilemmas despite him having ""developed"" in season 1. Particularly in the first five episodes, the show is highly adept at pulling off the school drama atmosphere, demonstrating how high school molehills are escalated into mountains in a decently realistic, high school way. Crucially, not everyone shows their cards, and the show allows each character to (at least sometimes) act accordingly to their own thoughts.That the season executes character relationships well is important to emphasizing the show\'s thematic strengths: through character relationships, the show has a lot to say about how to act in life, fit in, react to others, the utility and purpose of putting up a facade, and the contrasts and similarities between improving oneself versus putting on a facade to get by in life. These certainly aren\'t novel themes, but 2nd Stage does well in letting different views on these themes play out among the characters. Tomozaki himself articulates how he\'s processing these aspects of life often, but while the show can be a bit heavy-handed at times in answering these moral questions, it is fun and engaging to watch how Tomozaki is able to apply his thinking to address them. The first season deals with Tomozaki developing his character. This second season deals with Tomozaki applying it.Somewhat strangely, the interaction between Tomozaki and Hinami is one of the weaknesses of the second season. Despite the massive importance of their arrangement to Tomozaki\'s growth in the first season, 2nd Stage treats Hinami\'s instruction of Tomozaki somewhat as scaffolding to propel the plot: in a way, Hinami\'s goals are essentially the show telling the viewer what\'s next. There is a lot of potential depth that goes unaddressed, or is only explored at a surface level. Although Tomozaki can grasp the toxic implications of Hinami\'s worldview and her methods, the show shies away from letting him truly work with his thoughts independently and tackle this tension, and avoids letting the naturally developing unease simmer. Hinami remains a black box that manages to keep things running in the show, which is a little disappointing.2nd Stage starts off with a habit of playing a bit fast and loose with the plot.

This, as the story\'s major background, is quite appealing to mankind, who like the school-themed genre. Of course, some events must occur to establish the setting. Tomozaki met Hinami and progressed through his ""life game,"" leading to a close relationship with his peers. In this occasion, Tomozaki was assigned the ""life game"" of dealing with social situations in class. As a result, he...has developed and identified his role and capabilities within the group.The way social interactions were elaborated as a game was the cherry on top of making the show entertaining. It somehow prompted me to reminisce about the fun time watching Oregairu, which has some similarities. So, if you are a fan of the Volunteer Service Club, you might have a fun time watching Tomozaki-kun. It’s just like how Hikigaya in Oregairu who has a twisted view on life and hence isolates himself from others was developing by helping students in trouble and starting to make bonds in terms of friendship and romance ever since he was allocated to the Service Club. As for Tomozaki, the encounter with NoName or Hinami changed his dull life into a challenging game. The training for redefining his life in a classroom with Hinami is where it all started.In s2, we are able to witness once more how developed Tomozaki has become and how he has influenced the people around him. Somehow, he\'s made it to a place where he must figure out the value of a relationship and his feelings for the two ladies he wants to be closer to. Certainly, Tomozaki is a total stranger in front of romance. We know that with the progression of the anime so far, it’s either Kikuchi or Nanami. Picking a girl out of two that both have a good feeling for you is something common in rom-coms, and it’s surely unbearable to see the loser after a decision has been made, especially considering that the loser is the one you favour or side with. Although it was heartbreaking for Mimimi, but Kikuchi finally be together with Tomozaki was just lovely.As an anime-only audience, all these dramas of picking a girl out of two have been initiated and led by Hinami, while Tomozaki always obeyed the assignment given to him. Therefore, it will be interesting to know more about Hinami in the future or to see conflict between the mentor and mentee, which we saw at the end of season 1 as the story developed. Although there is an underlying scenario that the MC would end up together with Hinami, so far, the Hinami we have seen is merely a persistent yet sometimes cruel perfectionist, as if she is shielding herself. Nonetheless, what’s the truth behind her facade? As of now, the last episode seemed like a happy ending, which left me pondering about the later story and whether Hinami is the predestined girl for Tomozaki. If that’s the case, what about Kikuchi!?Anyway, it\'s pointless to speculate on what will happen next; all I can hope for is a sequel announcement as soon as feasible. To be honest, the bullying incident at the start of the show was casual in the sense that it was more of a side quest for Tomozaki to assist Tama-chan, but the rest of the episodes were the major challenge. Overall, the ending may appear rushed and unsatisfactory, but not every anime adaptation or production team can meet the demand for a consistent series composition. In short, Jaku Chara Tomozaki kun might have been the best adaptation, with Project No. 9 providing consistent quality, and the overall watching experience has been rather satisfying, particularly the scenes in which Tomozaki appears seated in between Hinami\'s thigh gap, which are absolutely fantastic. has developed and identified his role and capabilities within the group.The way social interactions were elaborated as a game was the cherry on top of making the show entertaining.

Game or not, world\'s best is still world\'s best (or rather, rank 1, I guess).It\' also feels like the story is dragging out at this point with a romance plot being the red thread through this season with Tomozaki building up actual meaningful relationships with people with some substance to them in ... pardon my wording ... autistic detail.Have you watched Lovely Complex? It\'s a comedy/drama/romance show from 07 that I love because it\'s just people being people, unreasonable, uncool but also a healthy amount of maturity that doesn\'t leave you thinking they\'re walking hormone bags.My point is that Tomozaki, the show not the character, doesn\'t feel like it has real characters as much as it has idealized tropes from a visual novel and too much of their thinking is rationally explained.What is interesting is the explanation of social dynamics in their class and how it\'s viewed from multiple perspectives, especially between Tomozaki and his rival/mentor Hinami Aoi. Tomozaki has grown a pair and challenges her on world views and values and both of them making good and bad arguments for good reasons.Mizusawa, the blonde easy going and charming class mate, becomes a friend of his and has very interesting things to say that aren\'t necessarily obvious to people who find themselves to be similar reclusives and social outcasts, that the defensive behaviour you might pick up is repulsive to others. Don\'t talk yourself down, don\'t joke around all the time making yourself look like you\'re never serious, don\'t be a clown unless you want people to assume you\'re an idiot.Do you want to be attractive to others? Not just romantically but socially? Then find confidence in who you are your achievements, what you\'ve managed to accomplish and how you\'ve figured things out. With every success you grow and become more confident and more outgoing.And then you\'ll gain notice and it\'ll pick up, because once one person starts sniffing around you, others want to know what the smell is about and that\'s how you do it right.These are crucial life lessons that a lot of people are missing in life, especially now as it\'s easier than ever to retreat into games or social media.Story-wise there are interesting things going on and the drama is tense but never feels grating, so that\'s great, that\'s quality entertainment. As for the romance... Ever watch Quintessential Quintuplets? Does he go with the blue haired chick, the brown haired chick, the white haired chick, the other brown haired chick... It\'s all formularized to make you feel like anything could be possible. So that part is not terribly interesting.The one negative that sticks out to me is that while Tomozaki has grown, he\'s still stupidly awkward and not always in a believable way. There are multiple bad scenes of him being weird in trying to accomplish set goals and it goes too far. Essentially he loses all his gained confidence and acts out of character, reverting to an annoying brainless stuttering idiot as soon as he\'s in an awkward situation and it doesn\'t play well.Mild non-story spoiler:The worst one by far is when he invites one of the girls out because he\'s supposed to take a picture of her eating ramen for his ""pinstagram"". He starts obsessing over the fact that she\'s ordered a different meal and it becomes this ridiculous mess of him trying to swap their meals and then making up this story about him taking a picture of her as proof so she doesn\'t eat his egg, all the while acting horrendously suspicious and having an annoying tropy stutter.Even the most socially awkward outcast would just ask for a picture and not care about the specific food she\'s eating, mostly to get it over with and not have to make up insane lies along the way.This stuttering ""oh gee, oh no, oh golly no, what do I do, what do I do"" trope repeats a few times and it never feels right. I get that some love this sort of cringe humor, but to me it\'s just not well executed.Besides that we have some exposition hidden in an analogy that spans multiple episodes which is not my cup of tea and it overstays its welcome in my opinion. It\'s not exactly exposition, but it may as well have been.Other than that, it\'s fun. Go watch it. achievement.

The human nature insights that this anime provided are not only more abundant, but much more psychologically correct and grounded in a true knowledge of human nature. COTE can be more about scheming and manipulating, but the way it does is exploiting very simple people weaknesses, secrets or stereotyped character flaws. But JCTK  is way more deeper in exposing and understanding the true psychology of the characters, and explaining how to deal with human instincts to become a better person. This anime is almost a perfectly crafted handbook on how...to improve your social and romantic skills. It dispels all the seduction myths introduced by gal games, giving a true insight into what really moves people, including the hard to grasp fact that self-help books and tricks can teach you how to “fake it till you make it”, but in the end, your own self-esteem is going to stop you from getting better, and you cannot easily fake that. You really need to grow that slowly and on solid ground, otherwise in the very moment you are in a pinch, your mask will break and you will find that even if others believe in you, believing in yourself is the real hard target. This anime is not only well crafted, entertaining, and happily paced without even a boring moment, but if you pay more attention to what characters say or do, looking beyond the anime stereotypes used to create the narrative, you will discover that it is actually incredibly insightful and deep.To sum it up: if I had to recommend someone a single anime to learn about human nature, this would be the one. to improve your social and romantic skills.

It\'s strange yet refreshing that Tomozaki has to make an effort to improve as a person to get out of his funk, but the first season of Tomozaki missed the mark in a lot of ways. It was just barely decent enough to get me to watch the second season, which turned out to be a significant improvement over the first.The second season is essentially split into two parts. The first part is definitely the...weak aspect of the second season. It\'s focused on the most insignificant person out of the main friend group/supporting characters. That was a pretty questionable decision by the author in my opinion, but the second half more than made up for it. What I thought the first season was sorely missing was romance; it was basically ""cut your hair, stand up straight, now you have friends"". That\'s what the second half of the second season is about, and it\'s easily the best part of Tomozaki to date. All the girls are great to the point where I had trouble knowing who to root for.One thing that really stood out to me over the course of this season though was that every character got a decent amount of development. That isn\'t something you really see in a lot of anime... in a lot of anime it\'s rare for anyone other than the main characters to get any development, if that. It was nice to be able to see the entire cast grow, and really made you feel more attached to everything going on in the show. They have the dime a dozen school festival arc during this season, and surprisingly I was actually interested in what was happening because it was just the author\'s excuse to put all the girls into a maid outfit.So in conclusion, if you watched the first season and felt on the fence about the second season, I recommend it. At the very least it\'s worth giving a shot, even if the first half of the season might potentially put you off. Hopefully we get some more Tomozaki in the future because I genuinely want to see where these characters go. I give it a soft 8/10. weak aspect of the second season.

It was nice to be able to see the entire cast grow, and really made you feel more attached to everything going on in the show. They have the dime a dozen school festival arc during this season, and surprisingly I was actually interested in what was happening because it was just the author\'s excuse to put all the girls into a maid outfit.So in conclusion, if you watched the first season and felt on the fence about the second season, I recommend it. At the very least it\'s worth giving a shot, even if the first half of the season might potentially put you off. Hopefully we get some more Tomozaki in the future because I genuinely want to see where these characters go. I give it a soft 8/10.', 'Bottom Tier character Tomozaki season 2 is honestly a really big upgrade from s1 in a lot of ways. It remains a series about self improvement and I really enjoy the main plots of Tomozaki, Kikuchi, Erika, Hanabi (Tama). Unlike season 1 being primarily about building up Tomozaki, we got to see multiple characters have their own self improvement arcs, which was really neat to see. I really enjoy the self improvement overarching theme of this series and it really fun watching other characters grow as people and not just the MC.Obviously there are a lot of socially awkward scenes in s2 as the MC...still doesn\'t fully understand social cues, but I think that adds dramatization and slow buildup of the character\'s ""growth"" arc. One point I really like is when the MC has to come to a realization that despite his low self image, there are other people who could possibly see him as attractive and he has to have that snap back to reality moment when called out on it. Really important growth moment.The only downside I\'d have to say to this season is probably the romance subplot in the second half, I\'ve seen a LOT of mixed opinions on the romance subplot, in my opinion the romance subplot was really well done albeit slow at some times, but a lot of people take it a lot more seriously than they should (as it\'s only a subplot, romance is not the main theme of this show). I\'ve seen a lot of mixed opinions on the romance subplot and people really not liking the season\'s ending because of how the romance subplot ended, but I think it was a satisfying conclusion.However, I bring that up as a warning, that the romance subplot could potentially effect how you feel about season 2, seeing as it\'s half of s2.Personally I think it\'s a really good season 2 and definitely a must watch. still doesn\'t fully understand social cues, but I think that adds dramatization and slow buildup of the character\'s ""growth"" arc.

Then we waste the remaining on a school festival. In the meantime, our hero is somehow shoved into a love triangle with Minami and Kikuchi, which was a little bit forced and an asspull from the author. Of course Tomozaki chose Kikuchi because the author enjoys drinking the tears of Minami fans, it's what...keeps him alive. I was ok with him choosing anyone because let's be honest, we all know Aoi is the final boss/main girl so no matter who it is right now, gets dumped in the final arc. But my issue was how little the buildup was to the Minami-Tomozaki angle, and even the Kikuchi-Tomozaki dynamic was almost non existent in the episodes. Yes, the season showed progress, but it felt extremely rushed because most of the episodes were used for worthless stuff, like the play that got too much screen time, that no one asked for. For me, this season felt like a step backward, and I'd be surprised if the show gets renewed for another season.Tldr: it's even worse than the first season, and the girl with the personality of a second hand sofa is winning...for now. keeps him alive.

The food looked really tasty and the character designs had a unique and memorable art style.The story followed a somewhat episodic structure, with each 1 to 3 episodes being centered around a character who Lee Link helps. I liked each of the characters, and the drama in each of these mini story arcs was pretty good. I do think it could have been better if Lee Link and his cooking were more of a central...focus of the story, though.

Jashin-chan Dropkick,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36906/Jashin-chan_Dropkick,"['Flavor text: Quick, and to the pointless.Jashin-chan Dropkick is about a naked snek-girl who’s trying to kill and adorable goth loli. She fails and gets horrifically brutalized by chainsaws and knives and iron maidens and moe snow creatures and other similarly terrifying weapons. If that doesn’t sound fun to you then turn 360 degrees and moonwalk away, because that’s about half the show.I’m the type that enjoys ridiculous, over-the-top violence. While No Dropkick on Snek doesn’t contain any real detail with its violence, the implication is good enough to sell it. Particularly because the one inflicting such violence is doing it with an evil grin...on her cute face, because Snake-chan is a fucked up individual who actually deserves it, and because the animation is actually quite good for this type of anime. But I feel like enjoying this or not depends on the individual viewer. You either get it or you don’t. I looked at this anime before it started and thought “this sounds fucking hilarious”, watched the first episode, and thought it was fucking hilarious. No deep reasoning behind it, really, I just like the use of violence as a joke.So now, all I really have to do is clarify a couple of things. First off, there’s no story in this anime; you probably could’ve guessed that, but there’s not even context as to why anything is happening in this anime. The first episode offers no introductions, but I thought this was clever. In a dumb gag series, I’m not expecting particularly detailed characters in the first place, especially in a series like this that uses religious references as jokes. Jashin-chan is a devil, so she acts like a cunt all the time. That is her character. Everyone else could be summed up in equally short statements; a quick glance at how each character acts is enough to determine all that they are. The lone exception is Urine (oh dear, what an unfortunate name indeed), who’s the only human of the series, as far as major characters go. But her enigmatic character acts as a landing pad for many of the series’ jokes, in terms of violence and fourth wall breaks. Urine’s character doesn’t have any particular set of rules, which means that her actions and dialogue have fewer limits, which is why it’s funny for her to get a chainsaw out of thin air.Moreover, backstories have a tendency to drag out too long and waste time from the real draw of the anime. The point is that Jashin and Urine have to kill each other; the fact that there’s a cowgirl and a stoner chick make little difference to that. Those characters are already distractions. How they got here doesn’t matter, what matters is that they’re here. Like I said, “Quick and to the Pointless”. This anime doesn’t have much of a point to begin with; it’s all shenanigans. A meme anime, if you will. It exists so that you can put it on whenever you feel like distracting yourself from whatever bullshit you’ve got going on in your life, or perhaps after a really dramatic, intense episode of another seasonal on your list, like Asobi Asobase.Which would bring me into the other thing to defend: repetition. I can’t say that this anime is repetitive, but I also can’t say that it’s not repetitive. Probably because that doesn’t affect me too much when I’m watching anime weekly, and you should also take this in small doses. If you try downing too much of it at once, you’re just gonna hate the taste of it pretty quickly.Jashin plotting and executing the murder of Urine, only to get dunked on in two seconds is a large part of the anime. Another large part is Jashin being an asshole to someone else, causing Urine to violently execute her. Fortunately, it manages to safely pad itself out with some other characters. They’re one-note, but good enough to pass the time. I would complain that there were a few too many scenes of Pekola, as the joke of her character runs thin pretty quickly. Meanwhile, there’s very, very little exploration with Minos, who I thought was a lot more fun with her quirky, but not super exaggerated personality. She feels like the most normal character of the anime, despite qualifying as a devil. But she’s also so normal that she doesn’t really leave an impression. But, even if all the character are one-note, they have a witty enough chemistry to keep the laughing gas flowing. I wasn’t bored at any point.To better present itself, Jashin-chan Dropkick has a surprisingly high level of animation. Not only does character movement look good in and of itself, but the character designs are memorable and the anime has a rather colorful, fun look to it. They likely managed to maintain this quality by shifting into lesser-detailed styles where characters look a little more simple; but note that I’m not saying this is lower quality. They manage to toy with the fine details without making it look jarring. Everything is as good as it needs to be, most of it is even better.But despite all of that, the funniest joke of the whole series is that fucking OST with the shitty recorder. It’s so (intentionally) godawful that I burst out laughing every single time.Overall, Jashin-chan Dropkick could stand the test of time as a solid slapstick anime--perhaps its ridiculous, bloody violence makes it more of a niche pick than others, but I had a good time with it. The show delivered what I wanted, and coming back to it every week was never a struggle.

One of the series that has defined the cultural slice of life comedy series of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past summer.What I love \'bout Jashin-chan Dropkick is the whole “devil aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the assassination arcs really shown the defining elements of how devils worked within the Jashin-chan universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know a lot of people complain about Jashin-chan Dropkick being a half-ass wit that can’t do anything Or...perhaps Pekora being useless. But in a way, I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters.Yukiwo did not intend to create the story with a “badass” character right from the start, toppling people one after the other, no. Jashin-chan Dropkick was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and Jahsin-chan is a devil that is trying to fit in with the rest of the humans and be ""recognized"" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the series. Yukiwo wanted to show that Jashin ""is a character that no one likes because she has the body of a serpent"". You can only wonder what she is thinking, being in his predicament.Watching her grow up as a devil and trying to kill Yurine, but realizing that she is in a world fraught with fascinating anime girls. Watching her friends get all of the food while Jashin-chan only gets a very small slice that can\'t even stand on its own. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards ""omg too much drama, get on with the fighting already"" But I actually liked how Jashin-chan Dropkick had that drama, it fits in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other slice of life series. I won’t state any names.One of the things that Yukiwo really focused on in the original was friendship and bonds. That\'s one of the major theme\'s watching this group of friends grow up together, learning from her friends and becoming a great devil in the process, learning the ways of the human world. This show explores themes of lust, love, epic fighting, and greed to a very astounding degree.The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented in both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that Yukiwo wanted to show the younger generation the main characters of the show grow and the progression and development into well-rounded characters. They had to learn the ropes of what being a devil is like. These devils are put to the test to show how they must use every ounce of their ability to survive and protect the people they love.Perhaps maybe the reason that I love Jashin-chan Dropkick so much and the reason it feels very nostalgic to me is because when I watched it for the first time when it was airing, It was one of THEE most popular anime series on the net and not a single person had anything remotely unscrupulous to say about it. Suddenly after the first episode filler arc, or the not so appreciated “trying to kill Yurine”, it lost its reputation and became a show just muddled by idiots that call anyone a Jashintard for watching it. I have seen how the fanbase has changed significantly over the past summer of watching Jashin-chan Dropkick. It is quite sad really.I still consider Jashin-chan Dropkick to be one of my favourite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because I\'m very infatuated with devils and like the unique way that Yukiwo has created this human world, similar to how I really love Initial D for its drifting. Every arc is something new and fresh so Yukiwo can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways. Initial D had some of the greatest character backstories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully Jashin-chan Dropkick does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most groundbreaking plot twists.I guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I myself am not a huge fan of typical slice of life tropes that are used consistently, but I love how the original series gave us a so much of a more powerful emotional impact to the show. In a way, it felt more humanized as opposed to the more generic school girl elements of slice of life animes. perhaps Pekora being useless.

And from Egyptian-Greek mythology combination waifus to lamias (half snake-half human). My views of the series were already rather positive after episode 01, as there were great many characters who all seemed to add something to the series, and it has only been going for better.From its core, Jashin-chan is a comedy series which is the combination of cute and grotesque/gory stuff. The setup being similar to other comedy series of the same type such as Detroit...Metal City, Mr. Pickles, and the already mentioned Azazel-san. The daily life of our characters centering around demons, murders and various subjects related to Hell. Not, by any means, is this series any more dark nor does it promote satanism more than one bit more well-known comedy series: Hataraku Maou-sama (The Devil is a Part-Timer).So far, the comedy has been rather fresh. Some scenes are pure cute girls doing cute things... except it includes murdering someone with a chainsaw. They don\'t really die tho, just become fucked and appear rest of the episode partly censored/pixelated, bleeding blood whenever they go. As disgusting as it may sound: it simply isn\'t. In this world, it\'s as normal as smiling in Maido dragon. In many moeblobs shows, the meme ""remember, it\'s cute, not retarded."" is relevant. Here is goes ""remember, it\'s cute, not mentally ill.""The art is rather basic. Promotes the cute side of the series more with bright, colorful choices. The character design, as well as the violence including moments, have been planned quite well. For one, it looks silly and innocent rather than being ""lol it\'s a prank"" tier meme when someone gets assaulted, and the design is from the rather original side. Otherwise this work will not be remembered for its production.Thus far, Jashin-san is among the better --and certainly among the more original series that are currently airing. I can\'t recommend this show to everyone as it will not appeal to every viewer, but I do recommend trying the first episode and deciding based to that. In this case, one episode tells enough.

Despite all this, you know it\'s legitimately bad when straight at Episode 1, the producers don\'t even care to open to us about the characters and their traits, and just straight dives into the comedy action.For this reason alone, there are 2 camps: the enjoyment and frustration factors.If you enjoy this series (like myself), the jokes are few yet decent, the many parodies it tries to imitate with the slapstick comedy. Other than the misplacements of the...jokes and such that I willing to forgive, this is yet a decent move in the right direction.If you hate this series (like everyone else who dropped the ball at the very beginning), the violence and gore from Jashin the viper herself will turn heads off, and the comedy will get old really fast. To top it all off, there are barely traces of character development, just their precarious situations towards the harm of another.With that said, studio Nomad (rise from your grave!) has done a good representation of the anime adaptation. Sure, it looks simple and bad, but for comedy purposes the drawings are meh but OK, and they fit their purpose.In the season of less stellar OPs, I thought that Jashin-chan Dropkick had one of the most creative and funny OP sequences, and props to the VAs for the OP song, which I like a hell lot now, and watching this with song lyrics subtitles just up the ante for me.If you feel like you have time on your hands and need a little breather, this series will do, if not go watch others that are much better.

Has some moments where you can get a laugh sometimes when the violence goes to the extreme in that way reminds me a bit to the first season of Dokuro-chan  but that makes up for like 2% of the runtime on each episode and it's always a very similar build up that...takes a long time for an kinda expected pay off.

Jashin realizes that Yurine basically summoned her for no reason, & she has no way to get back unless either her or the master dies. From there, every episode is about Jashin attempting to kill her with her Dropkick or, ''!!!!ROYAL COPENHAGEN!!!!'' She eventually tries multiple ways to kill her which obviously will never work, each episode....This anime's art style is quite addictive & cute! I love IT! It's technically not perverted but it is? It's a weird thing. I'd recommend it for anyone above 15+. You have to be able to handle tons of blood. This anime's music is totally awesome! 10/10 This anime's art style is quite addictive & cute!

This anime's music is totally awesome! 10/10"", 'Considering how often I\'ve said ""Thanks Satan"" in an almost serious manner when watching this show, I think that\'s actually quite telling of what it means to watch this.Story:One day, Hanazono Yurine, a girl who dresses as a chunni goth loli, decided to do a satanic ritual and summon a demon from hell.\xa0 From the ritual, she summons the titular Jashin-chan, a backstabbing lamia who due to being pulled out of her home against her will, is hellbent on committing manslaughter in order to break the contract and get back home.\xa0 But since this is a slapstick comedy, it does not go quite exactly to...plan.First thing to note, while Jashin-chan Dropkick the anime is a close adaptation to its parent manga, there are many differences to note that make it different and by extension, less friendly than its comic form.\xa0 Anime only characters aside, the adaptation kind of expects you to already know what you\'re getting into, throwing more or less the entire cast in your face in the first episode, and the above synopsis out of the window since that\'s not that well explained in any point in the series.Logistics aside, what Jashin-chan is is a slapstick comedy that no matter the situation, whether it\'s attempted murder, petty crime, or being a public disturbance: Jashin-chan gets her comeuppance either in the form of torture, dismemberment, or a threatening warning depending on the severity of what devilish act she\'s doing at the time.\xa0 As such, the show can get a bit stale, as Jashin-chan being an asshole is pretty much the entire reason the show exists in the first place, with everyone else either being sucked into, punishing, or just simply sitting on the sidelines to whatever thing she\'s doing at the time.To spice it up, the show includes several other brands of comedy, most notably 4th wall breaking and referential comedy which add in a nice bit of flair to an otherwise seemingly dull experience, and having side stories involving some of the other characters.\xa0 This is easier done since the show usually features A and B parts to split a single episode into smaller stories instead of stretching them out, though the stories that don\'t involve Jashin-chan are less enjoyable.Solely relying on the comedic factor of its titular character, Jashin-chan Dropkick is a show that doesn\'t really have much to offer beyond an asshole devil and her cohorts.\xa0 Its story isn\'t really anything to write home about, though it does try to provide character development at the end, which I think was unneeded and kind of disrupted the flow of the show.\xa0 On the plus side though, it is amusing for those that enjoy a balls to the wall comedy, so it\'s fun for that if anything.Overview:+ Pretty much knows what it is and sticks with it+ Amusing-\xa0 Not much else beyond thatCharacters:When talking about this show\'s characters, the only real standout one is Jashin-chan herself.\xa0 As mentioned before, she\'s a psychopathic lamia who desires the death of the\xa0 gothic loli who summoned her so she can return home to the fiery pits of hell that she came from.\xa0 Among other things, she\'s lazy, literally backstabbing, mischievous, and that one guy who makes you pay for their meal.\xa0 Which for the purposes of a karma-based slapstick show works wonders for the narrative.\xa0 She\'s the only one who really pulls their weight in the show cause everyone else only surrounds her regarding any antics or situation that she comes across, even so much so that she becomes a bit of a tsundere due to the show\'s need for character growth in its last few episodes.By comparison, her owner and dominant partner, Yurine, doesn\'t really do much beyond being there when Jashin-chan commits some immoral act, committing an even more immoral (and technically illegal) act by cutting her tail off, crucifying her, putting her in an iron maiden, stabbing her with various sharp objects, etc etc etc.\xa0 As a result of this, Yurine arguably doesn\'t have a character, and ironically relies on Jashin-chan to get any form of significant screentime.The only other standout character in the cast is Pekola, who stands out for all the wrong reasons.\xa0 Being an angel who lost her halo and thus cannot return to heaven, Pekola stands as the show\'s B plot involving the world shitting on her while she\'s homeless and trying to keep up her christian morals, making almost every appearance of hers trying to make light of an otherwise suffering and depressing situation.\xa0 And since her entire character is like this, it becomes one of those needlessly cruel storylines that you can\'t sympathize with because there\'s nothing to sympathize withThe rest of the cast kind of follows in Jashin-chan\'s footsteps (or...slither trail) as being background characters to her star position.\xa0 Minos, an anime only character, only appears to be the headstrong cow she\'s supposed to be as a minotaur, and Medusa (despite being my favorite character), spends the majority of the series having her kindness being taken advantage of, being quoted by Jashin-chan as her \'ATM\'.\xa0 The most amusing member of this cast I find is actually Satan himself, who spends the entire series just popping in randomly during story transitions to drop some actually useful knowledge regarding the topic the story was talking about.\xa0 It\'s one of those anime only features that benefits the show, cause it gave me an excuse to unironically say ""Thanks Satan"".Overview:+ Jashin-chan is a good titular character+ Thanks Satan-\xa0 Rest of the cast falls flat-\xa0 PekolaArt:Produced by Nomad, a studio that\'s created Rozen Maiden, Sola, and Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan (they reference this too), the art for Jashin-chan is not special at all.\xa0 Actually, I think the quality is actually below average, since there\'s not a lot that can be said about the show\'s artstyle in general.\xa0 The color scheme is muted and not that bright, the character models are average at best, and the majority of the animation budget is devoted to any form of torture that Jashin-chan suffers throughout this weird 11 episode series.That being said, I have to give Nomad credit for the creativity on some of their Jashin-chan torture scenes, as playing with censorship pixelation, referencing other more popular series, and doing whatever they could to make this average series stand out even more is actually quite commendable and gives the series more oomph than it could\'ve had.\xa0 So good on them.\xa0 That being said, I want to ask Yukiwo (the original creator) why Medusa is...dressed in Egyptian-themed clothing.\xa0 Y\'know, a greek monster...being Egyptian?\xa0 Asking for a friend.Overview:+ Did

in the way that was intended when it was first made.\xa0 By comparison, ""Home Sweet Home"" by\xa0Yutarou Miura is an ED that has a more slice of life feel, especially when pitted against its opening sister.\xa0 That being said, it\'s still not that amazing of a song, and doesn\'t really have that memorabilia factor that I see as required when talking about good OP/EDs.An interesting factoid about this show as well is the fact that all of the seiyuus for this show are all fairly new in the industry, and for what it\'s worth, Suzuki Aina, the voice for Jashin-chan, does a good job at portraying the character.Personal Enjoyment:Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that this series of all existing manga would EVER get an adaptation.\xa0 When I stumbled upon its parent story one day, I swear it was some slapstick thing that wouldn\'t get a lot of traction.\xa0 Yet here we are writing a review for a project I thought would never get made.Having followed the original, I can safely say that this adaptation actually blew my expectations of what I would\'ve thought could come from a series like this.\xa0 It\'s clear that there wasn\'t a large budget and low production value for the project, yet even so, they still managed to make a decent series that worked for what it was.\xa0 I get the feeling that Nomad knew what they were doing when they made this, and just had fun with it despite everything.\xa0 Hell they even made a jab at the Comic Meteor, the publisher of the manga, for this series not being that profitable.\xa0 Even more so, I actually found the anime original content to actually be mostly beneficial to the series, adding more characters and thus more flavor to the weekly doses of lamia torture.So as far as slapstick goes, Jashin-chan Dropkick despite a lot of factors stacked against it, manages to be a half decent comedy series worth watching to those wanting to get a little chuckle.\xa0 Like seriously, this is a helluva lot better than I was expecting

It was fun but I didn\'t like how the MC in that turned into a slob and rude being when she used to be an Honor student.I like the characters and find their Voice Acting, Designs and Personalities all good and interesting.Jashin Is a good character. I like her personality and design. I find it weird that for some reason she doesn\'t appear to have boobs. I also thought that Snake-Women should have big boobs. It just is what I\'ve always seen from those characters. I do like that she didn\'t use to...have some sweet and charming personality but became a slob and rude like what Happened in "" Gabriel Dropout""Medusa is probably my favorite or up there. I always like personalities like hers and I love her character design the most of all the characters. I do like the small amount of Yuri themed tensions between Jashin and Medusa.Yurine surprised me in the fact that I didn\'t find her to be annoying. I can easily see her personality to be obnoxious and her always beating Up Jashin could get bad if it wasn\'t done well. I also have had bad experiences with people wearing eye patches ( I.e Chuunibyou, I didn\'t like that show) So I\'m happy that I actually like her.Pekora I like. I do feel bad for her though. By the end of the show, I\'m wanting her to have found her Halo and return to heaven. Maybe have her get a task of returning to Earth and ""Watching"" The group. I also love the idea that God is up there in heaven watching a Tv laughing while all the stuff in the show happens.The cowgirl ( I can\'t remember her name) Might be interesting. But we\'ve gotten so little of her that it\'s hard to even judge her character at this point.The animation is also pretty good and has its own appeal to it.Overall this is a fun show and as of now, It\'s my favorite show of the season. Might have to do with me not being fully caught up on my shows and not being able to watch much of them/ have some sweet and charming personality but became a slob and rude like what Happened in "" Gabriel Dropout""Medusa is probably my favorite or up there.

Jashin can’t go back to hell unless she kills Yurine, but until then, they’re living together. This is the basic synopsis of the Summer 2018 season’s, Jashin-chan no Dropkick! Jashin-chan no Dropkick is described by MAL as a supernatural comedy show, complete with demons, angels, and all of hell’s creatures on earth participating in this fun slapstick, bloody, slice of life adventure.Jashin-chan no Dropkick is the newest addition to the newish genre known as monster girls. The 3 major demon girls, Jashin, Medusa, and Minosu, have...the qualities of their mythical creature counter parts. Jashin wears no clothes and has the bottom of a snake, much like Miia from Monster Musume, with blond hair hiding her tits. Medusa wears ancient Egyptian attire and turns normal humans to stone when they look at her eyes. Minosu wears cow themed clothing and looks like what you think a typical cow girl would looks like. There’s also Pikola, who is an angel who has lost her halo and is stuck on earth until someone comes to pick her up, but in the meantime she’s homeless. She is also best girl.As you can assume with this type of show, its mostly carried by the scenarios and personalities these characters bring to the table. Mostly interacting with the two protagonists, Yurine and Jashin. Jashin, being a demon, is a terrible person. She constantly does these deeply immoral things to the point it's even fucked up even for fiction. In reaction to this, Yurine often takes some overly comical weapon to do almost as awful thing to her back. Like bludgeoning her to death, or chopping up her tail and making it into stew, or sticking her into an iron maiden. You get it right? Yurine is a genuinely nice person despite her cold personality and the fact that she eviscerates Jashin everytime she does something horrible. Which is often. And she never learns. If Yurine wasn’t there to punish Jashin for her evil doings, then this show would just be a terrible person doing terrible things. Which wouldn’t be fun at all.The show’s art and animation, in my opinion, is stellar for this type of show. For just some slice of life comedy it's pretty great. The characters have a chibi, shiny look to them with some fluid animation to boot. It really makes the slapstick hit harder.In conclusion, Jashin-chan no Dropkick gets a 9 out of 10 for me this Summer anime season. I always looked forward to watching it after work on Monday’s. It's reminiscent to Gabriel Dropout, except more adult, if that makes sense. So if you like that, then give this show a shot.

Unable to go back to Hell by herself, Jashin spends each day unsuccessfully trying to kill Yurine while simultaneously spending time with her and various...acquaintances from Heaven and Hell.The brief look into the story is just half a layer of what this show truly peels out to.Pekola-Makes my heart hurt, my checks smile, and my eye well up with some sort of mix of tears of saddness and extreme laughter, this poor Angel with not halo nor money, who is on the street starving....will make you ach and laugh as she is at the mercy of the kindness of a witch (Yurine) while consistently be isolated taunted and chastised by the serpent devil  Jashin.The story its self overall presents its self in somewhat an episodic format, missing a week wont doom you. The episodes themselves play out in somewhat of a segment format with one episode running 3-4 segments all progressing towards the fall jashin and her next death by the hands of Yurine.Medusa- the enabler of jashin, typical ditzy attitude but is aware when people are trying to get over on her, good friend to Jashin enables her bad habits, but just wants to see her happy, the running gag is she wears a paper bag when in the human worldMinos- A minatur demon who has no issues with eating beef, right now her character is just there she is more of the comedic relife, she doesn\'t enable Jashin but is quick to state obvious of the situation.This is a studio Nomad production most famously known for (Rozen Maiden) to sum up Studio Nomads work, its the nail that doesnt stick out, but does it job.

It has it's flaws on the story, the biggest one, for me, being the devil girl who is searching for Jashin-chan but due to comical reasons never finds her, and only gets a small glimpse of her in the last episode, it's funny, but it left me questioning what the point of this charter is.Another thing I found confusing in the the story is that it was never explained, unless you watch the theme song (which I skipped at first), how Yurine summoned Jashin-chan into the world, and instead,...the first episode was just a normal episode that focused on the events after Yurine summoned Jashin-chan.Other than that, I honestly enjoyed the show, and would definitely recommend it if you're bored and want to binge on something funny.

It sets a tone in the first episode that is maintained throughout the run of the show.Jashin-chan is probably one of the most selfish and contemptible protagonists I've ever watched. Fortunately there is a cast of supporting characters to keep her and all her various antics in check. Usually this is in the form of Jashin-chan being brutally dismembered. So expect a lot of very over the top scenarios and absurd behavior from this cast of characters. But at times...this show can surprise you with moments of levity and wholesome interaction between it's characters. I was pleasantly surprised by the large amount of references to other media that were made in several episodes. The anime almost takes on the pace of a sketch comedy show, or a very self referential sit-com. In all, it was quite entertaining and very re-watchable. I'll be checking out more of this anime's other seasons in the near future. this show can surprise you with moments of levity and wholesome interaction between it's characters.

If there was a likely comparison LA would put on Jashin-chan Dropkick, then it would be in a similar comedic genre as Gabriel Dropout, heck they even have the entire angels and demon thing, character degrading jokes, just swap out the main protagonist wanting to have a NEET life with the main protagonist now wanting to kill her summoner in order to go back to hell and failing every chance she gets....Both animes really have the slapstick comedy down just that Jashin-chan Dropkick being in the more physically violent compared to Gabriel Dropout\'s more verbal insults.OK, so comparisons out of the way, so how is Jashin-chan Dropkick\'s comedy as a standalone, well with many comedies, have their running gags and much like Gabriel Dropout, runs it\'s running gags to the ground, be it in different settings you KNOW where the gags are going once it initiates itself every time. Jashin-chan Dropkick also is meta as many of it\'s characters KNOWS it\'s an anime and gives jokes about it knowing it\'s an anime whenever it wants the main user being Jashin-chan herself. Really Jashin-chan Dropkick\'s comedy runs the gambit of comedy tropes within the setting of ""demons or monsters + slapstick comedy"", like honestly the comedy isn\'t that horrible, LA did laugh at it\'s jokes but only when the jokes were one-off witty banter and outside the typical running gags. Jashin-chan Dropkick\'s comedy is mediocre but typically competent mediocre comedy nonetheless.LA really didn\'t go into it\'s characters so let\'s move onto that. The titular Jashin-chan voiced by Aina Suzuki is the butt monkey of the anime and for one of the main protagonist...yeah it\'s a slapstick comedy alright, the summoner and one dishing out the dirt to Jashin-chan being Yurine Hanazono voiced by Nichika Oomori and she\'s the stoic snake killing-eating no sell lolita teenager. Other cast members are Medusa voiced by Miyu Tomita, a shy, naive and gullible character that is an utter pushover towards Jashin-chan, Minosu voiced by Chiaki Omigawa as the hyper genki, active character and Pekora voiced by Yurie Kozakai, a fallen angel who\'s now in poverty and is also the other butt monkey of the anime, but not has harsh as Jashin-chan but Pekora falls under the character with just bad misfortune, Jashin-chan on the other hand is a total idiot all the time and all her troubles is it\'s mainly her OWN FAULT. Ultimately, the entire cast are cookie-cutter with their quirks and not much else besides most of their running gags driving alot of the quirky plots that appears, sometimes by Jashin\'s self-made situations.There are three minor characters beyond the main cast, which is the in-universe narrator Devil himself giving little tidbits after or in-between skits, Kouji and Yusa voiced by Miko Terada and Kazusa Aranami, two yuki-onna\'s  where Jashin-chan\'s superiorty complex kicks in and boomranged, they also make kakigori jokes because...their yuki-onna\'s, Mei Tachibana voiced by Natsuko Hara, a police officer, obsessed with having Jashin-chan in her *ahem* collection and will abuse her power as an officer to ger her way and finally Poporon voiced by Rico Sasaki, an angel and once subordinate of Pekora but she\'s not exactly a pure angel and that\'s her joke once Jashin-chan gets involved. Much like it\'s main cast, they all have their stereotypical hijinks and personalities and running gags that they use whenever they appear.With that being said, Jashin-chan is an utter troll of a main protagonist, narcissistic and having a superiority complex to the point of harassing low-level demons. But Jashin-chan has her moments showing she is sympathetic in some sense, this is mainly focused on Medusa and in the final episode to Yurine to re-focus it\'s efforts back onto the main premise and everything, but to the rest of the cast..not so much but still seeing another side of Jashin-chan is a good thing. Nonetheless Jashin-chan is the narrative drive of the anime, both of being the main protagonist and the hoist of her own petard alot of the time, creating many of the skits at least having her actions leading to consequences...mainly death by Yurine and then forgotten the next episode...because of course it does.In terms of animation by Nomad, well the animation was expected moe and chibiness for the more comedic styled moments, but due to Jashin-chan\'s deaths being a thing, well many of the animation does get gory...or in this case for slice of life comedy, immensely bloody to say the least. Really, the animation was just decent for such a slapstick comedy, no hyper craziness but instead it downgrades and goes the chibi route for it\'s overreactions just adding in the blood factor which it becomes intentionally censored because comedy. Character designs are of course distinct because of the entire angel and demons thing and Yurine is being one of the only exotic character but with most of the minor characters being unhinged and slapstick crazy in some sense as well, makes many of the characters blending in, yet knowing what their running gags are. Nomad nonetheless had some good yet expected animation for a violent slapstick comedy.Voice acting was both a blend of new blood voice actors (like Pekora\'s VA Yurie Kozakai) and idol (anime or real life) like Aina Suzuki and Miyu Tomita. Well LA is seeing a trend with ""it\'s joke"" VA due to LA watching Jashin-chan Dropkick which is that Aina Suzuki has been typecasted as the no shits-given psycho character like Rina Shioi from Mahou Shoujo Site and now Jashin, only she\'s dialed down because comedy. Overall, the voice work was to be expected and for what LA expected from such a slapstick comedy and where many of the character voices matched their characters but the cast is expected even with their line deliveries, but not much else however. At least because Jashin-chan Dropkick is meta in a sense...and yes they go meta jokey on it\'s voice cast too...especially towards Miyu Tomita.Jashin-chan Dropkick is a mediocre yet still funny slapstick comedy, LA won\'t put it past it\'s characters and their running gags but nonetheless, it\'s running gags are run down the ground, Jashin-chan shot herself on the foot almost every chance she gets, Medusa is always naive, Minosu is always hyper active, Pekora is always poor and Yurine will always beat the shit out of Jashin-chan whenever she does something wrong. It\'s predictable as hell and it\'s meta jokes are fine but not groundbreaking and through this, it just makes Jashin-chan Dropkick just...fine yet predictable, not a great comedy through taking risks much like Asobi Asobase from the same season, but not utterly horrible because of it\'s constant running gags. Jashin-chan Dropkick really does deliver what it\'s premise is front and center and not much else but still it was a comedy that LA still watched all the way through but not wanting more.Since LA only watched 3 comedies during the Summer of 2018, it was definitely the weakest of the trio but being the ""weakest"" doesn\'t resort to being horrible and that just where Jashin-chan Dropkick landed for LA\'s judgment towards it...mediocre, yet fun...but not much else. Both animes really have the slapstick comedy down just that Jashin-chan Dropkick being in the more physically violent compared to Gabriel Dropout\'s more verbal insults.OK, so comparisons out of the way, so how is Jashin-chan Dropkick\'s comedy as a standalone, well with many comedies, have their running gags and much like Gabriel Dropout, runs it\'s running gags to the ground, be it in different settings you KNOW where the gags are going once it initiates itself every time.

Last review I only saw 5 episodes, now I have seen all of them]One anime that I had a ton of mixed feelings about was Gabriel Dropout. It was a cute slice of life comedy centered around two demons and two angels living with each other. It was pretty good overall, but it had some big issues like unlikable characters and some cringy moments. Jashin-chan Dropkick is basically Gabriel Dropout, but instead of focussing on the character interactions it focuses on something else. What is that something else I am talking about? Well, get chainsaws and bank accounts ready, this...is my review of Jashin-chan Dropkick.Story: 7/10In this universe demons and angels come to earth to do things that are never showed or explained. Jashin-chan is summoned into the world by Yurine and now has to kill Yurine to get back to hell. The big problem is that Jashin-chan has no home now so she lives with Yurine and Yurine does not hold back to punish Jashin-chan. A side story that also gets focus is a friend of Jashin-chan and Yurine: Pekora the angel. After losing her halo she now is homeless and has to not only survive this world, but also from another angel Poporon. The story is pretty original for what it is and goes some unexpected turns.Art: 7/10The animation is really basic and kinda below average for this kind of show, but the colours, the visual references and expressions more then make up for it.Sound: 8/10The opening and ending are good for what hey are, but what I love about the OST is that they remix the opening in different ways. I love when people do this kind of stuff and the remixes kick ass on their own!Characters: 7/10The main cast consists of five people: Jashin-chan (aka a more dickish version of Satania from Gabriel Dropout) is the pathetic devil who loves to slack of and is a dick to her friends. Yurine is the silent demon and doesn’t hold back when punishing Jashin-chan for being a dick. Medusa is easily manipulated cutie who is friends with Jashin-chan. Pekora is the confident angel who gets easily persuaded by food. Then there is Minosu. She has no personality except of her being a thick cow. The biggest problem I have is Jashin-chan. Jashin-chan can be extremely unlikable at times and gets away with stuff way too easily or gets punished way too hard. Despite that, this is a really enjoyable cast.Enjoyment: 8/10This anime was really refreshing for me. Even though the majority of humor came from Yurines very graphic punishments, they cover the whole humor spectrum: Slapstick, references, meta humor, puns, all kinds of humor you can think of. It first seem like the anime can’t decide on its tone, but after a while it was obviously that the anime didn’t care about a consistent tone or a nuanced story, it just wants to make you laugh and not feel old.Overall: 7/10This was a pleasant surprise of an anime. I recommend this anime if you just want to watch a dumb anime with a dark undertone and a wide range of humor. is my review of Jashin-chan Dropkick.Story: 7/10In this universe demons and angels come to earth to do things that are never showed or explained.

Unfortunately for Jashin-chan her attempts in killing Yurine come up short constantly. Resulting in an hilarious outcome to which Yurine tortures Jashin-chan in different ways.There's no real story to this anime, and you are basically watching it for the interesting characters and comedy.The art and animation was different but I saw no major flaws with it.The opening and ending were really good. Very upbeat and Super fun.I actually found all the characters enjoyable...yes including Jashin-chan. Even though...she was annoying most of the time she showed her soft side as well. Especially when dealing with Pekola on a certain few accounts.I enjoyed this anime a lot.

Most of the show has no real plot just goth girl getting pissed at snake girl. the only thing that is really different is how bad of a personality the snake girl has. Most characters with that bad of personality have a reason like being jealous or lonely, ect. But this girl\xa0is just mean I would want to kill her just like goth girl. The other characters are also really basic not real depth to them.once again this show is good background noise thats it really. ', ""To enjoy #jcdkm, you should watch it with a different set of expectations. This anime is like a fusion of comedy and b-list gore/horror movie. It's no where as  'softcore' as Gabriel drop out and just tiny bit short of the more hardcore Dokuro-chan.jcdk has its own set of appeal. For those expecting Gabriel Drop out with more cutesy Everyday Life, this will disappoint. and it's very aware of its target audience.For most, you either GET jcdk or you don't. it's really a double-edged sword, since for those who GET it, it's very enjoyable, and offers sort of nostalgic piece of mind every week....For the general English anime watching community, jcdk type anime is most likely bland/repetitive/pointless voilence, etc, and probably not to their taste. This is quite evident between the review score here and the largest Chinese anime streaming site bilibili. Some of the jokes are even hard to translate into English, and this anime relies a lot more on ojii-san gag, and so it lacks some 'punch.'If you liked gabriel drop out you may or may not like this anime because Gabriel had a more familiar tone that's closer to the Hobunsha type anime (kiniro mozaic, rabbit, etc.). But if you liked Dokuro-chan you probably will like this anime.

Episode one is actually around chapter 58 or so of the manga and they skip almost every character introduction and...even the inciting incident that kicks things off in the first place which means viewers who haven\'t read the manga will feel a bit lost. The basic premise is sort of ""Ultra-violent Tom & Jerry crossed with Seinfeld but with demons and angels"" and granted, it isn\'t really plot driven so you can kind of pick up the archetypes in media res, but even as far as the third season the effects of skipping so much are still felt to the point where they make meta jokes out of it and point out which volume of the manga the skipped plot-point is in.That said though, it makes a fantastic companion piece to the manga if you have read it. Unlike a lot of shows that are 1 to 1 shot for shot retellings of the source material, but in a different medium, the Jashin-Chan anime is more like a remix. You\'ll get scenes, stories and gags from the original, but small gags from the manga will be expanded into their own little storylines and there\'s a lot of new glue holding things together. Sometimes when I read a manga or watch an anime after consuming the source, it kind of feels like going through the motions because I know what happens, but Jashin-Chan actually keeps things fresh even if you\'ve read every page. My favorite character ended up being the Baphomet Devil Narrator who doesn\'t even have any lines in the manga, but fills in the scene transitions of the anime with all kinds of wacky gags and strange trivia. The voice actors are all perfect and almost exactly match how I imagined them reading the manga, the artwork is constantly gorgeous (especially for a gag series), and the characters are as lively and fun as ever.The real charm of the Jashin-verse is how the more you consume it, the more it feels like a living world. It\'s not just Jashin-Chan and her battles with Yurine, but all the characters around her have their own lives that just happen to intersect with Jashin\'s antics, and even the smaller background characters like the three otakus who follow the angels everywhere or Pekora\'s part-time manager kind of have their own rhythms and gags that develop over time. There are some gags that just straight up wouldn\'t be doable in a manga (like Jashin-chan\'s impressive but insane song she works on over the course of the series) so they know how to take advantage of the medium. Most of all I think it\'s the tone that I really appreciate about this series. When doing a dark comedy it can be tempting to make everyone unrelentingly awful or just have cruel things happen for the sake of laughs, but while Jashin-Chan is a very violent series, it also has a ton of sincerity and knows when to let the characters be nice, have a good moment, or even grow as people without pulling the rug out from under it as a joke. Most of the cast is deranged, evil, or insane to some degree and there\'s maybe 4 characters total you could call ""well-adjusted"" but somehow they all generally get along at the end of the day and you want to tune in to see what else they\'re doing next.While I do think this series is best-served after reading the original manga, the anime version still grows into something complex and beautiful with a lot of original material, and the fun thing about this type of comedy series is that anything extra isn\'t really ""filler"" so much as it\'s more hilarious chaos with characters you already love. I eagerly await whatever comes next. even the inciting incident that kicks things off in the first place which means viewers who haven\'t read the manga will feel a bit lost.

I eagerly await whatever comes next.', ""The classic mantra of “Watch three episodes before deciding to drop an anime” saved this one for me. (Though realistically it was more like four or five.)Dropkick On My Devil has a rough start. Literally — it drops you right into the story with no explanation. Hopefully you read the synopsis, but even if you did it’s a stilted introduction. From there, it plays out like you’d expect from reading the synopsis: Jashin-chan tries to kill Yurine in some way, fails, then gets a gory punishment. There are things like supporting character interactions to make each section long enough, but that’s the general gist of...it…but only to a point.If you’re coming here to see how many murder ideas and fatalities the writer could come up with, you won’t get much of that here.Before getting into that though, the question might be “What makes this beginning part so unenjoyable?” The biggest problem is Jashin-chan — the main character — being insufferable. She’s cocky, annoying, and cruel. The point is probably to make her that way so her getting what she deserves (and then some) is satisfying. But personally she was just making the whole experience unenjoyable for me. Adding plenty of fourth wall breaking and random stuff on top of that was more annoying than anything. (You might also not like the fact that she’s always naked for the entire anime sans a couple of segments.)However, by around Episode 3, the anime starts to change. First, the whole “murder” plot of the anime stops happening for the most part. Jashin-chan only has the occasional thoughts of killing Yurine. Yurine subsequently doesn’t maim her too much, mainly only doing so for minor things like Jashin-chan being rude or lying.  The violence that’s inflicted is turned down as well. From here, the anime becomes more of a slice-of-life that follows how its peculiar characters go about their random days. If you came here for the actual premise of the anime, you’ll no-doubt be disappointed. However, a fan of the slice-of-life genre might find it to be noticeably more pleasant because…Jashin-chan also becomes much more bearable. Her being mean can still get frustrating at times, but other times she can even be a jerk with a heart of gold. Thus her antics (and punishments) start becoming comedic. She still lacks the art of being an enjoyable scumbag like the cast in KonoSuba or It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, but I'll take it. (And for the record, I think this subdued Jashin-chan could’ve worked while still having her focus on murdering Yurine.)Still, a lot of the supporting cast tend to be Jashin-chan’s punching bags. Medusa is so adorable that she would bump my score up by a point alone…if her appearances didn’t come with the dread of Jashin-chanin evitable (and boldly) abusing her for her money. Pekora’s a forsaken angel who’s homeless but tries her best, making her an easy target for Jashin-chan as well. Another angel has a rivalry with her. And a couple of yuki-onna sisters are bullied by her as well.The only characters that don’t get abused by Jashin-chan are Minos and Yurine. The former probably gets no screen time because of this, which is a shame since her pep is always nice. The latter obviously discourages Jashin-chan’s bad behavior and retaliates. It’s great that she’s so kind-hearted despite her deadpan face and violent tendencies. I suppose the cop also counts, but she barely shows up which I think is a good thing.Thanks to Dropkick On My Devil mostly dropping its plot after a few episodes, it’s hard to recommend to people hoping for a lot of that. And since it can take up to five episodes to start becoming enjoyable, it’s also hard to recommend to people who don’t care for the plot too much. But if those aren’t enough to deter you, I’d say I surprisingly ended up enjoying watching the episodes by the end. At least, enough to want to see what else these characters do in a second season. it…but only to a point.If you’re coming here to see how many murder ideas and fatalities the writer could come up with, you won’t get much of that here.Before getting into that though, the question might be “What makes this beginning part so unenjoyable?” The biggest problem is Jashin-chan — the main character — being insufferable. She’s cocky, annoying, and cruel. The point is probably to make her that way so her getting what she deserves (and then some) is satisfying. But personally she was just making the whole experience unenjoyable for me. Adding plenty of fourth wall breaking and random stuff on top of that was more annoying than anything.

Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17247/Machine-Doll_wa_Kizutsukanai,"['So I just finished this show today, and I am going to give you guys (and girls) a rating for each aspect of the show, and then I will give an overall review at the bottom.Story: 8The story was quite enticing, and it always left me wondering what would happen next, and it always stayed true to the main character\'s goal, Raishin, fighting along side his partner, Yaya. There were really no filler episodes, as each episode had some sort of meaning or foreshadowing that led into future episodes. There was also a lot of action, and the fighting scenes were very well done and...portrayed Raishin\'s abilities very well.Art: 9Not much to say here, I just loved the art in the show. It looked very new and refined, the colors were very good, but the only issue I would have is that the ""3D"" look of the dragon, Sigmund, got a little funky sometimes, but it wasn\'t a huge issue. Very good, better than expected and looked very new.Sound: 8The sounds were amazing in this show. It had it\'s own effect for each puppet/character, and it gave the show and the characters a really unique feel. Sometimes there would be parts in fights where there was minimal sound with a lot going on, but it was made up for with lots of other fighting sounds in other fighting scenes, along with regular sounds in just normal scenes.Character: 8Mainly all of the characters were very well developed, and each character had their own unique sense to display who they really were. We got a lot of backstory on all of the main characters like Charl, Frey, Henri, partly Yaya, and a good amount of Raishin. My only complaint would be that I wish there was more backstory on Raishin, because even though his background DOES affect the plot quite a bit, I wish we got to see more about it other than this one specific scene that happens a few times over. Not a major thing though, as it still made his character very well developed. I won\'t go into too much detail about each character as I don\'t want to risk spoiling or ruining the experience for anyone. However, I CAN say that it is a someone romance/harem kind of aspect a good amount of the times that aren\'t during fights. It doesn\'t ruin the show for me, honestly, because it is made up with the main character not wanting to be a part of a harem, and also with all the fighting scenes and the main characters insane brains to get himself out of any situation.Enjoyment: 8I really enjoyed watching every episode. There were no fillers, so you can watch each episode with reassurance that at least SOMETHING that happens will eventually be brought up in the next episode. I really loved all the characters, especially Yaya, and they just made the show that much funnier and more action packed.Overall: 8Overall, this show was a very fun show to watch. Every episode had some meaning to the plot, it always had lots of funny moments, but it knew how to transition to action and more serious scenes quite well. The show really stood out to me, as it was quite different from other shows I\'ve seen, and it really was a blast to watch. I loved watching each character interact with each other, some jealous, some more Tsundere, along with all the plot and development. In the end, it all came together for an amazing show that I REALLY hope will turn into a season 2. Fantastic show, I would definitely recommend watching it if you are into: A powerful main character (not OP), a romance/harem (not what the story is mainly about, but still present quite often), a whole bunch of unique characters, and comedy that happens all over the place.**Thank you for reading my review, and let me know if there was anything I could have done better, this is my very first review! portrayed Raishin\'s abilities very well.Art: 9Not much to say here, I just loved the art in the show.

We join him as he enters a school of some sort and his adventures as he helps out fellow students in trouble.The problem with the story is that they left out small details that either would have helped explained certain plot holes (Such as why Yaya had to...turn off her invisibility) or complicated arcs such as the Loki and Frey arc.  Both Cher's arc and the Loki and Frey arc both involved types of politics and relationships that weren't fully explained and left me clueless on why Raishin was helping.  The pacing for the series was also fast, the time frame of what was a couple of days to what was a couple of minutes are never shown right, and when combined with the lack of knowledge led this story into a train wreck.Art: 8The art was very good.  The scenery looked nice along with character designs.  I loved how the characters would look when they faced left or right.  The use of CG for this series allowed for smooth animation on almost everything, except for certain action scenes (This is the opposite of what Ars Nova did with CG)Action scenes weren't bad, but there were times in where character movement and animation did not look as well as other parts of fight scenes.  A great example would be the fight with Loki, as certain scenes had Yaya and Cheribum looking epic, but other scenes were very confusing.  If they slowed down the fight scene and didn't use as many different angles when showing the fight scene, this problem would be solved.Sound: 10+Anicca, the OP is a great set up for the series.  The song has a very soft start and leads to a metal guitar riff.  What more could help set up the plot where puppeteers use puppets to fight each other, since most puppets are machine like.  The ED is by far the best ED to come from the fall season, Maware! Setsugetsuka.  It may be because I have a soft spot for traditional Asian themed songs, but this song is cheerful with a very catchy beat.  The ED alone awarded this series a 10 in sound.Background music was there to fit the mood, no complaints.Character: 9A place where this anime shines is in the characters.  All the characters looked amazing as well as had interesting personalities.  One of the few things I did get from the story was enough history for each character to have them be memorable.  Some of the best characters include; Yaya, the comedic yandere, Loki, the rival who hates more than three things, Frey, the girl with a small personality but a set of big brea... I'll stop.  These characters were very humorous and enjoyable to watch.What about character development?  There is none that I noticed in the series, maybe small amounts when it comes to Frey and Loki, but nothing involving the main characters.  Is this a problem?  I will answer with another question, why change characters that were excellent to begin with?  Raishin and Yaya are blessed to be amazing characters from the very start and did not need character development.Enjoyment: 6Although the sound and characters were amazing, the story left me so clueless that I was partially bored during all the serious scenes and most of the action scenes.Also, what was Raishin's power involving Yaya?  Were they all different buffs or allowed different abilities involving Yaya?  I wish they had explained that, as it would have led to less confusing during the fight scenes.  Being ignorant of ones ability that is used a lot doesn't make for great fight scenes.Overall: 7This anime had my head do what the ED's chorus says, maware (Spin).

No. What makes someone the best is to prove themselves in front of the whole world through hard work, determination, skill, intellect, guts, and earn the respect from their peers. At rank #1235, Rashin Akabane is far from the best. In fact, he’s close to the bottom pit of the fall outs. But for him, there’s nothing more he’d like than obtain the title “Wiseman”. Such a pretentious title is equivalent to those of a king and is the ultimate goal of a puppeteer.Machine-Doll wa...Kizutsukanai (aka Unbreakable Machine Dolls) is an animated series based on the light novel of the same name written by Reiji Kaito. The series takes place in the early 20th century in an industrial-like world. Rather than producing cannons and gunpowder though, there exists an emergence of a power known as Machinart – a fusion of magic and technology applications. The series follows Rashin and his automaton Yaya as they go on a journey of both endurance and vengeance.Kinji Yoshimoto is the director where he previously had experience with fantasy theme series such as Quee;ns Blade and Dog Days. Here, he is in charge of a fantasy theme series that molds the themes of magic and science. Upon first impressions, it’s easy to tell this show would fall under the typical fantasy/battle shounen style with the tournaments to prove one’s worth; and you’re not wrong if you think so because the show does depicts itself that way. However, a primary motivation for Rashin to become Wiseman is more than simply be the best. He is also on a quest for vengeance because of his tragic childhood.Growing up as an orphan, Rashin can be best described as a brash and hotheaded young man. He joins Walpurgis Machinart Academy to not only make a name for himself but to also find the culprit behind his family’s murders. It ventures into the mystery zone on a variety of occasions as Rashin also plays the role of an anti-hero. His sidekick is the all adorable and automaton Yaya. Unlike most automaton, Yaya looks like a human in a variety of ways. This is likely because of Rashin’s past where his childhood has a strikingly resemblance to her.Yaya portrays the role of an automaton, a weapon of war but also surprisingly shows many human emotions. This is usually evidenced by her aggressive behavior towards Rashin that borders on obsessiveness. For Yaya, Rashin is her raison d'etre for existence. Throughout the series, it’s shown that her feelings for Rashin is genuine. Whenever his life is put into danger, Yaya would rush into the front lines of danger disregarding her own safety. Of course, this doesn’t always end well because the threats that their opponents pose. And as a normal human, Rashin has to work his way up. Unlike some of the other characters in the series such as Loki, he must prove to others that even a failure can surpass a natural genius. This puts himself on a frustration scale as we witness his struggles. On many occasions, he questions himself if he is worthy of being Yaya’s puppeteer or even a student at the academy. He hopes to not repeat his mistakes and become a master worthy of his partner. And because Rashin is not the typical Gary Stu character with plot armor, he isn’t invincible nor a superman.Despite the duo’s seemingly good relationship, there’s a variety of problems between them. Most of this is presented in a comical form as Yaya takes the role of an overly obsessive character. While not technically a yandere, she is infused with jealousy whenever a girl even comes into contact with Rashin. Regardless of age or appearance, Yaya simply cannot stand Rashin ever becoming acquainted with another member of the opposite sex. A seemingly flaw of this series shows that Yaya lacks a real personality in this way because of her one sided admiration and love for Rashin. The latter treats her affections with disgust and reluctantly tolerates her advances on rare occasions.The themes of magic and technology is a prominent aspect that is explored. The mechanics behind Machinart is explored on occasions although some parts are left in unexplored territories. Instead of telling though, the series presents them with other puppeteers in action. Among some of these including 2nd year Charlotte Belew, the clumsy Frey, the prodigy Loki, and mysterious Magnus. Throughout the series, each of them demonstrate abilities of a puppeteer at various skill levels. Most of them seems to have some sort of objective as to why they are also at the academy while others lacks a true motive. At the apex of its story, we witness an event that is motivated by a grim threat targeted to one of the puppeteers. Although the mystery is not a genre of this show, there come times when the academy becomes entrenched with suspicions that touches on cases of murder. It becomes intriguing to watch because of the standards involving red herring comes into play with false leads and suspects. It’s not as predictable as some might think as viewers will be able to indulge on the movement of the story.Unfortunately, the series’ story pacing feels peculiar on various occasions that looks typically rushed. There’s a lack of characterization involving its cast including Rashin. His past is only briefly glanced upon on various occasions but rarely discussed in full details. While supporting characters such as Charlotte gets more of their past unraveled, Rashin’s backgrounds are vague and is only motivated by vengeance. Thus, characterization feels a bit shallow in this series. Most of the main supporting characters only get some spotlight while others are colored with generics such as the constant apologizing or androphobia. They lack personalities such as Charlotte, Frey, and Yaya. Even more so, there are characters that are introduced on particular episodes with little depth explored on them as well. Being a one cour show, character development suffers on various degrees. There’s just little emphasis on most of them. While the series avoids the breather episode (onsen, beach, etc), there’s bits of fan service that seems out of place. Yaya plays the central role of this as she showers Rashin with affections and attempts to act like his “wife”. The result is usually a scolding on the receiving end with neither party getting satisfaction. Rashin is just one of those guys that are too focused on their goals to care about pity ideas such as love. In fact, the romance of this series is blend and hollow. Don’t expect any development in the romance territory at all. This isn’t a love story of a hero trying to save their princess.The art style of this series is peculiar. It may take a bit to get used to because of its lavish brightness and mechanical like coloring. Most characters in the series are generic in particular Yaya and Charlotte. Other characters such as Shouko and Frey reveals more cleavage than should. Thankfully, most of the automatons have diversity. None of them look similar but instead gives off a unique appearance that can be noticeable. However, the action scenes sometimes seems out of space with its usage of CGI and special effects. On the other hand, backgrounds fits the setting well for its time era with its stylish architectures giving off its old English look.Soundtrack wise, the series is tolerable and at times stands out above others. However, some of the voice actors and actresses’ role as the characters can be a bit frustrating to endure. Yaya’s VA Hitomi Harada plays her role well but it’s a hardship to deal with her obsessive nature. Charlotte’s tsundere like voice can also be frustrating while most of the other characters’ tones hardly stands out. The OST achieves satisfaction with its pacing and matches its tones well, in particular action scenes. The OP and ED songs conveys its theme well. More noticeable is the ED song however that has garnered attention with its catchy tone of ‘Maware, Maware, Maware’.This series might seem like an odd ball in the mix but it can hold itself together on occasions. However, don’t expect deep character development or a linear plot of progression. The show sets up itself with arcs but only focuses on its plot points with little emphasis on friendship, romance, or other significant themes of morality. Some stories seems a bit rushed because of its episodes pacing as well. The way to enjoy the show is to probably focus on Rashin’s motives whether it’s his quest for vengeance or goal to become Wiseman. It does portrays its premise well in technical aspects with the mechanics and setting. The tournament itself is not a pivotal factor of this show however. This is because the series also feels obligatory on occasions to pull out clichés with fan service scenes or meaningless dialogues. If it was designed as a comedy, this show would work out magnificently. But since it does have a serious plot, there’s a less reasoning for that. The way Unbreakable Machine Dolls almost is crafted will leave different impressions for everyone. Kizutsukanai (aka Unbreakable Machine Dolls) is an animated series based on the light novel of the same name written by Reiji Kaito. The series takes place in the early 20th century in an industrial-like world. Rather than producing cannons and gunpowder though, there exists an emergence of a power known as Machinart – a fusion of magic and technology applications. The series follows Rashin and his automaton Yaya as they go on a journey of both endurance and vengeance.Kinji Yoshimoto is the director where he previously had experience with fantasy theme series such as Quee;ns Blade and Dog Days. Here, he is in charge of a fantasy theme series that molds the themes of magic and science. Upon first impressions, it’s easy to tell this show would fall under the typical fantasy/battle shounen style with the tournaments to prove one’s worth; and you’re not wrong if you think so because the show does depicts itself that way. However, a primary motivation for Rashin to become Wiseman is more than simply be the best. He is also on a quest for vengeance because of his tragic childhood.Growing up as an orphan, Rashin can be best described as a brash and hotheaded young man. He joins Walpurgis Machinart Academy to not only make a name for himself but to also find the culprit behind his family’s murders. It ventures into the mystery zone on a variety of occasions as Rashin also plays the role of an anti-hero. His sidekick is the all adorable and automaton Yaya. Unlike most automaton, Yaya looks like a human in a variety of ways. This is likely because of Rashin’s past where his childhood has a strikingly resemblance to her.Yaya portrays the role of an automaton, a weapon of war but also surprisingly shows many human emotions. This is usually evidenced by her aggressive behavior towards Rashin that borders on obsessiveness. For Yaya, Rashin is her raison d'etre for existence. Throughout the series, it’s shown that her feelings for Rashin is genuine. Whenever his life is put into danger, Yaya would rush into the front lines of danger disregarding her own safety. Of course, this doesn’t always end well because the threats that their opponents pose. And as a normal human, Rashin has to work his way up. Unlike some of the other characters in the series such as Loki, he must prove to others that even a failure can surpass a natural genius. This puts himself on a frustration scale as we witness his struggles. On many occasions, he questions himself if he is worthy of being Yaya’s puppeteer or even a student at the academy. He hopes to not repeat his mistakes and become a master worthy of his partner. And because Rashin is not the typical Gary Stu character with plot armor, he isn’t invincible nor a superman.Despite the duo’s seemingly good relationship, there’s a variety of problems between them. Most of this is presented in a comical form as Yaya takes the role of an overly obsessive character. While not technically a yandere, she is infused with jealousy whenever a girl even comes into contact with Rashin. Regardless of age or appearance, Yaya simply cannot stand Rashin ever becoming acquainted with another member of the opposite sex. A seemingly flaw of this series shows that Yaya lacks a real personality in this way because of her one sided admiration and love for Rashin. The latter treats her affections with disgust and reluctantly tolerates her advances on rare occasions.The themes of magic and technology is a prominent aspect that is explored. The mechanics behind Machinart is explored on occasions although some parts are left in unexplored territories. Instead of telling though, the series presents them with other puppeteers in action. Among some of these including 2nd year Charlotte Belew, the clumsy Frey, the prodigy Loki, and mysterious Magnus. Throughout the series, each of them demonstrate abilities of a puppeteer at various skill levels. Most of them seems to have some sort of objective as to why they are also at the academy while others lacks a true motive. At the apex of its story, we witness an event that is motivated by a grim threat targeted to one of the puppeteers. Although the mystery is not a genre of this show, there come times when the academy becomes entrenched with suspicions that touches on cases of murder. It becomes intriguing to watch because of the standards involving red herring comes into play with false leads and suspects. It’s not as predictable as some might think as viewers will be able to indulge on the movement of the story.Unfortunately, the series’ story pacing feels peculiar on various occasions that looks typically rushed. There’s a lack of characterization involving its cast including Rashin. His past is only briefly glanced upon on various occasions but rarely discussed in full details. While supporting characters such as Charlotte gets more of their past unraveled, Rashin’s backgrounds are vague and is only motivated by vengeance. Thus, characterization feels a bit shallow in this series. Most of the main supporting characters only get some spotlight while others are colored with generics such as the constant apologizing or androphobia. They lack personalities such as Charlotte, Frey, and Yaya. Even more so, there are characters that are introduced on particular episodes with little depth explored on them as well. Being a one cour show, character development suffers on various degrees. There’s just little emphasis on most of them. While the series avoids the breather episode (onsen, beach, etc), there’s bits of fan service that seems out of place. Yaya plays the central role of this as she showers Rashin with affections and attempts to act like his “wife”. The result is usually a scolding on the receiving end with neither party getting satisfaction. Rashin is just one of those guys that are too focused on their goals to care about pity ideas such as love. In fact, the romance of this series is blend and hollow. Don’t expect any development in the romance territory at all. This isn’t a love story of a hero trying to save their princess.The art style of this series is peculiar. It may take a bit to get used to because of its lavish brightness and mechanical like coloring. Most characters in the series are generic in particular Yaya and Charlotte. Other characters such as Shouko and Frey reveals more cleavage than should. Thankfully, most of the automatons have diversity. None of them look similar but instead gives off a unique appearance that can be noticeable. However, the action scenes sometimes seems out of space with its usage of CGI and special effects. On the other hand, backgrounds fits the setting well for its time era with its stylish architectures giving off its old English look.Soundtrack wise, the series is tolerable and at times stands out above others. However, some of the voice actors and actresses’ role as the characters can be a bit frustrating to endure. Yaya’s VA Hitomi Harada plays her role well but it’s a hardship to deal with her obsessive nature. Charlotte’s tsundere like voice can also be frustrating while most of the other characters’ tones hardly stands out.

On one hand it seems to have enough ecchi to appeal to ecchi fans. On the other hand it seems to handle it\'s fighting scenes quite well albeit with the use of a little CGI here and there. Action fans may enjoy it as well.Story: 7Our story takes place in the early 20th century (1900\'s). Where science co-existing with magic has come together to develop living objects that have their own personalities. Fast forward a few years and the story follows a young puppeteer by the name of Raishin Akabane and his...machine doll, Yaya. The two must work together to achieve the title of ""Wiseman"" at their academy. A sort of king capable of almost anything. The only problem is that due to Raishin\'s poor grades he ends up in second last for qualifying in the ""battle royale"" out of thousands of students. And only the top 100 students can participate.This is a great premise and I was excited to see how it would be executed. Alas the battles while being amazingly animated... End up being no longer than a few minutes. The thing about this season only being 12 episodes is that it has a ton of pacing problems so I can\'t blame them. Okay, imagine driving down a straight road with a nice fast care. Now imagine that on each side of the road there is the most incredible scenery you have ever seen. Now imagine that the car is slowly speeding up... getting faster, and faster. Before you know it, the lovely scenery has now become a blur of boobs and moe blobs. What was that? Was that just some actual plot? I can\'t tell. In short, this anime\'s first season just needed to be twice as long.Art: 9Oh my Keima Katsuragi... The art is superb. The lighting is handled beautifully. You can actually see time passing as the episodes go on as dusk turns to night and night turns to dawn. The characters look uniquely 20th century-esque. This anime is pure eye candy I didn\'t even mind the fanservice, and I hate fanservice. But damn... The scenery is just immersing. I actually wanted to be there. The CGI wasn\'t all that bad, it\'s barely noticeable but it knocked this score down by 1 point.Sound: 10The OP and ED differ so much, but are both amazing in their own aspects.

It also handled dramatic scenes quite well, where Raishin had flashbacks about certain past events that I don\'t want to spoil but the OST definitely helped with me sympathizing with him. I have to say the the art coupled with the Sound is what made this show.Characters: 6This has to be the show\'s weakest point. Raishin is a pretty generic MC. His motivation for getting ""Wiseman"" is just a revenge driven plot device. Yaya is his doll that he uses to fight she is outright in love with him for some unknown reason always wanting to either marry, f*ck him, or both. This is a long running joke throughout the series and is kind of funny but gets annoying sometimes. Those are our MC\'s... I won\'t talk about any other characters because they are either unimportant or are introduced after episode 1. Just know that every girl student he meets will want his dick for reasons unclear. They are also all slightly moe... Just slightly...Enjoyment: 8I enjoyed this show immensely. The art is what kept me and the Music is what left me wanting more.

Characters were unique except for their shared moe blobness.Overall: 8The only problems I had were the use of CGI and Yaya got annoying at some points with her jealousy over other girls wanting MC\'S dick.

I'll do my best to give an accurate review of this show, though! I will also try not to give any spoilers.Story: 7Assuming that you have not read the light novel or the manga (in which case, you would have watched this show a long time ago), the story if fantastic but slightly confusing. The plot revolves around a futuristic world that has created magic through science. However, humans cannot utilize this magic themselves--rather, they use dolls/machines, or automatons, that can use magic from...humans to perform tasks and battles.The entirety of these 12 episodes is focused on Raishin, a boy of a highly prestigious martial arts clan. His clan is wiped out by someone, but as Raishin is on the verge of death, he is saved by Shouko, a doll-maker. Raishin is given0 Yaya, an extremely cute yet slightly yandere girl automaton, until he can fulfill his revenge.As you can probably guess, this anime is filled with action and some romantic comedy (Yaya's obsessive nature is quite something, although it's not at Gasai Yuno's level from Mirai Nikki), as you see both Raishin and Yaya's growth at a magic school. Even though Raishin is ranked 2nd to last in terms of intelligence, it is quite enjoyable to see how outstanding he is in battle situations.Now for the confusion: the plot is extremely fast paced. Meaning, not everything is explained. This anime makes a high priority in setting cliffhangers at the end of most episodes, and as a result, many explanations are left to be too short. They are explained thoroughly in the light novel (or so I hear), but these confusions are not too important, and can easily be found online if you are set on clarifying some things. I would give this anime a 9/10 if it didn't have such confusion, but  because of this flaw this anime deserves a 7/10 for its story.Art: 8Is there a need to explain? You can see for yourself if you watch the first 2 minutes of the episode :) Action scenes are extremely well placed, and character designs are simply amazing. The art in this anime is better than most. There were some CG moments where the art looked a bit funky, but other than that the art is awesome.Sound: 9Oh my. The sounds in this anime are simply amazing. The opening is amazing, the endings (yes, there are more than one) are amazing, and the voices are amazing. The action scenes' sounds are great as well.Character: 6Now this has some problems. I'm sure the anime could have a much higher rating if there was a second season, but for the first 12 episodes, there isn't much character development. Raishin is the daring person who strives to save people, as always. Yaya is obsessive and strong, although we can see a power development in her. Everyone else retains pretty much the same character save for Charl, who has minimal character development as well. However, this does not mean that the characters are not interesting. There are many, MANY points where you find that the characters are more than what they seemed--the author peels the characters one by one, revealing their true natures and powers. This isn't exactly development, of course, but rather an introduction. This is why I regret that there is no second season.Enjoyment: 10Despite its flaws, I must claim that I enjoyed this to the fullest. Great art, amazing action, and funny romance/harem scenes made this an extremely enjoyable anime. There are a lot of things to critique, but no matter how much there are I enjoyed this 10/10.Overall:7Because of its bland character development and its slightly confusing plot, I would give this anime a 7. Don't get me wrong though--I highly recommend this anime to any anime lover. If you watch anime for enjoyment (as I assume most people are), this anime will not turn you down!

Thanks!"", 'STORY: 5/10 MediocreIn truth, I was heavily intrigued by the introduction presented by the first episode. Set in a fantasy world where magic and technology are fused together to form ""Machinart"" - Machine Magic. The core of Machinart is the development of Automatons, dolls made for battle, and our protagonist, Raishin Akabane is one of the many puppeteers out there: the ones who control the dolls, and fight alongside them.At first, the plot focuses on Raishin trying to be the ""Wise Man"" by winning the ""Night of Walpurgis"" festival, held by the puppeteer academy he was enrolled into. Originally our hero was driven to be...Wise Man by the need of vengeance where he vows to kill his brother, instead as the series progresses, Raishin was thrown around into the family feuds, interfering with automaton production in the world, and entering a mess of harem with almost all the girls in the series.ART: 7/10 GoodUnbreakable Machine Doll features plenty of action scenes, and although some of them may be short, all of them are pretty well animated and will not leave action fans disappointed. Some of the character designs are awkward (Shoko and Frey take the cake) and some of the CGI used (particularly Sigmund) feel out of place as the rest of the artwork look so much different, as if two series from different times are put together as one.That aside, the British sceneries seen in the series are definitely a delight to see.My biggest complaint with the art would be the lower brightness used in the night scenes, my monitor was adjusted to its utmost brightness, yet many of the fighting scenes in the dark are a strain to watch. HD helps a bit, but if the night scenes are a bit brighter, it would’ve been much better.SOUND: 8/10 Very GoodThe soundtrack is pretty decent, particularly the battle scenes, where I am very fond of the use of string intruments into the theme. The piano tracks used in slower scenes are very nice as well.OP is pretty average, in my opinion, it’s nothing more than a J-pop song where you can find in a lot of anime openings. ED, however, is probably the catchiest songs you can find this season, and admittedly, one of the main reasons I keep coming back every week.The voice acting is fine and nothing much to say here.CHARACTERS: 6/10 FairTo sum things up, Unbreakable Machine Doll has stereotypical characters. Raishin is your typical never-give-up, never-say-die, always-helping-others, putting-others-in-front-of-himself type of wonderful man, at least he’s not protected by some heavy plot shield as he always end up in the hospital. Yaya the “strongest automaton in the world” is so crazy about Raishin, that she would do anything for him, anything indeed. Charlotte happens to be the loner, tsundere and a rather poor decision maker.The rest of the cast isn’t particularly memorable, but they tend to act in a certain (awkward) manner, probably in the writer’s attempt to make them stand out more, but that makes them rather unreal as characters.ENJOYMENT: 7/10 GoodThe fighting scenes are nice to see; watching Yaya getting jealous whenever Raishin is together with another female is funny; and the ED is catchy as hell. But ultimately, I feel that the weak and often confusing story and the huge amount of very dark night scenes did take away some of the enjoyment from me.OVERALL: 6/10 FairThis series is far from over, hence the story is also left half-assed. But after watching Unbreakable Machine Doll, I feel as if we are only shown the appetizer, and the main course has yet to be served. Should Season 2 be aired sometime in the future, hopefully more things can be cleared up and we get to enjoy the whole picture.

Raishin is your typical never-give-up, never-say-die, always-helping-others, putting-others-in-front-of-himself type of wonderful man, at least he’s not protected by some heavy plot shield as he always end up in the hospital. Yaya the “strongest automaton in the world” is so crazy about Raishin, that she would do anything for him, anything indeed. Charlotte happens to be the loner, tsundere and a rather poor decision maker.The rest of the cast isn’t particularly memorable, but they tend to act in a certain (awkward) manner, probably in the writer’s attempt to make them stand out more, but that makes them rather unreal as characters.ENJOYMENT: 7/10 GoodThe fighting scenes are nice to see; watching Yaya getting jealous whenever Raishin is together with another female is funny; and the ED is catchy as hell. But ultimately, I feel that the weak and often confusing story and the huge amount of very dark night scenes did take away some of the enjoyment from me.OVERALL: 6/10 FairThis series is far from over, hence the story is also left half-assed. But after watching Unbreakable Machine Doll, I feel as if we are only shown the appetizer, and the main course has yet to be served. Should Season 2 be aired sometime in the future, hopefully more things can be cleared up and we get to enjoy the whole picture.', ""I can probably sum this review up in 3 words: Needs another season.Story 7.5The story is probably not the strongest part of this show, but that's not a problem as the reason for that pertains to plot holes that could be filled with another season. The revenge aspect of the plot is a generic plot element that wasn't really brought up to an obsessive degree which is good becaUse I would've gotten annoyed by hearing about it in virtually every scene.Art 8.5The art and design really stands out to me, as I like how they used a steampunk style setting and used that in the...majority of the series. The one gripe I do have about it was the jarring transition to CG animation during certain scenes, namely the action scenes, but the CG animation itself was utilized very well, it was just the transition that was the problem for me. The character designs were very intriguing and, at least to me, felt fresh and unique at no point did a character stand out unnecessarily and felt out of place to me.Sound 9While the opening and ending were probably my favorite ones from the entire year, the opening because of how awesome it was and the ending cause it was catchy as hell(Spin Spin Spin Spin Spin), the soundtrack stood out very well. I like OSTs that know how to set the mood and for me, UMD's did just that. Two songs in particular were really good and definitely worth a listen to outside of the show, Magica and Bravery Steps(you'll easily notice them if you look them up), and Bravery Steps is probably one of the best instrumentals I've ever listened to.Character 8This is probably where the best and worst parts of the show lie. While each character is easily likable. They also have ticks that will annoy you if you don't like seeing that kind of thing in a character. Yaya is probably the character that'll cause the most division between viewers as while she's a great supporting main character, her excessive(sometimes bordering on obsessive) loyalty towards Raishin is both a good and bad trait as while she has her moments where her loyalty is tested and that's great to see, her constant attempts to, for lack of a better phrase, get in Raishin's pants, tends to get annoying.Overall 8.2Unbreakable Machine Doll is a good series, it is well worth a watch and at no point was I ever bored by what was going on. Despite some parts that felt rush, it never felt like it was a hindrance on the series itself, the writers put out what absolutely had to be seen or heard and did it exceptionally well. Like I said there are a lot of questions left unanswered and only another season will help. If there isn't another season, then this show will be badly hurt by the lack of one. majority of the series.

Yes, he actually says that.As with most harems, the redeeming quality is that the girls...are mostly all great, but the MC is so shitty that the show was still quite bad.Story 3/10The universe that the story takes place in is well written. It is a world where magicians control puppets and have them fight. It is fleshed out and the setting has a nice atmosphere that comes across nicely. That\'s the good part. The bad part is the events of the story. The MC has some insatiable need to get involved in the business of strangers. The writers couldn\'t explain it because it\'s so stupid; at one point they even had the MC say ""I have no idea why I\'m doing this"". Anime with male MCs typically have a problem of having main characters make retarded, implausible, reasonless decisions. This show is no exception. What hurts this show even more is that we are supposed to think of the MC as a badass, despite the fact that he has a phobia of sex and avoids it at all costs.How the hell is anyone who pretends he doesn\'t have a sex drive supposed to be cool/badass? That is really why this show ends up being utter garbage. The girls(especially his partner) are all in love with him and want to have sex with him, yet he always avoids it and acts like the girls are about to kill him whenever one of them tries to bang him.Art: 9/10The art and the art-style is fantastic. The outline lines for the characters are hardly visible. The art is probably the only reason why I was able to watch this dreadful show. While I was watching this, I kept thinking that it\'s a huge shame that this great art had to be wasted on adapting such a terrible story.Sound: 7/10Pretty good in the sound department. Great ED. And the OP was good as well, even if the lyrics were so edgy that it was cringe-worthy.Character:  1/10 for the male characters8/10 for the female charactersThe male characters are terrible. The male characters besides the main character constantly repeat their own introduction lines over and over again because the writers apparently thought that was ""badass"", when in reality it\'s embarrassing, because you know that the staff thought it was so cool, when in reality it is so pathetic that it makes you cringe.The MC behaves in such an implausible way that its infuriating to watch. He has no desire to have sex with any of the women who want to bang him, even when they are naked on top of him. He gets annoyed by the concept of sex. The only thing he cares about is getting involved in other people\'s personal business. He doesn\'t have a desire for romance, or love, or sex. However, he has an insatiable desire to help random people for no reason (once again, he himself states that he has no idea why he does it. There is no reason for it. The writers just shallowly make him do these things so that there is a story).The female characters are great for the most part. They\'re all cute eye-candy and they all nicely represent their archetype that they were written as. They all have generic personalities (e.g. being a typical modern tsundere, or an overly attached yandere), but I\'m fine with that. Anime girl archetypes tend to be great in my opinion, so I\'m fine with typical anime girls. I wish there were more huge titties though.Frey best girl.Enjoyment: 3/10The main character\'s retarded behavior ruined the show for me. I\'m getting sick of Japan writing such dense male main characters who are always scared of sex.

People who give me orders, people who stand against me, and people who tell me that my opinions are invalid. - LokiAll right, so I have decided to review the anime ""Unbreakable Machine Doll"" which is basically a light novel adaptation by company Lerche, who directed one of my favorite anime, Danganronpa & Carnival PhantasmSTORY (8):The story covers 3 chapters of the light novel. The first chapter involves Yaya & Raishin gets to know Charolette & Sigmund at Walpurgis Machineart Academy. The 2nd chapter involves the introduction of...new characters like Loki and Frey. The 3rd chapter focuses on Charolette\'s sister, Henriette, and how their relationship as sisters develop.Walpurgis Machineart Academy is a school whereby they train the puppeteers to control properly their automatons. In the 1st chapter, the school organizes a tournament to the top 100 students in the academy. Whoever wins the tournament, he or she will be crowned ""Wiseman"", known as the Great Puppeteer.Every chapter has one main villain. Of course this is important in most action anime.ART (7):The art style was ok, although the colors are very bright.SOUND (9):I honestly loved the opening and the ending. The opening is ""Annica"" that is sung by Hitomi Harada. The ending goes Maware Maware. By the way, there are some voice actors from Baka & Test who voiced the main characters like for example Hiro Shimono voiced Raishin & Hiromi Harada voiced Yaya.Hiro Shimono voiced Akihisa from Baka & Test while Hiromi Harada voiced Himeji from Baka & Test. I was pulled into the anime thanks to these voice actors.CHARACTER (8):So far, in every chapter, we learn about their backstory of each of the characters like Raishin, Yaya, Charolette, Frey, Loki & Henriette.Raishin: He was incapable of combat but he can control his automaton, Yaya. He was ranked the 2nd lowest in the class due to the fact that he has the 2nd lowest grades in the exam. In fact, he has determination although sometimes he gets easily frustrated. He reminds me of Eren Jeager from Attack on TitansYaya: She is cheerful and energetic and she likes to tease Raishin. One time in the beginning of episode 1, she says ""Yaya is cute, she is the cutest in the world"", I was like so surprised that she tried to put a spell on Raishin. By the way, she is skilled in combat. YayaboombasticCharolette: She is a tsundere. She is very hard on Raishin when she thought that she is doing something perverted.Loki: As you have seen in my first sentence, I have been inspired by Loki\'s statement in episode 5. Loki is smart, calm and composed.Frey: She is quite shy but she is kind at heart.Henriette: We only see her in chapter 3, she is also quite shy and gets easily timid. I would love to know more about the sister relationship development.I really have no problem with the characters, but I would like to know more about them.CONCLUSION (8):So far, I enjoyed this anime despite some lack of information of some episodes. Especially, the last episode whereby the boss in the 3rd chapter disappears. There is basically an OVA which might cover the remaining chapters. I doubt that the OVA might cover the remaining 9 chapters of the light novel. But it would be wonderful to see how the story unfolds.I just really hope there will be a season 2 so that this season will cover all the chapters up to 12.I can understand that the producers did not know that there are 12 chapters of the light novel just before they created this anime. So I grade based on how worthwhile it is to watch the 1st 3 chapters that is adapted into an anime.Overall, I enjoyed this anime. The voice acting was good and the characters are fun. So I give this anime an 8 out of 10.So in conclusion, here is my wish to MAL.""Merry X\'mas & Happy New Year"". new characters like Loki and Frey.

Based on the light novel Kikou Shoujo. Here's my personel opinion :Story: Just keep watching there's more than meets the eye! Cool yet very emotional protaganist Raishin & his doll familliar Yaya whose love for her master is beyond boundaries.Art: The only bad side about this anime is crappy CG usage in some action scenes!Lately anime production studios are using too much crappy CG to save a lot of budget but atleast this one doesn't have slugish movements like...Ars Nova or Tokyo Raven etc...Sound: BGM is great, Seiyuu s are ok too, no problems so far.Character: Yaya is moe & funny. The very unique art style fits the best for Yaya!Enjoyment: Unlike most fall animes i watch this anime with utmost high priority.Overall: And let's hope they will make some follow up season or something in the future.

Not only did it make my hate for harems more vehement, but it downgraded what possible could have been a better story.The story could have held up. Not really, it still would have been a piece of shit. The machine doll premise piqued my interest, but it could\'ve been replaced with a thousand other plot devices and still would\'ve been terrible. I understood the vengeance thing, but that main character fucker should\'ve died. It was like, exactly like what happened to the Uchiha Clan from Naruto. His whole family...got murdered by his asshole brother. I\'m guessing his brother was to be misunderstood in the end. The female characters were just there for the main character, and every other male character was an asshole. I don\'t know what\'s up with anime and making every villain just to make the main character look better. You don\'t have to make all the bad guys contrarily less better than the MC. And female characters can be there other than for fan service!!! Who know? Most of them literally had no purpose, and the MC had to do something to solve there problem. What almost had me interested was how that blonde dragon girl and that Felix guy might\'ve had something. It could\'ve happened, but naw the MC must obtain all ass in a 10 mile radius.The art hurt my nuts. I had to turn the fucking brightness all the way up just to see anything. Everything looked soft and shit. Were solid lines really that hard to make? The CG was like a very uncomfortable rimjob, and titties were everywhere. These two things don\'t usually go hand in hand.I never actually heard the opening, I always skipped it. The ending was okay. It sounded like a vocaloid song I heard once. The metal slashing sound, explosion, and almost every sound in here were very unpleasant to the ears. Some the voice actors were kinda annoying.Speaking of annoying, Yaya was that. She was always jealous or horny like what the fuck? MC was a duller Sasuke Uchiha if that was possible.He never fucking died either that doesn\'t really happen. You die when you are killed. Dragon girl I don\'t even remember, so she was probably unimportant. White haired dog girl did something once I think. There was a teacher or something. Someone had a sister I think. Who looked exactly like them. That brother of dog girl who didn\'t like things. The MC\'s brother was the bad guy. There was another bad guy. That\'s all the characters, I think. The stupid ones don\'t matter.You see those spaces? It was more entertaining pressing space bar eight times than it was watching this series.The machine doll broke my hopes.

Raishen and Yaya's interactions are priceless. I'm not sure I liked Char that much, but the rest of the characters were excellent.I think I liked the ending song much better than the opener though and wish they were reversed.Raishen generally is a very sharp guy, well except for one episode where he turns into a complete idiot briefly, but soon he's right back to his calm calculating self.Yaya is just awesome.

Unbreakable Machine-Doll takes place during the early 20th century where magic and technology are used as one. This is called Machinart. The ones who practice this art are called Puppeteers. Puppeteers use this art to develop animated machines or “Dolls”. These dolls while controlled by the puppeteer, are free thinking. The dolls are powered by these circuits which were originally used for military purposes, however, over time they have spread worldwide.The series focuses on Puppeteer Raishin Akabane and his Doll Yaya. Raishin has made it his...goal to enter a sort of tournament and become the Wiseman. The wiseman is considered the best puppeteer and is a sort of king. Placement in the tournament is only available to the top 100 students in the school. However, his plan becomes more complicated when he receives his test grade as one of the worst students in the academy, which earns him the nickname Second Last. I give the story a 7/10The art in this anime is absolutely superb! The characters looked well drawn and they looked like they belonged in that time period! I wasn’t a big fan of the CGI they put in the fight scenes, but I didn’t notice it at times. I give the artwork to this anime a 8/10The voice acting in this anime was pretty good in my opinion and the music was also great! I loved the opening music. However, I’m not one to stick around for the ending theme song and the one in this anime (While catchy) didn’t encourage me at all to stay (This is my opinion. I’ve heard others have liked it a lot). Overall, I give the sound an 8/10The characters here in this anime in my opinion could have been better. Everyone seemed too confusing at times. Raishin is your standard male protagonist, Yaya is obsessively in love with Raishin (As well as every other unique girl in this anime) and can cause a scene at times in public. Some of the characters do this annoying catchphrase thing where they repeat the same sentence over and over again while changing the last part (This in my opinion is very annoying at times).  I think the characters are the weakest part of this anime. I give them a 6/10.Overall, the anime is decently written, the voice acting and sound is great as well as the art, and the characters are very generic.

It’s safe to read even if you haven’t watched the show.Let’s start me review, shall we?Story: 7During early 20th century, by discovering “Magic circuits”, scientists found a way to give life to countless things. These magic circuits are made from complex magic and highly developed technology. Magic circuits were put into different objects to bring them to life and even give them human-like traits. An object that has magic circuits installed in it is called an “Automaton”, with humans called “Puppeteers” controlling them and providing them the “Mana “ they need to...do certain actions .Akabane Raishin is a puppeteer attending Royal Academy. Together with a beautiful teenage girl Yaya, who’s actually Raishin’s puppet. Royal Academy is a school specializing in training puppeteers and crowning them as “Wiseman”. Wiseman is a title given to the strongest puppeteers. Raishin has to defeat every single puppeteer in the academy to be crowned as a Wiseman.That’s basically the gist of the plot. You’ll learn some more of it by watching it.7’s a perfect score to gauge Machine-doll’s plot/story.  Not so rare these days if you ask me.Art: 9Amazing CG battle sequences alone deserves a 9. Aside from the great CGs, the details on everything are smooth. This wouldn’t surprise most of us by now.  It is 2014, nothing is impossible anymore (aside from me having a girlfriend). A point I would like to add, the manga’s art style’s a bit (itsy bitsy tiny bit) different from the Anime. Not much to mention here.Characters: 8ONE YAYA, PLEASE! NO, MAKE THAT DOUBLE—NO, THREE PLEASE! An obsessed girl character isn’t that really rare for a harem. Female leads and supporting characters in Machine-doll doesn’t differ much from other harem girls. Every girl goes gaga for Raishin. Meh, wouldn’t be a harem show if he wasn’t flocked on by girls, no? Anyhow, every girl in his harem has their own different personality.  Telling who’s who might spoil you, so I won’t utter any word about them. They’re all drawn perfectly, breast size, pantsu color—I’m not trying to sound like a pervert, ok!? Lastly, they’re all waifu material.Music: 8Given that the series has only 12 episodes, there’s only one OP and ED theme.Maware, maware, maware, maware, maware, maware, maware, maware. Don’t mind me, I’m just singing my heart out. That’s the catchy ending theme of Machine-doll. The seiyuu(s) sung it themselves! Yaya’s singing in it, too, of course. It’s so catchy I’ve been playing it for numerous times, even now while I’m writing this!  I didn’t like the OP theme though.Enjoyment: 9I enjoyed Machine-doll a lot more that I had expected. Part of it is it’s been a while since I’ve watched a series with these enough fan service. The occasional pantsu shots and ""other"" fan service moments were satisfying for me. After all, these are what most viewers (not counting out myself) find attractive. So if you’re a fan of harem/ecchi/seinen/action shows, you’d definitely like Machine-doll.Overall: 8I first encountered Machine-doll, if I’m not mistaken, around 2012, ‘course it was on a manga site. I click on the advance search button, clicked genres: ecchi; seinen; harem; action (three of them are my favorite genres). And then, BAMF! Machine-doll was on the first page of the results. That time, Machine-doll was about 25+ chapters. So you can imagine how hang-up I am when I finished reading them. Then last year, Machine-doll has finally turned into an Anime! I was so happy I forgot to watch it for a year (lol.  Actually, I forgot to put it on my watch list).Plot-wise, Machine-doll isn\'t really a rarity these days. Truth be told, I find it ""most common"". But that doesn’t mean I don’t like it. A lot might overlook Machine-doll because of the common plot. I find the 12 episodes too short for a series to show its real plot—how deep it is. Or maybe, Machine-doll is a failure because it hasn’t showed any serious developing within the 12 episodes? Nevertheless, Machine-doll is still a working progress, so it has a lot of potential to get better. I just hope they won’t take too much time. Lastly, I assure you that Machine-doll isn’t a waste of time. But, sadly, if you’re a fan of “deep-complicated” plots, you better pass this up. Ultimately, don’t let an amateur so-called reviewer, such as me decide for you.P.S.I still want my own Yaya.  =( do certain actions .Akabane Raishin is a puppeteer attending Royal Academy.

I am no big writer of reviews though this anime hit me in so many ways I had to add my two cents into it. Machine-Doll has a great concept though there are so many flaws one can not overlook it. I will touch on the things I enjoyed about this anime as few as they are. The artwork for this anime is spectacular. Cute with enough detail that each scene it becomes clear that the artist put in lot of time. The score to this...anime is well done matching the background music to enhance the emotional aspect the scene was trying to captivate. Now onto the things I disliked. Most might be wondering why I say this is a harem anime, the conversation between chars always leads to sexual innuendos, panty shots and girls blushing and getting jealous over the main char. What I found most annoying about this anime was the whininess of ALL the female chars. Even in situations where seriousness should have been taken it was pushed to whiny emo “I'm worthless” crap from the female chars. The storyline, while had a great concept lacked any real information give in the anime. I was hoping as the anime continued it would go deepening into the plot, though it continued to ignore any real depth. The fight scenes were decent enough though once again lack of information led to it being nothing more than an excuse to watch big breasted women jump around. If this anime was any longer I will admit I would not have forced my way through the entire thing. Though to each their own. So if you enjoy big breasted whiny emo girls, this anime is right up your alley. anime is well done matching the background music to enhance the emotional aspect the scene was trying to captivate.

Some people can’t stand it, some people love it, and aren’t afraid to show it, others are fans but aren’t too proud of it, and there are some people who are somewhere in between. With all of these differing opinions on ecchi anime, it’s hard to determine whether an ecchi series is any good or not. How much you like a series riddled with fanservice and that, usually, doesn’t have a very compelling plot is, naturally, entirely dependent on your opinion of fanservice and how much the plot of a series contributes to...your personal enjoyment of it. Now, occasionally, like in any other genre you will have shows that will try to break the mold that has been established by so many shows that have been released before it. In the case of ecchi anime, that often is having a really good story line to go along with the inevitable breast and panty shots. That is something that Unbreakable Machine-Doll (Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai) has tried to accomplish. Now was it successful, or didn’t it fall flat on its face?Story:Unbreakable Machine-Doll’s story takes place in the 20th century, a time where there have been several technological advancements, especially with the use of magic. During this time period, there was a tremendous discovery. By fusing scientific and magical knowledge, humans were able to create a device that can bring inanimate objects to life, an even give them their own personalities. The militarily use for this technology came in the form of puppets. They would bring puppets to life, and train people to use these puppets for military purposes.The story revolves around Raishin Akabane, a member of the Akabane clan—a clan that specializes in the use of puppets. One day, a mysterious assailant attacked his clan, and nearly all of them were killed. Raishin wants to avenge his clansmen’s deaths so he joins the Royal Academy, a prestigious school for puppeteers, in order to become the best puppeteer in the world.The most interesting thing in the story is its setting. As most of you probably have noticed, most anime take place in Japan, with the second most popular setting probably being space. So to have an entire series take place in 20th century England is a nice change of pace. I was also really interested in the story’s premise. Just looking at the plot synopsis got me interested in watching this series. But, unfortunately the story never gets any better than “interesting.”The first issue that I have with the story is the way that it goes about explaining everything to the viewer. It will introduce a subject, or term, to you without defining exactly what it is or what’s going on. They will have entire conversations about these things without giving you any clues or context to what they are talking about—until the conversation is already over. But, by that point, I was already annoyed. This happens several times throughout the course the series, and it gets even worse at the end, but I’ll get to that later. It’s not like they are being vague, and mysterious. They’re not giving you hints or clues, and trying to let you figure things out on your own. They’re just not telling you anything.The show also tries to break away from some of the stereotypical ecchi attempts at humor, i.e. the male protagonist “tripping” and grabbing the breasts of a female character or the male protagonist having several nose bleeds because of the female characters. While there are definitely some moments that are fairly cliché in the ecchi genre, for the most part, the humor in Unbreakable Machine-Doll at least a little bit different from what you’d typically see in the genre. The problem is that it uses the same types of jokes and gags over, and over, and over again. And, honestly, they weren’t even that funny in the first place.Another issue I have with the story is the way that they magically create and insert actions, conversations, and random knowledge whenever it’s convenient for Raishin. He’ll be in the middle of a battle, in which he’s getting beaten pretty badly, and all of a sudden he’ll turn the tables on his opponent and gain the upper hand. How does he do this? Apparently, he had it all planned out all along. Some random bystander will start commentating about how Raishin must’ve known about such and such all along (or “deduced” it right before hand), and had already had a plan in his mind to counter act such and such by doing such and such off screen. They don’t even show you flashbacks of when he did whatever they said he did, they just flash a picture on the screen, there will be more on that in the animation section of this review, and say that he had planned it all along.Now my biggest problem with the series is the way that it ended, because, it really didn’t. Remember what I said about the series picking and choosing when to explain things that they mention in their character’s dialogue? During the last two episodes they say things that were never mentioned in the series before hand, and must’ve planned on explaining things during the second season. The problem is that there is not second season, and there will probably never be one at this point. The unanswered questions are compounded because the season finale didn’t conclude the two main storylines during the course of the season: Raishin getting his revenge and becoming the best puppeteer. The only things were solved by the last episode were a few side character’s stories, and it felt like the main story was put on hold. All of this added up to a very unsatisfying conclusion, to an underwhelming story.Animation:Overall, the animation in Unbreakable Machine-Doll is solid. The characters are all distinctive and nicely animated, and the background scenery is well done. The fight scenes in this series are also well done, even though I do have a problem with the way they chose integrate still images into them. Instead of seeing a fight scene with every frame being animated, you’ll see quick flashes of still images, which are supposed to supplement the animation for those particular actions. This happens fairly frequently, and it’s not only jarring, but it’s also disappointing. Several of the moments that were reduced to only still images would’ve looked much better if they were animated, and they would’ve made the fight scenes that much better.Another thing I liked about the animation was that there wasn’t a ridiculous amount of fanservice. Was it there, and perfectly noticeable? Certainly, but it didn’t happen anywhere near as often as I expected it to. In fact, there were several episodes were there was little to no fanservice, and I thought that was refreshing.It also should be noted that there seems to be some brightness issues with the lighter colors used in the series. Some of the whites, in particular, look extremely bright, and even a little blurry, on screen.Sound:Unbreakable Machine-Doll’s soundtrack (OST) is fairly large, and pretty varied. There are definitely plenty of songs to fit every single moment in this series. Most of the OST is split between two song types: soft, airy, and melodic, and epic and grand. The softer songs usually rely on different string instruments and a piano to produce a lighter sound that just feels like it belongs in a fantasy show, which isn’t a bad thing considering that that is pretty much was Unbreakable Machine-Doll is. The other songs use a lot more instruments, and that big orchestral sound is perfect for the fight scenes in this series. The series only has one opening and ending, and I didn’t find either of them particularly special. While I didn’t find anything that I’d be compelled to re-listen to after this review, Unbreakable Machine-Doll’s OST was really good.Characters:There are two main characters in this series, Raishin and his puppet Yaya. There are also several side characters that you’ll see over the course of the series. I’ll just get this out of the way right now—there is little to no character development for any of the characters in this series. Every character in this series is pretty much the same at the end of the series, as they were at the beginning, with a few very minor exceptions. Thankfully, we do get some background information about most of them, but there are still some characters that we don’t know a whole lot about.But, the characters are decently likable and enjoyable to watch. There relationships with one another do actually go through some development over the course of the series. It’s nothing substantial, but it’s definitely noticeable.Enjoyment:As I mentioned earlier, this series never got past just interesting for me. The annoying methods of story telling, repetitive comedy, and lack of an ending didn’t really add to my overall enjoyment of this series. While I was decently entertained by Unbreakable Machine-Doll it’s not something that I’d consider watching again.Verdict & Breakdown:Story: 2.5/5Animation: 3.8/5Sound: 3.7/5Characters: 2.7/5Enjoyment: 3/5Verdict: 3.1/5While Unbreakable Machine-Doll isn’t bad, it’s far from being the, “Ecchi anime with a fantastic story,” that some claim it to be. your personal enjoyment of it.

Very uninteresting story about vengeance with a typical school setting, but intriguing world and concept.  The episodes don't really develop plot and are their for lore, character introductions, and back story.  The art is pretty good for action scenes are actually somewhat exciting but there isn't really anything too eye captivating, so don't expect stuff to wow you.  The sound is good, and fits the anime well.  With characters, there's a lot of typical archetypal characteristics, such as how the main...character wants to help everyone and is constantly accused of being a perv.  There's also the moe and tsundere characters, as well as the timid girl with big breasts that says rarely anything.  There are some subtle unique character points, but aside from that their pretty typical, yet entertaining and funny. There are a lot of generic things in this anime, but if you like action watch it as something on your free time, don't make it a priority.

I specifically enjoyed the anime for the interesting world, and for certain character relations, as well as for the occasional unique character moments, but it's nothing special."", 'This is what the average viewer should expect when coming into this anime. the setting takes place in the early 1900\'s in the U.K, with most of the events taking place at the Walpurgis Academy, a School designed to teach children the art of Machinart, a fusion hybrid of technology and magic that lets a mage control a magical robot by using their own mana in a manner similar to how masters in ""Fate/Stay Night"" control their servants. the students at the school then compete in a spectated combat competition to prove who has what it takes to become the ""Wiseman"" a position of power...in the military which gives the person who holds the title of Wiseman to be able to ignore the taboos of magic set by the world. the Main Character, Raishin , goes to this prestigious academy with a Magical robot in hand named Yaya, a cute girl who looks very indistinguishable from the other female characters in the show as she was made by one of the best machinart engineers in the world. She fits the yandere archtype to the tee as she loves Raishin to extreme lengths. Raishin then uses Yaya in the competition in order to try to become the Wiseman, but sadly as soon as he gets into the school he is forbidden from entering the competition because in order to participate you need to be one of the top 100 students in the whole school to be eligible and he is almost (and I place a LOT of emphasis on the word almost) the worst student in the entire school grade-wise. his entire purpose in being there is to gain the power and experience needed to take revenge for his slaughtered family by killing his brother Tenzin who happens to attend the same school as he does (where have I seen this before). that is the overarching story for the anime in a nutshell and along with several different story arcs that take place in the show. now that I have given my summery of the anime I will give my Scores based on Story, Art, Sound, Character, and Personal Enjoyment.Story: 6/10While I appreciate that this anime gives a new twist on magic and combining it with machines, I have to say the story isn\'t that great or original, as both the whole ""taking revenge"" story and the setting being a school have both been so overdone in anime that I cant really give it high remarks. also while some of the arcs are really enjoyable to watch at times I am more or less confused at the end of the series as it leaves a lot of questions left unanswered in this world.Art: 9/10the animation quality in this anime is definitely above average, the fight sequences are great (except for the cgi but that\'s my taste so I won\'t knock the score off for that) and is very fluid overall. not at the quality of Fate/Zero or the likes of that but good enough.Sound: 6/10overall the soundtrack isn\'t something to brag about. the music fits the show during it both suspenseful and emotional moments but nothing really catchy or something I could listen on its own except for the opening song which is ok at best on its own.Characters: 5/10in this series there isn\'t a lot of character development for most anyone in the series except for the Main Character and the Female Lead Charle. most other characters can be described in just two words. their Archetypes, while overused, did not make the series or its characters unenjoyable.Enjoyment: 8/10I really liked this show despite its faults. The interactions between characters were always either really silly and comedic or really heartwarming. I really did like the fight scenes in this series and there is also the idea that there is always an underlying case to solve in the series which was also entertaining to see unfold.Overall Score 7/10this anime isn\'t the best but it isn\'t something that should be outright avoided. all I can say is if you like the Magical world Genre, you will definitely enjoy this anime the same could be said if like either mystery or action anime. but it is not an anime that will be put into high regard anytime soon in the military which gives the person who holds the title of Wiseman to be able to ignore the taboos of magic set by the world. the Main Character, Raishin , goes to this prestigious academy with a Magical robot in hand named Yaya, a cute girl who looks very indistinguishable from the other female characters in the show as she was made by one of the best machinart engineers in the world.

A great wide range anime with wonderful graphics that involves some 3D models during action scenes.The downside is that it\'s not focused enough. If one were to watch this for purely action content then they would be disappointed. It doesn\'t have a specific genre to lean on.Putting that aside, the anime starts off in the early 20th century, where the main character Raishin sets off to a new academy in order to revenge his clan\'s death....He aims to be "" Wiseman"" (winner of a major tournament) by defeating his enemy. Interesting plot because it\'s not repetitive as the protagonist slowly reveals his strength. He aims to be "" Wiseman"" (winner of a major tournament) by defeating his enemy.

However, as it progressed, the story fell flat and so did the characters. Although it was obvious there was a bigger background plot, there wasn't enough emphasis on it in each episode and hence the anime felt fragmented, as if you're just watching random events that ultimately led to nothing.One of the major reasons leading to my dropping this anime was the lack of depth regarding most of the characters (though Raishin and Yaya, by default, were slightly more colorful). Half the time I had...been pondering why Charlotte was even part of the story (my conclusion: sexual tension and appeal to male audiences). The attempts at giving characters like Char backstories had been weak as most came off overly dramatic and instead made said characters even less realistic.Overall, it was a mediocre anime that basically got too uninteresting for me. Despite the attractive visuals and world-building, Machine-Doll had too passive a storyline. Those with more patience might want to stick through the whole season but if you're like me and usually give animes half a season—or less—to capture your attention, you might want to skip out on this one. been pondering why Charlotte was even part of the story (my conclusion: sexual tension and appeal to male audiences).

Charlotte is probably one of the better designs, especially her clothing (that hat) and personality. Now if only she was voiced by Rie Kugimiya.Story: 4/10The problem is that this anime had too much stuff and can\'t cover it all in 12 episodes.The plot is fragmented and inconclusive at best. There was supposed to be an overarching plot about a competition among 100 people whose last one standing (remind anyone of Sekirei?) would be rewarded greatly. Instead the Evening...Party isn\'t even a main plot point as it soon gets ignored in favor of a storytelling style like Strike the Blood\'s—short arcs, a few episodes long, about separate mini-villains. Slight spoilers: the ending isn\'t much of an ending.Character: 6/10Yaya was really cute, probably the most jealous character I\'ve ever seen. Her attachment to Raishin is legendary. Charlotte\'s also pretty good and her interactions with Raishin are amusing.However, similar problem with story was that the anime failed to thoroughly explore character backgrounds. Aside from Yaya, Charlotte, Henri, and Frey, none of the other characters get enough attention. There are also a few flashbacks of Raishin\'s tragic past when his entire family was murdered, and he supposedly came to this school to take revenge. Maybe defeating Magnus is a long term goal that won\'t happen for a while, but you\'d figure that the people around Magnus would be more alarmed that this guy committed mass murder rather than idly chatting with him (the female sensei) or using him as a bodyguard (the headmaster). Aside from Raishin, it\'d help to know more about what Shouko has to do with him, who Magnus is, and why they interact the way they do. The members of the harem—well Charlotte and Henri got a lot of focus in the last arc, although their past is still a little muddy. Frey and Loki could use more development too. The worst offenders are the two other dolls that go with Shouko. I don\'t even remember their names because they only showed up a bit in one episode, yet they feature heavily in the ending theme animation with Yaya as the spinning dolls. I was led to believe that they were important characters but it seems they don\'t have much to do with the central story after all.Enjoyment: 9/10Dialogue and jokes are great. Loki\'s ""I am a humble and tolerant man..."" speech gets me every time. Yaya is always there to spice things up. Everyone misunderstanding Raishin, Yaya, and each other and abusing Raishin for being a pervert got a little repetitive after the 50th time but harem protagonists always get shit from everyone. The fights were pretty badass but having Raishin/Yaya get beaten up before someone else saves them or they figure out how to beat their opponent is kind of repetitive and predictable. The automata system in the anime is interesting, but I feel the fights and anime overall would more enjoyable if the audience understood its mechanics better.Sound: 10/10As far as music goes, the opening theme was good and ending theme is #1 catchiest of the season. I think the original version is the best though, maybe I got used to it from playing it on Osu all the time, but it feels weird when a different voice begins singing it.Voice acting was excellent too, especially Yaya\'s. Same voice actress as Himeji in Baka and Test.Overall: 8/10As a harem series, Unbreakable Machine-Doll excels in character interactions and designs. I really like the feel of its unique setting in 20th century Britain when most other animes are in modern-day Japan. Action scenes are also great, but the mechanics aren\'t explained well, nor are the characters\' backgrounds. Plot is often nonexistent, which is quite a shame, given the setting\'s potential. Still, it was a fun series to watch and Yaya deserves a second season.

This is yet another anime that tells the beginnings of a fun and interesting story but stops with no less than 5 huge plot points left unanswered. That said, if you\'re looking for a new light novel to read or are looking for something light with some excellent animation, cute characters and don\'t mind only getting part of the story you may find this enjoyable.Story: 8/10The story is solid. There are a lot of characters which are slowly introduced and intertwine in an interesting way. The concept of automatons...is a bit overdone but is handled well (they range from animals, to dragons to Yaya who is almost human like). The anime does a great job of drawing you in and getting you interested in each of the characters and their back stories and how they interact, with the looming ""Evening Dance"" where they will all need to fight each other. The last few episodes really expanded on the story and left you with tons of unanswered questions. The story was good enough to make me want to read the LN, which rarely happens.Art: 9/10The art was fantastic. I loved the character models, the use of light and dark colors, and the overall effects. One thing I found absolutely gorgeous was the opening sequence where the train is going down the tracks in 3d and the characters are running along the train and dodging incoming bridges; it is impressive and well done and sets the tone for the rest of the series.Sound: 7/10The intro theme was cool. The overall sound was OK, nothing too outstanding but it does it\'s job.Character: 7/10There is solid character development and an interesting and diverse cast of characters. The main characters are all fleshed out (minus MC and Yaya), their back stories explored and their motives fairly clear. There is also teaser back stories about characters that would likely play a major role in the second season of the anime were there to have been one. Each of them had a fair amount of depth considering there was only a single season and I was interested in learning more about each of them.Enjoyment: 7/10I enjoyed this anime quite a bit. It had interesting characters and gorgeous art. The story had me interested in knowing what came next. The fight scenes were fairly detailed and action packed. IF you\'re not too worried about the second season and take it for what it is you can have a good experience.Overall: 7/10I wanted to give this a higher score but I just couldn\'t given how it ended. It left too many things unanswered and left me feeling disappointed. If you can get over that, there is a solid story, excellent art and fight scenes and solid character development.

I immediately was hooked. I watched all 12 Episodes, and then I turned around and bought all the English Dub of all 12 Episodes of iTunes.My biggest problem is the story, and that's mostly because they structured it in such a way that they're hoping to get more seasons. Apparently, they've adapted the first three novels, setting four episodes per novel. While each 4 Episode arc works alone, it's the awkward transitioning between the arcs where the story falls flat. For instance, Loki...and Frey, the characters who are the main focus for Episodes 5 through 8 show up exactly 0 times in the 1st 4 episodes, when even a cameo would have worked.It was very pleasing aesthetically, and the music, especially the victory theme is very good. The series takes the time to develop the motivations of the major teenage characters, and gives them personalities that make sense.If this anime somehow gets any more animated continuations, (Movie or another season), it could really gain some traction and become quite the hit.  Not since either of the Fullmetal Alchemist animes have I seen such a fictional science/magic developed so thoroughly and with such internal consistency. and Frey, the characters who are the main focus for Episodes 5 through 8 show up exactly 0 times in the 1st 4 episodes, when even a cameo would have worked.It was very pleasing aesthetically, and the music, especially the victory theme is very good.

The characters are likable and the story is decent.  However, it falls far short of being a great work for the medium.  I went into this with high expectations, as this is a Lerche anime and Lerche is my favorite studio.  Their animation is always gorgeous and they are responsible for some of my favorite series ever made.  However, Unbreakable Machine Doll does not feel up to par with their other series.First of all, the animation.  Lerche usually has some of the best animation in the industry.  However, Unbreakable Machine...Doll does not meet their usual standard.  Most of the time, it looks serviceable.  The characters are well-designed and stay on model.  It's not a stand-out style or anything, but it's perfectly fine.  The issues, however, come from the action scenes.  In almost every action scene with the automatons, the animation will switch to very low-quality CG models.  The change is very jarring.  Some characters look better than others, but Yaya in particular looks really off due to her human appearance.  It's really disappointing because the fight scenes are a focal point of the anime, and there are some good ideas in terms of choreography, but it all falls apart in the execution.As for the story, it's decent.  It's nothing particularly groundbreaking and I don't think it's going to be anybody's favorite anime, but it's extremely watchable.  In particular, the characters are largely very likable.  The main character, Raishin, is enjoyable (albeit a bit one-note at times) and most of the supporting cast, especially Charlotte and Loki, are very well-written and I found myself liking them a lot.  However, the biggest issue the story has is that it all feels like setup.  The series ends with pretty much just as many questions as when it started, and the whole season feels like it's just introducing characters and concepts to be used further down the line.  However, it's abundantly clear that season 2 will almost definitely never happen, so if you want to see where the story goes, you'll have to read the light novels, which have never been officially translated into English.There's a lot to like in Unbreakable Machine Doll, but overall, it just feels extraordinarily average.  It's not something I think anyone needs to go out of their way to watch.  However, if the premise really sounds interesting to you and the idea of CG battles and a lack of resolution don't bother you, I recommend giving it a watch and forming your own opinion.

Though fan service does turn me away from many shows because it's an excuse to derail a story and often used as a device to draw male viewers, here I could still find enjoyment in the show regardless.I don't like harem anime but this one doesn't throw the entire harem at the main character all the time so it didn't always detract from the mood, however Yaya's constant clinginess gets really irritating...and tends to throw the show off the rails more than it should.The humor is good and the consistency of Raishin's character works for the entire show but nothing we haven't seen before: a brash but selfless hero that, while lacking in certain skills makes up for it in his sheer determination and faith in his high potential machine-doll Yaya.Though this show ends at the end of a chapter and leaves on a cliffhanger so you have to read the manga to finish the story, still a fun little show that has it's moments, though repetition of breast gags, Loki quips, and Yaya moments gets old fast. and tends to throw the show off the rails more than it should.The humor is good and the consistency of Raishin's character works for the entire show but nothing we haven't seen before: a brash but selfless hero that, while lacking in certain skills makes up for it in his sheer determination and faith in his high potential machine-doll Yaya.Though this show ends at the end of a chapter and leaves on a cliffhanger so you have to read the manga to finish the story, still a fun little show that has it's moments, though repetition of breast gags, Loki quips, and Yaya moments gets old fast."", 'Fairly intriguing plot that really gets you hooked towards the end.

The anime is remarkably consistent with a pretty indicative opening act - they set up Raishin and Yaya's relationship and motivations pretty effectively and just throw the characters into a variety of situations, with new ones showing up along the way. The tone remains fairly consistent throughout without taking huge and unwarranted departures as many struggle with.Raishin and Yaya are the clear focus of the show, with some of the side characters falling into...obscurity or never really getting developed fully, but Raishin's deadpan snark mixed with Yaya's mix of bubbly affection and raging insecurity makes for enjoyable back and forth banter, some of the gags getting old over time but I generally found it to be quite tolerable and enjoyable from start to finish.The fights are ostensibly a major draw of the show but in practice vary wildly in quality and I generally wasn't super impressed with them - kinda basic and at times held back by poor 3d animation, though they usually looked perfectly fine.The plot starts off as a very generic revenge fantasy - oh no, MC-kun's family is dead and he wants to kill the one (probably) responsible! - but thankfully doesn't go too crazy with it, rapidly tying in a variety of other plots that take precedence, and the main character is both thankfully not super edgy and has a very genuine caring side that softens him up and drives some significant character development over the anime.While not a groundbreaking anime overall I personally found it very enjoyable; an anime that looks good, has (mostly) decent characters, some solid fights, lots of enjoyable banter, and a pretty in depth plot that gets pretty god damn dark at times and paints a remarkably harsh world akin to Fate's mage society.As fair warning; for better or worse, there is some definite fanservice here. We're not talking Dead or Alive: Extreme Jiggle Jigglyball, but Yaya's, ah, advances towards Raishin are NOT of the subtle variety and she ends up naked or nearly naked multiple times. So if that's your thing, cool, if it's not, eh, it's not a big part of the anime but maybe something to watch out for. I personally didn't mind it, they set her up as pretty thirsty so it wasn't out of character or anything. obscurity or never really getting developed fully, but Raishin's deadpan snark mixed with Yaya's mix of bubbly affection and raging insecurity makes for enjoyable back and forth banter, some of the gags getting old over time but I generally found it to be quite tolerable and enjoyable from start to finish.The fights are ostensibly a major draw of the show but in practice vary wildly in quality and I generally wasn't super impressed with them - kinda basic and at times held back by poor 3d animation, though they usually looked perfectly fine.The plot starts off as a very generic revenge fantasy - oh no, MC-kun's family is dead and he wants to kill the one (probably) responsible! - but thankfully doesn't go too crazy with it, rapidly tying in a variety of other plots that take precedence, and the main character is both thankfully not super edgy and has a very genuine caring side that softens him up and drives some significant character development over the anime.While not a groundbreaking anime overall I personally found it very enjoyable; an anime that looks good, has (mostly) decent characters, some solid fights, lots of enjoyable banter, and a pretty in depth plot that gets pretty god damn dark at times and paints a remarkably harsh world akin to Fate's mage society.As fair warning; for better or worse, there is some definite fanservice here.

This is the case here, with a few early establishing shots of the city, we see the world the anime takes place in; but that is the end of it before we are withdrawn into the school setting. Everything else about the environment isn’t that interesting, so nothing else to say on the landscapes. This could’ve been a touchdown worthy feature of the anime, which sadly was not taken advantage of; leaving us with monotone forest and school interiors.The animation...was nothing to write home about, but it wasn’t bothersome either. It made use of CG though. While I’m personally not a fan of CG, I can see where it is useful. In comparison to anime like Knights of Sidonia, where CG is used throughout the entire show to make animation consistent and to make action scenes easier to produce; it ultimately allows the animation to flow together. Here, it transitions between using CG and not, which is really distracting to the eye. It may not bother some people, others may find it infuriating. The CG only gets bad during the faster scenes, and at other times you can’t tell that it’s CG, so your opinion may vary. I’ll include the music here, as it suited the anime well enough, but it was below average on it’s own.The main characters of Raishin and his automaton Yaya, aka his Doll, enter a new school (wow, how original) in order to avenge Raishin’s family.  The main character started out with some promise, as with most harem/ecchi anime protagonist being either perverts or too thick-headed to understand that girls are interested. Here, however, as the main girl is a doll, she is naturally treated as such; usually with her advances being brushed aside. I personally prefer a protagonist who has no interest in the girls opposed to two previously mentioned character types; at least in these settings I find.But a problem occurs early on with Raishin, in which he states that he respects Yaya’s individual personality; and the individuality of other dolls. In respect to his stance on the treatment of dolls, he has no room to develop; and with the master and slave/doll relationship being a key feature of this anime, this gives us little reason to care. A stronger point could’ve been made by making him a massive asshole to dolls, and then having to learn. Now, it should be said that his respect for the dolls is also made through straight up dialogue, but again leaves the viewer with nothing to interpret.A last point on this master/slave doll dynamic, is how the supporting characters have explain why Raishin is a good guy. In the first two episodes, after meeting the second girl (Charlotte) who has a dragon doll; the dragon doll has to state to the audience that Raishin asked how asked the dragon doll ‘how he was doing?’ It would’ve been better to have just have Raishin treat the dolls better, and leave it to the audience to pick it up.It’s not all bad for little, old Raishin though. As he can actually do stuff, again being said rather than shown at first, he isn’t a good doll user and has to compensate by participating in the battles alongside Yaya. It adds a camaraderie element that just seemed refreshingAs for Yaya, the doll. She is a more likable character when next to Raishin. Purely due to a more exaggerated personality, but the constant desire to rip of Raishin’s, even when he walks in bleeding, loses its charm. She, and some other dolls, are “banned”, but are still used? It’s just kind of said, but nothing really happens because of it. Yaya is apparently the best doll in the world, it takes a while to learn what’s so special. She repairs herself through being close to Raishin, explaining why she is really attached. But in the end, she nothing new or good, but adequate. The pair have some interesting dynamics that go insufficiently explored and developed.There is no point going into detail about the supporting characters, as they are mainly used to state exposition, advance the plot or provide some motivation that is forgotten fairly quickly. Except for the character Frey, she got a chuckle out of me. A main concern was the inconsistency of the characters intentions, one moment they help each other but immediately after re-establish that they’ll have to fight each other. Never mind the moments where they break from task to discuss their boobs. When some extras are added in and then die, their death scene correlates with how much exposition they spouted. The ones who explained how a move worked, get knocked out quicker than the characters who only got 4 minutes of screen time.The fights are pretty ‘meh’, usually after something happens the characters take turns explaining how and why what they did worked. This followed statements of how invincible the move is, just proceeding its failure. The lore surrounding the magic is phoned in, mainly due to having such a short time to allow for sufficient explanation; a lot can be taken at face value and it feels as though some anime forget this.The plot is at the very least, different. The characters all want to get into an event called ‘the evening party’, fight club for the students, Raishin also wants to be a thing called a ‘Wiseman’. All of it is tied into some worldly political power struggle that never takes fruit. Also as mentioned before, this is a revenge story, you’d forget if the characters didn’t stop to talk about it. The school has a ranking system that seems to have no relevance, except for explaining character backstory. But then it takes a sudden left turn, and I found myself saying, “Where did this plot come from?” in a good way; it gave me something to think about at least. But this turn happens halfway through the series and I can imagine many a viewer concluding this show as nothing special before then. Even if the you stay till these extra details are introduced, they may fail to interest you. The series would’ve greatly benefited from being 24 episodes, rather than 12, but it seems as though they condensed something much greater into this series.In SummaryIf you know the type of anime you’re getting yourself into, and you like it, then go for it. A little off the rails plot, and somewhat refreshing character dynamics (I use the statement loosely) made this one slightly more enjoyable than the rest out there. In terms of harem/ecchiness, it’s pretty light.

I understand that she had an obsession with her master (almost like a little sister obsession), but I wish it wasn't shoved in our faces multiple times each episode. There is nothing wrong with the cliche idea, but it just got to be too much. Also, her voice was really annoying.The rest of the characters...were fine- I wish there had been more scenes where I got to know them, but in a 12 episode anime, there's but so much character development you can do, and I recognize that.Drawing StyleI hated it. To be honest, I almost didn't watch the anime because I didn't like the drawing style, but obviously I ended up giving it a chance, and ended up liking the anime (even though I still don't like the drawing style).The ending was really open and I do hope that they make a sequel, because I want to know what happens next!Overall, if you like harems with little true romance + cyborg-type machines, then I would recommend this to you. were fine- I wish there had been more scenes where I got to know them, but in a 12 episode anime, there's but so much character development you can do, and I recognize that.Drawing StyleI hated it.

We begin again...This is a difficult review to compose. Not because ""Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai"" is a bad show, but because it is a GREAT SHOW! It is VERY fast moving, plot points in every episode, the cliff-hangers leave you breathless. Even the music is excellent.Let\'s go to work,When I think of the number of Anime, constructed as well as this, I can count them on the fingers of one hand.The story line begins simply enough; a teenager Raishan, of mysterious background enters a prestigious school to improve his skills in an art form only present in this alternate reality...of the latter 20th century (which is the puppeteering of a machine-doll). While there, he runs into a myriad of characters, every one of which has a unique personality, with their own skill-set, and identifying traits (I know, some would say ""... I seen this stuff before .."" and you\'d be right). But try to create a new personality for yourself. This complaint was probably presented in Chaucer\'s time as well. Too bad, every person is born into his world, and that dictates at least part of his personality; try to escape it and become a misfit, if you dare.In any case, this story has twists that Macheavelli would have been proud of. Even some of the \'good guys\' get into serious trouble, only to find their way, led out of the darkness by Raishan.And then there is the character that started the entire story. While some would say, it was Raishan\'s brother Tenzen; I submit that Raishan was left to die, and should not have had a part to play in this drama. The true beginning of this story, is a character named Shouko Karyuusai. She even gave Raishan a choice of whether to have a part to play, or not; from the very beginning. She is quite prescient about the future, and wanted to pit the two brothers against each other. Only the audience becomes aware that Touko doesn\'t give a tinker\'s damn which one survives the exchange, as long as she is left with an intact, but dead brother to use in one of her own experiments. WOW!Even the ban-doll Touko delegates to Raishan, is part of her plan. And while the entire audience is dazzled by the ban-doll\'s hentai behavior, Toukos\' intention to use Yaya to drain Raishan\'s energy unto death is hidden in all the charm and comedy. We even feel sorry for Touko; who \'s conscience nags at her about Raishan at times, even though ultimately she will write him off as raw materials for one of her latest experiments in the creation of a new ban-doll! Exactly what Tenden did to the entire remaining parents and siblings of his own family\', using them for spare parts to make his own set of ban-dolls!We are left with the watching of the events unfold between Raishan and Touko, as if mesmerized by an unfolding train wreck as it expands a little more each episode, meanwhile we are diverted by a house fire in a neighboring town.The house fire is the growing dread of what ends up just beginning by the 9th episode, dealing with a heretofore unknown character with her own superior ban-doll, Cedric Granville. This last thread is the part of the story that gets the most criticism by many viewers, who don\'t know what is going on. That event is an unfinished thread in the story, that while is very amusing to Cedric, is unrequited. The end is never in sight, which leaves the lack of satisfaction for many.While there are many other events going on in this masterpiece, the previous discussion recounts the most important issues in the story line. The story is NOT complicated. It stands as unfinished. No other criticism is necessary.Putting the previous comment aside, it is clear that this Anime stands very high in my book. The story is Great! The artwork matches any Anime ever made. The music, dialog, and soundtrack is quite impressive. Character development is great although short because of the unfinished thread. Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai is extremely enjoyable, quite funny at times, and at others very poignant and subtle. Emotions extracted range from outright laughter, to tragedy, to suspense; to that other thing, done so poorly in the rare Anime that attempts it; horror.It is my hope that Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai gets another season, the next fully realized installment can only lead to further suspense, and a good time should be had by all.I give this Anime an overall score of 8. of the latter 20th century (which is the puppeteering of a machine-doll). While there, he runs into a myriad of characters, every one of which has a unique personality, with their own skill-set, and identifying traits (I know, some would say ""... I seen this stuff before .."" and you\'d be right). But try to create a new personality for yourself. This complaint was probably presented in Chaucer\'s time as well. Too bad, every person is born into his world, and that dictates at least part of his personality; try to escape it and become a misfit, if you dare.In any case, this story has twists that Macheavelli would have been proud of. Even some of the \'good guys\' get into serious trouble, only to find their way, led out of the darkness by Raishan.And then there is the character that started the entire story. While some would say, it was Raishan\'s brother Tenzen; I submit that Raishan was left to die, and should not have had a part to play in this drama. The true beginning of this story, is a character named Shouko Karyuusai. She even gave Raishan a choice of whether to have a part to play, or not; from the very beginning. She is quite prescient about the future, and wanted to pit the two brothers against each other. Only the audience becomes aware that Touko doesn\'t give a tinker\'s damn which one survives the exchange, as long as she is left with an intact, but dead brother to use in one of her own experiments. WOW!Even the ban-doll Touko delegates to Raishan, is part of her plan. And while the entire audience is dazzled by the ban-doll\'s hentai behavior, Toukos\' intention to use Yaya to drain Raishan\'s energy unto death is hidden in all the charm and comedy.

Although I don't think this anime has anything special about it, because the mc is still the usual beta mc who gets pushed around by girls and even risks his life to save them after knowing them for like a day or 2, which to me is stupid and pisses...me off.I think that these types of stories are always better in the light novel format, because it's much easier to skip a scene that u don´t like or simply enjoy the plot more because it's more detailed and well paced than in the anime. Aside from that they usually adapt 3/4 volumes per 12 eps (a season) and sometimes it feels like episode 3 (for example) has nothing to do with episode 4 cuz most of the time the plot is from 2 different volumes (usually a light novel volume takes 3/4 eps to get adapted).To me it was very hard to watch this anime, because it was very fast paced and it felt rushed and tbh I only watched it till the end cuz i want to go read the novel, but i don't wanna start at volume 1. me off.I think that these types of stories are always better in the light novel format, because it's much easier to skip a scene that u don´t like or simply enjoy the plot more because it's more detailed and well paced than in the anime.

The anime which I can undoubtedly say is my favorite. The anime which was able to capture and warm my heart, holding a special place and creating unforgettable memories.I have never felt this attached to an anime before, I will always cherish it.Story: 10/10The story makes great use of foreshadowing and the deep world-building to create an intriguing atmosphere which kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire series. While the general concept of a battle-partner anime isn't particularly unique, the delivery and execution of the the story cause...MDK to stand on a pedestal.There is a hefty amount of action-packed, heartwarming content packed into 12 episodes, and the story continues beyond the end of the anime.Art: 8/10The designs of both the environment and the characters are acutely displayed in relation to their intended purpose. By this, I mean that:Beautiful characters/scenes looked beautiful, cute characters looked cute, badass characters looked badass, ect...The animation, environment, and design all fit the tone of the anime to a tee.If I were to have any complaints, it would only be that the CGI can be a bit bland, although I still never would've guessed this anime came out as early as 2013.Sound: 9/10The ambience and background music was a hit throughout the series. Never did I find the BGM or sound effects to be inappropriate or distracting, rather they drew me into the anime even more.The voice actors were perfect! They completely nailed their tones and lines, making the loveableness of the characters even more apparent!The ending song is also particularly catchy~Character: 10/10From the comedic scenes, to the serious scenes, to the casual scenes, I adored every bit of characterization that this anime had to offer.Alike the art design, the characterization and personalities of the characters were always fleshed out. It is really easy to become attached to the characters in this anime, to share in their happiness, sadness, or whatever emotions they may feel at the time.Thanks to the astounding character design and their story presence, it's like I didn't just feel like an observer watching an anime to kill time like usual, I was genuinely emotionally invested and hoping for the best for my unique and beloved characters.Enjoyment: 10/10I thoroughly enjoyed this anime from start to finish. It tugged on my heartstrings in ways that I never knew an anime could. After each episode I found myself laying in bed and smiling to myself while thinking about what I watched, imagining what could happen in future episodes, and what the characters might be feeling.The story/action in this anime was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat, but there is so much more to it. A deeper connection and appreciation that brought me genuine joy and something to look forward to each day.Closing:The one thing I regret is that I waited until 2021 to watch this 2013 anime.It is without a doubt an underappreciated gem, and I can not wait to continue the story in the Light Novels.

In this setting, it is common for scientists to create automatons to control in battles. Thus, after he creates his own death machine, he learns about the whereabouts of the killer and heads to get his revenge.I made it sound interesting; didn’t I? It’s all about the way you present it and sadly for the audience the premise is ruined by the usual tropes...that light novels are filled with. So allow me to rewrite the above; this time on how it is actually presented.The premise is about a generic shonen lead whose purpose in life is described in one line. In this setting, it is common for people with random superpowers to create waifus. Thus, after he creates his own sex doll, he enrols in a school and begins to create his harem.Doesn’t sound so well now; does it? Well that is the harsh reality and if one needs to hope of enjoying this show, he should lower his bar a few centimetres away from the ground. The plot is basically random missions where the lead is showing off his hax superpowers, seduces girls, and then has sex with his doll, which is one of the biggest anime sluts you can ever hope to encounter in a non-hentai title. The damn thing is a nympho and can’t stop craving for more sex with the only person she cares for. Every episode will feature at least 3 scenes where she is naked and rubs herself on the lead, who of course acts like he is about to be murdered. And then there will be at least a couple of more scenes where she is jealous of him talking to other girls and resorting to all sorts of deviant fetishes in order to attract his attention. The show will desperately try to excuse that as a “normal” fascination of a robot towards its creator. Plus all the sex scenes are “supposed” to be about a robot recharging its batteries by plugging into its energy source, which so happens to be its creator. And we are supposed to actually believe that...So as you can imagine there is very little time left to actually offer some sort of plot other than softporn nonsense. The whole revenge business is just an excuse for the lead to be doing something other than orgies with super hot babes who fall for his boring personality. There are for example some side stories where one of the girls has a very heavy duty to fulfil, or her pet dragon is accused of being a savage beast. They are supposed to build drama and tension but good luck doing that when they are kicked to the side every 3 minutes for some overdone ecchi scene you can find in any harem show out there. Hell, even the guy the lead want to kill, the part which is supposed to be the most serious one, is controlling several automatons, and they are all (SURPRISE) also sex dolls.Not that it would make much difference in saving this wreck of a series, but even the production values are that good. The animation is done by a minor studio which seems to like erasing outlines to the point shapes seem to blur and tire the average eye. The colouring of the skins seems to be too pink or brown and with the simplistic look everybody is drawn you end up looking at a bunch of shapes that are supposed to make up a human being. And no, that is hardly artistic or appealing. As for the music, it is barely something you will care to pay attention to.So there you go, yet another show that is just forgettable fan service instead of ... you know, something worth of your time? Perhaps a story about revenge and existentialism regarding the value of human lives in a world where people can be manufactured? Straight up hentai? A dating simulation?

The writer seemed to go off in several directions without ever firmly creating a solid story and I have seen several people complain about this, dropping the show mid way through. It also feels as if the author wanted to add more cute girls to the harem, imagined them, but then realised he needed some plot in order to in fit them in, letting...other story elements slip, which is fine with me as I never went in to this for some ""from the new world"" degree of plot, but something to consider.In terms of animation its fairly basic, doing what it needs to in order to portray fight scenes with some degree of motion. Its good enough not to be off putting and allowing for a fine watching experience. Heavy CGI is used in the first episode but then isn\'t used again until the last, so don\'t let this be an off-putting factor for you.If you want a nice palette cleanser and some cute waifus between other shows this is a good choice. other story elements slip, which is fine with me as I never went in to this for some ""from the new world"" degree of plot, but something to consider.In terms of animation its fairly basic, doing what it needs to in order to portray fight scenes with some degree of motion.

Aside from the main character\'s motivations and the magic system, not much else is told. The action-sequences weren\'t bad, one of the good points of this show. Somehow it has the Ecchi tag, most likely for the sole sake of Yaya\'s personality. After the first episode, it was hard to come back and finish, and overall felt rushed.Art (5/10)...- The art style was bright and colorful, but that was about it.Sound (6/10) - The opening song matched the atmosphere and setting well. The ending theme had a more traditional Japanese-style to it, which was a little strange since the story is based in England. But nice, nevertheless.Character (5/10) - Main character who seeks vengeance for tragic past. Check. Love-struck companion who wishes to be their wife? Check. Throw in a Tsundere-friend with the supporting cast, and what do you get? One word: Average.Enjoyment (6/10) - The magic system was easy to understand, but the spells were another story. Each character got enough screen-time to resolve their pasts and create character-development. Even though the ending left some questions, it was what one would expect from a series just trying to pull you in to read the source material.Overall (5.2/10) - This anime wasn’t necessarily bad, it just wasn’t that good either. If I could summarize it, it would be: Main character wants revenge, goes to get it, but by the end doesn’t and tries to leave a cliffhanger for fans to find out what happens next.

This is not what I was looking for, but it does have its merits.Story: 6The story is broken into three 4-episode arcs, which does affect the overall feel of the story. However the thing that brings it down pertaining to these arcs is that they are very similar. All the arcs follow the same generic storyline, and after watching to the third arc, it gets tedious and repetitive. So plot-wise its okay, i don\'t particularly hate it,...but its just too generic of a story line to like. However if I look at it with fresh eyes its not a bad story. The elemental parts are there, there is an overarching plot, and it will give you everything you want in a story. so good but not great. Personally was disappointed because of the repetitiveness and the lack of ecchi (and by that i mean visually, script-wise it has quite a bit). Also the enemies are framed as OP and unbeatable, yet for some gadam reason the MC and his automaton always find some way of powering up and beating it at the end. which gives in to the idea of it being repetitive.Art:9Whereas the story was boring and repetitive, the art and animation was quite well done. The character designs are visually appealing. I personally liked the art, and the costumes since they mesh really well with the whole paradox of an ancient-advanced-techno era setting. Also, this is the first anime i have encountered that looks like it used CGI to make some of the scenes, and although it flows well, it seems too...fake. However I don\'t dislike it.  A couple of things are holding it back from me giving it a 10 though. (1) the brightness of the animation is too high. And its not just a problem with my display, its a problem within the anime. All the colors are washed out, and sharp, almost to a point where it hurts to watch. (2) The art is reminiscent of Rakudai kishi no cavalry, with its floatly, and plasticine colors. Everything just seems to have a sheen over it.Sound: 10Originally I was feeling a ""9"" score here, but after thinking it through a bit more, i decided that this anime\'s sound warrants a ""10"". Now this is my opinion but I happen to like Yaya\'s voice, so much so that I actually looked up the voice actor, which is surprising for someone who doesn\'t pay attention to sound. I liked Yaya\'s voice, and none of the characters had ""out-of-place"" voices. Opening song was not that special, but the closing song was a real gem for my taste. Its fast, up beat, and it feature\'s Yayas voice. I don\'t know how they made a song moe but they did.Characters:7Similar to the story, the characters are really predictable and after seeing a bunch of them its gotten really boring to watch. However if this is like the first or second anime you\'re going to watch then you might like it so i\'ll try to be objective. The MC follows the overused Zero-to-Harem archetype, yet it fails at even following that. He also suffers from MBBS (Massive blue ball syndrome) cus he wont pick a girl from the harem, or pick any of them. Even though the anime tries to convince us that the MC is absolutely crap, we as the watchers already know that he isn\'t. and that is because he is paired with the Best girl. The best girl is basically the opposite of the MC in terms of power, as she\'s the ""best automaton in the world"". She is basically the perfect girl (Yaya that is), and has an extremely ecchi thought process. all the other characters in the Harem are just your generic tsunderes and blonde girls, with no real substance except as fanservice. Another thing that bothered me was that they all had some sort of saying that quickly became overused. catechisms like ""she\'s the best automaton..."", ""...we are not without our flaws, but i guess mine is..."", and ""there are three things in the world I will not tolerate..."" quickly become boring as characters continue to repeat them over and over again.Enjoyment:9I don\'t really care for plot so i did enjoy this anime quite a bit. It has nice art, a good song, a decent storyline and well drawn (or should i say proportioned) characters. Its not an absolute turn off, and it has enough cliffhangers to get you interested in the next episode even though you\'re sure of whats going to happen next. However, I cant give it a 10 because I am perverted. yep. With the exception of 1 scene, this anime has NO TITS not even censored ones. Like how am I supposed to enjoy an ""ecchi"" tagged anime if there are no tits?!?! or ass?!?! If there wasn\'t an ecchi tag then sure i could consider it but the possibilities for tits were endless but crushed by plot. Not that that is neccessarily a bad thing, but its a definite detriment for me.Overall:A solid anime with great art, generic characters, and a forgettable plot. However this ranks lower for me than other ecchis because its just not great at ecchi. And at the end of the day thats what irked me the most about it. its a good anime don\'t get me wrong. but the lack of visual ecchi is appalling for an ecchi tagged anime. It has no good comedic value. so if you like that then go for it. if i had to quantify it then 1 for plot+1 for characters+ 2 for art + 2 for sound + 2 for enjoyment equals 8 overall. you can kinda tell i don\'t really like it since the best part was the sound and enjoyment, which is not exactly objective.AnywaysPeace but its just too generic of a story line to like.

Not that that is neccessarily a bad thing, but its a definite detriment for me.Overall:A solid anime with great art, generic characters, and a forgettable plot. However this ranks lower for me than other ecchis because its just not great at ecchi. And at the end of the day thats what irked me the most about it. its a good anime don\'t get me wrong. but the lack of visual ecchi is appalling for an ecchi tagged anime. It has no good comedic value. so if you like that then go for it. if i had to quantify it then 1 for plot+1 for characters+ 2 for art + 2 for sound + 2 for enjoyment equals 8 overall. you can kinda tell i don\'t really like it since the best part was the sound and enjoyment, which is not exactly objective.AnywaysPeace', '- may contain spoiler -hello, my self Raishin Akabane, i have come here from the far east to learn magic and become wise man - what if i say this, will you believe me? of course not. so here the main reason i am a man who is an idiot and doesn\'t know his limit and gets involved in every single incident which takes place. (i think this is what i think about MC.)Well, while watching this anime i felt this anime is kind of a straight forward or i say fast-paced. There is nothing like a normal scene, what i mean by normal is...that - that each arc is divided in 4 episode and creator are trying to fit everything in these 4 episodes.And MC is like - i am injured and some bones are broken but who cares i can go get more broken bones and some more injuries it all can heal all together later. Its like he is getting distracted from his goal and why he has come here and ""if trouble is not coming my way, i will go find it my self.Story - the story is good, but what we have seen here is kind of distracting stuff, not related to the MC. But i like each arc which is about each character and the relation and background info of some other and closer character to MC and MC have met to.7/10Art, Sound and Character - hmm kind of disappointing here because sometimes i noticed that the sound and the animation are not matching, the animations are lacking and the sound in those parts is good. Same goes for characters they feel less alive but the voice dubbing done by actors is really good, that the animation and character build in anime is not matching the sound and voice dubbing quality. But i do say fighting animation and other some stuff are done well. And what I meant by less alive is that if you look at some conversation between characters they have very little facial expression or other body movements for example.Art & Characters - 7/10Sound - 8/10Enjoyment - hmm, i did enjoy some part and some were kind of i felt to skip (haven\'t skipped any), when i started this anime at start it felt interesting but somewhere in middle (in some points) and in the end, it was felt like they are extended. and about the comedy not too great but not bad also.7/10overall - nothing much to say it could have been better than this.7/10(i may have said some things which are not acceptable to some people who like this anime but i was comparing this anime to all other anime ( in a different way) which i have seen, but i do will say that each anime is good in its own way) that - that each arc is divided in 4 episode and creator are trying to fit everything in these 4 episodes.And MC is like - i am injured and some bones are broken but who cares i can go get more broken bones and some more injuries it all can heal all together later.

Mostly they are plain without any deep story-telling in it.BUTMachine-Doll made it to the top anime with these kind of genres on my list. Let's go through my rates, shall we?Story: 10Woow, so high? Yeah, so damm high. The thing is, I look at it from not only what I saw but also from general idea behind a story. The past of protagonist and his story was greatly added piece by piece in every possible episode. Yes, you can predict how the story goes if you've watched enough anime but ->...this somehow made me curious for next episode and in hope for another story-development. The only thing I didn't like about story is that only 12 episodes were made.Art: 9For 7-year anime, art looks pretty standard. I enjoyed the design and animation from like trivial stuff to bigger battles. Even some third-party characters which weren't part of story at all, just you know, they were there ->they've got their own faces and lines, which kinda surprised me in a good way of course. That's why I've scored it so high.Sound: 10To me, sound means not even OP or/and ED but also some kind of background music or even some battle-related music, like when swords clash etc. So, the OP and ED are amazing! I knew both of them before I've watched this anime and they just correspond with it so greatly! Also there wasn't any disturbing sounds like louder bangs and then silent voices which means I didn't have to adjust my volume which is pretty rare for me as well.Character: 8My lovest score of them all. Maybe you ask, why is that?! Simple answer - I've got like tons of questions about side characters as well but their own story never developed in full size, which is shame. I mean it's understandable, looking at the 12-episode mark but no 2nd season means they'll never develop them fully at all.Enjoyment: 10Not a surprise here either. As I've stated above, the anime got only 12 episodes, yet I couldn't really notice how fast I went to last episode and still be dragged into it so hard.Overall: 10The anime itself is nothing less from masterpiece in my opinion. Many would argue about it being average or slightly better than average yet I enjoyed it to the full extend. Got good vibes and chills from it, felt sad, happy and intrigued as well.

The story is about a guy who if he finds a guy who did bad things to him or his loved ones, ""sigh"" wants revenge... I hate shows to make revenge the main motivation, Black butler did a good enough job to not be terrible (in season one) but revenge is so cliché, tropey, and just an annoying concept for a character to focus on, Back to these in characters later. When it comes to the English setting i really don\'t feel it would matter if this was England or japan, ultimately the only thing really English about all this was some of the characters having British voices, besides that i really didn\'t get immersed in the English part of the show. The tournament part was kinda boring but ok i suppose. I think one of my favorite scenes was a date scene with the MC and a contender in the tournament, which says a lot considering the show mostly focus on either a semi mystery type thing or battles.Characters: 3/10. The most noteworthy characters are Yaya and Charlotte in terms of importance or just being noticed. I think the show wanted me to care about Shouko but honestly in a 12 episode show with her being a side plot development character i just didn\'t see the point. Yaya is extremely thirsty for out MC\'s dick as some characters in anime are which makes her stand out a lot, she also does most of the fighting for the MC like a Pokémon but she has no unique powers so it\'s hard to say if she’s really useful or not. Charlotte\'s voice is so heavily English that it\'s hard to not tell she’s on screen and some of her interactions are cute but she only adds a small bit of light to the show. The MCs revenge thing builds him up to be some great generic MC but then he\'s a screw up who only wins when the plot says it\'s ok. He relies so much on anyone else especially Yaya that it\'s almost sad to watch anytime he fights.Art: 8/10. For a show that wasn\'t great the art has a really unique style to it. It would fit well with an English type show if they focused more on the English part of it (its looks similar to princess principles type style but though i haven\'t seen the show it looks like it did a better job at it) i think it shined best in how its shading/shadows were done but I’m no expert in art so i could be just me.Sound: I\'d say 7/10 because there were scenes that had music that matched the atmosphere and the setting well. The beginning song good but the ending was more Japanese stylized which for a anime based in England makes little to no sense and offsets it from its setting even further.Enjoyment: I\'d say 7/10. It had some good part in the show and when they treated the MC like he was not overpowered but someone to be taken seriously instead of some revenge craving moron he did a good job. The tournament fights were interesting and when they kept to the setting it was refreshing to see something other than japan.Overall: It wasn\'t the worst show, but it definitely is not a classic in my eyes. It gets a 5/10 for what it gave me when it gave it to me right. The characters and the lack of focus on the English setting dug its grave in my opinion. If the MC acted like he was a professional with the revenge thing and he wasn\'t all powerful then he would have made for a great MC but they had to throw the revenge in and screw it up.Let me tell others 2 things, 1: I will not tell you or encourage you to give the same rating, this is just my personal opinion on this show and 2: honestly I’m doing this review and other reviews as a hobby and for my own “anime records” so to speak, so if you see this and don’t like it just ignore it honestly because its more for me then to help others in the long run. wrong, a few things actually including but not limited to tropes, and the story. 5/10.

Well, that\'s what I\'d like to say but sadly it\'s not.The fights are unsatisfying, the protagonist constantly preaches how he\'s got the most advanced automaton (humanoid dolls that are used in combat) in the world, yet said automaton AND the guy himself always gets their ass whooped into the hospital in every single fight. They don\'t land a single satisfying attack on the whole series, and somehow they win some of the fights (most end up...unresolved).They try some comedy in the form of overly jealous and paranoid female characters, and the overused ""Raishin you pervert!"" that repeats the whole show.Ecchi scenes are ok, tho there aren\'t that many. l have to give credit for them for not using the cliche ""guy trips and somehow accidentally grabs the girl\'s boobs"", tho.In the end I give this a 6/10, mostly because I like the art style, if not for that it\'d be an easy 5, maybe even a 4 due to the frustrating fights where the protagonist ends up in the hospital and doesn\'t even land a good hit in the enemies. unresolved).They try some comedy in the form of overly jealous and paranoid female characters, and the overused ""Raishin you pervert!"" that repeats the whole show.Ecchi scenes are ok, tho there aren\'t that many. l have to give credit for them for not using the cliche ""guy trips and somehow accidentally grabs the girl\'s boobs"", tho.In the end I give this a 6/10, mostly because I like the art style, if not for that it\'d be an easy 5, maybe even a 4 due to the frustrating fights where the protagonist ends up in the hospital and doesn\'t even land a good hit in the enemies.', 'Honestly if it weren\'t for the oppai and fanservice, this anime is pretty much like watching a poor attempt at pokemon or something, MC and his partner fights a whole school of people to be the best, I mean wiseman. This anime\'s biggest flaw is that it quite apparently rushed. The moods of this anime tries to take on a serious tone at times and other times it takes on a harem anime approach, but it switches between the two so quick that I honestly can\'t tell what the main theme of the anime is. A lot of things lack explanation, for example the combat...moves, we know MC shouts some stuff, some coloured aura appears around his partner and yeah, that\'s it. Does she gain attack power, defense power, speed or what, we don\'t know, there is no clear indication either of what exactly he did. Some rather cringy situations too, we are shown the doll\'s \'awakening\'  and after the whole first crisis ended I still have no idea what was the point of that happening if they were still gonna get their ass whooped and passing all damage taken as a ""calculated risk"", as quoted in the anime itself.Story: 4Pretty solid idea of combat machine dolls. Had a lot to look forward to. Perhaps the LN takes a better approach in this but I can confidently say the anime does not dive deep into the plot. How should I put it, its as if the anime is just a warm up, introducing the characters and barely touching on the MC\'s initial motives. I must also comment that this anime has many, many logical flaws. Of course, anime and logic don\'t really go well together but this one takes the cake, to the point I created an account on MAL just to comment on this aspect.Art: 6Decent visuals. That\'s it. The scenery and animation is decent but I do hope the combat animations were a bit more tidy. The battles mostly occur at night, so it isn\'t very obvious what\'s going on. It sometimes has typical anime-style visuals but sometimes they attempt to make 3D animations, which wasn\'t very impressive. The MC supposedly gives magic to his doll but the only difference between these spells or whatever they are is the colour. Same aura, same thickness and effects.Pretty good character designs though.Sound: 5OP was quite average, it was a singer I recognised immediately who sung some pretty good songs so this one was a bit of a letdown, ended up skipping the OP beyond the second episode. ED was catchy, kinda vocaloid-like. Character voices were good, the girls weren\'t overly yappy and the male MC had a good voice matching his personality, at least.Character: 4Again, good character designs. Poor character development though, you just don\'t feel the characters developing and it feels more as if they were dolls (true to the anime name I suppose). By this I mean one moment a girl is \'broken\' and seemingly insane and the mood goes serious and all with MC thinking things like ""I shouldn\'t have done this"" and all of a sudden they\'re hugging and all back to normal. Just like that in the blink of an eye. It was at this point I started cringing at all the anime\'s attempts to portray emotion.MC initially appears as a smart and talented guy and that\'s what all the side characters suggest but watching him in action is like watching a \'badass\' character with a pea brain. Making poor decisions in combat based off...oh dear...emotions. Instead of focusing on his whole \'tragedies of the past\' scheme, which was his whole reason for being at the academy, he pokes at others\' business and quite often it feels like playing a RPG where you ignore main quests to just focus on sidequests.Heroine is like an ultra loyal waifu that initially appears quirky with her thirst for MC D, but over time it gets a bit cringy and rather awkward. I\'m surprised the MC has \'love for dolls\' what with his dislike of his partner\'s overly perverse nature.The other harem candidates are just airheads and yeah pretty stereotypical personalities. Somewhat lovable though, depending on you I supposeEnjoyment: 4Some decent fanservice material with ok waifus but as the MC is a massive cockblock himself, I wouldn\'t call this anime a fanservice anime either. The start to climax was decent at best, but the conclusion for this rushed anime was relatively satisfying. Still left with many questions, but if I take this anime as a harem anime, its okay I suppose.Overall: 4I probably wouldn\'t recommend this anime unless you really don\'t have anything to watch.

The expansion of Automaton with the intention to be a military weapon then spread all over the world. Here our main hero appears, Raishin Akabane, a puppeteer of his Automaton (Banned Doll) Yaya is joining Royal Academy, the academy full of puppeteer. His desire is to participate in Night Party, which he believes by that way he can find her elder brother who slaughtered other members of family.I found...the story\'s intriguing and somehow the Automaton concept and the match was allure me deeper, I wished to disclose how the story end. This show, even if so short (well for me after watched this show, 12 eps was not enough) developing its story and characters well. Gradually the viewers introduced to new characters and other matches, many issues in the academy itself, but all of it still attached to the goal of Raishin. The improvements happened to be so smooth yet tense and mostly get rid by matches, that\'s how I like it. We will be served with lots of battles full of meaning and also the deep bond of friendships.Altho\' almost the entire matches here won\'t do any terrible gore, you\'ll find blood, scratches, explodes everywhere all in a proper place. The enjoyment of art in every single matches are completed by the Automaton special moves. The character designs makes me interpret it as sweet, mostly uses the thin outer line and lighter colours. Along with new matches and problems, the characters are developed itself nicely, more intense one by one. The shift of their personalities too, are absorbing.I think the OP theme song here is a blast, sung by Hitomi Harada ""Anicca"" has a solid rhythm, kind of pounding heart tempo while the unique and catchy ED song ""Maware! Setsugetsuka (回レ！雪月花)"" sung by Hitomi Harada, Ai Kayano, and Yui Ogura. Somehow just by listening to the ED song it can lift up my sullen mood yet it\'s not my favorite song which I\'m willing to hear continuously.

In this match, surely allure all of the top puppeteers to fight, and Raishin assumes he will find his elder brother here.', ""When i found this anime the art style was not for me but still i gave it a chance because great story can cover up the art style was what i always thought.Sadly this show is just a mountain of anime cliches, overused settings, overused lines and you can easily predict what's going to happen, also the story pacing wasn't good too.In the end i just couldn't care less about the characters and the story.Kill la Kill, Log Horizon, The devil's a part timer, Silver Spoon and Gargantia was also released that year and just look at the quality of those anime, you cant even...compare. compare."", 'Was very interested in the story and enjoyed the sceens with Yaya and Raishin playing around having fun however... Hated the fact that the festival they kept speaking of never happened I got to episode 10 was was like ""where is this festival??"" it was frustrating they keep throwing all these characters at you and not even trying to show the actual festival they keep talking of so the last few episodes were rather disappointing because I was expecting a big fight at the festival. Also the art style was OK at times but during the fights the scenes just looked awful the way the...automations moved aroundAlso on episode 3 where Charlotte and Raishin go on a date it would have been nice to see more of there date to be honest felt rather rushed. I do enjoy the humour and the romance throughout the season it would be a shame if a season 2 came out and changed that which is the case in most animes lately. To be honest season 1 has left me disappointed as there is no season 2 at the moment and we haven\'t seen a single piece or revenge which was the core reason for Raishin going their in episodes 1. Very disappointed with how little progress was made in season 1 when thinking about the revenge parts of things. automations moved aroundAlso on episode 3 where Charlotte and Raishin go on a date it would have been nice to see more of there date to be honest felt rather rushed.

The plauge of the ""stupidly naive and dense moral-compass protagonist"" trope. I mean, when I see this archetype, I already know, I\'ll feel bad for all of the people around the MC, because they\'ll suffer a lot while they try to protect the dense protagonist from his own stupidity. I really don\'t get it why do people glorify recklessness. Not to mention the complete ignorance of the safety of the loved ones. Sadly, if I see these absolutely avoidable situations, I cannot hate the ""bad guys"", I can only blame the MC for his rush, stuipd, and stubborn decisions. What makes this even...worse, if the plot is written in a way, that the MC gets rewarded for his stupidity... Now, this show is the perfect exectution of the trope. Meh...Other than that a pretty generic shallow story full of plotholes. The world could have been interesting, but there is no world building. There are these battle dolls and be happy about it. It is not much, but it\'s honest work, I guess. The characters are the typical cardboard cutouts, none of them has anything what would resemble a personality. Yaya is fine, I guess, but she lacks of the depth as well. She is not much more than a budget yandere like waifu bait from the wallmart. The dialogs are dumb as hell. I genuinely felt bad for the sidecast. They tried to talk some common sense into our resident dense mofo, but they got only some shallow and really badly written one liners or some pretentious bs in return... Visually, the waifu candidates are fine, but the animation is kinda cluncky here and there, the sounds are nothing fancy neither (especially the OP made my ears bleed, but that\'s just subjective taste, so you may like it).So all in all, this is pretty medicore. If you like the aforementioned tropes, you may have a good time with this one, but for me it was a cringefest. I barely managed to watch until the end. worse, if the plot is written in a way, that the MC gets rewarded for his stupidity... Now, this show is the perfect exectution of the trope.

If you like ecchi isekai anime with good story & interesting plot & development then this is for you.Note that this is not comedy so don't expect many jokes. Instead the jokes are intermezzo and often related to ecchi. This is more of serious battle and story-focused anime with much explaining background individual story.[The Girls]The girls are cute and sexy, it is one of the main selling of this anime.- Yaya is very cute and erotic, always attempt to gain...love for the MC and will do many naughty things in order to do that.- Charlotte is your typical tsundere with big boobs.- Frey is the funniest character, very clumsy and plain stupid and honest, she also has voluptuous delicious body too.Overall this is a great and fun anime to watch. love for the MC and will do many naughty things in order to do that.- Charlotte is your typical tsundere with big boobs.- Frey is the funniest character, very clumsy and plain stupid and honest, she also has voluptuous delicious body too.Overall this is a great and fun anime to watch."", 'This is either a really bad adaptation or there two authors, the first one being an absolute mastermind and the second one being horrendous writer. Personally, revenge stories will always intrigue me. That\'s the reason why i started the series in the first place. I searched for above decent series with revenge as plot and finally came across Machine-Doll wa Kizutsukanai. Reviews were good, VAs were known. This one though has been such a waste of time. I feel like my time, expectations were robbed by reviews...And last of all, if you aren\'t fond of girls screaming ""RAIIISHIIINN""  in a high pitched voice...then this is probably not for your taste.Overall 3/10 then this is probably not for your taste.Overall 3/10', ""(Spoilers Ahead!)Rating: 10/10Unbreakable Machine Doll is an extraordinary anime series that seamlessly weaves together elements of fantasy, steampunk, action, and a touch of romance.
