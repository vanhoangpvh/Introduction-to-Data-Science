Shen Mu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51861/Shen_Mu,"['**Updated** Preliminary Review at the top with full/after review lower down.This is a preliminary review, after having skimmed 5 episodes:As a standalone piece/work, so far, this donghua is nice. The animations are fluid and organic, the art/designs are nice. And the story premise is quite good, however, if you look at it from an adaptation perspective, it really leaves much to be desired. There are simply too many changes to the plot to really be called an adaptation. I saw one commenter on Youtube say it is only kept the name the same, most everything else has been changed. It was given the Yuan Long...Season 2 treatment.For the changes, they seem intent on reducing the number of characters in this donghua from the original. The princess was originally insufferable (she made me want to throw my computer out the window pretty much every chapter, but later disappears so it made things better), but now she\'s less annoying and more normal(?), and she seems to be the main focus/FMC for now, which was NEVER THE CASE in the novel. I might write a more detailed review later after this full season is released.All in all, I think it\'s worth watching as a standalone work, but might not be if you loved the original novel and expect an accurate adaptation.Adaptation Score (how faithful to the source): 3/10****************************************************************This will be a more comprehensive review of Shen Mu after I finished watching the whole season. I will do a review of the work as well as going through what changes were made in the work as an adaptation. My ""preliminary review"" opinion still stands, so you can read that if you want a 100% spoiler free impression. The following review may contain spoilers.For the Shen Mu donghua, if you look at it as a standalone work (not as an adaptation), it is still a decent donghua, though a bit light-hearted and generic. It is not a bad watch, however, the tone and direction is much different from the original work (novel).General Plot: Chen Nan wakes up 10,000 years after his death (he remembers dying), to find himself in a tomb where all the most powerful figures of his time buried alongside him. He wonders, why is he alive? After finding out about how much time has passed, he originally plans to look for some answers and live his life exploring this new work, but an unexpected reunion with the HouYi bow, his family\'s heirloom divine weapon drags him into the conspirisies planned for tens of thousands of years.As a standalone work, the story and plot of this decent. Unfortunately, because this is an adaptation that had a huge departure from the source material (more on that in the adaptation section), there are large amount of inconsistancies in both character and plot. However, despite these problems, this donghua story is still good, it is just not as well paced as it could have been and there is some questionable motives/decisions made by the characters. There is also an overly complicated romantic entanglement with a tsundere princess and political machinations (and clearly defined villain) that I felt were shoehorned in to create a huge climax for the season, espeically since the season ended most of the plot threads. Overall, it can be considered a relatively generic shounan donghua with a ""OP"" protagonist. Enjoyable, but very disappointing for viewers who read the original work.The character designs and the animations are done well, the art style is very appealing and the animations are smooth. The action scenes flow well and feel impactful. At least the animation department did a good job.Overall, an enjoyable watch, though the plot can be a bit incosistant and messy. 7/10Review as an adaptation (comparison to source, spoilers ahead):As for how this stands as an adaptation of the novel...........it\'s horrible. While it started off fine, the opening was pretty cool, it almost immediately began to change the plot; I thought it would only be small tweaks like most adaptations, but as the season progressed, the changes became greater and greater. By the end, it\'s even hard to call it an adaptation.Plot Explanation (SPOILERS FOR PLOT COMPARISON):Chen nan was originally a genius, a young master with great cultivation talent, but after his duel with Tantai Xuan, his cultivation started to regress to Rank 1 (from Rank 3). This caused others to treat him as a cripple/trash (typical). Because of this he was sent to travel the world to cure his depression by his parents, he met Yu Sheng during his travels, and the two fell in love with each other. However, he was later attacked by one of this father\'s enemies as revenge, during which Yu Sheng sacrificed herself to save him. While his father was able to go against the laws of nature to revive Yu Sheng, it was not perfect causing them to be seperated again. Chen Nan falls in to a depression again. Feeling tired of life, he goes on a deathmatch suicide mission to fight the son of the one who killed Yu Sheng. He dies and someone does something to his body (seen in the opening). Now we get to the beginning of the novel, where the donghua opens (All this was Chen Nan\'s history as is revealed later).PLOT OF NOVEL COVERED BY DONGHUA:Chen Nan wakes up 10k years after his death in the ""tomb of the gods"", a place where the most powerful people of his era were buried. After he ressurected, he left the tomb and traveled to a border town where he spent one year learning the new era\'s language (it has been 10k years after all). Then when he embarks on a journey to travel the new world, intending to start a new life unconnected to his past, since everything he knew had disappeared into the river of time. However, he has an unfortunate encounter with the princess Chu Yu, and ends up being captured as a slave (not servant like in the donghua) for peeking on her bathing. They continue to the mountain to get the fire lotus for the emperor\'s birthday present (not to cure her father like in the donghua). The princess uses the HouYi bow during the fight, which allows us readers to know understand the bow can only be shot once every 10 years (needs to recharge). During the fight, Chen Nan is able to escape, but is captured by the neighboring empire\'s prince as he tries to steal the HouYi bow that the princess snuck out. During the subsequent bluffing/ambush on the princess, the HouYi bow ends up in Chen Nan\'s hands as a ""hot potato"", with no choice, he is forced to try to use it to save himself, revealing he can use the bow without limitations. Then there is some plot revolving Chen Nan capturing the princess, princess taking a bite of the lotus, and reversing their captor-hostage roles. As punishment for capturing her, she uses that absorbtion technique on Chen Nan as punishment to weaken him, but ends up sucking all the Qi out of his body, revealing the hidden qi that caused his cultivation to decline. Because of this, others end up treating him as a cripple, while he is able to recover his cultivation talent and quickly return to the level he once was (he hid his cultivation from others and pretended to cripple). He hid his cultivation intending to not develop any ties with any powers, so he can remain free. The older princess manages to track the two down and decides to try to heal/nurture Chen Nan because of his ability to wield the HouYi bow, employing Nalan Ruoshui (a deleted character), a practicioner of medicine/healing arts. Chen Nan develops a close relationship with Nalan Ruoshui, since she\'s genuine to him. By now, his goal has changed, while he was intending to live a life free from his past, his reunion with the HouYi bow (a family heirloom), and revelation that his mortal enemy, Tantai Xuan has become revered, he decided to dig up the secrets of the past 10k years and get his revenge. To do that, he continued to hide his cultivation while he scoured the ancient books of the empire; once he finished he planned to leave (not to overstay his welcome as he is a ""cripple""). However, he learns that Nalan Ruoshui is to be married off in a political marriage (and live a lifetime of misery), he makes an irrational choice to reveal his power to prevent that, by officially tying himself with the empire. The emperor first agrees, then renegades, making Chen Nan mutiny. He finally is able to prevent the marriage through mutiny, and takes Chu Yu hostage in order to escape, ending the plot corresponding to the novel that the donghua should cover.The changes to the plot are numerous, but I will try to categorize them. The changes include: side character reduction and role consolidation, plot thread shortening and shuffling, political climate, and a plethroa of MC changes.Changes to the MC (character, motivations, etc.) -The MC was weak because of his cripple cultivation and not as ""badass"" as in this donghua. I guess this change was because most people don\'t like pathetic, self-loathing, and weak MC\'s, which he would have been for the first half of the season. His original motivation was to travel the world, then changed to learning the secrets of the past as his encounter with familar objects drew him into that vortex. He was also very independant and did not like to be attached to others, unlike what is shown in the donghua, as it seems Chu Yu, the princess, will be a mainstay in this donghua.Changes involving HouYi Bow -First in the donghua, the mysteries/secrets of HouYi bow came to light earlier, with the whole revival thing, this was something that was slowly revealed to readers as MC dug deeper into his past and found out about his family/clan\'s deeper secrets.Second, the HouYi bow was a divine weapon that protected the Chu Empire. Its ability was to guarantee a hit on anyone it was aimed at, making it an effective tool for intimidation (you would be able to effectively kill anyone you wanted which would scare other rulers), but it had a restriction: it could only be used once every 10 years, after that it had a cooldown because it had been sealed. This made the MC\'s value much greater, because he could pull it without that restriction (he\'s the defacto owner of the bow 10k years prior). Now, there was little reason to keep him by the first princess other than the second princess Chu Yu likes him (See character changes for more info).Side character Changes -The changes to the side characters are quite significant. The neighboring empire\'s prince was painted as the main villain and mastermind behind all the ""bad stuff"" in this donghua, while in the novel he was just a insignificant minor character. I won\'t say much about him because he is so insignificant, but his villainous portrayal is mirrored by the white-washing of the princesses (which I\'ll talk about a bit later).-The baby dragon that showed up in this season was only supposed to be introduced later in the story, during the academy arc, where the MC is headed after the end of Season 1. I guess they added it because it\'s cute and for comedic relief? The whole revalation that the dragon was a rank 5 dragon doesn\'t come until much much later; the reveal was quite premature.-Now onto the changes to the important persons of the empire: there was a significant amount put on the chopping block. The asshole dragon rider that got owned by Chen Nan (our MC) was basically a typical rich young master type. In this donghua, they changed him to be ""heroic"" and self-sacrificing even though he was a petty and selfish asshole.-When the MC joined the Eccentrics\' brigade (where he stayed), he met some unique cultivators there, like the old poison devil and witch who were quite interesting and unique, but they got completely cut from the show.-There was a potential love interest, a friend of the elder princess named Nalan Ruoshui, who got completely deleted from the story. She was nice to the MC and would be one of the potential romantic interests in the story. After she was removed, her character and roles have been divided between the princesses (older and FMC).-The older princess is shown as patriotic/nationalistic and stern but loving in the donghua, however this is partially because of the role consolidation. In the novel, she is an perfect example of a cunning fox politician. She changes her face to suit whatever role she needed. She may act compassionate or understanding, but it is all calculated to achieve political goals. She even contemplated having the MC secretly assassinated after assigning him to some remote region after finding out he was useless, because her friend (mentioned above) had some good will/feelings toward him.-The FMC, Chu Yu, is changed to be a slightly mischivious and tsundere princess. In the novel, she was an spoiled, insufferable b*tch, petty and loved to watch the world burn for her entertainment. Chu Yu, the younger princess, was promoted to FMC, which was not the case in the novel. She was semi-important as a hostage in the earlier parts of the novel (for his protection after he mutinied against the Chu Empire), but after the academy arc Chu Yu mostlydisappears from the novel. Despite being a hostage, because the ancestor of the Chu Empire was following Chen Nan, he still had to deal with her annoying antics.Plot and plot thread changes -The main outline of the donghua is the same as in the novel, but because of changes to characters, the major details are changed. I also heard that there were production issues with this donghua (changing studios etc) which probably influenced some of the changes, like plot theards. This donghua is VERY episodic, meaning almost everything that happened in this season got wrapped up, with very little lead-ins for the next season (they only left . Some of the things that happened in this donghua were not supposed to occur yet, like they attempted takeover of Chen Nan\'s body, the reveal or introduction of the baby dragon. Those should have happened in the ""second arc"" which takes place at the academy they are travelling to at the end of the season. Because of all the changes to the characters, many of the details changed making this a very loose adaptation of the original work (novel).Political climate -The Chu empire, that the princesses are from was portrayed as one of the most powerful. Of course, the prince that is the main villain of this season, was trying to hurt the Chu empire by stealing the Hou Yi bow. The other empire was also powerful, on par with the Chu empire, it could simply be seen as a ""cold war"" for supremecy. In this donghua, the empire is portrayed as weakening, with succession issues, etc. While the vassal states wanted to show strength and break away from vassal status, it was not like how they were presented here (used by another country to achieve some goals).Final Adaptation Score (how faithful to source):2/10 Season 2 treatment.For the changes, they seem intent on reducing the number of characters in this donghua from the original. The princess was originally insufferable (she made me want to throw my computer out the window pretty much every chapter, but later disappears so it made things better), but now she\'s less annoying and more normal(?), and she seems to be the main focus/FMC for now, which was NEVER THE CASE in the novel.

Adaptations usually never do the original story any justice.However, if you came across Tomb of Fallen Gods by coincidence, then you might enjoy the beautiful animation, OP action and the opening of what could be another epic top tier animation, though I'll reserve judgment for now.Everything that happened in Season 1 was merely a teaser of what's to come, laying out...the ground works. The characters seem to be developing, especially when it came to their powers, their past and growing into themselves, at least, on the MCs part. I look forward to Season 2 (if any) as then it'll make more sense of why Chen Nan was revived - his past, powers and etc, since at some point even if I enjoyed the animation, I'm still quite confused as to what on earth was going on. (Especially since I've never seen the original novel)Not sure if there'll be any romance but I did enjoy the typical hot-cold camaraderie between Chen Nan and Chu Yue, though if it ends up being a harem, then I'm out.Overall there's no harm to add this on your TBW list. the ground works.

Shuangsheng Lingtan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33969/Shuangsheng_Lingtan,"[""As someone who has finished reading the original comic version, I think the animation studio did a pretty good job of the animated version. Not too much of the plot and characters were changed compared to a lot of other Chinese shows. The story is interesting and different, with cool and funny twin brothers being the main characters who are solving mysteries. It was nice to watch as the story is unique. There could be some improvements but it's pretty decent in my opinion. I'd recommend for others to give it a go too if they are interested in genres like supernatural and mystery. "", 'Let\'s start off with saying I was really tempted to give these series a 10.""Is there any evidence to prove your existence?""It was something that was briefly mentioned earlier in the series, yet it wraps up the feeling I get from this series. Saying a series is confusing, can be positive and negative, as it can point out to a badly written plot or something with a lot of surprises. In the case of Shuangsheng Lingtan, I\'m talking about the last one of course. I just couldn\'t predict where the series was going. It feels really refreshing, yet not too complicated.But first let\'s wrap...up the story a lil\' (there will be some spoilers of the first episodes).Story 9/10So the story is about the twin detectives Xiao Tu and Xiao Hu, who hold a business that specializes in supernatural events. What makes this series interesting, is that Xiao Hu died a while ago. However, Xiao Tu is still able to see and communicate with his dead brother and they\'re always together. As a viewer, you start to get questions about the situation, as the series drops hints that there\'s more to it than just a guy that happened to see the ghost of his dead brother. As Youzi said: ""Since you don\'t believe you have any psychological issues, how do you view your current situation?""What if there aren\'t any ghosts but this series is about hallucinating and PTSD\'s?These are all questions fired at the viewer in only the first half hour.The series hasn\'t finished airing yet, but as where we are now in the story, I can confirm a lot of questions get a satisfying ending. The individual stories tie together nicely, without becoming predictable and a few jumpscares every now and then (that creepy baby... just... that baby...).Yes, it\'s by far the most tightly written series I have ever seen, with obvious clues and kind of simplistic interrogations, but nevertheless it\'s enjoyable and good when it has to be. The best way to call this series is: \'Refreshing\', even though I can\'t really tell you why.Art 8/10Hmm, maybe I was slightly too generous with my points over here, but I just really love this art-style? Yes, you could say the character designs are too plain, but the animation and art-style itself is really beautiful. I might be biased because it slightly (just SLIGHTLY) reminds me of the art in Kakumeiki Valvrave (mainly the eyes). Shout-out to Bing btw, she\'s gorgeous without being your average my-boobs-don\'t-understand-gravity-Miss-Fanservice.Sound 7/10The opening is beautiful and really reminds me of the typical detective series I used to watch on TV. Other than that I can\'t say a lot about the sound. It wasn\'t outstanding, but not disturbing either.Compared to some other Chinese anime (including some done by Haoliners) the voice acting is better, by the way. A lot of people often shit on the Chinese voice cast, but I think they sound good in Shuangshen Lingtan.Character 8/10Nothing too special or unique, yet it doesn\'t feel like they lack character development. They\'re simple, likable and nice.Enjoyment 10/10When I watch a show, all I want is to be surprised. Shuangshen Lingtan didn\'t fail on me on this one. I couldn\'t predict where the story was going for, yet it didn\'t follow some kind of illogical path in order to be unique or creative. It was just fine.Thanks for surviving my bad English, and I hope you give this series a shot! up the story a lil\' (there will be some spoilers of the first episodes).Story 9/10So the story is about the twin detectives Xiao Tu and Xiao Hu, who hold a business that specializes in supernatural events.

As Youzi said: ""Since you don\'t believe you have any psychological issues, how do you view your current situation?""What if there aren\'t any ghosts but this series is about hallucinating and PTSD\'s?These are all questions fired at the viewer in only the first half hour.The series hasn\'t finished airing yet, but as where we are now in the story, I can confirm a lot of questions get a satisfying ending. The individual stories tie together nicely, without becoming predictable and a few jumpscares every now and then (that creepy baby... just... that baby...).Yes, it\'s by far the most tightly written series I have ever seen, with obvious clues and kind of simplistic interrogations, but nevertheless it\'s enjoyable and good when it has to be. The best way to call this series is: \'Refreshing\', even though I can\'t really tell you why.Art 8/10Hmm, maybe I was slightly too generous with my points over here, but I just really love this art-style? Yes, you could say the character designs are too plain, but the animation and art-style itself is really beautiful. I might be biased because it slightly (just SLIGHTLY) reminds me of the art in Kakumeiki Valvrave (mainly the eyes). Shout-out to Bing btw, she\'s gorgeous without being your average my-boobs-don\'t-understand-gravity-Miss-Fanservice.Sound 7/10The opening is beautiful and really reminds me of the typical detective series I used to watch on TV. Other than that I can\'t say a lot about the sound. It wasn\'t outstanding, but not disturbing either.Compared to some other Chinese anime (including some done by Haoliners) the voice acting is better, by the way. A lot of people often shit on the Chinese voice cast, but I think they sound good in Shuangshen Lingtan.Character 8/10Nothing too special or unique, yet it doesn\'t feel like they lack character development. They\'re simple, likable and nice.Enjoyment 10/10When I watch a show, all I want is to be surprised. Shuangshen Lingtan didn\'t fail on me on this one. I couldn\'t predict where the story was going for, yet it didn\'t follow some kind of illogical path in order to be unique or creative. It was just fine.Thanks for surviving my bad English, and I hope you give this series a shot!', ""I haven't finished this but thought to write from what I have seen so far. Might update when I have finished watching.Art: I like the art. I haven't watched any Chinese anime before so was greatly pleased by the level of art work. If you are an anime fan, you might have seen better (I have) but overall, trust me, there's worse and this is pretty good.Music: I like the ending and starting songs, but it might not be for everyone. Just go with it, it's nice.Plot: I went in with no exceptions; someone mentioned fan service and I thought, oh, boobs, great!...not interested but this caught me by surprised. The plot is detailed, there are things you can miss in the first watching that you can go back and watch again. The plot twists, though nothing great, build up make the pacing interesting and unexpected.

At no time does he get annoying.Would I watch this again: Yes. This anime needs more exposure. not interested but this caught me by surprised.

This anime needs more exposure."", '- This review contains spoilers -The first thing I will say about Twin Spirit Detectives is that it held a lot of promise.Story: The show is about Xiaotu, a kind of detective for hire, who works with his brother solving mysteries. The plot was interesting at first, with everything supernatural having a natural explanation somehow, but quickly leaves the original plot behind in favor of increasingly paranormal and strange events that just didn\'t make sense. In the end, it was all because of some doctor who had found the physical manifestation of the ""human spirit"" as a small, insect shaped piece of tissue in...the brain. The doctor was experimenting with transplanting it, working on twins like the main characters. The plot started out interesting, but had problems with pacing and lot\'s of plot holes, especially considering science and physics ( the spirit was in the brain, but some how a specially made crossbow bolt to the neck extracted it without damaging the person etc.)Art & Sound: The art and sound was probably the best parts of this show, showcasing possibly the best voice acting I\'ve ever seen in a Chinese anime. The art was also solid. I did enjoy the instrumental part of the OP, but not the singing (preferences, you know).Overall: This show had a lot of promise, but failed to deliver when it came to story and character building. There might be more seasons coming, but I\'m not sure I will be bothering to revisit it. This might be different for others though, so I suggest trying it if you fancy some light detective work with a ambiguous and strange main story. the brain.

Slowly, the story unfolds upon that very question. And every sidestory will be a piece of a big jigsaw, once solved, giving you the answer you wished to get.There will be questions, riddles and things to ponder about. But most importantly they will be answered with believeable and realistic (albeit still fictional) answers.Build upon it\'s story is the world our Protagonists live or exist in. Locations differ and are recognizeable and distinct. They give off atmospheric feelings fitting their situation. A big church-like library as Headquarters for a Spirit detective? Even to my standards, this was fairly interesting and comfortable to look at.Each setup and location has it\'s unique feel and reason to be. The art and character style was fitting to the whole image, at least to my eyes.It was not too colorful, it was horrific at points. This anime\'s style is a bit closer to realism than others, which makes the supernatural part so much more immersive.But as anything in the world, even this piece has flaws, or things which are questionable.I do not pay special attention to parts of animes in order to write reviews, and thus I can only say this much:The sound of this anime is lacking. I do not remember a single second where I thought or felt the music enhanced the situation. I don\'t even remember if it had background music at all..In some cases more subtle bgm is the best, but in this anime, it felt lacky. Various scenes could\'ve been much more impactful if only it had better bgm. I did like the opening song, but that\'s about it.Another thing that I realized at a certain point of the anime was that our beloved twin main characters are lacking in something essential: Pulling our heartstrings effectively.I loved the both of them, but I had some sort of unsatisfied feeling throughout the whole series.Although this anime is supposed to play around twins, which should have equal attention because it\'s the point of the whole anime, one of them was neglected for no reason. It felt as if the younger twin was that much more important, while the older twin only provided a few interesting pieces to the main story.I felt a bit frustrated that the older twin\'s existence was not really that important.He did have a few roles, but all of them felt rather weak and forced. His connection to his brother was questionable and hardly relateable.It felt as if his only important trait was him being his younger brother\'s ""twin"".Furthermore lacking any solid characteristics. Even until the end it was not clear what exactly his older twin brother could do. It is not clear how he can or can\'t do certain things. To some extent, the secretive behaviour was necessary for the series development and it\'s momentum. However, it was way too secretive even after all questions were answered. His behaviour and presence was lacking. You might find yourself thinking ""What is he doing, where is he?"" often enough in regards to the older twin. But be prepard, you won\'t get clear answers. You will only get one answer, from which you could derive your answers yourself. Although it is still very unclear.Nonetheless, their shared story and suffering was very interesting!I think the whole idea and setup was well developed and still keeps me interested in another season.I recommend watching this anime. It\'s episodes are around 14 minutes (Including 2 min opening), and they are thus rather short and easy to binge. These short episodes really did me in for some reason. Nothing felt too strongly stretched just to hit that episode time.Thank you for reading, have a nice day. :) the profession of spirit detectives, taking up bizarre cases their clients present to them.Starting this series though, you will realize the story is not as simple as it might appear at first.You are presented with a huge question right off the bat, and this question will keep you on this series long enough, for you to start liking the entire setup and their characters.

Shakugan no Shana: Koi to Onsen no Kougai Gakushuu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1531/Shakugan_no_Shana__Koi_to_Onsen_no_Kougai_Gakushuu,"[""This is set more like an actual episode or a special.  On its own this doesn't have much of a story, but fit it in the series and it works just fine.It focused almost entirely on Ogata and Tamaka's relationship, while dealing with all of the typical anime hot spring moments we love. Really this was purely comedic and exaggerated a lot of the characters roles in a hilarious way. Even Marjory makes an appearance (drinking of course).If you are looking for an ova that has an indepth storyline, this isn't it. However it is something good, if you are looking for a...field trip, fan-service, fun episode. :D field trip, fan-service, fun episode. :D"", '===Animation===It\'s very good, but it doesn\'t seem to be as good as the animation in the TV series. A bit of a disappointment. As for the fanservice/ecchi that this was supposed to be about, is kinda disappointing as well. It wasn\'t up to the standard that it should have been at.===Sound===Both the OP and ED are the same as in the series, so can\'t complain about anything here since they were both very good songs. Background music was average, and seiyuu\'s did a good job on this OVA.===Story===Is there even a story to this? Not really. It doesn\'t even revolve around Shana, but about some...new girl that I\'ve never seen before called ""Oga"" and her classmates. This is a disappointment, but you can\'t expect too much from an OVA aimed at fanservice-lovers. I guess it\'s the comedy that counts a bit. However it wasn\'t anything spectacular, but it made me laugh a few times.===Characters===Some characters appear in this OVA that I\'ve never seen before in the series and the specials. They are just Shana\'s classmates from school. The only characters that I recognised from the series were Shana, Yuuji, Kazumi. All three of them got a fairly decent airing time considering the fact that the plot wasn\'t even about them. Margery, Alastor and Wilhelmina got very little airing time. A few seconds, maybe with the exception of Margery who got like a whole minute (lol). And some had absolutely nothing to do there, like Wilhelmina.===Enjoyment===Overall this is a disappointment. To tell you the truth I wasn\'t expecting anything special, but this was just below what I was expecting. If at least the fanservice/ecchi and comedy was any good, but neither one of those factors was good enough to improve my overall impression on this.

Shippuu! Iron Leaguer,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2758/Shippuu_Iron_Leaguer,"[""Shippu! Iron Leaguer is not an incredible show, and you should watch it. Especially if you like robots. This is one of my all-time favourites.It's probably fair to say that at no point in its life was this show a chart-topper. From its.. interesting robot designs and continually subpar animation to its repetitive and often limited soundtrack and aggressively corny plot beats, Iron Leaguer is clearly not the cream the of the crop. It never received an English release, so the vast majority of its English-speaking viewers have been given the opportunity to see it thanks to the efforts of fansubbers Alpha Numbers and Silver...Castle. I think it's pretty telling, then, that most reviews here from those that have watched the whole show have given it a better score than those elements perhaps deserve.On a surface level, this is a weird combination of a half-assed sports anime that's more about sportsmanship than actually playing sport, and a sentient mecha show that dips into the ethics of robotics. Kinda. If you like the talking, feeling kind of robots, this is going to be very up your alley.The run-of-the-mill sports championship content of this show is underpinned by a deeper, weirdly darker narrative about old robots being retired and used for war. Perhaps inadvertently, this intrigue is coupled with a surprisingly effective framing of our enigmatic protagonist Magnum Ace that starts suspenseful, turns into something deeply interesting, and is concluded with an arc that breaks open the consequences of that mystery and interrogates his character, using him as a metaphor for the moral basis of the show. Iron Leaguer is not well written on a moment-to-moment basis, but over its 52-episode run this throughline is bewilderingly well-executed.The rest of the main cast, for the most part, spend their focus episodes being interesting and endearing and then fade into the background as soon as they're over. The plots often alternate between being cheesy and outright ridiculous, and so much of this show is unintentionally funny that it makes an amazing drinking game.The show sucks. But it has a driving plot that works, enough interesting characters at any given time to support it, and most of all - elevating it above other lackluster old animes, imo - it has heart. Give it a chance and if it's for you, you'll see what I mean. Castle.

Give it a chance and if it's for you, you'll see what I mean."", ""one of the things on the amazon jp site that caught my eye was somebody said I HAVE TO show this anime to my child. I totally agree!!  good message and fun to watch.I feel that fans of this show are crazy fans even if they haven’t seen the show in years. I can only imagine the joy the Japanese fans felt when the show finally got released to DVD 10 years after airing.This is definitely a special anime. It’s so goood that you can tell in 1993 or 4 or whenever that they’re never going to make something this good again or rather...i wish they would! In other words, a true classic! I am calling this a classic because of the QUALITY not because it’s old or the first anime to do x. I wish people would stop calling boring old animes as classic because it’s old. I wish people would stop saying oh it’s the nostalgia or whatever to dismiss 90s/80s anime (it basically depends on the anime). For me i remember I loved watching a bunch of anime as a child and remember they were fun. But then i watched some of those again years later after I forget all the details and then after re-watching i went what ? that’s it? i realized at that point it’s ONLY really fun for children but not for me now.  It’s not a bad thing necessarily. Some pass that test, some don’t. it’s pretty obvious whether it does or not. LET ME TELL you that this anime shines now and then. I would guess that when I was a child I wasn’t drawn to this anime… you know robots + sports screams shounen anime. I probably watched on a whim and then realized the show is actually REALLY good. I feel like there’s no such thing as I hate x genre in anime. I think it means you haven’t a seen a good anime in that genre. That’s another reason why I think it’s special. I hate shonen anime and this one is if you try to categorize it from the nature of the show but it’s so gooooooood. Whenever say ugh this anime went all shonen on me I mean that in the worst way possible lol… ie the end of kurenai. despite that there are “shonen” anime that I do like.I feel like this anime could only be done via anime and that too adds to the specialness of the anime. If it was 26 eps, it wouldn’t be as good, if it was live action that would be really difficult lol… For nodame cantabile I was thinking how the animation is not that anime and so it’s not as expressive as iron leaguer when it comes to facial expression or any type of expression.. they kept the instrument playing animation to a minimum? for obvious reasons. I was thinking what’s the point of making this into an anime?? I thought the drama was better… I REALLY loved the facial expressions and other stuff they did for expression in iron leaguer so it made me think of this.I love the message of the show. I love how it doesn’t come off forced or cheesy as it has in other anime shows especially the kids shows (wedding peach…) . i love how even though it’s a kids show it can definitely enjoyed by adults. few children’s shows can also be enjoyed by adults and this is one of them. There’s also mystery and surprises. There’s parts that I LOVE… those scenes where x finds about y’s secret or x learns the truth about y. While i was watching i was so curious as to how the character would react and what they would say and now that i’ve seen it, i want to see it again lol.random thought while I was watching. I was thinking “hey since ryuuken is the karate leaguer he’s like asian so does he have the smallest eyes?” but his eyes looked big in this scene so eh to that silly theory.I further confirmed the specialness of the anime when I read the interviews by the producers on the official site and how they had all this inspiration from real baseball players and more and were having fun and working hard to make it (like the animators). Also one of them said that this show is for children but they also want people of other ages to watch… he went on to say that overly making it from a child’s pov isn’t a children’s anime. rather, anime that can be enjoyed by adults and old people and children are true children anime. They had no CG back then 😦 but  i wonder if the show would look like shit if they used CG…After i finished watching it i really wanted to read interviews. there’s interviews on the official website but I want more. I was thinking if they had interviews or something in anime magazines in the 90s… like i want to read those tooooo. also I felt like reading other fans thoughts… well the japanese fans.there’s no romance but there’s bromance. in fact you could watch it from a a dirty yaoi fangirl pov lol. there are scenes or lines that could be interpreted like that. I definitely watched from that point of view from time to time lol. i also watched from a serious pov too. Magnum x windy forever ❤ ! lol. IRON LEAUGER is so much more moe than the anime nowadays that try so hard… AND FAIL. It reminds me of some of the realllly trashy american singers that think they’re “sexy” or they think they have to be trashy or almost naked (naked as possible) to be sexy.. they don’t seem to understand that that’s not necessary. I’ve seen time it and time again on immotral song or even in k-pop that it’s possible to be classy and sexy at the same time. it’s so oversexualized in america.there’s comedy too. it’s smidge of comedy but when they put it in here and there with the animation or situation or a line that put a smile on my face or made me chuckle. it’s so well done because of the characters/character designs and the whole set-up. there isn’t a lot of comedy, BUT none of the comedy fails. the point of the show isn’t comedy anyway but the comedy in it is 5/5 lol. The just completes the show~so in that way there’s cuteness and moe ( I moed out sometimes lol). the animes now a days try way too hard to the point where the show is boring as hell unless you’re a creepy otaku or they have NO class or it’s so obvious they’re trying so hard. I really want those otakus to watch this anime. for this show that kind of stuff is effortless and those little moments of moe and cuteness is to die for. I LOVED it when magnum winked lol. nowadays the moe is getting really creepy or boring or way too maniac or plain tasteless or too… much ie borderline softcore porno/hentai/whatever you call it. i feel like the moe here occurred naturally or it came off naturally as a result of all the hard-work they put into show rather than like using moe to cover their asses which is a noticeable trend in anime right now.  I like the word bromance more than yaoi and i don’t know what yaoi really means anyways (how far do they go lol). they’re robots anyhooooo. so i feel like the bromance is all innocent and fun and if you want to think all twisted and whatnot draw weird fanart go ahead~I love the animation. the character designs kick ass. For example, the inning on magnum’s back is so CUTE lol. I gotta pause and stare at everyone’s designs lol. one time they zoomed into their shoes/feet. they were all so unique and cute lolz. no seriously i need to inundate this post with the ADORABLE CHARACTER DEISGNS. some of them are BADASS of course but I can still see the cuteness in the badass designs tooooooooo. that’s another reason why this show is so awesome. It has so much going on for it.The human character designs are good. i was reading in the interview somebody drew the humans asked the producer or somebody is this alright. whaddya think? so i could tell they were beingparticular with it. if you think ruri is ugly or whatever then i guess you can since she’s a normal girl. they show a movie star in one ep and that movie star was really pretty. so i think it’s fine ruri isn’t as pretty as the movi star. i dont’ tihnk ruri ugly though personally.  I think the girl designs that are overly moed up are ugly actually if anything… .not to mention not a smidge of originality. it reminds me of south korean plastic surgery epidemic. NOSE, EYES, JAW-LINE, FAT-DISTRIBUTION. wtfThe action/animation was intense and exciting and they definitely planned it out well. The beginning of the series was sorta normal but as things progressed the animation got more intense.  I really mean it as intense and exciting. that’s the only way I can describe it. don’t worry it’s not a mediocre sports/shonen (no seriously what is up with the crap people proclaim as epic being the boring shit in the world?) anime. the games are exciting, i was saying they're screwed every other episode lol. that’s what makes it interesting. plus the episodes where the game should be most exciting really is exciting… you don’t have to worry about quality when it comes to that. It was awesome. I had a blast watching those episodes because there’s moments where I’m like omg what’s gonna happen/omg i can’t believe this happened/omg how’s it gonna end/omg i can’t believe it’s ending like this/ lol. it’s a lot of omg’s like every couple minutes??? I found it fun and enjoyable to watch… and that’s what makes someone want to recommend a certain anime to another person because you want to pass on your enjoyment and hope or think that they’ll enjoy it as well.I love the facial expressions they did with the robots. it’s so expressive. When I was reading the interview, they had separate people for separate things like a person was in charge of facial expression, another for posing etc etc. so I totally LOVED that when I watched. It’s so well done and i could tell they put effort into minuscule stuff like that even before i read the interview. there’s stuff I notice or feel or whatever while watch and reading the interview just affirms that or explains what I was feeling and love how it goes both ways like that. i really really feel what the creators put in to this … their sweats, tears, soul, love for sports, etc,etc. going back to what i was saying i loved what they did with their eyes. I thought it was interesting how their mouths are pink inside like humans lol. Not to mention SUPER CUTE!!!  one aspect of the show that seems sorta contradicting is what makes it so good and special and unique. that is how the robots are metal so they shouldn’t be humanly but actually they’re more human than the humans lol.I also love how the thicklines add to the menace(?) /intensity/impactThe people who made this anime mentioned in the interview on the official website how they had trouble with consistently drawing the characters and robots the same in terms of their relative heights/size. I think they argued about it and got frustrated lol. I think it’s cute and it’s anime so it’s all GOOD. it adds to the enjoyment in my opinion.. spot the quirks!CHARACTERSI wonder if there’s a main character? Is it Magnum Ace? I mean everything is connected to him. If he’s not, then there’s no main character. Anyways I loved all the characters. They’re ALL likable and have their cute character designs. I loved the way top joy talked with the nes and the intonation. not sure if english speakers can tell that his intonation is a little off because i remember when i was wtaching lovely complex with zero japanese studying i couldn’t really hear a significant difference from the way these characters talked vs characters in any other anime but if i were to watch it now i would be like oh it’s so kansai-ben lol. Anyways I loved SEAGULL… the voice acting, the way they drew him, the angle, the pose, etc, and his story or whatever scene with him had me glued me to the screen. THEY utilized the side characters really well.VOICE ACTINGI loved all the voice acting. everyone fitted the character. MAGNUM’s voice is PERFECTTTTTTTT. I liked all the voice actor’s voices… like i gotta look up what other anime they’re in. I loved the recycling of the Voice actors too lol. like the voice actor of someone on silver castle ends up voicing the baddie’s ___ voice. it’s interesting. actually out of the gold brothers i liked gold mask the best because of his voice… but i like all of ’em so much! sometimes i wanted to know the voice actor of some really minor person in the episode but then when i chcked out the credits they credit main and minor but they don’t include e single character that was in the episode. so i asked on chiebukuro who did mihaeru’s voice because i loved her voice and they were like…well one person replied that it was this voice actor who plays another characteron iron leaguer… so maybe that’s why they don’t credit a character because they recycle the voice actors and we’re supposed to know which one did that minor character (sometimes the va is reall ygood at changing their voices to play different characters so it’s sorta hard. do they still do this practice now a days ? lol.and of course i LOVEd THE BGM. when i saw them use the bgm in the first ep I was scared they might overuse it but they didn’t overuse it at all imo… and i watched eps in a row etc etc… you know how some tv dramas have something special going on for it especially the bgm like hanazakari no kimtiachi e or JIN or this… you can tell they’re putting their all into it the shows.So I didn’t watch the previews till after i saw the episode because I want to be as surprised as much as possible. But after certain episodes I was thinking even if i watched the preview i couldn’t have predicted this lol. there’s some good surprisesMUSICThe opening is awesome. it totally matches the show. It’s definitely good enough to be used throughout the whole run. as you watch the show you realize how amazing the opening song is. I was wondering for the part where they sing IRON LEAGUER with japanese pronounciation of aian riiiiiiiii gaaaaaaaaaa….it sounds like they’re saying eiennnnn leaguer. it doe snot sound like aiannnnnn riiiiiiii gaaaaaaaaaa like it should. in the show they say iron leaguer a lot and they aian riii gaaa. maybe they’re doing that on purpose cause you know eien means forever,eternal. I never reallllllly got why he’s saying it like eiennnnnn riiiiii gaaa.the ending song is really goood, i love the message. i love hearing the seiyuu’s of characters sing the song. here it is ruri’s seiyuu.the second ending song is silly lol. the lyrics are simple and fitting. i was gonna watch it once then i realized that they’re changing the lyrics up for the song. it’s so funny hearing magnum ace sing such a silly song.they changed the animation for the op and let me say that the second opening is rather intense. in fact i couldn’t even tell wtf was going on at some parts because of the credits so i definitely gotta go check out the creditles version. yes they deserve their credit but we can’t see the animator’s work… thank god for creditless opening.WEAKNESSIf I HAD to bring up the weakness it would be this certain arc … one reason is because after it was right after a couple REALLY REALLY interesting/INTENSE/EXCITING eps (it literally makes me go omg who knew sports anime could get this good……. ) . the eps were sorta filler-type but then they technically aren’t… and the way that arc ended was kickass AMAZING so that’s why i wrote if i HAD To bring up a ~~ but I still liked that arc as a whole. in this arc there’s eps that are better than others. another thing is towards the end, you’ve seen all the tricks they pull and whatever so it’s not as fresh as in the beginning… but you know the last game was exciting so.. no complaints. I never felt like the games were ever stretched out… perfect ratio of action/dialogue/announcer”s dialogue/talking to self time/robots communicating to each other via telepathy or technology or whatever.. stuff became more big and intense as it went on… i guess that’s the shonen factor but i LOVED IT. like i said before i hate shonen anime b.c. i instinctively hate shonen anime because i ain’t a shonen. but if it’s a really well-done shonen like this I’m all for it, i feel it.but you know something i wished happened was there was more character development in the last 10-15 episodes as in OTHER characters but then i’m not sure if that would’ve taken away from the character they were developing during those episodes. But you know what i also wish they developed the character they were developing during those eps more like his _____s (I’m not gonna fill that in, those who watched know what comes before the s, hint PLURAL). they gave us something but i wish it was more. that’s selfish request that will never come true lolz.a fine 52-episode anime that is WELL-DONE.!!! it makes me lament the animes now-a-days that are 13-eps and are suckfest from beginning to end or it could’ve been better if it was longer or try to “move” the audience even though they didn’t develop the characters etc etc. but i loved zetsubou sensei and i think 13 eps was fine for that since the second season was not as interesting and the third season was unwatchable. it all depends on the show and how well done it is etc etc etc.so it’s completely subbed for chinese and korean (thank god for these lol). it’s done partially for english. This anime has HEART… It's very HEART-WARMING.oh and the ova is not good. i don’t know it has holes… i don’t understand the point of it.are ovas that are released after the tv series always bad…??I was so sad when i finished watching the series. the ending is good and satisfying but i’m sad that’ it’s over. no i donn’t want to it to go on endlessly like naruto. that would make the show turn into 1/10… I sorta confirmed this with the OVA. The only thing positive about the ova I can say is they came up with some interesting robots with the designs (creative stuff… ) and animation of course. I think that’s how one feels after being absorbed and watching something really fun and significant. plus i can’t un-watch this. I gotta wait many years before rewatching lol…. i already know the story and surprises etc but like I said I LOVED some of those scenes. I don’t understand what’s the point of OVAs. i was thinking of the word masturbation with OVAs… because the only people who are going to watch it are FANS not people who you are trying to hoook on the show like with anime tv series. so the people making it know you want to see it or buy it and they know that you loved the series. so they probably can tell what you loved about the series and try to include it in the OVA but it’s not the same thing because that stuff was happening in the series while it was going on (in that atmosphere that was built from past eps and whatnot), while now in the OVA it’s happening after the series “concluded” so… it’s like… novelty effect is worn off and it’s NOT the same thing. as much as i love the characters and the world the anime is set in, I enjoyd it in the ANIME series and i’ll re-live it by re-watching the episodes instead of some weird OVA that’s trying to recreate that??? I want to enjoy the real deal 100% iron leaguer world, not some half-bajed iron leaguer world. but the thing is if the series is really good, usually a good story is told and the ends are tied. so if you gotta something afterwards, you gotta create some friction, and problems or introduce something new etc. otherwise it’s a filler episode of the series ?? so basically the OVA has the potential to destroy what the tv series has done because of what an ova is… something that concluded beautifully gets unconcluded with whatever new thing they come up with. but anyways i loved the series and i dont’ want to talk shit about the iron leaguer ovas. i’m saying, i loved the SERIES but i didn’t like the ovas. I was thinking after i watched the series or the OVAs of stuff I want to know more about with characters and whatnot… so I was thinking maybe the OVA could’ve been better if they told us about the details that fans want to know about the iron leaguers and the story. BUT THEN I READ that there’s some LD (what is that?) that was released and how they wrote the robot’s biography or something on it for all 7 main robots. i wish they would! In other words, a true classic! I am calling this a classic because of the QUALITY not because it’s old or the first anime to do x. I wish people would stop calling boring old animes as classic because it’s old. I wish people would stop saying oh it’s the nostalgia or whatever to dismiss 90s/80s anime (it basically depends on the anime). For me i remember I loved watching a bunch of anime as a child and remember they were fun. But then i watched some of those again years later after I forget all the details and then after re-watching i went what ? that’s it? i realized at that point it’s ONLY really fun for children but not for me now.  It’s not a bad thing necessarily. Some pass that test, some don’t. it’s pretty obvious whether it does or not. LET ME TELL you that this anime shines now and then. I would guess that when I was a child I wasn’t drawn to this anime… you know robots + sports screams shounen anime. I probably watched on a whim and then realized the show is actually REALLY good. I feel like there’s no such thing as I hate x genre in anime. I think it means you haven’t a seen a good anime in that genre. That’s another reason why I think it’s special. I hate shonen anime and this one is if you try to categorize it from the nature of the show but it’s so gooooooood. Whenever say ugh this anime went all shonen on me I mean that in the worst way possible lol… ie the end of kurenai. despite that there are “shonen” anime that I do like.I feel like this anime could only be done via anime and that too adds to the specialness of the anime. If it was 26 eps, it wouldn’t be as good, if it was live action that would be really difficult lol… For nodame cantabile I was thinking how the animation is not that anime and so it’s not as expressive as iron leaguer when it comes to facial expression or any type of expression.. they kept the instrument playing animation to a minimum? for obvious reasons. I was thinking what’s the point of making this into an anime?? I thought the drama was better… I REALLY loved the facial expressions and other stuff they did for expression in iron leaguer so it made me think of this.I love the message of the show. I love how it doesn’t come off forced or cheesy as it has in other anime shows especially the kids shows (wedding peach…) . i love how even though it’s a kids show it can definitely enjoyed by adults. few children’s shows can also be enjoyed by adults and this is one of them. There’s also mystery and surprises. There’s parts that I LOVE… those scenes where x finds about y’s secret or x learns the truth about y. While i was watching i was so curious as to how the character would react and what they would say and now that i’ve seen it, i want to see it again lol.random thought while I was watching. I was thinking “hey since ryuuken is the karate leaguer he’s like asian so does he have the smallest eyes?” but his eyes looked big in this scene so eh to that silly theory.I further confirmed the specialness of the anime when I read the interviews by the producers on the official site and how they had all this inspiration from real baseball players and more and were having fun and working hard to make it (like the animators). Also one of them said that this show is for children but they also want people of other ages to watch… he went on to say that overly making it from a child’s pov isn’t a children’s anime. rather, anime that can be enjoyed by adults and old people and children are true children anime. They had no CG back then 😦 but  i wonder if the show would look like shit if they used CG…After i finished watching it i really wanted to read interviews. there’s interviews on the official website but I want more. I was thinking if they had interviews or something in anime magazines in the 90s… like i want to read those tooooo. also I felt like reading other fans thoughts… well the japanese fans.there’s no romance but there’s bromance. in fact you could watch it from a a dirty yaoi fangirl pov lol. there are scenes or lines that could be interpreted like that. I definitely watched from that point of view from time to time lol. i also watched from a serious pov too. Magnum x windy forever ❤ ! lol. IRON LEAUGER is so much more moe than the anime nowadays that try so hard… AND FAIL. It reminds me of some of the realllly trashy american singers that think they’re “sexy” or they think they have to be trashy or almost naked (naked as possible) to be sexy.. they don’t seem to understand that that’s not necessary. I’ve seen time it and time again on immotral song or even in k-pop that it’s possible to be classy and sexy at the same time. it’s so oversexualized in america.there’s comedy too. it’s smidge of comedy but when they put it in here and there with the animation or situation or a line that put a smile on my face or made me chuckle. it’s so well done because of the characters/character designs and the whole set-up. there isn’t a lot of comedy, BUT none of the comedy fails. the point of the show isn’t comedy anyway but the comedy in it is 5/5 lol. The just completes the show~so in that way there’s cuteness and moe ( I moed out sometimes lol). the animes now a days try way too hard to the point where the show is boring as hell unless you’re a creepy otaku or they have NO class or it’s so obvious they’re trying so hard. I really want those otakus to watch this anime. for this show that kind of stuff is effortless and those little moments of moe and cuteness is to die for. I LOVED it when magnum winked lol. nowadays the moe is getting really creepy or boring or way too maniac or plain tasteless or too… much ie borderline softcore porno/hentai/whatever you call it. i feel like the moe here occurred naturally or it came off naturally as a result of all the hard-work they put into show rather than like using moe to cover their asses which is a noticeable trend in anime right now.  I like the word bromance more than yaoi and i don’t know what yaoi really means anyways (how far do they go lol). they’re robots anyhooooo. so i feel like the bromance is all innocent and fun and if you want to think all twisted and whatnot draw weird fanart go ahead~I love the animation. the character designs kick ass. For example, the inning on magnum’s back is so CUTE lol. I gotta pause and stare at everyone’s designs lol. one time they zoomed into their shoes/feet. they were all so unique and cute lolz. no seriously i need to inundate this post with the ADORABLE CHARACTER DEISGNS. some of them are BADASS of course but I can still see the cuteness in the badass designs tooooooooo. that’s another reason why this show is so awesome. It has so much going on for it.The human character designs are good. i was reading in the interview somebody drew the humans asked the producer or somebody is this alright. whaddya think? so i could tell they were beingparticular with it. if you think ruri is ugly or whatever then i guess you can since she’s a normal girl. they show a movie star in one ep and that movie star was really pretty. so i think it’s fine ruri isn’t as pretty as the movi star. i dont’ tihnk ruri ugly though personally.  I think the girl designs that are overly moed up are ugly actually if anything… .not to mention not a smidge of originality. it reminds me of south korean plastic surgery epidemic. NOSE, EYES, JAW-LINE, FAT-DISTRIBUTION. wtfThe action/animation was intense and exciting and they definitely planned it out well. The beginning of the series was sorta normal but as things progressed the animation got more intense.  I really mean it as intense and exciting. that’s the only way I can describe it. don’t worry it’s not a mediocre sports/shonen (no seriously what is up with the crap people proclaim as epic being the boring shit in the world?) anime. the games are exciting, i was saying they're screwed every other episode lol. that’s what makes it interesting. plus the episodes where the game should be most exciting really is exciting… you don’t have to worry about quality when it comes to that. It was awesome. I had a blast watching those episodes because there’s moments where I’m like omg what’s gonna happen/omg i can’t believe this happened/omg how’s it gonna end/omg i can’t believe it’s ending like this/ lol. it’s a lot of omg’s like every couple minutes??? I found it fun and enjoyable to watch… and that’s what makes someone want to recommend a certain anime to another person because you want to pass on your enjoyment and hope or think that they’ll enjoy it as well.I love the facial expressions they did with the robots. it’s so expressive. When I was reading the interview, they had separate people for separate things like a person was in charge of facial expression, another for posing etc etc. so I totally LOVED that when I watched. It’s so well done and i could tell they put effort into minuscule stuff like that even before i read the interview. there’s stuff I notice or feel or whatever while watch and reading the interview just affirms that or explains what I was feeling and love how it goes both ways like that. i really really feel what the creators put in to this … their sweats, tears, soul, love for sports, etc,etc. going back to what i was saying i loved what they did with their eyes. I thought it was interesting how their mouths are pink inside like humans lol. Not to mention SUPER CUTE!!!  one aspect of the show that seems sorta contradicting is what makes it so good and special and unique. that is how the robots are metal so they shouldn’t be humanly but actually they’re more human than the humans lol.I also love how the thicklines add to the menace(?) /intensity/impactThe people who made this anime mentioned in the interview on the official website how they had trouble with consistently drawing the characters and robots the same in terms of their relative heights/size. I think they argued about it and got frustrated lol. I think it’s cute and it’s anime so it’s all GOOD. it adds to the enjoyment in my opinion.. spot the quirks!CHARACTERSI wonder if there’s a main character? Is it Magnum Ace? I mean everything is connected to him. If he’s not, then there’s no main character. Anyways I loved all the characters. They’re ALL likable and have their cute character designs.

BUT THEN I READ that there’s some LD (what is that?) that was released and how they wrote the robot’s biography or something on it for all 7 main robots."", ""Hello, I am only the 1st person on MAL to write a review for the show “Shippuu! Iron Leaguer” and this is also my first review. I hope that my review can give people an idea of what kind of show iron leaguer is and if they want to give this series a chance.Story: 6The story it takes place in a future where all the sports are played by a team of robots. in this context there is the Silver Castle the worst team in the soccer league, but the fate of the team changes drastically when Magnum Ace, a misterious leaguer, join the team...and recruites other strong leaguers to battle Dark Prince, the strongest team in the series.The story sounds simple and cliché, the pace of the series is very unstable and one of the critics that i have is that 52 episodes is a lot for a simple plot. Aside this the plot have some of misteries that is revealed at bits, the story is divided in 3 arcs the inicial arc that introduces the world the teams and the characters, the second is the stray league arc that goes on another story that it gives the show a nice breath of fresh air and the third arc the world cup tournament.Art: 7Its the typical 90's artstyle and for me its was good but it isn't anything groundbreaking. Some episodes is really good and others is fine at is best, in general there's consistency.Sound: 5The sound is mediocre at is best, there just 2 or 3 song that i can say that i like aside from the opening, the rest is very forgetful.Characters: 7First the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, famous names and voices that are remarkable. saying that most of the characters have their own personality specially the main characters but there are a little to none development, this the classic what you see is what you get. All that aside every characters have their moments and their time to shine with all of then being likeable.Enjoyment: 7I can say that i enjoy this anime, mostly because i feel attracted to this 80's/90's obscure animes. But i can pointed that this is a decent and well built show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice.Overall: 7Iron Leaguer is definitely not going to be a show for everyone. You have to be very open-minded to old-school animes. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much to the plot. The theme can represent what the 90's was for the anime industry (a decade very experimental for anime plots). It may get a bit repetitive and be far from perfect, but the solid characters and a fun and easygoing feeling can turn this show a very fun and pleasant gem.This is my first review in the MAL so i expected to make a decent job. and recruites other strong leaguers to battle Dark Prince, the strongest team in the series.The story sounds simple and cliché, the pace of the series is very unstable and one of the critics that i have is that 52 episodes is a lot for a simple plot.

All that aside every characters have their moments and their time to shine with all of then being likeable.Enjoyment: 7I can say that i enjoy this anime, mostly because i feel attracted to this 80's/90's obscure animes. But i can pointed that this is a decent and well built show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice.Overall: 7Iron Leaguer is definitely not going to be a show for everyone. You have to be very open-minded to old-school animes. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much to the plot. The theme can represent what the 90's was for the anime industry (a decade very experimental for anime plots). It may get a bit repetitive and be far from perfect, but the solid characters and a fun and easygoing feeling can turn this show a very fun and pleasant gem.This is my first review in the MAL so i expected to make a decent job."", ""If you like sports anime, shounen, anime from the 90's, and robots especially, there’s a pretty good chance Shippu Iron Leaguer is the anime for you. If you still aren’t quite sure or want to know a little more, let’s go into detail on what this anime is about.Welcome to the Iron League! The most popular sports league in the world where robots are the players. The League covers a wide variety of games: you want a sport, we've got a robot for it! From soccer to basketball, baseball to football, even bowling and golf! Sounds great on paper but there’s one big problem:...rough play, underhanded tactics, and straight up brutality are the norm across the board, with the crowd loving every second of it.But Silver Castle, the worst and weakest team in the League, play a bit different, going into every match with the principles of fair play, respect, honor, and kindness for their opponents and the game. Which is all well and good as far as morality is concerned, but most of the time it just means they're getting the bolts kicked out of them. That is until one day a robot with origins shrouded in mystery by the name of Magnum Ace lends Silver Castle his power, helps recruit new and skilled members to their cause, and vows to install a heart of justice into the corrupt Iron League.Right off the bat I’ve got to give this anime props where props is due for the interesting and unique concept, especially refreshing in the sports anime genre which is known to be very formulaic and by the numbers (a sports anime that doesn’t take place in a school setting? Who would have thought it.). There might be like 2? other sports playing robots manga or anime out there and none of them are done quite like this.The series doesn’t just use the concept as mere set dressing either, it goes deeper and explores it amply through a variety of sports with specially designed Leaguer types for each one. Each Leaguer has a unique mechanic or design trait that helps them stand out and show us which kinds of ways they play and excel at their sport, which makes even the side cast fun to meet. (And if you’re worried at all about the toy-like designs of the robots, not once while watching did I feel like I was being advertised to or watching a glorified toy commercial.)Without treading much into the territory of spoilers, this isn’t JUST a sports anime either. There is more to the Iron League than meets the eye, and this anime doesn’t shy away from exploring and showing us that deeper side—all without being too heavy-handed or preachy about it either.This anime is dumb, but in an awesome way. Iron Leaguer delivers in spades on the kind of goofy, hilarious, and fun over the top action you’d want from a robots playing sports anime. Nowhere else are you going to see a karate robot punch a hockey puck so hard it disintegrates, or a kendo robot cut a baseball and then have it explode, or a unified team kick that sends a soccer ball blasting to the net with the strength of a nuclear bomb. Absurd, surely. Enjoyable? Definitely.The first half of the series is where it’s at its most solid and consistent, focusing mainly on Silver Castle building the team and attempting to win the soccer league to gain a standing in the world cup. The second half of the series sees things change up a bit, giving us some of the highest highs coupled with the lowest lows. We have a travelling the world arc with some amazing self contained character episodes and exploration of the setting, which kind of goes on for longer than it should and ultimately turns out to have no real bearing on the plot. This is followed by a final arc which, while it goes harder than anything else before it, introduces a handful of new characters and ideas that don’t quite get the room they need to breathe or be fully explored.The cast itself are very charming, with each robot having a unique design and personality which helps them stand out and remain enjoyable and entertaining even in times when they’re just chilling with the group or playing with the team. From the passionate and fiery soccer star Mach Windy, to the serious robot-of-few-words samurai Kiwami Juurouta, or the lovable Topjoy, a character who is nothing but positivity and good vibes yet manages to avoid being overbearing or annoying.Magnum Ace is easily the star of the show, serving as an incredibly refreshing MC especially in the sports anime genre. Instead of a bright-eyed bushy-tailed newbie with a special skill that becomes the team’s ace in the hole, Magnum is a hardened veteran with a wealth of power, skill, and knowledge, balanced splendidly by a humble down-to-earth personality and kind heart. While strong, resolved, and determined, he’s not invincible or infallible and his greatest victories come from him supporting others and others supporting him in turn.While there are enough character moments and focus episodes for individual members to be fleshed out and have their own identities and charm, there aren’t really any ongoing character arcs or development beyond the team’s introductory episodes, or a few select members of the cast who do get that development (cheers to you Gold Brothers). But, much like a sports anime in this case, the characters are easily the strongest part of it and all are easy to love and get attached to. (This goes for the side cast, human characters, and even the villains as well, though the robots do get most of the love here.)Interesting premise, ideas, and characters aside, this anime is far from perfect. At the end of the day it’s still a kid’s show with more than a fair share of dumb stuff, rushed, clumsy, and half-baked execution, low budget, moments that are just straight up bad, and a lot of little things that don’t quite make sense.Calling it a good anime or a bad anime is going to be really subjective here, and the quality of the show can vary drastically from episode to episode, even from moment to moment. But what brings it all together in the end are a super charming cast of characters and the series’ core messages of fair play, teamwork, respect, the impact of kindness, and just having fun with your friends. Corny, of course, but these messages are delivered so genuinely and with such heart and charm that it becomes VERY difficult to hate or even dislike this series even at its worst.Because of that, I find it hard not to recommend, especially if robots and sports are your kind of thing.Mecha anime in the 80’s and 90’s were often experimental, ideas become reality just because ‘hey why not’, concepts thrown at a wall just to see what would stick and become the next big hit franchise. While Iron Leaguer wasn’t one of those that stuck around for the long haul—especially in the west with no dub or “official” english release to be found—I find myself feeling glad that this anime was a thing that happened and that it even exists at all. An anime like this had to happen somewhere at some point in time and I’m glad that this is the one we got.

Sentou Mecha Xabungle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2254/Sentou_Mecha_Xabungle,"[""Xabungle is a mish-mash of genres combining westerns, mecha action, sci-fi, and comedy focused on a young man named Jiron Amos who partners up with a gang of sand bandits and the crew of the landship known as the Iron Gear to seek out the whereabouts of the murderer of his family named Timp Sharon. Within the world of Xabungle, mechs called Walker Machines are used by landships to combat one another and there is a three-day rule in place where all crimes have to be resolved within that time or else they are pardoned. In addition, there exist two living beings within the series:...the Innocent who live lavishly in domed cities and the Civilians who live out in the harsh planet landscape.Xabungle was directed by famous mecha anime director Yoshiyuki Tomino, sandwiched between his work on the more darker and serious Space Runaway Ideon and Aura Battler Dunbine. The series is more lighter fare with its focus on Jiron and other characters as comedy rears its presence frequently throughout the series to parody typical tropes of the mecha genre and usually breaking the fourth wall with characters being self-aware of their status as fictional characters and whatever roles they have to fulfill within the series. Some characters even aspire to be greater than the roles they personify or attempting to seem tough and intimidating, yet their comical and klutzy behavior goes against whatever role they are attempting to come off as. The comedy actually helps to allow Xabungle to stick out from the many mecha titles that were made throughout the 1980s trying to come off as serious, as the series is self-aware of its roots and doesn't take itself seriously on enough occasions throughout its 50-episode run.Outside of the comedy, Xabungle also sticks out for the rather unique world it has to offer up in its mixing of sci-fi and western story elements. On the surface, the series seems to be a western with the attire, settings, and weaponry employed; mixed in with the more advanced technology such as the Walker Machines and landships used by the Civilians. But as episodes progress, more is revealed about the workings of the world that Xabungle is set in that eventually leads up to a conflict between the crew of the Iron Gear and those under the influence of the Innocent. A good chunk of what is revealed is pretty typical of sci-fi and mecha focused anime, but the mentioned comedy rears its head enough to keep things from getting too overly serious.In regards to characters, the series has a fairly large cast considering its length and the scale of which its main conflict onfolds. Some characters, notably the villains, are pretty standard with their motives and character types. Others, like major characters among the Iron Gear, do get a good deal of fleshing out that let them have more to them beyond their character types as Xabungle shows how a number of characters are affected by the escalating conflict with the Innocent and there are a few characters within the Innocent concerned about how things are escalating with their influence on the Civilians. In spite of how typical a number of the character types are, Xabungle still does a solid job with exploring how each side is affected by the developing conflict between Civilians and Innocent.Overall, Xabungle makes for a fun and engaging mecha show thanks to the humor coming off its self-awareness of being a mecha anime, as well as the unique blend of western and sci-fi storytelling tropes implemented in its exploration of the Iron Gear's conflict with the Innocent. Old-school mecha fans looking for something unique for the genre should definitely consider giving this a watch. the Innocent who live lavishly in domed cities and the Civilians who live out in the harsh planet landscape.Xabungle was directed by famous mecha anime director Yoshiyuki Tomino, sandwiched between his work on the more darker and serious Space Runaway Ideon and Aura Battler Dunbine.

This is a good thing and makes it very enjoyable. There are roots to concepts seen in more serious Tomino mecha anime - like Zeta Gundam - within Xabungle, and the same beats are hit... but while this normally causes the show to feel repetitive if you've seen other mecha works of Tomino, Xabungle is different enough that it doesn't suffer at all from this. I've seen a lot of Tomino mecha anime and while almost all of them are good, they do hit on the same characterization,...the same themes, the same dynamics, the same plots... and for shows like Gundam, Dunbine, and Ideon, which are more serious, it becomes necessary to take a break before starting - or else you'll get deja vu every other episode. Xabungle covers up this deja vu with a different tone and every episode you end up having fun with.I'm giving Xabungle a '9' and L-Gaim a '9' because both of these shows break from Tomino's formula and prove more engaging because of their humorous characterization. However, Xabungle is far sillier. Tomino's other serious shows are just as enjoyable but they don't stick out as much, which can be unfortunate. the same themes, the same dynamics, the same plots... and for shows like Gundam, Dunbine, and Ideon, which are more serious, it becomes necessary to take a break before starting - or else you'll get deja vu every other episode.

Xabungle is certainly one of them, and it’s also my first experience with a “happy Tomino show”. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but I ended up with a hilarious and extremely fun show.--STORY—Xabungle’s story is one that manages to stay fairly interesting. The actual overall plot is good, but what makes it truly compelling are the characters, which I’ll touch on later. It could be perhaps a bit slow at...times, but the comedy, characters, and dynamic action kept me watching. The first half is mostly based around Jiron’s revenge, fights against various mercenary-esque land ships, and some semi unique world building. A few eps were slow, but most were enjoyable.I ended up enjoying the 2nd half far more with the battle vs the Innocent starting to come into play. Character dynamics were more interesting, some minor characters got more development, a certain brainwashed antag and return of another older antag all contributed well towards that. The ending in particular is great, and wraps up the series well.Pretty much all the comedy lands well in Xabungle. There’s a lot of slapstick and Tom and Jerry crap going on, but there is the rare clever joke. The show also pokes fun well at common mecha tropes and breaks the 4th wall, but it doesn’t do it often enough that it becomes cheesy or annoying. It’s not all comedy though, and there are some serious, emotional moments scattered throughout the show. There’s some rather nice commentary on trans humanism, exploitation of the lower classes by the higher, and typical gender roles.The actual mech/land ship action and battles were surprisingly great. The more cartoonish feel to the action leads to some very creative moments, but there are also serious, well-done tactics as well. Despite some battles feeling similar to others, across the 50 eps not battle felt like a complete repeat. The mech designs are standard, but work well. I do quite like the Iron Gear being a landship that can transform into a mech though.--CHARACTERS—Tomino’s usual “motley crew of often dysfunctional, but come together when necessary” cast works extremely well with the tone of this series. Jiron grows from an arrogant boy out for revenge, to a competent young leader. Rag goes from a reckless, free spirited, hotheaded woman, to a still snarky but considerably toned down girl, who can now get along with other people well. Elchi in particular was my fave character, and I think overall she has the best character development learning to balance her more tomboy and naturally girly qualities and finding love. The side cast was also quite enjoyable, and get fairly solid development. Fatman is always a hoot to watch, and Cotsett is a great mechanic/pilot.The main antags aren’t as well developed, but they’re still fun to watch as villains just being villains. I would’ve liked a bit more development on some of the Innocent, but overall characterization is very good.--MUSIC/VOICE ACTING—The soundtrack of Xabungle is full of amazing music. The OP is stupidly catchy, the ED has a nice 80’s charm to it, and the general music is really good too. The voice acting is always full of energy, and they deliver each scene really well. On a minor note I was surprised to find out that Timp was voiced by Banjou Ginga, more often known for his voice is Netero in Hunter X Hunter. The guy has certainly been voice acting for a long time.--ANIMATION—To complement the varied battles and semi chaotic nature of the series, the animation was actually considerably more varied than I expected. There was a lot less reused stock footage than I expected, and there’s plenty of great visual gags. Overall, the animation is very good for the time, and it never really felt like they were running low on budget. It’s dynamic when necessary, and well-drawn for still moments.--ENJOYMENT—I very much enjoyed Xabungle. There was rarely a dull moment with it, and it’s definitely up there for one of the funniest anime I’ve watched. It’s also excellent if you’re here for the mecha elements moreso, and is a classic 80’s anime I’d rec to anyone. times, but the comedy, characters, and dynamic action kept me watching.

The soundtrack is appealing and the characters design is alright. The voice acting is well done and the seiyuus are well choosen, but noisy it's at time. (a lot of screaming or loud voices but i'm sensitive so maybe that's just me) The sound quality is good for a 40 years old anime.The characters are lovable and the personnalities are varied. The villains are also as lovable as the mains...characters. The fight scenes were fun to watch, often creative. The story get really interesting as the episodes goes by. The humour is refreshing and very lighthearted , it has a taste that you rarely find in moderns animes. The last scene of the ending made me laugh a lot it was simply perfect I rarely laughed that much in a last episode. Considering it's a 40 years old anime, I must say the females characters were pretty modern and badass for it's time.But I must say it's an anime of it's time, it has a lot of free violence (underlings getting hit randomly, Chill (8-9 years old girl) getting hit pretty often by some crew members, Girls getting hit and slapped often etc. It is mostly used in a comedic way but it can be triggering. characters.

Slayers Premium,https://myanimelist.net/anime/866/Slayers_Premium,"[""Slayers has always been a great series to follow, with plenty of loyal fans. Its spanned three series, five movies, and two different three episode OVA series. Following, as always, the great sorceress Lina Inverse.Premium is unique in that it is the only movie that has Gourry, Amelia, and Zelgadis; who are Lina's companions during the three series; as opposed to Naga, a friend/rival of Lina's from the OVA's. Naga does make a breif cameo, marking one of the few (if only) times Naga and the rest of Lina's friends are in the same series.The story is a bit silly, with some town famous for...its seafood having the octopus that live in the acompanying bay decide they have had enough. All in all, its not as epic as the series tend to be (with the world hanging in the balance), and not as humorous and character developing as the OVA's tend to be, but seems on Par with the other movies in the slayers franchise.Art and Sound are typical of the Slayers media, so if you have seen other parts of the series you should generally know what to expect. A bit outdated by todays standards, but still generally clean and well animated.As far as character goes, this movie dosn't offer much in the way of development. However you do get to see all of the characters you know and love (even if Naga's appearance is... very breif), but if this is your first piece of Slayers media you may be a bit lost.This movie was quite enjoyable for fans, and fits in nicely between the second and final series. Overall, this is a good diversion from the series, with some quality bits of humor for a fan. If you are a first time Slayers watcher, its probably best to start with 'Slayers' the first series. its seafood having the octopus that live in the acompanying bay decide they have had enough. All in all, its not as epic as the series tend to be (with the world hanging in the balance), and not as humorous and character developing as the OVA's tend to be, but seems on Par with the other movies in the slayers franchise.Art and Sound are typical of the Slayers media, so if you have seen other parts of the series you should generally know what to expect. A bit outdated by todays standards, but still generally clean and well animated.As far as character goes, this movie dosn't offer much in the way of development. However you do get to see all of the characters you know and love (even if Naga's appearance is... very breif), but if this is your first piece of Slayers media you may be a bit lost.This movie was quite enjoyable for fans, and fits in nicely between the second and final series.

It's not interesting, it's not clever, it's not funny, it's not aesthetically appealing, and one hopes that it's not canon.  Returning characters are sloppy mockeries of themselves, and very little besides that.  The plot is more or less on par with a particularly weak mid-season comedy episode from any of the Slayers series.  The 'takogo' gags are stupid, obnoxious, and repetitive.  The art is not good, and the facial expressions manage to look like some kind of emoji vomit even in the context of the over-the-top Slayers universe.If you know and...love Slayers for what it is, this anime is not for you.  If you're not familiar with Slayers, this anime is not the place to start.  This is Slayers for young children. love Slayers for what it is, this anime is not for you.

First, let me say that I watch Slayers in english dub (yes, yes, I know, heretic.) It's one of the few series I prefer the dub over sub. And Slayers Premium changed the voice actors...It's dreadful, the Lina in Prenium sucks, it doesn't fit the character at all and even then most of the cast seem to be acting out of character for no apparent reason. The art is also stepped down, as...well as the music. The story is uninspired and dull and, like I said, thank god it's only 1 episode; because I would have dropped a season that starts like that.So yeah, overall Slayers Premium is simply a bad OVA, but that happens all the time in anime doesn't it. It is not necessary to watch it to understand the rest of the series, skipping it would be recommended, unless you have time to kill. It also doesn't bring any relevant backstory or anything like that, so it's really just a basket of stale bread in between the main dishes. well as the music.

Like a sore thumb that someone slammed on with a hammer.

And with freedom, we can use our creativity to build worlds, to imagine ourselves in places where we never expected, or meet people from the other side of the globe. What does that tell you about anime? Well, it means writers are able to freely express their thoughts and ideas into their work no matter how ludicrious it is.Take Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! for example. It\'s written by Natsume Akatsuki, the same writer who is the brainchild behind the KonoSuba franchise. You remember Konosuba, right? Unless you\'ve been living under a rock, that...series became a light novel and anime sensation back when it was airing. And now, he\'s back. Mr Akatsuki decided to translate his ideas into this show because freedom allows him to do what and how he wants. Isn\'t freedom just wonderful?To be fair, Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is a completely seperate show and doesn\'t have any direct connection with Konosuba. So yes, go ahead and watch this without any knowledge would be a fairly straightforward easy thing to do. However, that doesn\'t mean you won\'t feel a similar experience when watching this goofball of a show. If you\'ve ever felt the need to turn your brains off, then feel free to jump right in. But I should warn you, this anime loves comedy and the author wants you to laugh every square inch of the way.As the first episode progressed, we quickly find out just how goofy the main cast is. Let\'s start with Combat Agent Six, the man with the perverted mind who wants to do lewd acts to his bosses, from the organization Kisaragi. Yeah, you heard me right. Six explifies the type of protagonist who says what\'s on his mind and does what he wants, or even who he wants. Out of every character in the show, we see him perform the most lewd acts and because it\'s part of his mission to collect ""Evil Points"". I don\'t know how high the author was when he created Six but let\'s just say that he is about as obnoxious as a protagonist can get. Joining him as a group of female characters including Alice, Snow, Rose, Grimm, and his superiors. The majority of the show follows Six\'s group to collect evil points and and completing missions. No, it\'s not an RPG because Six himself isn\'t into roleplaying. He only seems to care about himself at first but he does get the job done when the time calls for it. Surprisingly, Six is actually efficient with some of his clever yet underhanded tactics. In various episodes, he behaves like a fool but can also be a badass when he wants. I don\'t mean type of badass that will make his look enemies weak. What I mean is that Six can be very efficient with his combat skills and it\'s why Kisaragi decided to employ him as an agent on their assignments.Six doesn\'t carry this anime all on his shoulders. We can\'t ignore the pretty android Alice, can we? Out of all the main cast in this show, she is perhaps the most normal and that\'s saying a lot when you realize she isn\'t even human. Unlike Six, she demonstrates a serious attitude on her assignments and often berates him for his foolish behavior. Their first meeting in the show starts out rocky but over time seems to get along well enough to get jobs done. Then, there\'s Snow, the woman with the haughty attitude and executive officer serving under Six. Their relationship in the show is comically toxic. By toxic, I don\'t just mean it as drama, insults, and names thrown at each other. What I mean is that Snow has to deal with Six for he is if she wants to remain in her position. And as fate turns out, she does warm up to Six and the others as time drags on. That doesn\'t refrain Six from talking lewd words to her though. Outside of these three, there\'s also Grimm, the flirtious redhead in the wheelchair. And despite being flirty, she becomes embarassed when lewd acts are performed on her. Many episodes shows that she is a pure hearted girl inside but acts like the opposite outside. And last but not least, there\'s Rose, a mascot of their group with a massive appetite. It seems when the author created her, they wanted a main character to fill the void of a gluttonious girl. When you package these characters together, you get perhaps the most idiotic group of 2021.Let\'s not get too ahead of ourselves though. Outside of Six\'s group, we also need to know about Kisaragi and their goal. What is Kisaragi? The easiest way to say it is that they are an evil organization. Sure, they are ""evil"" but to emphasize, the show doesn\'t protray them as malicious as they sound. In fact, Kisaragi has moral obligations and I dare say that their members aren\'t evil at all. Freezing Astaroth and Flaming Belial are two members who tasked Six to collect ""Evil Points"" but the way they protrayed their assignments almost seems like a parody. Evil Points is collected by evil deeds but the anime subverts and downplays as a joke. That is also thanks to Six\'s actions such as trying to gain evil points by lifting Grimm\'s skirt. Regardless, I think once you\'ve seen the first few episodes, you\'ll realize the anime isn\'t bound on showing how ""evil"" Kisaragi is at all.Tagged with some of the familiar genres you\'d expect from the Konosuba author, the anime itself loves its running jokes. There\'s countless recurring gags such as Snow\'s money fetish, Six\'s perverted way of living life, or Grimm being the target of sexual harassment. Sexual references and allusions is also common thanks to words being misunderstood. For instance, a conversation between Six and Grimm once gave him the impression of sex when she actually wants to eat him. There\'s also dick jokes thrown around by Six\'s perverted mind to the princess Tillis. It seems at every opportunity, this show will make fun of itself in some shape or form, usually the perverted way.Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is the type of anime that you can recommend to your friend but I\'d be careful if they\'ve never seen something similar like this before. They might get the wrong impression or message of what the author wanted them to see. But if you\'re watching this show on your own, let\'s just say that turning your brain off is an understatement. In fact, turn all common sense off because this anime has transcended beyond the realm of normalcy. This is far from a normal show and the author wanted you to be free to experience their work.

Isn\'t being able to express your thoughts like this so freely just wonderful?', 'Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is basically a retelling of KonoSuba—only much, much inferior. That\'s not to say that it\'s particularly a bad anime, but does that matter much when pretty much the entire time I was thinking: ""I wish I was watching KonoSuba instead.""The idea of parodying isekai RPGs was novel few years ago. However, after the release of countless light novels and anime that have parodied/attempted to parody isekai, this concept has become painfully dull as practically everything about the genre has already been covered. Originally a light novel by Natsume Akatsuki—the creator of KonoSuba—Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is essentially just another unremarkable isekai parody. I know what...most of you are probably thinking. Given the fact that the original light novel is written by Akatsuki, we should be expecting another side-splitting comedy anime, but in reality, Sentouin only dreams to be as funny as KonoSuba.KonoSuba was one of the first anime to parody the then ubiquitous isekai genre, which is mainly why it had become so popular. However, no matter how distinctive the set-up was, what primarily made KonoSuba so enjoyable were its flawed yet exceptionally hilarious characters. The comedy of Sentouin is dependent on its characters as well, but the difference is that most of the characters aren\'t nearly as likeable and entertaining; they are more or less the watered-down versions of KonoSuba characters.Sentouin\'s comedy is mostly hit-or-miss. Most of the jokes involve sexual matters in one way or another, which I mostly don\'t find funny. I won\'t pretend that I\'m a ""mature"" guy who doesn\'t laugh at lewd jokes, because I\'m not. Gintama is one of my favorite anime of all time and it contains a fair amount of sexual humor too, but that\'s far from what essentializes the series (the same could be said about KonoSuba). In contrast, one of Sentouin\'s essential parts IS the lewd comedy; taking out the lewd jokes would be like removing one half of the entire show. To make it worse, the hackneyed lewd humor crosses the line multiple times in the series, which includes the protagonist Agent Six shamelessly groping the female characters, pulling down their panties, forcing them to do lewd things, etc.This also brings up the topic of using repulsive fanservice as a means of ""comedy"".KonoSuba isn\'t entirely immune to this either, but the issue of fanservice is far, far more prevalent in Sentouin. There are several distasteful panty and cleavage shots in the show that serve no purpose besides appeasing the horny fanbase. This doesn\'t mean I can\'t stand ""meaningless"" fanservice at all. I\'m a fairly big fan of the To LOVE-Ru franchise (Darkness, specifically) which is full of pointless and over-the-top ecchi scenes. However, when most of the fanservice is followed by a creepy guy making crude and despicable jokes about it, I think it\'s reasonable to display some concern.A lot of people seem to liken Agent Six to Kazuma, but these two aren\'t the same. Despite his perverted tendencies, Kazuma is surprisingly a very well-written character. Unlike most of his peers who are protected by the mythical object known only as ""plot armor"", he actually uses his brain to solve his problems. Deceptively clever and knowledgeable, Kazuma is the main (or perhaps the only) reason why his practically dysfunctional group manages to do something useful sometimes. His witty remarks, sneaky tactics and ingenious schemes are one of the prime aspects that make KonoSuba so entertaining.On the other hand of the spectrum, Six\'s essential character trait is the fact that he is a giant creep. He is pretty much Kazuma—if Kazuma was made thousand times more stupid and creepy. In the anime, Agent Six himself doesn\'t do anything useful for the most part (it\'s usually Alice who does the actual work) and instead causes trouble for others on a regular basis. Most of his jokes aren\'t even remotely funny. Rather, his creepy and idiotic behavior only makes you annoyed and uncomfortable. Despite that, like every harem protagonist, all the girls surrounding him seem to find him charming for some reason.Fans will probably say Six does these awful things only so that he could gain evil points, but that\'s a complete lie. Pretty much all of the times, Six actually enjoys the detestable stuff that he does. Although there are a couple of occasions where he does become remorseful for his actions, they are few and far between. And even if I disregard that argument, integrating evil points into the story is still just a convenient plot device to include fanservice as much as possible; it doesn\'t rationalize the sexual harassment whatsoever.Luckily, not everything about Six is irredeemable. There are times when he can actually be a nice person. Take a scene from episode 7 for example, where he found Mokemoke adorable and wanted to be friends with it—tell me that wasn\'t heartwarming! (although the ending is morbid) Moments like this are one of Six\'s few saving graces and probably one of the best parts of the entire show. Unfortunately, when you take his countless loathsome deeds into consideration, you realize that Six ultimately doesn\'t amount to much more than a scumbag. And no, being self-aware about it doesn\'t help.Most of the other significant characters—which are all females—primarily exist for being the unfortunate victims of fanservice and Six\'s sexual harassment. They aren\'t as unlikeable as Six to be fair, but that isn\'t really saying much. Similarly to KonoSuba, pretty much the entire cast of Sentouin is extremely flawed, but whereas the former uses the imperfections of its characters to make them more endearing, in the latter it mostly makes them annoying. Alice is probably the most likeable of all the characters; her clever and deadpan personality is a nice change of pace from the usual idiocy.In terms of narrative, it wouldn\'t be too far-off to say that there\'s absolutely nothing remarkable about Sentouin. It blatantly rehashes the fundamental tropes of most isekai parodies and doesn\'t bother to add much of its own flavor. The obvious lack of originality makes the show kinda tiring to watch at times, especially when you consider the fact that there are already a multitude of anime that are based on the same basic concept and follow the same story patterns. Another apparent flaw regarding the storyline, and possibly where Sentouin falters the most, is how the show handles its serious side of things.Despite mainly being a comedy anime, Sentouin does contain a reasonable amount of drama, and I honestly wouldn\'t have any issues with it—if it wasn\'t this poorly written. There is an overarching plot in Sentouin that revolves around the conflict between humans and demons, and it\'s all hastily put together and doesn\'t mesh well with the comedy. I get it, the plot is only supposed to be a side-dish here, not the entire thing. But if you think putting in the right amount of ingredients is too much of a hassle, why did you bother to give me the side-dish to begin with?During dramatic scenes, the characters suddenly become attached to each other for the sake of plot progression. When something serious is about to happen, they suddenly act like they have always been best friends. But here\'s the problem—they never had any proper bond in the first place. The anime does pretty much nothing to flesh out its characters in a meaningful way, so dramatic scenes like this can only be seen as awkward and pointless. I mean, tell me how I\'m supposed to think those guys are being serious when one of them literally pulled down a girl\'s panties few minutes ago.Amidst all this chaos and stupidity, Sentouin does have a few morsels to offer. One of the plus points of the show is that it\'s at least aware of its own inanity, and while that\'s not necessarily always a good thing, I can still appreciate the honesty (as odd as that sounds). There\'s something quite exasperating about watching a show that is being ostentatious with its comedy, and Sentouin fortunately isn\'t guity in that regard. Of course, self-awareness can only carry a show so far, but at the very least, it made Sentouin a tolerable experience.The comedy doesn\'t always disappoint. Akatsuki has proved in KonoSuba that he is a talented author, and his brilliance occasionally shines in Sentouin as well. Character dynamic is one of the key things to consider when you are making an anime (especially if it\'s a genre like comedy that primarily relies on characters), and while the characters of Sentouin generally share a rather feeble bond, their dynamic during comedy scenes is surprisingly quite strong. Unexpectedly, there are some well thought-out jokes here and there that don\'t shamelessly resort to fanservice, and utilitize the characters\' dynamic instead for which they are actually clever and funny.Remember that I said the characters are annoying? Well, that\'s not always true. Like Agent Six, all of them have their own great moments. There are occasional moments in the anime when their charm shines through; especially when they are together, they are able to complement each other pretty well. Because of their strong dynamic, sometimes it\'s quite entertaining to watch the characters simply goof around. From time to time, they can be reminiscent of KonoSuba\'s quartet, reflecting the latter\'s usual charisma and excellent compatibility, which should be a plus point for KonoSuba fans like me.The animation of Sentouin is actually pretty good, although nothing particularly remarkable or worth taking notice of. The character designs are obviously designed to be attractive, and attractive they are. If you simply want some cute girls to gawk at, Sentouin should be able to meet your expectations quite easily. On a side note, the costumes of the characters are fairly varied and distinct; I have to give the artist a pat on the back for that. The background designs aren\'t half-bad, either.Like most light novel adaptations, the soundtrack of Sentouin mainly consists of generic upbeat tracks. That doesn\'t mean that it\'s bad though; it actually works well with the lively nature of the anime. The dramatic scenes, however, tend to be rather unengaging since they are mostly accompanied with trite and overly sentimental music. The opening ""No. 6"" is a pretty generic J-pop song that has some annoying parts, but it does suit the vibrant style of the anime. The ending song ""Home Sweet Home"" is quite catchy and has a soothing vibe to it, which I personally find very charming (Alice\'s voice is amazing).Sentouin isn\'t entirely meritless. Although I have been fairly critical about the show in this review, I have also said that I did enjoy it. Sure, the comedy is mostly trite and inane, but I have to admit that it still made me laugh sometimes. Sure, the characters are generic and can be pretty annoying, but I have to admit that they still kept me somewhat entertained. For what it\'s worth, Sentouin can be quite enjoyable despite all its flaws, so I found it a bit difficult to actually dislike the show.But then again, I would have had a much better time watching KonoSuba instead. most of you are probably thinking. Given the fact that the original light novel is written by Akatsuki, we should be expecting another side-splitting comedy anime, but in reality, Sentouin only dreams to be as funny as KonoSuba.KonoSuba was one of the first anime to parody the then ubiquitous isekai genre, which is mainly why it had become so popular. However, no matter how distinctive the set-up was, what primarily made KonoSuba so enjoyable were its flawed yet exceptionally hilarious characters. The comedy of Sentouin is dependent on its characters as well, but the difference is that most of the characters aren\'t nearly as likeable and entertaining; they are more or less the watered-down versions of KonoSuba characters.Sentouin\'s comedy is mostly hit-or-miss. Most of the jokes involve sexual matters in one way or another, which I mostly don\'t find funny. I won\'t pretend that I\'m a ""mature"" guy who doesn\'t laugh at lewd jokes, because I\'m not. Gintama is one of my favorite anime of all time and it contains a fair amount of sexual humor too, but that\'s far from what essentializes the series (the same could be said about KonoSuba). In contrast, one of Sentouin\'s essential parts IS the lewd comedy; taking out the lewd jokes would be like removing one half of the entire show.

You know you've got a gem of a show when even the episode previews are entertaining.Like seriously, there's an entire episode that's basically a 20 minute long episode preview and it's still funny as hell.Sentouin hits you with jokes like a machine gun. The jokes come fast and even if one doesn't hit, another one soon takes its place.

Its not a really good anime when you have a tight time like me who is trying to land a job. I guess  its good. not very or amazingly, just good. You would rate this 10/10 if you hadnt seen konosuba, or you laugh on daddy jokes.Story : If we remove the comedy, the story is like 3? or 4. Lets be real. This is the same with konosuba. I guess, thats why they are investing in comedy. Its a great anime especially after watching some depressing shit. Like I read the murder case of Junko F. , if you...havent read, you should just get a short summary of it as I would not recommend children reading that. Thats alot of off topic, anyways, the story kept on a plot which is very unstable. Though the future, atleast from the manga looks promising.Art : The art seems not lacking atleast. I have not focused on it, though even after watching it, I saw no issues with it. Its not amazing but it has its place on good.Sound : OP, love it. The sounds are also not lacking anywhere and the OP really matches the comedy style. It has that vibe in it.Character :Agent 6/ MC : We are at episode 4 only so expecting too much will not be good. Though the manga shows a good future, atleast, which means that this rating will stay unchanged.Alice : Her development sure looks like waifu 1. And I aint complaining about it. These are atleast no flaws that I have found yet which is promising.Snow and other characters : They are what essentially create the story. The development is amazing. To put it in simple terms, they are not lacking anything, yet they have something which makes all of them unique.Side Characters : Its comedy and from the author of konosuba. Dont expect development here. Though atleast they have given considerations to avoid plotholes which is good.Enjoyment : The comedy easily brings a smile on my face. The first time I watched konosuba, my parents thought that I was a maniac who replaced their child. Laughing in the toilet, car and everywhere you can name. With that much laughing, I have gotten alot of immunity to this shit. So I would say that this would atleast make the veterans smile while the newbies gotta have some extra oxygen tanks at the ready.TL;DR : A good comedy. Though it does not have alot of potential to get a sequel from a viewers perspective cuz the plot is as unstable as my heart in front of girls havent read, you should just get a short summary of it as I would not recommend children reading that.

Did it have to exist? Not really, it is just a piece of work that I have so many problems with and its even worse after I knew who the author was. So lets give a small introduction to this Anime, it is an Isekai comendy show with a cast of a loli, a pervert, stupid and fan-service. Does that sound familiar, yeah its kinda the same as Konosuba but way worse in every aspect. And the worst part is is because its the same guy who made konosuba also...made this, piece of shit ""work"". The thing what angers me the most isn\'t that he is going to make an other comendy anime but rather again using the Isekai setting, this not only limits his jokes and you know what happens than but he could have used so much other genres instead of Isekai, but nope, an other Isekai anime comendy. And he also didn\'t fix his problems that Konosuba had and you know what those problems were, so lets talk about the comendy of this show and man its bad.....Comendy in general is a very subjective genre from itself. Some people see comendy like,""If its funny, its good"". And thats the thing, some people laugh at the jokes of female comedians and other don\'t, becuase that is how were made. We are different from eachother but we cant deny when a joke is good or not. None of the jokes in this show are good. Its mostly\xa0 cringey anime references or a character doing something stupid and other characters making comments about it. The thing is, I didnt laugh once in this entire show. And to be fair I also never laughed while watching Konosuba but at least I was enjoying the anime, this anime I am not enjoying because the jokes are so bad and so boring that I just cant enjoy it. The other thing is is because this work is made by the same author doesnt mean it has the same quality, Konosuba can act like this is a good anime but please tell me, is it because of the person who created it. Now lets talk about the last part of the comendy and No....why this shit. Look, this is why I mostly like 3d>2d because of, the fan-service. ""●FANSERVICE ISNT COMENDY YOU MORRON●"". So, grabbing boobs is considerd funny in our sociaty. I just dont understand, why has the fan-service been doubled since Konosuba. This is insane to the point where you can make this show a hentai and I wouldnt even care. What a huge f--king dissapointment, he still hasnt learnt his mistakes. Its just sad but""tell me why""""Life is nothing but a mistake""""Shut up, lets talk about characters""Every single character in this show is just Konosuba characters but just way worse in like so many different ways. The charm is gone and the chemistry between the characters doesnt even work. They are just bland, unfunny. Not intressting and so many other problems. The author tried to recreate the characters from konosuuba but failed miserbaly. Its just not fun to watch characters talk and make bad jokes, its just f--king annoying. The characters aren\'t in anyway memorable or fun as I have already said, but hey, he at leas tried so thats good. But yeah It turned out terible. This is the reason why the setting shouldnt have been an isekai maybe something like a highschool or something but nope, just Isekai. *Sigh*.ArtJust really average, so not a lot to complain about.SoundBoth the op and ending werent very catchy but the visuals were good so thats good right.EnjoymentWell, I didnt enjoy this show, the extremely bad jokes and shitty references really just ruined my experience for this show. I had low expetations but now they are even lower for next season.

The thing what angers me the most isn\'t that he is going to make an other comendy anime but rather again using the Isekai setting, this not only limits his jokes and you know what happens than but he could have used so much other genres instead of Isekai, but nope, an other Isekai anime comendy. And he also didn\'t fix his problems that Konosuba had and you know what those problems were, so lets talk about the comendy of this show and man its bad.....Comendy in general is a very subjective genre from itself. Some people see comendy like,""If its funny, its good"". And thats the thing, some people laugh at the jokes of female comedians and other don\'t, becuase that is how were made. We are different from eachother but we cant deny when a joke is good or not. None of the jokes in this show are good. Its mostly\xa0 cringey anime references or a character doing something stupid and other characters making comments about it. The thing is, I didnt laugh once in this entire show. And to be fair I also never laughed while watching Konosuba but at least I was enjoying the anime, this anime I am not enjoying because the jokes are so bad and so boring that I just cant enjoy it.

This name should be very familiar to the big crowd of cultured people who watched KonoSuba before, not adding that his later work (Hataage! Kemono Michi) is hideously average at best. But what else is this author hiding? This show! And it\'s none other than Re:Zero author Tappei Nagatsuki whom found out that Natsume Akatsuki was actually hiding this work from superiors at Kadokawa, and if you know anything about the AniManga industry, if your work is noticed, you\'re gonna get rekted the hell outta deadlines and such. That\'s why he hid it from Kadokawa, and the snitch was just waiting to happen...in time to come. So in regards to the original source material (and this anime), you can thank the ""Return by Death"" God that is Tappei Nagatsuki for revealing this well-hidden work to the world. Also, same industry friends be snitches LOL.Despite being released later than KonoSuba, it was actually Natsume Akatsuki\'s very first work with the whole ""another world"" ancient, sci-fi, interstellar joke of a setting with plain stupid and idiotic characters, most of which bear a lot of resemblance to KonoSuba (that the latter series refined on it and was a smashing hit). If you still don\'t get the gist of this show, like said series, it\'s meant to be literal jokes one after another without discourse and contentment. We all know the feeling of watching KonoSuba for the nth time, but to experience other works that may or may not have the same standard as the illusive frenetic comedy series, it\'s just comparing those to a very high pedestal. Seriously though, in Natsume Akatsuki\'s case, there is nothing that could top KonoSuba, though what was done here in ""Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!"" (a.k.a Combatants Will Be Dispatched!) definitely laid the groundwork into the creation of one of the most famous and iconic ironically cultured shows of the modern anime era. The former is the daily homework, while the latter is the BIG project.Helping the fact that it\'s not just an Isekai, but a ""transported into another world"" through object means (as opposed to being Truck-kun-ed,  stabbed or slept to death) that makes this show stand out amongst it\'s own hilariously self-aware, no pun intended, dirty comedy of the most degenerate kind. The characters know what is going on, and they\'re unafraid to bash the conventional terms of their existence in a shitty setting of a Black Company, one who only does ""pure"" devilish evil things. The MC in question is Kisaragi Corporation\'s Combat Agent No. 6, whom like Kazuma in action (plus a lil\' bit of Megumin with that ""Explosion!"" move), thinks that he is on top of the world with his evil skills as a combatant, and goes around like the bad influencer that the self-proclaimed agent is the ""best of the best"". This show may not have Kazuma\'s refined ""true gender equality"" catchphrase, but what it does here is to add characters that provide that nonsensical jester and banter so ""evil"", you might wanna squinch your eyes and gouge out those eyeballs if shit goes insane. For a mission that requires him to transport into another world to solve the case of a kingdom that is about to fall to the generalist ways of the Demon Lord, No. 6 is accompanied by a travelling companion: the no-nonsense, monotone, disfiguratively straightforward and exceptional android Alice. She can take all kinds of shit that No. 6 dishes out of his actions and his dirty-ass cuss mouth, and lead him into victory, all while being a vessel of the collection of ""Evil Points"": deeds that range in the pervy kind, no matter how tangible it is, in exchange for useful parts transmitted from Earth when they are in a pinchy-punch. She\'s the equivalent of Doraemon in their world, and an extremely useful android at that too.Once transported into another world, more hijinks arise in the form of an ineloquent rag-tag team of an unintended ""harem"": the boobs-heavy Snow, whose serious-but-cheap personalities emits a split personality according to her circumstances, all she ever cared for is fame, recognition, and the greed of money. In total, she\'s akin to Aqua in a lot of ways. Rose the chimera, a kid-like warrior that often attaches herself to No. 6, though not close to Megumin-like, but there\'s a cinch of that personality likeness. The Dark Witch Grimm, she\'s the easiest of the trio to compare to the KonoSuba crew as this series\'s version of Darkness, she has no shame and does what she wants on her own whim. Add in the endless sexual innuendo of ""tits""-ular characters of what you would expect to find in ancient kingdoms of royalty, evil Demon Lord levels, and even some bootylicious ""evil"" managers of the Kisaragi Corporation, and you have the foundations of an imperfect KonoSuba in the making.I don\'t want to keep stating that J.C.Staff\'s quality is whatever, but it\'s clear that this was made as a half-witted show, and director Hiroaki Akagi knows it best. Working 2 shows this season with this show and Mashiro no Oto for the Shin-Ei Animation in-house director, more than his directorial duties being stretched, with the limited resources, I\'m sure that the production team tried their best to deliver on the ""meh"" plot that incites a lot of forced comedy, even though it feels a lot on the crass side. But make no mistake, this show is indeed watchable, that\'s if you can handle the cringe for majority of the show.I\'d swear that Seiyuu Miku Itou\'s biography is getting a whole lot more with just more than notable characters like Gotoubun no Hanayome\'s Miku Nakano. Even down to her discography, the songs written by her are also getting better, as is the case for this show\'s OP, dressed in a comical-like fashion. While character-centralized collab songs are getting old pretty fast (with the case of the ED), I guess you could call that an art that was once prominent, and in this day and age, it\'s not all that viable anymore.All in all, unless you\'re looking for more KonoSuba, this show ain\'t worth your time to be looked at. Rather, I implore you to see from a different angle, that if not for ""Sentouin, Hakenshimasu!"", we wouldn\'t even have KonoSuba in the very first place. Someone mentioned that ""It’s the sequel that started way before the prequel"", and this is very true. In conclusion, of the 3 adaptations seen from Natsume Akatsuki, the latest (that is Kemono Michi) is a big departure, while both this series and KonoSuba are IMO considered to be in the same family tree. This show is not for everyone, and it may look and sound disgusting, but it is disgustingly good if you are willing to turn your brain off and enjoy this mindless and senselessly drought of a substandard work-in-progress. in time to come.

It is inferior in every single way you can think of.The story is about a ""Evil company"" and a ""Evil hero"". The reason i wrote Evil Hero and not Anti-Hero is because he is not a anti-hero at all. He is just a cruel and mean hero, who does bad things because the author made me do it to ""compensate"" for when he does good deeds that the story needs to progress. It ridiculous....The show has ""comedic relief"" at the most inappropriate places. The demon army will wipe out all the humans of the city if the battle is lost? Time to make lame jokes like it\'s a normal day with no stakes at all! The music shifts to clownish comedy music in the middle of tense moments for some bizzare reason, Why? To make it fun? It certainly is not funny, it just comes off like the guy who wrote the story had no idea what he was doing and thought that adding in ""comedy"" randomly into a moment would somehow make it good.Pretty much all the characters are flat and most are unlikable. The main Character is  a grown up warrior version of Kazuma, but without any of the positive aspects so he is just a perverted trash heap. Most other characters have serious flaws that don\'t make you attached to them at all.In the end when i think of what a failure this anime is, I wonder ""how the hell did he manage to make Konosuba a success?"" Was it just pure luck that Konosuba was good and not like this? I don\'t have any hopes that this author will manage to do better in his career.If you like a good Comedy/Isekai, pick anything else.

Best anime of this season.', 'As is with the majority of silly comedy anime you have to take Sentouin Hakenshimasu and this review with a grain of salt. It\'s one of those animes that are self aware and intentionally stupid. So if you are one of the people running around on this platform  who consider themself ""anime connoisseur"" and the ""sentiment of acquired taste"" please go and call out another anime for ""characters as flat as your girlfriend\'s chest"" or ""story as lame as Lightning Larry Luciano"" (damn a SpongeBob reference, a comparison and a hyperbole I\'m getting going on this one)Disclaimer out of the way so let\'s roll....If isekai is a family then Sentouin Hakenshimasu is that weird little cousin that always acts like he snorted uncle Kazumas cocaine line leftovers.I swear that\'s the only and last Konosuba reference or comparison (or is it).The story hits the zeitgeist like nothing else.It\'s basically Twitter as an anime. One stupid bubble bashes on another bubble on a quest to gather useless attention by harassing and insulting others while being as edgy as possible. Meanwhile, you enjoy the clash of idiotic morons and some occasional softcore porn while scrolling through your feed.Just the way you like it.You will find out that this description is more accurate than you might think so I don\'t even bother you with some actual introduction or summary. There\'s actually a linear plot that is featured here and there but overall it\'s still as deep as your bathtub. But that\'s fine, you wouldn\'t want your Twitter timeline to be covered in Kant or Nietzsche quotes.Coming to the main selling point: The cast. Anime like these need genuine and enjoyable characters. They need just the right traits and characteristics that fit the goofy and ironic narrative. And Sentouin Hakenshimasu ticks the necessary boxes. The main cast is a solid match of characters. They are really fun to watch and in no way boring or tediously dry.The main character is Combat agent Sex... I mean Six aka Zipperman. Hes your average degenrate twitter troll. And when he\'s not shitposting on some random Twitter hashtag or bullying someone on their discord server then he uses the rest of his spare unemployed day to moderate Reddit hentai fetish subs. What can I say his persona is just made to spread joy around his fellows. All jokes aside just for now but he\'s unironically a ""better"" character than you might suspect. Explaining that just wouldn\'t fit this review, trust me he has his moments.He\'s followed by his sidekick Alexa or was it Alice I don\'t remember. No, seriously that shotgun wielding Loli android is the epidemy of Amazon Alexa evolution. Just call her up and whatever goody you need she will ship it. High caliber weapons, C4 .. everything a modern household needs regularly. And when you don\'t keep her occupied by bombarding her with boomer joke requests, question her what to cook today or beg for life advice she will either interrupt you with a weather forecast for some town on the other side of the globe or remind you of those bugging appointments or chores you desperately try to avoid.Now to the rest of the main cast harem:Big brain Six managed to accumulate the most useless fighting trio of all time. Competing with the likes of Jesse, James and Meowth, Shinpachi, Kagura and Sadaharu or even Megumin, Darkness and Aqua. It\'s just as good old schooldays: the sports ace drafted himself the fat kid, the nerd and the girl who is usually dodging PE class, as his dodgeball team just to show off how incredible he is.So who are the lucky poeple Six and Alice chose? For starters they got themself a crippled hag with a body that is a merge of Kate Moss and Stephen Hawking while having the mental capabilities of Hagrid. Even her magic abilities are as debilitated as her limbs.She\'s followed by an annoying brat. The little Kirby cosplayer has the ability to transform into everything that she gets between her chops. ""That ability doesn\'t sound that bad it sure has to be of some use!"". You could think that but apparently, little Rose only transforms some parts of her body, and let\'s say that ""she wasn\'t exactly struck by luck when it comes to her transformations"".Last but not least we have the basic dumb bitch whose sole drive to live is to gather either fame, fortune, or both by using her ""feminine qualities\'. Trust me if she could access the internet, my my she would certainly be all over the place. But in her world, the career of a soldier is the only way to gain the attention and money she so much desires (or by digging for gold). And such the battle waifu has found her way into the group. However, having the IQ of a watermelon is not the best trait to possess in a leading military position.She is also as emotionally stable as a certain building in new york on the 9th of September 2001If you made it this far into the review and you think these story and character descriptions suck as much ass as Six does in his wet dreams then you should definitely go ahead and watch Sentouin Hakenshimasu, you won\'t regret I promise!Animation. It\'s functioning there\'s really not much more to it. I mean its JC Staff expectations are met I guess. Bright colors but generic palates. Lame and repetitive backgrounds. Basic character design. I felt that the longer the anime progressed the less I was ""irritated"" by its mediocre animation. It\'s working for what the show is a comedy parody.The music is just on par with the witty and stupid comedy/ dialogue and is very supportive of those scenes. Even though I gave a relatively high score don\'t expect killer songs or gorgeous melodies. I just think Sentouin Hakenshimasu was over average in combining comedy with beneficial tunes.As mentioned before this is classic comedy Isekai in terms of story and characters. Both are quite basic but not really generic either. For what it is it delivers above average I would say. But you arent, or shouldn\'t at least, be watching this show to see highly developed characters or experience a cinematic story. You should be watching though if you want some blunt comedy and stupid punchlines for a great laugh. Sure there\'s one or another cringe and childish gag but who cares I found most of them quite funny too.As my last words: ""You earned evil points""Maybe it\'s just me having a narcissistic touch but this line is oddly satisfying to hear. If isekai is a family then Sentouin Hakenshimasu is that weird little cousin that always acts like he snorted uncle Kazumas cocaine line leftovers.I swear that\'s the only and last Konosuba reference or comparison (or is it).The story hits the zeitgeist like nothing else.It\'s basically Twitter as an anime.

And when you don\'t keep her occupied by bombarding her with boomer joke requests, question her what to cook today or beg for life advice she will either interrupt you with a weather forecast for some town on the other side of the globe or remind you of those bugging appointments or chores you desperately try to avoid.Now to the rest of the main cast harem:Big brain Six managed to accumulate the most useless fighting trio of all time. Competing with the likes of Jesse, James and Meowth, Shinpachi, Kagura and Sadaharu or even Megumin, Darkness and Aqua. It\'s just as good old schooldays: the sports ace drafted himself the fat kid, the nerd and the girl who is usually dodging PE class, as his dodgeball team just to show off how incredible he is.So who are the lucky poeple Six and Alice chose? For starters they got themself a crippled hag with a body that is a merge of Kate Moss and Stephen Hawking while having the mental capabilities of Hagrid. Even her magic abilities are as debilitated as her limbs.She\'s followed by an annoying brat. The little Kirby cosplayer has the ability to transform into everything that she gets between her chops. ""That ability doesn\'t sound that bad it sure has to be of some use!"". You could think that but apparently, little Rose only transforms some parts of her body, and let\'s say that ""she wasn\'t exactly struck by luck when it comes to her transformations"".Last but not least we have the basic dumb bitch whose sole drive to live is to gather either fame, fortune, or both by using her ""feminine qualities\'. Trust me if she could access the internet, my my she would certainly be all over the place. But in her world, the career of a soldier is the only way to gain the attention and money she so much desires (or by digging for gold). And such the battle waifu has found her way into the group. However, having the IQ of a watermelon is not the best trait to possess in a leading military position.She is also as emotionally stable as a certain building in new york on the 9th of September 2001If you made it this far into the review and you think these story and character descriptions suck as much ass as Six does in his wet dreams then you should definitely go ahead and watch Sentouin Hakenshimasu, you won\'t regret I promise!Animation. It\'s functioning there\'s really not much more to it. I mean its JC Staff expectations are met I guess. Bright colors but generic palates. Lame and repetitive backgrounds. Basic character design. I felt that the longer the anime progressed the less I was ""irritated"" by its mediocre animation. It\'s working for what the show is a comedy parody.The music is just on par with the witty and stupid comedy/ dialogue and is very supportive of those scenes. Even though I gave a relatively high score don\'t expect killer songs or gorgeous melodies. I just think Sentouin Hakenshimasu was over average in combining comedy with beneficial tunes.As mentioned before this is classic comedy Isekai in terms of story and characters. Both are quite basic but not really generic either. For what it is it delivers above average I would say. But you arent, or shouldn\'t at least, be watching this show to see highly developed characters or experience a cinematic story. You should be watching though if you want some blunt comedy and stupid punchlines for a great laugh. Sure there\'s one or another cringe and childish gag but who cares I found most of them quite funny too.As my last words: ""You earned evil points""Maybe it\'s just me having a narcissistic touch but this line is oddly satisfying to hear.', 'Boring, unfunny, and disappointing. Sad really.As many of may have heard, this series was written by the same author as Konosuba, I however had not at the time of watching the first couple episodes, so I ran into it with no expectations.The production values are low overall, the animation is not impressive in anyway, and some still shots are just awful.After watching episode 1, I figured the plot was non-existant, and the series treated the setting as if we had already been familiar with most of these characters, if not confusing, it rather let me wondering ""why should I care about these unlikeable characters. Most...of them just seem mean spirited, which seems to be the not funny joke, like most of the show, jokes tend to range from bland to ""alright that made chuckle a bit.""8 Episodes later, as expected nothing managed to change in the tone and feel of the series.Now, knowing it is written by the same author of konosuba, I wish I could recommend it to it\'s fans but it just plainly has a different feel. It\'s lacking in many ways compared to it. And speaking as one of it\'s fans, it\'s a bit sad knowing it\'s from the same author because I know he can do better than this. of them just seem mean spirited, which seems to be the not funny joke, like most of the show, jokes tend to range from bland to ""alright that made chuckle a bit.""8 Episodes later, as expected nothing managed to change in the tone and feel of the series.Now, knowing it is written by the same author of konosuba, I wish I could recommend it to it\'s fans but it just plainly has a different feel.

This anime initially still maintaining good balance to that but throughout the episode they went to the fully degenerate side, Snow that despite love money still sometimes despise bad act like corrupt regime, trash politican etc, then later on...she\'s just let some prince from another country fondle her boobs just for ""MONEEYY IS ALL I NEED"" and lost depth to her character.Early episode still let you have development between Agent Six and Grimm, how she gets mistreated, how Agent Six waits for Grimm to be revived and taking a stroll with her, etc. But they won\'t do something like this anymore, scrap it, and make her like simple brainless crazy witch.Music is okay I guess, decent OPED.

Simple, it's just my preference.The story is simple, evil organization sends the mc to another world to conquer it.

Why didn't they send more combatants right from the very start when they sent more combatants in the latter episodes? Like, those common sense questions are just a few that comes to my mind when thinking about...this anime's plot.But all in all, it's not really a problem since it's a comedy series that doesn't really follow common sense. So yeah, watch this anime with that mindset and you'll enjoy it.The characters, well, they might not be as developed as Konosuba's cast, but when they shine, they f*cking shine. What I meant by this is that Konosuba is consistently good, but Sentouin is hovering between mediocre and great. It has it lows and highs.Some example of the lows is when Rokugo rage when some of his team died which is pretty hard to watch-through because of how cringe it is.But overall, they are a good cast. Albeit a little underdeveloped. But Konosuba's cast are also underdeveloped though if I may add.The animation is bad. Still images and some scenes looks good, but when they start fighting, it looks laughable. It isn't that bad, but it's really not good either.The music is decent. I don't find the ost or the op and ed bad, but I'm neutral to it.Overall, the good outweighs the bad.

Massive developments happen that fail to relate whatsoever to the plot because it\'s only related to a single episode. Konosuba...progressed as a slow isekai comedy, with small, gradual changes that occurred in the world over multiple seasons that began to shape the overarching plot.

It disappointed me, not because I was a bad person, but because of the high expectations I had.Grade: 4', ""If you have a healthy amount of testosterone and appreciate a self-aware comedy in a similar to vein to Konosuba then you'll love it.It's not ground breaking, you're not going to finally see the matrix or have a world changing experience.But, simply put it's fun. It's not mental brain rot like certain series we won't mention *cough* *To-Love-ru* * cough*. Thankfully the writer has an IQ high enough to give us both the sizzle and the steak.So far I think it's better than Konosuba, it's faster paced and won't have you lose interest while you're waiting for the next plot development.As someone...that can appreciate thematically deep stories and fun shows alike.

The art lacks detail, but the animations are serviceable and the overall background designs are pretty cool. Monsters and such are terribly boringly designed though, but the main characters stand out.All in all, there\'s just enough good stuff to make it enjoyable....Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 7/10------------------------------------------It\'s okay. Main characters have nice voice acting.Story - 5/10-------------Eh... I didn\'t really get a good idea what this show wanted to achieve. The story is kinda all over the place. It\'s a futuristic Isekai that takes place largely in a medieval fantasy land. It tries to tango with the MC being evil, but doesn\'t really pull that off as any and all ""evil"" that they do is actually just childish pranks. It tries to be a comedy while also being serious, it tries to be kinda adult trivialize sex and ecchi, but still ends up all over the place with blushing and cringe romance.The comedy feels overly forced and predictable.The overall story doesn\'t really even make sense to begin with and not much is explained. Ep 1 immediately throws you off the deep end and expects you to just roll with the B-tier movie plot. I\'m not really a fan of that.Characters - 6/10---------------------I don\'t really like any of them. The MC is a frustrating walking pendulum that swings between being stupid as a bag of dirt, to too smart for his own good. Between being so incompetent as to fail at tying his own shoelaces to being capable enough to solo top enemy combatants.Supporting cast is a bit more one dimensional, but not really in a good way. It\'s a cast of people with serious mental problems.---Total - 6/10---I\'m not sure what this anime really tried to achieve. Its comedy doesn\'t even come close to the powerhouse Isekai shows such as Konosuba, or even the occasionally comedic Overlord. It\'s seriousness is similarly lacking, as the B-tier plot and comedy make it impossible to really take even its most serious moments truly seriously.The production values aren\'t terrible, so I suppose at the very least you can grab some popcorn and watch it for a few chuckles.

Note that I will not consider giving this the same score as Konosuba hence having the same creator otherwise this might be higher than 5 or even a 6. I really don’t think its fair. I get it, because I do give similar scores, but thats for one anime with more than 2 seasons depending on my experience or how much they fixed the issue. We’re not considering giving two animes with the same score with same traits.Since this anime is a copy paste to Konosuba, this will be lower because you got the character with...similar traits and characteristics, similar storyline and similar ecchi-ness into it. The only thing that makes up a little, is the music which is the opening and ending, I’ll give it a pass for that.So far, not too much to think of. That’s all i gotta say, for now and again, if this has a second season hell even a third season, I would probably give this a similar score and review if its the same otherwise it could be changed once i see difference into it.You know 5 could be your lucky number if you can believe on the score i rate. similar traits and characteristics, similar storyline and similar ecchi-ness into it.

It is very good as it relates to the group of leading girls, it is fun. I love the personality of the protagonist because he is very crazy. I find it very interesting, I...hope they get more seasons, it is very entertaining.The animation is pretty good but when it shines the most is in the fights, then the animation level drops sometimes in some moments.

Now, don't slaughter me before you finish reading this paragraph, but... Konosuba wasn't good (7/10 at best, more likely around 6.8~), and Kemono michi was even worse (barely 6 point something /10 (6.2-6.5). And before you kill me - I'm talking about the LN and/or manga here! The anime for Konosuba was pretty great as we know, but that was achieved through the talent of the animators, and...voice actors improvising A LOT of the best things about the show, the changes, additions, fluidity, directing, all working perfectly to create this passion fruit which really worked unlike the source material that was just 'somewhat good' at best. Kemono michi didn't get that kind of treatment, and despite also being better than the  source material, it was just SLIGHTLY better, and overall not that memorable or good.How about Hakenshimasu? Well, so far, its by far the worst of the trio, even worse than the source material for the other two, to the point i'm thinking that Hakenshimasu and kemono michi where adapted ONLY because the producers thought something among the lines of 'if Konosuba was so popular, fans will like the author's other works too!', which is a very flawed assumption, and even if they didn't do it due to that reasoning, the result is all the same - a painfully mediocre product. What are the reasons for it and problems i noticed in it so far?Horifically bland and generic opening. Average ending, overall bad audio. Generic drawing style, average visuals, low and stiff animation. Utter lack of story, sense of progression, sense of threat and danger, power levels, scaling (the 'heroes' are extremely op from the start and the only limiting factor is their lack of 'evil points' and their overall disinterest in helping)... There's pretty much no story and script. No investment and no tension. There are no character arcs, no vested interest, the hero is not attached to anyone or anything, and the way everything is presented doesn't get the viewer too interested and attached either.The premise is 'go to another world, do evil, earn evil points, and use them to make a teleporter and base on the other side'. What's the protagonist's interest in doing that? He seems to be a small fry, and despite the promise he'd make it big if he succeeds, it doesn't seem he will, and he doesn't seem too interested in it either. Does he have something for him on the other side? Well, a team of three misfits joining him that he seems semi attached to, but not enough to change his mind and get him to care, just in the first big encounter in ep 6 and the part where he rolled the crazy curse chick on her new wheel chair he gave her that seems to be later forgotten about (i thought the anime would change and get a bit better at that point even, well, no such luck)...This is not the final review, and I'll update it and probably add things after it ends, maybe change it if it goes better, but i highly doubt it from the fact that half way in, all i can say about it is - unbelievably underwhelming. voice actors improvising A LOT of the best things about the show, the changes, additions, fluidity, directing, all working perfectly to create this passion fruit which really worked unlike the source material that was just 'somewhat good' at best.

"" Is a story that was written by Konosuba\'s Author. I had high hopes for this anime, because of three factors. The first is obviously because it was written by the creator of Konosuba. The second is that the trailer interested me, due to the fact we have a perspective from a evil company, Kisagari. The third was because of the director, Akagi Hiroaki. His work on Takagi-san and the newest Mashiro no Oto was really well directed. So I had my hopes high, and ultimately I was not disappointed.The studio that made Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is...J.C.Staff notoriously known for making One Punch Man Season 2, Toradora, Food Wars, Saiki K etc. They had some good works on their belts so that helped enhance my hype for this show.The genre for this show is comedy, action and fantasy.<<--------------------------------------------------------------------->>Story : 6/10Art : 7/10Sound : 9/10Characters : 7/10Enjoyment : 9/10Overall : 7/10<<--------------------------------------------------------------------->>Story :The story is about our protagonist, Combatant 6 and a Android named Kisaragi Alice. They were sent on the mission to check out a new world, by the three leaders of Kisaragi. It seemed like a interesting concept, I had hoped we had more exploration of the HQ or even the world they lived in. The world they had been transported to, seemed pretty bland but the people living there were definitely something- The story in general is simple enough as you can see.There is really nothing outstanding about the plot, it was just simple and that\'s what I liked about it. They were straight forward with many things, but there is still more we need to learn about the world. Their mission was simple, yet it exploded into a full on war between a kingdom and the demon clan.But this is only one of the things that enhanced my enjoyment for the show. I gave the story a 7/10<<--------------------------------------------------------------------->>Art :The art fit the story pretty well, I especially loved how Combatant 6 looked. He looked just like any normal human being who had been transformed by science. Alice looked just like what she is, Kisaragi\'s Company Pretty Girl Android! Grimm looked just like her personality, the color of her hair fit her name. Snow had light blue hair, perfectly representing snow itself. I think the only one I didn\'t like was Rose she didn\'t really fit her name. The three leaders of Kisaragi looked just like how their personalities were.The general backgrounds were fine, the characters looked off model sometimes but it just enhanced the comedy.

Other than that it\'s just pretty simple and fits the comedic tone.I gave the Art a 7/10<<--------------------------------------------------------------------->>Sound :Let me start off with the Opening and Ending themes first! The Opening ""No.6"" by Miku Itou is one of my favorites. Of course I would love this type of song, it fits the freedom of the main characters well and it shows us a new type of open-world type of song. It perfectly fits the vibe I get when I watched the show, it was jazzy and full of surprises. The ending song ""Home Sweet Home"" sang by the VA\'s of our four wonderful ladies. It didn\'t give me a feeling of the show, but it gave me a feeling of calm and peacefulness.The OST is one that fits the show pretty well, both in comedic tone and balances it out with some pretty dramatic ones too.I gave the sound a 8/10<<--------------------------------------------------------------------->>Characters :The main character, Combatant No.6 seems like a jerk and also a pervert from the outside(I mean he is) but he has a heart and he can care like a normal human does.

Grimm is a very interesting lady, she is a religious girl but she is also a lady in need of love(Hope Combatant No.6 takes her-). Rose is alright, we saw a little bit of character in her but really she didn\'t develop that much.The characters are good in their own parts, its just that they have yet to be developed. I like that the three leaders are in every preview of each episode, we don\'t get to miss them and we can see that Astaroth\'s love for Combatant No.6 is increasing. The two other leaders Belial and Lilith are pretty good characters as well, we can see them playful trying to get both Combatant No.6 and Astaroth together.

Seeya on the other side :)Overall : 7/10', ""tl;dr mediocre time filler.Sentouin Hakenshimasu doesn't particularly stand out for anything. An odd take on isekai, the appeal of Sentouin comes from its cliche-ish characters and comedy routines. Certainly worth the watch if you're seeking a quick laugh or some cookiecutter fanservice.Sentouin lets the viewer know from the get-go that they're in for a lighthearted and slightly perverted anime and delivers on that promise. The plot isn't particularly engaging or even coherent, though each episode is active or funny enough to maintain the viewer's interest.We see no real attempt at character development, instead there is a slice-of-life-esque exploration of what certain characters would do in...the situation that they're placed in each episode. 12 episodes is just short enough to where these things that they do haven't become too overused and still retain their comedic value.Overall, the show is quite enjoyable if you don't take it seriously, with much of the enjoyment stemming from ridiculousness. I wouldn't watch a second season unless I really have nothing else to do. the situation that they're placed in each episode. 12 episodes is just short enough to where these things that they do haven't become too overused and still retain their comedic value.Overall, the show is quite enjoyable if you don't take it seriously, with much of the enjoyment stemming from ridiculousness.

To be fair even half as funny as Konosuba is still funny so you will find humor and good jokes in this one, occasionally. You will also find massive amounts of fan service and bad pervert jokes.I am also aware that humor is both subjective and cultural but despite being a non-Japanese I have watched extremely funny anime before (not just Konosuba). For me this show just doesn't work and it all comes down to what it chooses to focus on: awful sexual jokes. Half the show is just fanservice...and sexual harasment jokes and rarely is it funny. At one point the main character, who's been flip flopping between combat pragmatist and moron the entire show, puts his (censored) penis on top of someone's head. The scene is sudden, incredibly bad, unbelievably stupid and badly justified.The show is also inconsistent in their portrayal of the characters, sometime they're smart, sometimes, usually, they're brain dead. Sometimes they're massive perverts and sometimes, rarely, they're nice. And the intelligence and niceness seems to drain from them as the show continues and they become incredibly 2 dimensional: the pervert, the genius, the greedy one, the hungry one, the sleepy one.They've also done themselves a disservice by having 2 main characters, the Kazuma like Six and the Kazuma like Alice. Yes they split Kazuma in two, one of them being the perverted Kazuma and the other being the smart Kazuma and it makes both Kazumas worse as a result as the pervert is nearly irredeemable and the smart one is unfunny.I enjoyed it enough to finish it (barely) but it became frustrating to see it become less entertaining and less funny as it went on and my time would have been better used rewatching Konosuba. and sexual harasment jokes and rarely is it funny.

And the intelligence and niceness seems to drain from them as the show continues and they become incredibly 2 dimensional: the pervert, the genius, the greedy one, the hungry one, the sleepy one.They've also done themselves a disservice by having 2 main characters, the Kazuma like Six and the Kazuma like Alice. Yes they split Kazuma in two, one of them being the perverted Kazuma and the other being the smart Kazuma and it makes both Kazumas worse as a result as the pervert is nearly irredeemable and the smart one is unfunny.I enjoyed it enough to finish it (barely) but it became frustrating to see it become less entertaining and less funny as it went on and my time would have been better used rewatching Konosuba."", ""Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! is a fairly average anime that prioritizes comedy above all else to the point of recklessness. The animation and visuals stand out the most, especially in action scenes where the animation feels particularly stiff, most likely to reduce costs, with much of the action seemingly occurring off-screen. But fear not, for amidst the chaos and confusion, there's a saving grace: this anime is downright hilarious. With jokes that hit harder than a punchline and characters so sexy they could make your screen sizzle, the anime delivers the laughs and the eye candy in equal measure. Despite its lack of many typical enjoyable elements,...Sentouin, Hakenshimasu! manages to exceed expectations with its quick pacing and occasional moments of genuine character development, ultimately captivating viewers with its expressive comedy and memorable characters.

Doesn't really matter. Isn't the focus of the series. 4/10Art is basic, low budget and a bit 2010-ish, but not eye-gouging simplistic. Animation is just fine. Nothing special, but nothing your stomach can flip from either. Not really the focus of the series either, but I expected a bit better. 5/10Sound, one of the fine points of the anime, even if basic, is mostly on point and doesn't feel artificial. The effects...sound the way they should and foley artists (if they were even employed instead of using pre-made samples) did a decent job. Opening is actually very nice. Sets up the goofy atmosphere for the series. VA is decent and fits the characters. Very nice. 8/10Characters are fine. The main character is actually fun to look at. He's despicable, horny, goofy and stupid, but by no means a total pushover. Has his moments of idiocy, moments of brilliance and even occasional wholesomeness. The other lead, a kuudere loli is mostly a straight man for the MC, but she doesn't have many distinguishing characteristics past that short description. Side characters are mostly stereotypical, to the point of being fresh in the world of originality (OK, I know that sounds stupid), but usually have a characteristic or two that sets them apart of the usual approach. Not terrific, not terrible. They are not a pain to look at. And tend to be at least somewhat fun. 7/10Enjoyment generally comes from the comedy, which... Is ok, I guess. There are times of smirks, snorts and all-out laughter. That might just be me, but I find the primitive and juvenile humor in the series quite endearing. Tropes are all around, but the author tries his best to somehow subvert the expectations in some of them, even if not all of them and only a little bit. Decently good. 7/10I'd say it's a 7.Not a very solid 7 maybe, but still more fitting that a 6.A 6.75?Not a must-watch, unless like me, you can't live and sustain your brain-eating bug without watching at least 10 series per season, because this season is one of the weaker ones really, so we have to make do with stuff like Sentouin here. sound the way they should and foley artists (if they were even employed instead of using pre-made samples) did a decent job.

The rest...of the cast is also really fun, there isn't ever a dull scene when all of them are together - I especially liked Snow and how pitiful she could be.The jokes and scenarios in this anime are really funny, some truly outlandish stuff happens and it's great to witness. We're essentially following the villains in this story and it's a breath of fresh air to not have cringe moments where the protagonist out of nowhere acts all noble and righteous, he instead acts the absolute opposite and it makes for some great humour.Overall this show is definitely worth a watch, it's really funny and the characters keep it from feeling boring despite the pretty standard plot.

As this too is a satirical take on isekai, it is inevitable that comparisons will ensue. Similar to Konosuba, here too the focus is on a party of adventurers that really don’t fit the isekai mold. The protagonist is Combat Agent Six, an operative of an evil Earth organization that was teleported to a fantasy planet to...prep for an eventual invasion. He was teleported alongside the android girl Alice, who has all the combat abilities of a normal little girl, but is really smart and quite skilled at coming up with devious plans. Three other girls from Grace, the kingdom they land in, end up joining their squad: the incredibly greedy knight Snow, the gluttonous airhead chimera Rose, and the envious death worshiping bishop Grimm. Together they deal with various problems that the Grace Kingdom faces under the threat of a demon invasion in ways only members of an evil organization could.The overarching plot is pretty simple and doesn’t feel that important. It just sets up problems for the main characters to get involved in, and the core of the story is the unique ways in which they solve said problems. The party is ultimately very different from Konosuba in that while the main cast of Konosuba definitely have some very nonheroic traits, it still felt like overall they were clearly being presented as heroic. Here the focus is very much on them being villainous, with the protagonist’s abilities essentially being straight up powered by him committing evil deeds. However, this is still a character focused story with an emphasis on comedy so it relies on the viewers liking the main characters. As such, I feel it is much more difficult to write, and unfortunately I feel this missed the mark in quite a few areas.The parts that work well are those involving the protagonist Six and his partner Alice. They’re members of a evil organization and they very much play the part. They come up with all sorts of cartoonishly evil plans and just in general behave childishly malevolent. Seeing them deal with the type of problems heroes face in very unheroic ways is hilarious. And just in general the two of them have pretty good chemistry that’s fun to watch as well. Snow too works decently well for the first arc of the anime, which takes up the first half. She’s not quite evil, but she is really greedy and always desperate for cash. But despite that she also is somewhat heroic. And over the course of the first arc of the anime she develops a decent relationship with Six and Alice such that she draws out the heroism in them too and it feels like the bonds between them are developing reasonably well.However, the second arc which takes up the second half drops the focus on Snow’s arc entirely. It feels like any progress in Snow and her relationships with the rest of the group were completely reverted. Furthermore, in the second half it places a larger emphasis on Snow’s less heroic traits, but they aren’t written as cartoonishly evil as Six and Alice. As such, she just seems kind of lame and unlikable. If the focus on Snow was dropped to focus on the other two members of the group, Grimm and Rose, that would be acceptable, but the second arc feels completely directionless. Grimm and Rose get so little development that it’s hard to really have much of an opinion on them at all. Though I suppose it’s better than being actively unlikable as with Snow. There are also of course various other side characters such as a reoccurring antagonist demon woman named Heine, or brief cuts to the leaders of the evil organization that Six is apart of as they read his reports. However, they don’t really have anything interesting to them either beyond being the butt of jokes.And that ultimately brings up the other issue. The comedy in this feels much more narrow than Konosuba. It can be really good at times, and for the first arc I’d say it’s excellent. Konosuba felt like it was playing around with tropes to make fun of them, but here the comedy arises from playing around with tropes trying to break them, which can be both hilarious and satisfying. However, the second arc feels like it’s mostly just making very similar jokes without anything more and it quickly starts losing it’s appeal. I suppose it does try to change things up somewhat, but it’s not enough, as it just feels like it’s slight twists on old material. And just in general I feel the pacing was also weaker and the writing not as good, resulting in the anime overall just being not as funny.The art and animation were pretty good. The character designs were really good though. The designs outside of that weren’t particularly great, but they weren’t purely generic isekai designs so they get some points for that.

The characters are supposedly representative of those from konosuba as well, except much more dumb and perverted.Literally other than the characters, the anime is decent, so if the characters don\'t bother you too much or you can look past it, then give the anime a shot.', 'A duo of an android and a scumbag try to achieve their mission and on the way they gather their group whie fighting the enemy and solving problems made by other and by themselves,pretty simple stuff.As you can guess they are stuck in a specifc status quo but thats to be expected since its a comedy and it ends with READ THE LN ending as per usual for those kind of thing but on a good point.The art was good enough for a comedic series but it does not have much range,not like this hindered the show much mind you.The music was simply okay and...the VA as well,not bad but they did not do that much more than what was expected.Most of the characters are douchebags and scumbags but obviously for its genre its more of a comedic tone to them,how much you will like them depens on how much you like how shameless most of them are to their negative traits.I enjoyed this show as a passtime,i was amused by it and sometimes laughed,yes sometimes the jokes and situations got repetitive but not too much for me.Also beware,this show has more eichi than you would expect,not nipples but still. the VA as well,not bad but they did not do that much more than what was expected.Most of the characters are douchebags and scumbags but obviously for its genre its more of a comedic tone to them,how much you will like them depens on how much you like how shameless most of them are to their negative traits.I enjoyed this show as a passtime,i was amused by it and sometimes laughed,yes sometimes the jokes and situations got repetitive but not too much for me.Also beware,this show has more eichi than you would expect,not nipples but still.', ""While the animation isn't incredible it is fairly decent. Action scenes aren't super flashy, but they're still fairly fluid. Backgrounds are decent, character animations are decent, again not terribly impressive, but decent.

Pacing is good, it gets a tiny bit slow after episode 6, but picks up again towards the end. While the voice acting isn't terribly impressive, it is well cast and not grating, which is nice.

It is filled with juvenile humor, which is a fresh feeling after lots of forced comedy in recent shows.This is written by the same person who wrote KonoSuba, so if you liked the comedy in there, you'd probably like the comedy in here.I enjoyed the slice of life nature of the anime, and the ending wrapped up the general feelings pretty well.There was plenty of fanservice to keep the show moving, but I felt that it was well-placed such that the show itself would...not be hindered through fanservice.The show begins well, slows slightly in the middle, and keeps a strong pace through the end.Art - 7=====Normal isekai art, pretty much.

It’s a fun action adventure show with science fiction and fantasy elements mixed in there.Combat Agent No.6 works for the Kisaragi Corporation with the goal of conquering the universe. He is accompanied by a support android named Alice Kisaragi, who is made to look like a little girl. Why this is, of course, is never explained. I guess it’s just funny that a loli is helping take over the universe. I also find it funny how the android is given a proper name while the protagonist is referred to as the...number 6. It’s possible that he has a real name, but that doesn’t matter. It’s funny either way. These partners in crime are teleported to a planet in hopes of conquering it. To do this they’ll have to infiltrate the kingdom that rules there and take it over from the inside.The show has a good setup for a comedy. In fact it’s quite similar to Konosuba, which makes sense considering it is an adaptation of a light novel from the same author as Konosuba. You’ve got the perverted asshole main character, Combat Agent No.6, who isn’t as quick-witted as Kazuma but is somehow more competent. Grimm is a bumbling fool who can cast magic, but it has a 20 percent chance of affecting herself instead of her target. She rides around in a wheelchair because she once tried to curse someone with the inability to use footwear, but it affected her instead. She’s kind of the Darkness of the group. Grimm isn’t as masochistic as her. She is just accident prone. Rose is some human/dragon chimera that is obsessed with eating meat. She is similar to Megumin in that she has a happy go lucky attitude and is focused on one thing. Then there is Snow who is definitely the Aqua of the group. She was the highest ranking knight but was demoted and is now stuck with this band of misfits. Snow is much more of a hard ass than Aqua but also has an immature side. In summary, most of the show’s characters are morons, except for Alice. Of course that’s part of what makes this show enjoyable.The most interesting aspect of the show for me is the point system. The corporation that No.6 works for has a system set up so that he can earn points for each evil deed he commits. He can exchange points for any type of gear on his mission. Throughout the show it’s pretty clear that it was a necessity. So not only is Combat Agent No.6 a mischievous, perverted asshole, but he is incentivized to be one. Now that’s good business. Of course since No.6 is an idiot he constantly screws himself and the whole team over following this system. Alice has to make up for what he lacks. That’s probably what she’s there for. Even when No. 6 isn’t screwing up, all the other characters are taken aback by his malicious way of doing things, except for Alice of course. Though it’s only to rack up points, so it’s all good.Just like Konosuba, this show loves it’s repetition. Snow is constantly getting her sword destroyed, even though she hasn’t finished paying off the loans for them yet. I wonder how much debt she’s in? Grimm is so clumsy that she takes herself out before almost every fight. Just so many jokes are repeated over and over again. Though the show is consistent if anything. It didn’t get too old. If that is something that you don’t like then this show is not for you. Overall this show was pretty fun.

This is obviously a failure of the anime studio making this show and as a result many story elements lack the expected climax that it definitely was aiming for.I could see this improving greatly in a sequel series and while the plot doesn’t go in a direction that was completely satisfactory it is still changing the status quo from what you’d expect.In summary it is an enjoyably relaxing time that feels distinct from any other series and its character moments make me want more from the show in the future. location the show takes place in and instead you learn about the leaders that the main character works for.Many of the characters share a lot of similarities to KonoSuba’s characters whether that is art or personality designs but I also believe that they end up not feeling as tropey as Konosuba’s characters.Again about the action in the series while you might not expect very good action scenes since this is a mostly comedy show KonoSuba never failed to deliver fairly satisfactory action scenes.

Some work on unsubtle repaints of the concept, others try to weasel their way into the franchise, and another group entirely decides to do something only marginally more respectable, and look towards tapping the same source. I mention this because Combatants will be Dispatched is firmly a result of this last route.I\'ll make it clear, first of all, that I\'m not saying that its flaws are specifically due to being worse than the creator\'s other, more...prominent work, instead that it has to be noted that the only reason it was adapted, and the only reason anyone who watched it chose to, is because of its successor, Konosuba. While it\'d be at just the same quality were the other never adapted, coattail-chasing is a critical issue. Any ardent message the story may have had behind it is torn away, replaced only with asinine mimicry. Not only is it trying to be something it isn\'t, to do so is why the show even exists.

The show, in a word, dawdles. Despite the illusion of progress, no event is even remotely contributory to any other, leading to the whole production having an air of aimlessness. A similar effect occurs with the attempt to match the Isekai side of the show with the quasi-Tokusatsu parts, which ends up feeling like an entirely different show is needlessly interjecting to react to the first.

Fittingly, what comes to mind is to note how again it seems to be trying to recapture the style of the creator\'s other darling. That, I suppose, makes a rather quaint point to close this on.----I distinguish myself by providing a brief run-down of improvements wherever possible. Here, though, I\'m somewhat stumped. Though I gave praise to the secondary cast and basic aesthetic, which ordinarily I\'d easily point to as areas to have put more effort into, I\'m left with the question of ""what\'s the point?"" It\'ll still be a baby\'s-first-Isekai. It\'ll still be painfully uncharismatic. Really, all I can say is this should have remained in Akatsuki Natsume\'s desk. No-one\'s early works are their strongest, this is far from an exception.It goes without saying that this is not worth recommending to strangers, but to fans of his, almost certainly the only group even contemplating seeing this, I really must implore not to try. It\'s a total waste of time.']"
Tantei Opera Milky Holmes Movie: Gyakushuu no Milky Holmes,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31486/Tantei_Opera_Milky_Holmes_Movie__Gyakushuu_no_Milky_Holmes,"['This is a Milky Holmes movie. It isn\'t a Futari wa Milky Holmes movie or a Tantei Opera TD movie. It\'s the Milky Holmes we know and love.I\'m one of the many who loved season 1 and 2 of Milky Holmes, but hated season 3 and 4 and consider them slanderous to the Milky Holmes name. Almost everything that was missing from season 3 and 4, and what made season 1 and 2 so great, is in this movie.Kokoro is back to her old, IQ-proclaiming self and the rest of the G4 aren\'t mere cameos. Shery, Nero, Herc, and Cordelia are the main focus again,...and the comedy is back in full swing. If you\'re worried about what role Kazumi and Alice (the 2 new characters from season 3, and yes I had to look up their names too) have in this movie then I can tell you they make only 3 very brief appearances. So if you hate them then they will only be minor interruptions to a movie that\'s otherwise enjoyable all the way from start to finish.The plot is relatively straightforward. Without going into spoilers, a great phantom thief is revived and Yokohama\'s existence is threatened, and the Milky Holmes have lost their Toys again. At its core it\'s a slightly more serious, retold version of the ending arc of season 2.You can expect the humor from season 1 and 2 back in overdrive with some excellent animation that can switch between cute to bizarre and comedic at the tip of a hat. It always felt like Milky Holmes was just a little short on money in the animation department, and I believe everything was given just the right amount of animation and detail in this movie.If I have any complaints at all about the movie they are minor ones.The sound levels shift sometimes, with some sound effects being particularly loud compared to the dialogue and music. It only happens a handful of times but it was grating to hear such unexpected loud sounds with my headphones on.The plot is very straightforward and that\'s not something I have an issue with, if anything it\'s what I expected of the movie. I was just a little disappointed that there was so much ""action"" for the Milky Holmes this movie. It felt like there was little downtime for them to do slice of life stuff, which is what made up the bulk of season 1 and 2. They were quite proactive and didn\'t fail at their tasks as much this time around, but perhaps that was a necessary change for the movie to not have a 2 hour runtime and to make sure the story moved along at a solid pace.Moriwaki Makoto (director of seasons 1 and 2) returned to direct this movie and it really shows. If Futari wa was a U-turn from the style of season 1 and 2, and Tantei Opera TD was a 90 degree turn back in the right direction, then this movie was the final 90 degree back on the right course. I\'m not aware of how successful this movie was in terms of revenue or critically, but if seasons 3 and 4 were failures and this movie was well received then perhaps Moriwaki will return to direct future seasons of Milky Holmes and make the series great again.If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons of Milky Holmes and desperately want more of it, this movie is a must watch and brings back hope that Milky Holmes might get a new season that brings them back to their roots. and the comedy is back in full swing.

Spy Kyoushitsu 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54947/Spy_Kyoushitsu_2nd_Season,"['After the disaster that was Spyroom season 1, Spyroom season 2 is an all around better and more enjoyable experience, that faithfully captures the essence of the best arc of the light novels.Studio FEEL really dropped the ball on the first season of Spyroom. The pacing was awful. The adaptation cut out numerous key details that would’ve helped things flow more cohesively, and all the magic of what makes this series special was gone. I legitimately found myself falling asleep watching some episodes. The difference between this season and last season is night and day. They’ve taken their time and given volumes 3 and...4 the love and care they deserve.What’s significant about those two volumes is that the story is substantially better than the first two books. Yes, the first season wasn’t a good adaptation, but that’s compounded by the fact the story simply isn’t that great to start. The slice of life elements of spyroom make the progression slower than your typical LN. This season really shows Lamplight coming together as a proper team, some good action scenes, emotional story beats, as well as characters like Thea and Annette getting fleshed out. Both really serve as the focal points of the two main arcs in season 2 and are simply brilliant in them. Had a blast seeing two get the shine they deserved. Particularly Thea over the last 4 episodes or so growing into a true leader.Not only are the episodes a near 1:1 adaptation of the source this time around, but the inclusion of the side stories volumes in between arcs was a nice way to expand on the girls and get audiences more invested in them. Last season they did some side story volumes, but they were positioned really awkwardly and killed the momentum of the show. FEEL learnt from their mistakes and wove a much more cohesive narrative this time bringing the whole team to life.For a story about “spies” I think last season many people may have felt there was shockingly little espionage and tricks employed. While it’s still no Mission:Impossible level of spy thriller, this season definitely leans more into the spy genre and there’s some really cool reverse uno style trickery and action. I still think there’s room to improve on this, but it’s slowly getting better and this was a big step forward.As I started to touch on before, the story has got much better overall, and there seems to be a clearer direction in terms of the overarching goal. We actually have some enemies and something to work towards which makes the show much more enjoyable.So to sum things up. If you liked the idea of a team of hot waifus being spies, but found the pacing and story to be weak in the first season, I think you’ll enjoy this season a lot more. While it’s not the strongest piece of writing, it’s still pretty fun, has some surprisingly heavy moments and just flows way better. The characters feel more alive and there’s much more weight here. Hopefully we get a third season with the same level of quality.Spyroom season 2 gets 7 out of 10. 4 the love and care they deserve.What’s significant about those two volumes is that the story is substantially better than the first two books.

I was actually not expecting that much on this one since season 1 was actually lacking in a lot of sense before. But I never knew that I would see this where the s2 is much better than the s1.This season gave all the spice that was lacking in season 1. The backstory of the other members that wasn't introduced that much on the s1, and their personalities were also given a lot of explanation. There was a lot of play for wits and live action that was much more entertaining than the previous season. I love the fact...that they provided more information and screen time this time to Annete, Monika and Thea (though this also meant less screen time for others). They also highlighted the unique traits of each girl.And if by bias thinking about the girls, I like them all but I really loved Thea since s1. But even with all the time provided to her in this season, I actually think it's a pity that they designed all the other girls with such OP traits and use but in the end, they provided Thea with a 'heart' instead, the most compassionate but does not have much knowledge on offensive play or even for defending herself on attacks. I might not be that sentimental to be touched by the 'big' role that she has in this season, especially in the last episodes but I actually think that Heather and others praised her too much. But oh well, maybe this is still just her start.Apart from the above, I actually also noticed how Lily, who's supposed to be the leader, was always just a leader in name and has never really acted as one in this season. Lmao. Hope to see more of the girls in the next season. that they provided more information and screen time this time to Annete, Monika and Thea (though this also meant less screen time for others).

And with one more season of the anime to prove its worth, does Part 2 a.k.a Season 2, finally justify what its prequel season set...out to be? In many ways, it\'s definitely a redemption arc for the anime adaptation, though still a far cry from being like its great source material.TL;DR, just in case you missed reading my review back in Winter, the other Lamplight girls who get the spotlight this time that were missed in Season 1:- Monika, codename: Glint. The most talented of Lamplight, being able to think on her two feet of last-minute decisions.- Thea, codename: Dreamspeaker. The oldest and most attractive member of Lamplight, she is good with negotiations.- Annette, codename: Forgetter. The one who is good with engineering, her becoming a spy is just natural progression thanks to her special skills.Otherwise, there is just nothing that is significantly new to add to the sequel, other than acting out the part of truly being James Bond\'s Mission Impossible, where the Lamplight spy girls and Inferno\'s head honcho Klaus head out to big lands to conduct their spy sortie shenanigans against other prominent spy groups that risks their reputation and lives on the line. The other girls (a la Lily, Grete, Sybilla, Sara and Erna) already featured in Season 1 get better as time passes, and so do Monika, Thea, and Annette, showcasing their reasons of wanting to become spies. I felt that the compromise of ""show, don\'t tell"" works well in the sequel for being adequately paced, though the prequel had the train of thought from director Keiichiro Kawaguchi to cram as much content as possible should there be the off chance that the Winter show was the only one they would get, which does a major disservice to the LN either way.With nonoc\'s 2nd OP song, I pretty much liked the 1st OP song just because it made sense and was a good fit for the show, and that goes the same for sajou no hana\'s sequel ED song, to which I preferred Konomi Suzuki\'s prequel ED song. But it\'s not like either song really piqued my interest for the ""I Spy"" tunes.

It did many mistakes - messing up everywhere from a too fast pace to seemingly screening the episodes in the wrong order. It\'s mystery wasn\'t thrilling and the cast was far too big to give proper development to the individuals.So it\'s hardly a suprise the expectations for the second season weren\'t exactly high.The story of this season just continues where Season 1 left off. With Grete, Lilly, Sara and Sibylla getting the spotlight in the last arc of Season 1, Season 2 starts with a story around Anette, Thea, Monika and Erna.After they...successfully completed their mission, they take a few days off, but their vacation is cut short by a fateful encounter. This encounter forces the girls to make some very difficult decisions, and shows them the true reality of their life as a spy. All without their teacher giving advise and protecting them from harm.This arc does a great job in giving Anette, Thea and especially Monika some much needed development and growth. And at the same time, it tells a great and exciting story with a lot of twists, mystery and action. Something both Arcs of the first season didn\'t manage to do.After the first excitement follow three filler episodes, just like in season 1. They focus on Monika, Thea and Anette and work well to satisfy the interest gained in the characters from the previous arc. Monika gets mostly backstory, Thea\'s story focuses on her values and inner conflict and Anette\'s goes deeper into explaining the ""method in her madness"". They also manage to hit with the comedy where Season 1\'s fillers missed.The final arc rounds up the first ""act"" of Spy Classroom, connecting the dots of the first 3 stories told. It does a great job of highlighting each of the girls and how much they\'ve grown, both individually and as a team. But the main focus is on Thea, Klaus and their backstory with the previous members of Lamplight.This arc once again suffered from slightly high pacing, but unlike the first season\'s arcs, it\'s no problem to follow the plot and enjoy it. And it did a great job in finishing the season(s).Last episode is Lilly\'s filler - a funny comedy episode. But that\'s only half of it, as the other half is about Thea processing the previous arc. It finishes with a nice bridge between the two halfs anf finally a tease of what would be next in a potential 3rd Season.In conclusion: The second season of Spy Classroom is nothing like the first. It fixes all the major problems and finally makes use of the great potential this show\'s characters and world-building have.If you cared about the first season enough to look up reviews for the second - go watch it.

Tenchi Muyou! GXP,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1133/Tenchi_Muyou_GXP,"[""**This review contains spoilers**I recently bought the DVD pack for this and I can't tell you how glad I a'm to be done with this.Tenchi Muyo! GXP isn't very different from the other side stories, but I can tell you point blank that the English Dub sucks and I know it usually does for most shows. The story line for this side story is really just awful. The main character is extremely dense to the point it made me frustrated.I loved the other Tenchi shows, they had great use of harem, the English dub wasn't bad, the characters felt unique, the shows felt romantic yet...had lots of action.GXP really just takes all of that reputation and just trashes it. It had lots of action sure, but the romance just simply wasn't there. The harem felt overdone and the ending plot isn't to have the main character choose his love, but rather  he ends up marrying all of them. It felt like such a cheap shot to a fan like me.~Story 5/10~The story starts out like almost every other anime does. A dense teenage boy  happens to come across a cute chick and ends up joining an academy of some sorts and in this case it was the Galaxy Police. And in his training he will befriend many people (most of them girls) and will fight pirates on an almost daily basis by exploiting Seyna's incredible bad luck. But when he isn't fighting for his life he has lots of fun watching the girls he befriends and gets bloody noses almost every episode.~Art 6/10~The Art was not unique, but there were some aspects that did feel unique in the sense of having Angels as giant space-ships. I love that part because mecha's are usually pretty ugly.~Sounds 5/10~Well, I only had the opportunity to have the English Dub, and the sound was just deplorable. The music was okay, but did not catch my attention and the use of sound effects throughout the show weren't very good. The sound effects alone make me have to give this a mediocre score.~Character 6/10~Well, the characters are not unique and as you may see at the end of the show, the same character traits are used for more than one person. You'll end up seeing double. The characters are your usual harem types: shy and proper, the athletic and daring, the nerdy temptress, the space pirate that ends up being a princess, and the short smart loli character.I liked the original characters because they felt very unique. After 2 seasons, GXP really made me feel like the Tenchi Muyo! series was way over done.~Enjoyment 6/10~I did enjoy some aspects of the show. The first episode is off-putting because it's just so incredibly stupid, but for a while after that (for about 15 episodes), things seemed to be good, but at the end of the series, I felt like it was a chore having to finish the show.Overall, I give this series a 7/10. It did not meet my expectations and surely didn't even come close to it's predecessors. had lots of action.GXP really just takes all of that reputation and just trashes it.

The focus was changed from Tenchi Misaki and Earth to a new character and outer space. The problems were different and instead of the cast simply staying in a house until some new alien came to blow things up, here people were moving around and trying to do their job. The premise is definitely one that could work. The problem is the execution.The main character, Seina Yamadal, doesn't show much in the way of character and frankly really isn't that different from any other harem anime protagonist.

GxP however, takes a step away from that.  Directed by the frequently manic Watanabe Shinichi (aka Nabeshin, aka the guy who dropped Excel Saga and Puni Puni Poemi upon an unsuspecting world) the maestro himself jumps from plot-point to plot-point with reckless abandon.  While obviously having some respect for the original material, he takes...liberty with the original canon when it suits him and creates the giant continuity cluster$#@! that was the 3rd OVA (and the scramble to fit it in with the original plot).  The series takes a different slant from the other series in that it's got a lot more slapstick, and it's more risque in many places.I will say that the crossover attempts and the AWFUL episode 17 (people at Funimation are going  to hell for the dubbing of that episode BTW) were weak and really not necessary.  The fact that this series came out before OVA 3 but referenced many parts of it, was also very disconcerting.Art: Nothing stood out.  Again, the artwork was heavily influenced by the director's style and his input is very clear.Sound: I liked the opening credits music.  But then all the Tenchi series have strong music.Character: Enter the main character,  Seina Yamada, the hopelessly cursed young man with legendary bad luck.  While dropping by to see his friend Tenchi (who's also related to his best friend...don't get me started on the first of many continuity snafus) he's present for a Mihoshi-style crash landing of a Galaxy Police shuttle.  The pilot, the sex object/mentor figure Amane, mistakenly things he's &quot;in-the-know&quot; to the wacky condition as Casa de Tenchi and hands him a recruitment brochure.Seina then finds himself in the GP.  I'm drifting into a synopsis, but work with me.The GP, and the Jurai royals, soon discover Seina's unique ability to draw space pirates in like moths to a flame and they quickly decide to make use of that fact.Seina is joined by the aforementioned Amane, model turned detective.  His crush from back on Earth joins them as well, Kiriko.  It's a mindbending rip of belief how Kiriko gets to GP HQ ahead of Seina, and if she was already aware of her royal status (yes, not even Tenchi knows that even his cousins on Earth get the royal treatment as well) what the heck she was doing on Earth before this point (reality bending, a Nabeshin special!)Others include Ryoko Balta, who disappointingly does not share any of the roguish charm of her namesake but is also horribly miscast as a polite, almost prissy space pirate.Then there is the child-like Neju, who true to anime stereotype, calls Seina &quot;big brother&quot; but is really 10,000 years old and also has designs on him.The one standout character is the &quot;Devil Princess of Jurai&quot; Lady Seito.  Her character is the one unique standout and plays very well in the 3rd OVA off of Washu.  The other characters are quickly forgettable, but Seito will remain as one of the franchise's more memorable characters.Enjoyment: This series was fun.  It didn't wow me, it didn't make me think.  It did give me headaches when they decided to screw with the established canon, but since it was continued in the 3rd OVA we have to assume that the Director and writers had some sort of blessing in this.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a raunchy slapstick comedy.  However, this series did lack the tenderness of the rest of the franchise and will doubtlessly turn off female fans. (I know this because the series is one of my wife's favorites).Overall: Watanabe Shinichi's unique take on the Tenchi world is refreshing and entertaining, especially after the semi-flop of Tenchi in Tokyo.  It's clearly in it's own little section of the universe and is certainly a different take on things.  The satire of the Galaxy Police (shown as vain and fashion obsessed) and the Jurai family (shown as a little kooky and not completely sane) is very fun given that one has seen other installments of the Tenchi franchise (namely the OVAs) liberty with the original canon when it suits him and creates the giant continuity cluster$#@! that was the 3rd OVA (and the scramble to fit it in with the original plot).

About a year ago I tackled the most popular of the Tenchi series, Tenchi Muyo Universe, which was a fun adventure with a likeable cast and some occasionally good humor and antics. It’s not a perfect show by any means but it’s still a lot of fun and has some enjoyable science fiction concepts.And it’s also a prevalent part of my childhood, which is a probably reason it’s so endearing and loveable for me.GXP came out in 2002 and has literally nothing to do with...Tenchi, instead focusing on a character named Seina (AKA Not-Tenchi) who is recruited into the Galaxy Police. From there the typical hijinks ensue as he’s surrounded by a harem of women who all want his crotch, he faces off against bad guys, and everyone fights over him.The series starts pretty strong and funny, building Seina to be a guy with terrible luck (which works for the Galaxy Police since it means he’s always running into pirates) and giving us a group of likeable girls to be his companions. But as the show progresses it flat lines in every department.One of the reasons I think Tenchi worked was the lovable cast. Tenchi as our hero was likeable, Ryoko and Ayeka’s constant bickering and fighting led to good moments of comedy. The cast was diverse and interesting and it wasn’t so much about the dynamics of the harem as much as the dynamics of the individual characters that kept us watching. The characters were interesting and it was hard to choose a favorite.GXP forgoes that though. While initially I found the characters to be slightly different, none took on personalities of their own through the course of the series. It’s like their basic attributes were taken into account but not so much any development. Amane is the daughter of a fashion mogul and a model. She likes Seina. Kiriko’s Seina’s childhood friend who randomly is part of the GP. She likes Seina. Ryoko is a pirate who turns straight and likes Seina. There’s a loli named Neju whose two thousand years old and likes Seina.That’s about the only character trait they have too. They like Seina. Usually I can discuss characters in an anime on a level that’s a little deeper but I can’t say I can here. Even Seina himself is not interesting in the least. He has bad luck…and that’s about it. The bad guy is boring; the side characters are all pretty weak with the exception of Kamiki Jurai whose manipulative nature is enjoyable.Even the story is pretty lame, and the little bit there is means a lot of padding takes place, none of it well done. The show shines when all the characters are in a formal setting and bickering but for the most part the women work together and no humor is made from their differences. If there had been a focus on that, the show would have been much more comedic. Instead the humor comes from sexual jokes that, while occasionally funny, shouldn’t be the only chuckle I get.There are some good instances of humor in the facial expressions though, which I found completely hilarious. While the animation isn’t very good, there are still some wonderfully devious or evil faces that illicit a good laugh here and there.But all that said, this is a very underwhelming show. When it involves Tenchi and shows us our favorite characters, I kept wondering why I wasn’t just watching Tenchi Muyo proper. There’s a whole episode dedicated to Seina returning to Earth and hanging with Tenchi and the gang and we see that hilarious interaction between Ayeka and Ryoko that made Universe and the OVA’s so funny. It’s kind of sad they even included that episode because, while connecting the story to the previously established one, it also leaves us begging for more of what we’ve come to love from the series.GXP has good intentions and helps expand the universe of Tenchi, but it also isn’t very good. Even newcomers will find a lack of anything worthwhile in the twenty-six episodes. It’s a show yearning for the glory of the previous series, but never quite reaching those heights.Fans of the series might want to give this a go for the sake of fan service, others will be better off watching the OVA’s and Universe.

This anime has the same feeling as the newest tenchi spinoff Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, or as i should say isekai has the same feeling as gxp.  But i do remember that i did love this anime and would recommend it to any tenchi fans.Thank you.Ok, i finally got done re-watching this series and i must say it was great.  Although there were a couple fillers, it in general was quite funny.  The story...in my opinion was quite good, but it did get a little boring towards the end.  All in all i would give it a 9 because it was fun to watch and it kept my interest through out most of the series.  However if you do plan to watch this series the i recommend watching the other tenchi muyo series first because if you don't, it may be hard to figure out whats going on about half way through.  I do hope that you like the series and if you do then please try watching Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari as it is quite similar and in my opinion even alot better. in my opinion was quite good, but it did get a little boring towards the end.

This MC has made so many other MC's look like the luckiest people around based on all the crap that happens to this MC.

I like the show though it's a big mixed bag. It's way different from the original OVAs.The biggest problem is lack of consistency. Characters, character traits, and plotlines just come and go randomly. Like in the first half they hammer home that Seina is perpetually unlucky but after a while they hardly mention it, it doesn't come into play in later episodes. The show starts off with some ecchi shit but later drops it. Characters that Seina meets just disappear and only make a small handful of cameos later. There's also a lot of characters that are introduced so its hard to keep track...of em all.Like at some point they're attacked by pirates and Kiriko fuggin kills them in cold blood. There's blood spray on her face and it freaks Seina out cuz it's so out of character for her, but its never addressed. No consequences or plot relevancy, its just a thing that happens.Also the original OVA characters appear in like 1 episode. They get namedropped a few times throughout the show but like, the show is named after Tenchi but he only shows up twice or something. Shoulda called it Seina Muyo teeheeTLDR 2.0. The show is too long. If it was like 12 episodes with a tighter, more focused story then it would be lit. Cuz its pretty much just. Random stuff that happens. They don't even do much policing, just flying around space and shenanigans happen.

Terra Formars: Bugs 2-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22689/Terra_Formars__Bugs_2-hen,"['this OVA , independently of the manga wich i haven\'t read, and of the series that is said to come later,the art is okay, the animation is fine, being aware that this OVA is an introduction to a whole franchise, i\'ll only mention the things that can not possibly be fixed :the pace is stuttery, mixing moments of doubts with gratuitous reveals to try and explain plot elements or characters in a hurry, most of wich are incredibly cliché (hinting on a dystopian future with corrupted politics and perhaps even a caste system )  this might be only because of the OVA...nature of this episode, but still could certainly have been more subtle.The characters are apparently disposable, but not as brillantly done as in Attack on Titan wich makes sure the viewer gets familiar with them before doing horrible things to them, but more in the ""that\'l hopefullyl make people talk about it"" sense of random guro, wich feels like some kind of cheat to me, covering up the lack of plot, wich seems to fit in a single sentence judging from this single OVA:past the first encounter, there is no surprise, no cliffhanger, no new element introduced to the story, it all relies on it\'s own premice wich is "" mars has been terraformed through the use of moss and cockroaches, people we send there disapear shortly""  and all the episode is basically showing the many gruesome ways to make explorers disapear..my main issue tho, is on the solution to the explorer death issue, seemingly the whole concept of the series, is the ""surgery"" undertaken by the protagonists, allowing them to instantly grow insect parts upon injecting themselves some kind of chemical product....... and that\'s just not Science Fiction, in any realistic sense ever, that is Ben-10 Fantasy ! not only the idea that such body enhancement could be done, but moreover the idea that it should be sufficient to face an unknown menace, implying that such unknown menace had to be fought through close-combat....this is where it lost me, seeing year 2600 humans unable to think of anything else than this incredibly far-fetched solution is nothing but threatening my faith in humanity, present and future ..as a parody of an old  Z movie tho, that could work, so if that is what you\'re looking for, enjoy ! nature of this episode, but still could certainly have been more subtle.The characters are apparently disposable, but not as brillantly done as in Attack on Titan wich makes sure the viewer gets familiar with them before doing horrible things to them, but more in the ""that\'l hopefullyl make people talk about it"" sense of random guro, wich feels like some kind of cheat to me, covering up the lack of plot, wich seems to fit in a single sentence judging from this single OVA:past the first encounter, there is no surprise, no cliffhanger, no new element introduced to the story, it all relies on it\'s own premice wich is "" mars has been terraformed through the use of moss and cockroaches, people we send there disapear shortly""  and all the episode is basically showing the many gruesome ways to make explorers disapear..my main issue tho, is on the solution to the explorer death issue, seemingly the whole concept of the series, is the ""surgery"" undertaken by the protagonists, allowing them to instantly grow insect parts upon injecting themselves some kind of chemical product....... and that\'s just not Science Fiction, in any realistic sense ever, that is Ben-10 Fantasy ! not only the idea that such body enhancement could be done, but moreover the idea that it should be sufficient to face an unknown menace, implying that such unknown menace had to be fought through close-combat....this is where it lost me, seeing year 2600 humans unable to think of anything else than this incredibly far-fetched solution is nothing but threatening my faith in humanity, present and future ..as a parody of an old  Z movie tho, that could work, so if that is what you\'re looking for, enjoy !', ""Valiant heroes defend Mars from the deadliest species of invader pests. There are many losses on both sides. The heroes take their revenge and it is always satisfying to watch them tear the pest species apart. The overpopulated pest species abused the abilities of our heroes (against their will and best interests) and tasked them to terraforming a planet just so the selfish pest species could come back and take the planet for themselves and continue to spread their filth, diseases and eventually destroy yet another planet.Nothing beats a series where blattodea, a species relentlessly massacred by humans, turn the tables to flatten the real...pests: homo sapiens.

What makes this anime twice as great is the fact that it involves fantasy, drama and romance which really pulls you into the story. One of the good points of its story is that very often more and more new characters join the story and old characters may reveal secrets about themselves that were previously unkown.That is probably what pulls most watchers more and more into the show. The only thing i didnt like about the anime...was that the romance kind of comes later on so if your a romance kind of person you may have to wait a while before you get to that point. Other than anything else, just get away from it all, have fun and give it a shot try watching Ultra Maniac i am positive you will enjoy it. If you need a source to where to find it go to www.veoh.com it has the whole series subbed there. ^_^ enjoy! was that the romance kind of comes later on so if your a romance kind of person you may have to wait a while before you get to that point.

Or if not that, ever heard of a previously popular show called Marmalade Boy? Yoshizumi, real name Mariko Nakai, created that. Marmalade Boy was a pretty popular shoujo anime and manga around the late nineties and early 2000s, but that's not the only thing they made. In 2001, Yoshizumi published what would be her first fantasy/magical girl manga, Ultra Maniac, which was adapted into a TV anime two years later, which is the subject of today's review. It had been on my...radar, but I never got around to watching it due to other obligations and the Geneon DVDs going out of print. But in 2017, Discotek Media rescued the series, re-releasing it on DVD, and now it's officially streaming on sites like RetroCrush for free. Magical girl anime don't normally get uncut releases here in the US, much less even faithful English dubs, so this was a rarity. But by magical girl standards...as much as I hate to say it, Ultra Maniac isn't one of the better ones.On the outside, Ayu Tateishi seems like the coolest girl around. She's pretty, popular, smart, mature, and has a good head on her shoulders, but inside, she's actually rather awkward and really wants to ask out the coolest guy in school, Kaji. One day, she has a strange encounter with a mysterious but clumsy girl named Nina Sakura. It turns out, Nina is a witch from a magical kingdom sent to Earth on a mission to collect five holy stones, all of which are in the human world. But the problem is, Nina is utterly lousy at magic. Even so, the two of them wind up becoming friends and decide to help each other out. They have to deal with all sorts of mishaps, from one annoying kid constantly trying to find out Nina's secret, to Nina's callous rival Maya, who is not only better than her at magic in every way, but wants to get those holy stones at any cost. Ayu's life just became a little more magical.For anyone who's read my review for Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure, rememeber how I said on there that the main characters of that show were the weakest part of the series, with the side characters coming off as far more interesting and less obnoxious? Well, Ultra Maniac has the opposite problem. Ayu, the main character, isn't like most lead characters you'd find in shoujo manga, and she's actually the best character in the series. She's mature, intelligent, and has plenty of flaws but is competent enough to carry the series and grows as a person. Granted, she's not the most three-dimensional—and neither is anyone else—but she's definitely the kind of lead character that you want to root for and won't want to strangle. The other main characters...are rather bland. Nina is your typical klutzy but sweet magical girl who can never seem to do anything right, the two male characters, Kaji and Tsujiai, are really just there to be love interests and are about as bland as white toast. But the main quartet are an absolute blessing compared to the minor characters, because every single minor character, even random characters who only appear for one episode, are not only utterly abysmal, but annoying as hell!! Seriously, I have honestly never seen a show that actually goes out of its way to make every single minor character be as utterly annoying and rage-inducing as possible! Tsujiai's cat Shinnosuke, Luna, the three little kids from the magic world, Maya's butler Sebastian, Nina's grandfather, that Kawanakajima kid, dear lord! Most of them are just there to be violently possessive (Sebastian) or creepily clingy (Luna and Shinnosuke), and Nina's grandfather in particular completely ruins every scene he's in. He's such a raging asshat it's not even funny, and not only is he verbally abusive to Nina even when she improves her magic, he often goes out of his way to mess with her friends in ways that are downright criminal...and the show expects us to forgive him for it JUST because he was worried about Nina. As a result, many of his more heroic actions later in the series feel completely unearned. Ugh, bite me.But while everyone except the main characters is the worst thing about this series, it's unfortunately not the only problem holding the show back. Ultra Maniac as a show is mainly a slice-of-life magical girl series consisting of the girls encountering a problem and Nina trying to help with magic, with most of her solutions going wrong. This isn't necessarily a bad premise, as other shows I like have done similar premises, like Fancy Lala. But Ultra Maniac doesn't do anything new with it. A lot of the show consists of teenage angst revolving around trying to get with the guys, with only very few moments of brilliance here and there. There are times when the show tries to flesh out some of its ideas, like Nina being unfamiliar with how most human customs work due to being from another world, but they're never really expanded upon, and I feel like the show could really benefit from fleshing out the more fantastical parts of its premise and ditching the romance and teenaged angst. Plus, the animation and soundtrack are pretty typical of early 2000s fare, and are completely unmemorable in any way.So with all this, does Ultra Maniac have anything to offer that's actually good? Well, yes. For one, it's a fairly safe, kid friendly show that you can totally show your little sister, daughter, niece, or whoever else without feeling skeeved out. Secondly, like I mentioned before, the main cast of characters, while nothing noteworthy, are a fun little group to follow with good, light-hearted chemistry between one another. Thirdly, it does have little moments where it actually subverts a lot of cliches that it follows (Example: Girl sees her crush and another girl together, assumes they're in love and angsts about it, only in here, the show actually has the real situation explained to her, and the characters ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER about their issues rather than angsting about it or believing a misinformed third party!). Unfortunately, for me, these aren't enough to save the series from being utterly cliche, generic, shallow, and ultimately uninspired. Though from what I've heard, the anime diverges a lot from the manga, so for all I know, maybe the manga did the premise better. Who knows? I ought to check it out. That being said, I do admit to being a hypocrite and buying the DVD set for Ultra Maniac anyway, mainly because I want to support Discotek and because magical girl anime don't get a lot of love in the US, so I thought I'd give some support to the genre.All in all, it's just a cutesy slice-of-life magical girl anime, and nothing more. But if you want something better, I'd recommend stuff like Fancy Lala or Cardcaptor Sakura. radar, but I never got around to watching it due to other obligations and the Geneon DVDs going out of print.

She's mature, intelligent, and has plenty of flaws but is competent enough to carry the series and grows as a person. Granted, she's not the most three-dimensional—and neither is anyone else—but she's definitely the kind of lead character that you want to root for and won't want to strangle. The other main characters...are rather bland. Nina is your typical klutzy but sweet magical girl who can never seem to do anything right, the two male characters, Kaji and Tsujiai, are really just there to be love interests and are about as bland as white toast. But the main quartet are an absolute blessing compared to the minor characters, because every single minor character, even random characters who only appear for one episode, are not only utterly abysmal, but annoying as hell!! Seriously, I have honestly never seen a show that actually goes out of its way to make every single minor character be as utterly annoying and rage-inducing as possible! Tsujiai's cat Shinnosuke, Luna, the three little kids from the magic world, Maya's butler Sebastian, Nina's grandfather, that Kawanakajima kid, dear lord! Most of them are just there to be violently possessive (Sebastian) or creepily clingy (Luna and Shinnosuke), and Nina's grandfather in particular completely ruins every scene he's in. He's such a raging asshat it's not even funny, and not only is he verbally abusive to Nina even when she improves her magic, he often goes out of his way to mess with her friends in ways that are downright criminal...and the show expects us to forgive him for it JUST because he was worried about Nina. As a result, many of his more heroic actions later in the series feel completely unearned. Ugh, bite me.But while everyone except the main characters is the worst thing about this series, it's unfortunately not the only problem holding the show back. Ultra Maniac as a show is mainly a slice-of-life magical girl series consisting of the girls encountering a problem and Nina trying to help with magic, with most of her solutions going wrong. This isn't necessarily a bad premise, as other shows I like have done similar premises, like Fancy Lala. But Ultra Maniac doesn't do anything new with it. A lot of the show consists of teenage angst revolving around trying to get with the guys, with only very few moments of brilliance here and there. There are times when the show tries to flesh out some of its ideas, like Nina being unfamiliar with how most human customs work due to being from another world, but they're never really expanded upon, and I feel like the show could really benefit from fleshing out the more fantastical parts of its premise and ditching the romance and teenaged angst. Plus, the animation and soundtrack are pretty typical of early 2000s fare, and are completely unmemorable in any way.So with all this, does Ultra Maniac have anything to offer that's actually good? Well, yes. For one, it's a fairly safe, kid friendly show that you can totally show your little sister, daughter, niece, or whoever else without feeling skeeved out. Secondly, like I mentioned before, the main cast of characters, while nothing noteworthy, are a fun little group to follow with good, light-hearted chemistry between one another. Thirdly, it does have little moments where it actually subverts a lot of cliches that it follows (Example: Girl sees her crush and another girl together, assumes they're in love and angsts about it, only in here, the show actually has the real situation explained to her, and the characters ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER about their issues rather than angsting about it or believing a misinformed third party!). Unfortunately, for me, these aren't enough to save the series from being utterly cliche, generic, shallow, and ultimately uninspired. Though from what I've heard, the anime diverges a lot from the manga, so for all I know, maybe the manga did the premise better. Who knows? I ought to check it out. That being said, I do admit to being a hypocrite and buying the DVD set for Ultra Maniac anyway, mainly because I want to support Discotek and because magical girl anime don't get a lot of love in the US, so I thought I'd give some support to the genre.All in all, it's just a cutesy slice-of-life magical girl anime, and nothing more. But if you want something better, I'd recommend stuff like Fancy Lala or Cardcaptor Sakura."", 'Ultra maniac is a rare kind of anime. An anime that\'s so bad it\'s funny. It fails in every category, but it fails in such a hilarious way that it\'s just so much fun to hate.Story 1/10The most obvious problem with this anime is it has a really unoriginal premise. Seriously, I can name at least a dozen TV shows (not just anime) where it\'s just another fish out of water story that has a main character whose a witch (or an alien, a robot, a goddess, a vampire, etc.) whose going to a school for humans and has to adjust to her new...surroundings.Of course, even if your story has an unoriginal premise that doesn\'t necessarily mean the story as a whole is awful. A good example is Kiki\'s Delivery Service which is also about a witch moving to a new home. However, while Kiki tells the basic fish out of water story, it tells it in an interesting way with great characters and beautiful animation. Ultra Maniac has none of those qualities and instead relies on overused cliches and tropes.Every episode is just so predictable. For example, there\'s an episode where Maya creates a potion to make things shrink, but instead the opposite happens and it makes things bigger. Wow, who could\'ve seen that coming (rolls eyes).Another problem is that the show\'s world building is convoluted and makes no sense. For example, in order for Nina to do magic she first has to transform, then search on her personal computer for what kind of spell she wants, then she has to plug a cord from her computer into a magic box, then she has to put a random object inside the box, then she has to type the spell into her computer, then she has to say ""practice"", and then the spell happens.From a writer\'s perspective, wouldn\'t it save like ten steps to just give Nina a magic wand like every other witch in popular culture? Oh, no wait, a magic wand is too old fashioned as Nina explains to Ayu.Another problem with the world building is that witches and wizards seem to have this godlike power to just make matter materialize from nothing. For example, we see characters several times just wave their finger in the air and make something like a four course meal with a set table appear from nothing.That raises so many questions. Can witches just make literally anything out of nothing?!Art 2/10The character animation looks stiff with not a lot of movement or detail and the effects animation is even worse. Whenever a character does magic they just use the exact same animation every time which is just white sparkles covering the screen.I don\'t like the character designs much either. Nina\'s witch outfit just looks boring and isn\'t cute or eye catching at all.Character 2/10Every single character has a one note personality and doesn\'t go through any sort of development.One things that confuses me about these characters is why are Nina and Ayu even friends? Seriously, all Nina does is cause trouble and make things worse for Ayu. I know everybody makes mistakes and nobodies perfect, but there\'s a limit as to how many times you can forgive a person before you just have to cut your losses.Another thing I don\'t understand is the character\'s motivations; why is Ayu in love with Kaji? There is nothing interesting or unique about him yet Ayu thinks he\'s this embodiment of perfection.Some characters I did actually like, however, were Sebastian and Luna. Unfortunately, for some strange reason, they only appear in one episode each.Overall 8/10Ultra Maniac is a train wreck of an anime that is full of one note characters, cheap animation, unappealing character designs, and an unoriginal story. I absolutely love to hate this anime. surroundings.Of course, even if your story has an unoriginal premise that doesn\'t necessarily mean the story as a whole is awful.

I absolutely love to hate this anime.', ""If you're a fan of 2000s slice of life, this is definitely a good watch. Ultra maniac sets itself apart from other shoujo anime (especially at the time) by having the protagonist, Ayu, be smarter and a bit more realistic than the average shoujo protag. It really makes you root for her and her friends. The animal companions in this are realy cute, too (especially rio! but maybe im biased towards cat boys)This series has some really funny moments too, and it never drags out the conflict. The best thing is that the characters ACTUALLY communicate and solve their problems!1. Characters: As said, Ayu...is a GREAT protagonist. Nina is a good character too, she's clumsy but not overly annoying and her friendship with Ayu can be truly heartwarming at times. The two main boys, Kaji and Tsujiai, are genuinely likeable and not completely one-dimentional or straight up mean like a lot of shoujo love interests. Watching their relationships develop is fun, well-paced and feels realistic. However, the supporting characters... are annoying. You could skip Luna and Shinnosuke's episodes and be fine. Nina's grandpa is also unreasonably mean to her. Because of that, i'll give it an 8/10.2. Art & Animation: I wish i could rate it higher, but sadly it's a bit wonky sometimes and it could totally be better. The promo art looks miles better than the anime. To give Ultra maniac a bit of credit, it's from a studio that's not really well-known and from quite some years ago. Perhaps a 6/10.3. Soundtrack: The background music fits well with the scenes, and it's nothing to complain about. The op and ed however? big dissapointment. The singing is out of tune and the opening itself is nothing too special. It's fun but the out of tune singing ruins it soooo much T_T i skipped it every time. The ending is plain boring. 3/10. It doesn't ruin the experience, though. I'd rate the anime higher if it had more enjoyable songs...4. Story: Nothing original, really, but i feel like it's executed nicely. Except for things like when Nina or Maya have to transform, which i feel is too long and could be better. Also, i wish they went more in-depth about the whole princess situation. 5/10Conclusion: It's a cutesy 2000s slice of life with magical girls (and boys) that might have some wonky aspects but it's well paced, doesn't feel rushed at all, and has amazing characters.

Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19117/Toaru_Hikuushi_e_no_Koiuta,"['The skies is a vast and mysterious place. It’s unlimited and holds infinite potential for sky pirates and aviators of war. For a young pilot named Kal-el Albus, he’s looking for more than just flying the skies. He’s looking for revenge for the harsh life that he’s endured during a time period known as the ‘Wind Revolution’. But now as a young man, he embarks on a journey along with his sister Ariel to discover more than just riding the winds.Taking place in the same world as the movie Toaru Hikushi E No Tsuioku, this show holds little similarity besides its initial setting. In other...words, it’s not a necessity to watch the film to understand or gain pleasure from this series. Yet, they do hold a similarity based on a concept – the reality of war. Because with war, there’s countless casualties, misunderstandings, and death that breeds hatred. Kal-el knows that from experience when he was just a kid. From a biographical viewpoint, it’s almost too harsh for a reality to sink it all in. Yet for him, he holds onto his promise to never forgive or forget.Coming into this series will feel like an adventure at first. The setting has a steam punk-esque that illustrates itself with the usage of its vehicles. But by standards, they are powered by hydrogen and fuel rather than some super tech gadget that you would find in mecha theme series. There’s also battleships too and other weaponry designed for warfare. For what’s worth, we quickly find out that there are nations at war and our main characters gets caught up in the middle of it. More than that is the mystery regarding a phenomenon known as the ‘End of the Sky’. It raises many flags for questions relating to its secret, the truth behind the conflicts, and our curiosity of how all this ties together with the main characters.Speaking of characters, this series spends a good majority of its time to let viewers to get know them. In particular, Kal-el is one that stands out more than just besides his name. Despite having a similar name to the man of steel Superman along with the skill to fly, Kal-el is far from invulnerable. We do get a sense of justice from him but sometimes, his pride and arrogance gets the best of him. In essence, he still has a lot more to learn of the world and himself. His new position as a cadet allows him to discover potential and the truth. Yet on many occasions, Kal-el finds himself in trouble with his life in danger and realizing his own insecurities. This doesn’t just solely fall with his hands but connects with other characters such as Claire Cruz. The duo shares a rather peculiar relationship that ranges from respect, friendship, and romance. Yet, it’s easy to tell that their love story is one that is set to self-destruct. For more than just tragic reasons, their relationship also holds deep secrets and hidden truths that Kal-el held scars for his whole life. Strictly speaking, a romance during a time of war is never a fantastic idea. Whether their feelings blooms or decays is like a flower that does not last forever.But of course, no one’s immortal in this show either. No one lives forever and war brings that truth to its finest. Throughout the series, characters faces the reality of war. Namely the Sky Clan, the unit that most of the main and supporting characters are enlisted in, experiences firsthand why there is grief and despair when sent to the line of battle. There is no salvation in the line of duty. Whether killing others for survival or nationalism, there’s one thing the cadets all needs to know and that’s for fighting for what’s right. For most of characters, no one is safe despite their various reasons for entering in the war. The series doesn’t neglect to spare characters from certain death. This may catch some viewers in surprise as several major supporting characters meets their doom as result of fighting. But at the same time, this should bring about reality – that war is never without a price.Theoretically speaking, there are several ways the series demonstrates its feelings through its course. The most obvious one is romance between Claire and Kal-El. It’s very different compared to the classic Clark Kent/Lois Lane from the Superman franchise. Rather, it feels rushed and sometimes lifeless because our main characters lacks compatibility. Young people fall in love yet their story has tragic holes in it by dark revelations and startling discoveries. Yet, the show doesn’t stop at that point with the romantic aspect as it expands to some of our supporting characters. Unfortunately, the show doesn’t handle its romance aspect in a manner deemed as everlasting. It doesn’t just matter with the class levels or relationship development. Rather, it comes off as an average love story based on mutual attraction and predictability; as in the traditional fan ships. The only part is that some ships are bound to sink, not in the way of the ‘friend zone’ but more as into heaven. However, it does bring back its point to illustrate the reality of warfare as love isn’t met to last during such crisis.On the other hand, the appealing parental and sibling love between characters is one that we should smile upon. Kal-El has a family and even though not related by blood, they treat him with respect, dignity, and care. In many ways, it feels like they love him as their own child. Similarly, Kal-El and Ariel shares a close relationship despite their constant bickering. A prominent evidence comes from their time spent in the air. On one instance, Kal-El experiences a brink of despair similar to one in his past. Looking back now, this show’s relationship shines stronger when it focuses on commitment as opposed to becoming a couple by love.At the same time, we get a tense feeling of vengeance coming from not only Kal-El but also a young boy named Ignacio Axis. With silver hair, a cold stare, and stoic personality, Ignacio is the classic lone wolf. We learn through flashbacks with his circumstances and motivations why he became the person as he is today. In a way, there’s a similarity between Kal-El and Ignacio based on their quest for revenge. They are driven by vengeance and their desire to achieve justice by their own standards. Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta (The Pilot’s Love Song) set these standards and attempts to give viewers a chance to see how they are resolved. In the end, their resolutions and ideas might be different from what the audience have in mind. I think by this show’s standards, it isn’t presented as a didactic story but rather for how chains of reactions leads to certain outcomes. Unfortunately, these outcomes are ambiguous and feels rushed with a lack of depth.Because nations are at war, expect plenty of action both on land and in the air. The dogfights are coordinated with credible effort. From minute one, the show demonstrates that it can handle its exposition of war in fluid way. The dogfights are rapid with bullets raining from the sky but not in mindless action. Rather than just a full throttle spraying of bullets, we also get strategic movements, heroic sacrifices, and what it truly is like being a pilot. Similarly on land, there’s bloodshed and violence as action-oriented episodes presents every effort to demonstrate its cruel reality.Even with a credible story however comes with that prevents this series from shining. For one thing, the story itself is predictable with cliches and a blend romance based on mutual attraction. Certain revelations and discoveries are presented in a quick fashion and anticlimactic despite its initial built-up. Although some of its flashback scenes paints a realistic format of cruel life, there’s little strength in their actual present stories. Main characters’ development suffers as result along with supporting characters including some which held potential development but seemingly tossed out of the show for good. There’s also a bit of disappointment relating to its setting. In essence, the setting the show takes place in embellishes itself with fantastic features for potential world building. Yet, the majority of the show chooses to focus on its character relationships and state of affairs with its main story. In retrospect, there’s a lack of depth in exploring what’s behind the scenes. Even some of the initial mysteries are pinned down when compared to our main characters’ thirst for revenge.Artistic wise, the show demonstrates a high degree of fantastical features. It presents lush backgrounds with aesthetic designs with its aircrafts. Some of them holds a similar degree with historical vehicles while others (such as battleships) creates a feeling of intellectual depth. Some scenes also gives off a feeling of tranquility and almost a dream-like atmosphere such as romantic moments. The flashbacks also illustrates to show, rather than tell the audience of what our main characters has gone through during their childhood with a black and white world quality. Character design also makes sense on most parts although some characters’ ages doesn’t match their appearance. Luckily, the show omits fan service even with the adaption of the classic beach episode; for training purposes of course!A fantasy series would also require a stellar soundtrack to match its high caliber degree of action. Luckily, it is consistent in terms of coordination. Dogfights in the air matches well with every movement with adamant integrity. The OST also demonstrates both an ethereal and vigorous way of presenting certain scenes to match the mood. On the other hand, some of the characters’ voices can be exasperating to the ears. Really, how long can you listen to Kal-El scream in agony at whatever he has trouble on mind? Or otherwise, Claire examining her own insecurities? It will take some time to get over their mannerisms. Luckily, the OP and ED song might be just what you need for their quality and delicacy.Hatred, fear, oppression, revenge, love, regret. Those are just a few of qualities coming from war that the show brings together. Yet, there is some peace at mind with characters that demonstrates their heroism in the line of duty. This show focuses on aspects of that through human dynamics. The romance coming out of this show will come out as cliché by the classic ‘love at first sight’ circumstance. However, the parental/sibling bond is a strength that is hard to overlook. With impressive action sequences and a fantastic setting, expect warfare to come as reality painted by grim truths.

Watching this show in the end will feel like taking a journey to a world, one which holds feelings in a fictional realm.', 'Just by looking at the title (Love Song of a Pilot), the description, and a preview, most people will get the impression that this is a heavy-hitting drama with a beautiful romance augmented by plenty of flying through the skies. I’m pretty sure that description up there also suggests Toaru Hikuushi no Koiuta will cover touching themes as well, such as how hate can be conquered by finding love. The setup is fairly enticing. You’re probably thinking this is a story that will hit your heart.Lower your expectations, NOW. Trash the images my first paragraph produced. Reduce the dramatic impact you are expecting by about...50% and lower the charm of the romance you are picturing by about 80%. And were you expecting quirky, vibrant, enjoyable, and interesting characters that you could feel attached to? You are only kidding yourself. With all of the proper cuts applied and high expectations moved to the side, you have what Toaru Hikushii no Koiuta really is: an average drama story that had all the right tools to be excellent.Story (5)\tCharacters (5)What is a drama’s primary responsibility? To make you cry and feel emotion, that’s what. How does Toaru Hikushi no Koiuta accomplish this? Well, I can say that the method it uses is one I find to be obnoxious: It spends six episodes focusing on a handful of uninteresting cadet characters goofing around until finally, by episode 7 or 8, it decides to start chopping off some heads. In other words, by the second half, war breaks out and about fifty percent of the characters die. Essentially the whole first half of goofing around is designed with the purpose of placing weight on the characters’ impending deaths, however this was accomplished fairly poorly due to the fact that the characters were so uninteresting that it was just unspectacular to see them dick off, cook food, and constantly mock each other. However, most of the characters do establish romantic ties (although very light ones) with each other. And although it seems like a cheap half-assed effort to throw some easy emotional weight onto some of these guys, the minor romances might just give you enough of a reason to care for the characters.That’s basically it. The story brings up a handful of characters, kills a couple of them in battle, and makes an effort to hoard your sympathies by showing the survivors crying all over the place and mourning over their lost love ones. There’s nothing particularly excellent or enlightening about this story, its characters, or its emotion. It’s really just the typical second-class drama.And where does the romance fit into all of this? Well, lucky for you romance fans, the first episode jumps right into it, and it is perhaps the only episode where you will get a look at some genuinely heartwarming moments between Kalel and Clair. You think it’s going to continue to be this sweet? No way. The romance just… I don’t know the words… loses its gas I guess? Kalel and Clair just begin to seem too close and too familiar with each other. The romance would have been more effective had Clair been more aloof like she was portrayed as in the first episode, and Kalel would have to work harder to get her. You think the anime would have gone that way considering how it underscores the class difference that separates these two lovers. There were just far too few genuinely charming moments between the two. Even a plot twist that could have brought this romantic relationship to a crazier level was not taken full advantage of.Aside from all of these things, there are a few other elements to the story that aren’t necessarily important. If you hear any of this “holy spring” or “end of the sky” sh*t and can’t figure out what the hell any of it means, don’t stress over it. Understanding those concepts will do nothing to better your experience with this anime.Enjoyment (6)If you cry as easily as Ari (the redhead) does, this drama story might work for you. If you’re like me and are more on the insensitive side, this story will be a waste of time. The story, overall, turned out to be a LOT weaker than I expected. I had the willpower to finish this series only because I kept on expecting for something brilliant to suddenly happen. That’s because this anime’s themes and concepts WERE capable of brilliance.

The show starts with a relatively easygoing feeling, but gets much more serious by the halfway point and remains so until the end.The main theme that this series focuses on is the reality of war, which includes the concepts of overcoming fear, accepting loss and the importance of forgiveness through love. There is a fairly decent-sized cast of side characters without being too overwhelming, and there are several romantic interests among them which helps to keep your interest even if...you're not super into the main relationship. Though their primary purpose is generally to further the drama, the action scenes are quite well-done and do a good job of making you feel like the characters are truly in danger.On the negative, the story, at times, is a little confusing and the pacing feels a little off. Given that this is a short series at only 13 episodes, there was perhaps a little too much time spent both on the initial ramping-up to the main conflict and on the denouement after the main conflict.There are also times you may find yourself questioning the decisions of the characters, or exactly what their motivations are, and, while that is often a good thing to some extent in storytelling, I felt that there could have been a little more gradual hinting given to the watcher so that some things didn't seem quite as sudden when they were revealed. Having said that, most things are tied up by the end, though it may leave some people feeling a little unfulfilled.In summary, if you're the type of person who focuses a lot on logic, consistency and smooth storytelling, this series may not be for you. On the other hand, if you are more about the character relationships and the drama, while being able to suspend your disbelief regarding some inconsistencies or unexplained phenomenon, you will probably enjoy this show like I did. you're not super into the main relationship.

Set in a fantasy-esque setting, the show tries to produce images like the ""holy spring"" or the ""end of the sky"". The story starts out with a day-to-day pilot school setting but later shifts to a battlefront setting.Almost immediately, the show attempts to dive into the romantic zone. It tries to go for the classic ""love at first sight"" complete with romantic scenery and music instead of a gradual development between the...two main love interests. If you\'re into romanticized scenes such as a ""couple moment"" where the girl is ""flying"" through the air with her arms spread wide from the backseat of a bike in a titanic-like image, then the beginning of this story may be a good watch for you. However, be warned that there will never be full conclusion where the two ride into the romantic sunset hand in hand and live happily ever after. Anyhow, the characters Kal-el and Claire quickly become infatuated with each other. Kal-el gets obsessive whenever he thinks about her. Conveniently enough throughout the story, they become stranded alone with each other in various scenarios for dramatic effect. As for the other students in their class, most of them come in convenient parings, though not all these love stories will end happily, or the way that most people would want them to.The pasts of the main characters in the story are revealed through long flashbacks instead of current events. I rather liked the background stories for the four main characters. Each of their back-stories are fairly well developed and it becomes evident why each of them behaves the way that they do. Unfortunately, none of these characters ever get a chance to fully understand one another.The main character, Kal-el Albus, is the former crown prince of the Ballesteros Empire; his family was removed from power during a time of revolution.  A major theme in the story revolves around Kal-el\'s hate for the public figure called Nina Viento. Even though he was taken in and loved by a warm and welcoming new family, he still desires revenge on the girl that took everything away from him. A point that the show tries to get across is the importance of forgiveness. People seem to be pretty forgiving here in the face of love.As mentioned before, the story goes from happy training/school days scenes to a full blown ""war"" against the fabled sky clan. There is an immediate change in pace and the remainder of the story comes out a bit rushed. The aerial fights weren\'t bad to observe, however, some flying angles got a little dizzy to look at. If you have a slight motion sickness like I do, you might feel a bit of a headache going through some of those scenes. Still, it certainly is a treat for those who have a love for airplanes and/or the Air Force. During the ""war"", the story tries really hard to bring out the feels. The amount of emotion that you feel during those scenes depends on how easily you get emotional over the deaths of minor characters. But for some of the deaths, the death flags were raised high up in the air and waved around in circles. I imagine it\'d be a pretty terrifying experience watching your friends and classmates dying all around you. Just picture the raw fear that the characters would experience. Whether or not some of the deaths were ""uncalled"" for, we get a good glimpse at the devastating reality of war. There is an emphasis on ""guts"" and the ""courage"" to sacrifice yourself for other people\'s sake. In the end, the ones who experience the most pain are the ones who are left behind. In this story the military also gives out purple heart-like badges to the families of the deceased. It\'s all the military can really do for the families out of gratitude, but no gesture can truly express the emotions felt on both sides.It\'s a bit of a head-scratcher how they were so willing to send students off into actual battle in that condition. The least they can do is supply them with actual planes instead of the training planes they had to use. Those planes didn\'t even have covers, so casualties became almost inevitable. Why did they venture into enemy territory with so many students in the first place?It can be noted that in this world, there is a literal end to the sky. The whole reason behind all the sacrifices was to complete their expedition to the end of the sky, watch their floating island get destroyed.... have an adventure... take some pictures... maybe eat a snack after... Their motives for the entire trip becomes pretty questionable given the high casualty rate.In the end there are still many questions that are left unanswered. The ""legendary sky clan is still shrouded in mystery even though we get to sneak a glance at their technologically advanced city. The Holy Levamme  Empire is only portrayed as ""mysterious allies"" with an ambiguous reference to a silver fox plane. There is a possibility that it is directly tied with the novelist\'s other pilot novel. We are also never told the reason behind Nina Viento\'s temporary loss of power, whether it was because she was emotionally unstable or that it was only for the sake of drama.Many of the events came off feeling predictable. Some of the characters seem to just disappear. For example, what happened to Wolfgang\'s partner who always called him ""aniki""?  What happened to rest of the course 1 students besides Fausto? Either they all mysteriously died after the fighting, I missed something important, or they are apparently so insignificant they don\'t even get mentioned in the slightest. There were scenes where characters die off so quickly it leaves you mentally unprepared. Instead of crying or feeling sorrow, you would just think ""Wait a second, did that person really just die? Rip...."" The main characters in contrary are shrouded in plot armor and conveniently escape and live. The different situations where Kal-el could have died were above and beyond. There were many other things that just went by unexplained such as a one-time mention of a notion to overthrow the revolutionary government towards the end. Oh well, it\'s up to you to imagine what that will lead to I guess..?The soundtrack throughout the show was good. Right of the bat, some ""grand"" themed ost plays as the characters leave for the floating island of Isla. I rather liked the Op song. It was nice to listen to. The art was decent but the animation wasn\'t always consistent. As a side note, I can\'t say that I\'m a fan of the computer art designed plane base.The ending felt okay for me. There is a lack of a conclusive ending, but as with a lot of the rest of the story, that is up to your own interpretation. The plot for most part is pretty straightforward, and while the show was enjoyable at times, there were other times where I would tilt my head and wonder if the show couldn\'t have used its potential a little better.My Score: 6/10        Decent two main love interests.

Ok, so the plot specs was a bit too cheesy of sorts and often wasn\'t very clear as to why certain country of sort put a group of people in a flying island that seems to defy the laws of physics only to have it sacrifice to the so called ""End Of the Sky.""Fair 6.Art- I\'d probably...fine the way it is since there isn\'t any fanservice for the pirreos to howl about which is one reason why I give this category a 6. But, the planes....oh the planes, the setting was suppose to be in the late 19th century so why would planes of 20th century designs be doing in that time period? Also, I can\'t help but notice a VTOL aircraft with such horrible design have to be an old model compare to an Macchi C.202 where Kal gets to pilot it on the last episode, there are also air crafts that were clearly of German design like the Bf 102 and the Stuka, clearly an amateur plane enthusiast will be able to tell that the VTOL aircraft that the Republic Of Ballesteros were using was a much more modern design.Frankly, I can say that this series creator Inumura, Koroku wasn\'t much of a techie, then again, I forgive him....just a little to give this category a fair rating.Character- Ok, so in this serial it was all about Kal and Claire, Kal, is basically what you might call as into this situation where he has fallen from grace after the wind revolution, in fact her predicament can be compared to the French Revolution, where the fate of the Dauphin was unclear, but in his case, it was the continuation as to what has happen to the Dauphin- which btw refers to him, where one would feel sorry for him that he has to go through such predicament that he develops hatred to the very person he blames the most who happens to be Clair aka Nina Viento, however the touching part that I like was when his mother before being sent to the gallows told him to forgive than to hate. I\'m one of the few who was surprise that Nina and Clair are one and the same, I kinda like her sweet and kind personality, but there were time that I\'ve wish that she could have use her authority as the governor of Isla instead of being a puppet of the four oligarchs, I also like the part where she regains her powers from being forgiven by Kal, but for me that\'s as far as I can say about her.Good 7.Sound- The rating is for the opening theme.Decent 4.Enjoyment- I\'d say that my rating for this category was for the moral lesson that this anime carry\'s, also, I based my ratings because of the apathy that I\'ve have for the character\'s as we see into their back story about the fate that the have to undergo and that\'s as good as it gets.Poor 3.Overall- The story maybe good, but unfortunately, this anime has a lot of ill-fitting parts, in fact this anime focuses too much on the romance and slice of life, that it has neglected its adventure genre, now, in an aerial combat a pilot has to make himself a hard target, but in one scene where a group of student adopted a sitting duck in the sky tactic was pretty stupid to say the least, also giving the student a Lee Enfield rife instead of a Vickers Machine gun to defend themselves in an aerial attack goes to show you as to how stupid Inumura, Koroku is when it comes to the principals of aerial combat, it goes to show you that he is more of a novelist who isn\'t trying hard enough to make the anime\'s action element exciting. Also, his concept about the setting was too illogical to say the least when one might wonder as to why would a group of people set out in a flying island only to abandon it and sacrifice it to the ""End of the Sky,"" also why would a temporary settlement in the flying island have to be attacked when their just doing something stupid- I mean, what\'s in it for them? And last but not least, this anime may have ended in an open ending, but it wasn\'t just a typical open ending where the end is narrow, this anime has a very wide open ending and it was disappointing that it had to end that way, so overall even with a nice story, the ending was a disappointment.which is one reason why I give this anime\'s overall a 3. fine the way it is since there isn\'t any fanservice for the pirreos to howl about which is one reason why I give this category a 6.

Well before i get in depth with the review , i would like first o make a general comment about the anime(as i always do on my reviews)Taking into account its popularity and score I consider Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta by far the most underrated  anime of the early 2014 releases and i will explain myself.Story 8:The whole story takes place in an actuall fantasy world where war between  3 factions is quite active.Kal el is a young prince who has been hiding his identity in order to get revenge, to the cause...of his parent's death meaning Nina Viento(aka Claire Kruz), that led a revolution a few years ago, a girl  with who he will get in love with during his staying on isla. Though the story is just above average the way that this anime captivates u its insane, it retains a fantastic balance between the characters and develops them without exaggerations and misleadsArt 10: Pure perfection. I have seen over 110 animes, i would easily put Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta in my top 3.The quality of the art is OUTSTANDING  and i dont only mean the colours the enviroment  and the details. I mean the naturality of the movement, and the liveliness, i wont lie when i thought sometimes i was watching a movie in blue-ray cause that the kind of impression u get  when u watch this animeSound 6: It could have  been better, i sort of like the sound effect though, but it doesnt exceeds the mediocrity on that aspectCharacters 9: The only reason i dont really watch animes with romace, or focused in romance its because i find the characters quite annoying. Well thats not the case here, even though the anime is centered on a flirt(kal el-claire) characters  have quite correct and normal reactions , and not that over-dose lolipop-ubercute and shy reactions we get to see evrytime.The other characters amazing aswell and very well developed.Ariel-Ignacio Mitty(i love this guy) its with its own pesonal storyEnjoyment 9 : I wont lie i am not very into romances when it coems to animes.but THIS one , really blew my mind in every aspect.I will say just this, it is a shame that some  mediocre animes(not nesceserily mainstream) get all that hype  for no reason and such beautifull animes  like Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta  dont get the attention that deserve.My total score is a 8.5 which would easily be 9 with some more decent sound of his parent's death meaning Nina Viento(aka Claire Kruz), that led a revolution a few years ago, a girl  with who he will get in love with during his staying on isla. Though the story is just above average the way that this anime captivates u its insane, it retains a fantastic balance between the characters and develops them without exaggerations and misleadsArt 10: Pure perfection. I have seen over 110 animes, i would easily put Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta in my top 3.The quality of the art is OUTSTANDING  and i dont only mean the colours the enviroment  and the details. I mean the naturality of the movement, and the liveliness, i wont lie when i thought sometimes i was watching a movie in blue-ray cause that the kind of impression u get  when u watch this animeSound 6: It could have  been better, i sort of like the sound effect though, but it doesnt exceeds the mediocrity on that aspectCharacters 9: The only reason i dont really watch animes with romace, or focused in romance its because i find the characters quite annoying.

(ironically didn't turn out to be quite short)So, simply put, the show is kind of divided into several events where they basically transition from one genre to another. 1-6 there's mostly adventure with a bit of comedy, 7-11 action, drama and some romance, and finally the last two focus mainly on romance with a bit of drama.Overall...they pulled switching the atmosphere of the series quite well although I personally was offset by a sudden shift after the sixth episode, but I got used to it.They deliver the story not in the first episode, but later in first half, so there's a nice feeling of backstory and retrospective of characters. The first thing you'll notice watching the anime is how there is tons of stuff happening. There is never a dull moment. The story is the main plot of the series as it should be. Without going into any more detail, I'll just drop my opinion here that they SHOULD HAVE made a 24-episode here not a 13. Definitely a lot of good material, and generally a really good anime.Now you stop reading unless you watched the anime and you're wondering what it is that bothers me. Maybe it pissed you off as well.*SPOILER*She didn't confess to him. She didn't, and I'm so pissed off since I was shipping them the entire time. First time I felt so passionate about anime's relationship so much lol.It's anime, not real life, don't get all smart now with me, young man/lady. I don't want to turn this into a debate, so lets move on.Just to emphasize once again, it should have been a 24 episode long anime. OR, there should have been a 1-2-3 episode OVA of Kal-el and Ari's relationship. That would majorly improve the - kind of - cliffhanger ending regarding the relationship.There, I feel much better now.Overall a great anime, well worth watching even if you're mostly for romance, it's still very well worth it. they pulled switching the atmosphere of the series quite well although I personally was offset by a sudden shift after the sixth episode, but I got used to it.They deliver the story not in the first episode, but later in first half, so there's a nice feeling of backstory and retrospective of characters.

There are nice slice of life and funny moments in preparation for what's to come. However, there are parts with rushed/cheesy romances, utter predictability (especially episode titles), and a few things left unexplained that can leave a sour feel throughout the series.Art 5/10It isn't as crisp, clean and sharp as the other 2014 anime but the aircraft battles that take place look/feel intense as well as the detail of the aircraft itself. The art could've been a little darker since there were themes of hate and revenge.Sound 7/10The show has...lovely orchestral music to fit nicely with each scene from the happy and playful moments to the sad and depressing ones. The same can be said about the voice acting as well. The characters sound quite believable in most situations when conveying their emotions and desires. Although at times it can be overdone to the point where reducing the volume is the best option.Characters 3/10The main characters Claire &amp; Kal-el receive interesting/dark backstories to get the viewer sucked in. The way they're both setup is quite intriguing. In contrast to that, there were two problems in the series. First is that there are too many characters to be developed in just 13 episodes. Second, there are moments for certain characters that are made so blatantly obvious that when it becomes their time to shine, the emotional impact doesn't deliver what's intended because of the predictability in past episodes. Couple this with the beautiful music just adds to the confusion of how one should feel about the characters.Enjoyment 2/10As for me, I grew to hate this series. It started off very well but the way the characters were setup halfway in the anime was beyond predictable. I just couldn't buy what was being sold to me after that point. Also, hearing the characters scream was an ear sore. And the student's fighting gear against enemies was questionable. The only thing that kept me in was the music.Overall 4/10If you like people with dark pasts, intense aircraft battles, nice orchestral music, and romance twist, then give this one a shot. My only complaint would be to tone down the cheesiness of the romance and the predictability of what happens to certain characters. Also, you should read episode titles after you finish each episode so you don't get spoiled when watching.

The ending was quite the hanger so I'm really expecting for a second season.But I really think that they will make another season for this anime coz, it was really a hanger, and the scenes of the lovers was just not enough! "", 'It is in my opinion, one of the best tearjerkers after Clannad. Dont start that thing about other anime having better tearjerker moments than this one because this is purely in my personal opinion. A clear plot, a few twists and turns, but so far, a really good anime to watch and rewatch. This, however needs a season 2 simply because it lacks enough story to fill up all the details that it presented.Good, well rounded anime, it is a personal favorite and a must watch. ', 'Okay, if you are looking at my ""enjoyment"" score (10) and wondering why I gave the show a 5, you\'ll understand soon. This is a show that sells itself as a romantic story about a pilot and a girl in the midst of a gruesome war.  About the compassionate love between a soldier and a lady. I was expecting tragedy that tugs at my heartstrings and the realities of war\'s effect on people. This would have been great if the show was written with heart, but, sadly, it wasn\'t...I would not have enjoyed watching this show at all if it wasn\'t for my friend...that watched with me.  Because of the incredibly simple plot and terrible pacing, we were able to spend most of our time making fun of the terrible characters, making predictions on the ""plot twists"", and making really funny nicknames for each character.  I swear, we may have figured out a way to make any anime fun to watch no matter how terrible the show really is!!!We would dub over scenes in real time as a way of explaining how unrealistic and predictable they were.  For example, while the characters were flying next to each other, they would actually just talk without any radio or normal communications device.  I mean, how can anyone hear one another with two gigantic gas engine propellers on either side of the plane running full throttle?? We would dub over, ""what did you say?!"" and ""I can\'t hear you with these gigantic engines running!! Try sign language!""We named this one really fat dude Porkins, and the super hot girl that somehow liked him (seriously weird romances) Gold Digger because the only way that relationship could make sense in our minds was if Porkins was filthy rich. We also predicted that Porkins was going to die in the most stupid way, too (like in Star Wars).  Turns out we were right!! the dude literally flew into enemy fire with a broken plane for no reason only after he ejected Gold Digger from his plane......WHY DIDN\'T HE JUST EJECT BOTH OF THEM!!! AND WHY DID HE THINK THAT GOLD DIGGER WAS GOING TO BE JUST FINE??? seriously stupid writing, but we were laughing so hard that we had to pause the video for at least 5 minutes.Now, lets talk about pacing!  The director and writers of this show have no clue how to end an episode!!  For example, Porkins\' death although hilarious was supposed to be a huge emotional war hero scene....you\'d think the episode would end with his death to instill the emotions of the episode, but no!! NO!! why would they do that when they can cut to the rest of the pilots standing on the runway wondering where Porkins and Gold Digger are....and then end it with the rest of the planes landing without Porkins\' plane....My friend and I made a game out of this after the 3rd episode since the first three episodes had terrible endings.  We would pick out which scene would be the end only to find out the show was going to make use of the last minute to show you something completely irrelevant to ruin the possible cliff hanger....of course this also gave us a lot of laughs, as well.In the end, we ended up enjoying the show by turning it into a comedy when it was trying really really hard to be a serious war story.  If you find a show similar to this, take as many steps as possible to make fun of it so that you can actually enjoy it. Seriously, Porkins was hilarious!! that watched with me.

Or it\'s supposed to be one, but I almost never write reviews, and I see no reason to bore people with things many others have written, so I\'ll offer some other perspectives (just don\'t read if you\'re under 20). Simply said, it\'s a story about war, love and adventure. Undoubtedly it is very ambitious, with moods going from girly giddy to PTSD then back to boyhood wonder in a brisk pace, but 13 episodes are just that, only 13 episodes. You don\'t feel like you\'ve tasted enough of the world and its people.  And I could see...all the cliches coming from 9 episodes away, so don\'t expect originality either.  The technical aspects are passable.However, don\'t rule out this series, because watching this anime can be good. I will be frank: anime has mostly become an exclusive wasteland for fetishists thanks to popular demand. Sometimes, it is even soul-destroying and only aggravating the emptiness felt by certain people who are deeply disillusioned with life. Maybe it has always been so, but I digress. Some writer once said a story will come to mean different things to different people. So does this series to me. By that I don\'t mean it\'s an awesome tearjerker (already done that to death), or a magical cure for depression (that\'s stupid). But it has actually made me think, and at some point I found my attention drifting away.For a long time I have been alienated by fiction (that at least attempts to be emotional), anime or not. I am too old for high school idols or pretty-headed haremettes.  I see no point in trying out yet another gratuitously dystopian fantasy just to see which fictional character could outbastard other fictional bastards.  I am too aware to enjoy the kind of romances dominated by female interests, which believe in debasing men even if the vapid and vacillating women almost never deserve it, especially the subgenre of infidelity / divorce / ""empowerment"" fantasy that is mostly about feeding the infamous Rationalization Hamster. When I read about how 70% (or 90% in certain places) of US soldiers from Iraq face divorce (robbery), or how 1/4 of Britons commit infidelity, or how a female Facebook executive publicly encourages other females to sleep around with ""bad boys"" then snatch an obedient guy for marriage, I suppose I no longer have the energy to be fazed or sarcastic. It\'s like a broken record. But this anime struck a chord with me.I, and probably many other people, have more in common with the prince than I\'d care to admit. Just that, we don\'t have a loving family to heal us, or a destination so noble like the End of the sky to inspire us, or a grand conflict to humble our self-centered indignation, or the chance to forge an unquestioning bond of love in the face of death, free of doubt and pride, with a person that deserves it. We don\'t have a wise mother to tell us that embracing our hatred against her killer, which is the world itself, would eventually destroy us, no matter how justified we might seem. Such simple, theatrical words that I used to dismiss. Now ...It was something to ruminate on, and nice when it lasted. all the cliches coming from 9 episodes away, so don\'t expect originality either.

From there, romance blooms among the pilots of the Isla project\'s trainee school through the hardships of battle and loss of friends along the journey. The story follows the main protagonist, Kal-El Albus, a former crown prince of an overthrown empire, and his journey through hatred and revenge, to eventually, forgiveness and romance.Sounds like quite a lot...to take in right? Yeah, that\'s kinda what I felt watching this anime. But despite being disoriented for quite a while, it slowly became quite an enjoyable ride for me after a few episodesStory: 7The story line of the anime is simple and complex at the same time. As it is a romance anime after all, it involves people falling in love (duh). But the context of this romance anime can be confusing at times. Looking beyond that, Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta has a pretty engaging story overall, with much detail in the lives of the various characters portrayed. And the feels are also quite strong! Honestly, if I were a girl, I\'d probably have cried quite a few times.The only reason why it didn\'t get a higher score was because of its incredibly slow start. It took 2-3 episodes before we were fully filled in on what\'s really going onArt: 6Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta is a romance anime after all, but due to the nature of the story, some degree of artwork is needed to portray action scenes fully, especially duing dogfights. It was... sufficient. Apart from that, characters were nicely drawn, but at times, slightly plain. SufficientSound: 5Probably my only qualm of the anime. Openings and endings were fine, but music especially during intense moments was repreated. That same dissonant piano music seemed slightly too underwhelming for the scenes unfolding like dogfights in the sky.Character: 7This anime doesn\'t spare on character development, and it\'s interesting to see most of the cast growing as the anime progresses. Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta also does a great job making the audience feel the struggle and greif that characters are put through. Creators also did a great job delving into the back story of most of the main characters.Perhaps exploring other supporting characters would\'ve been even more awesome, but... seems too much to as for hahaEnjoyment: 7Overall, it was a pretty touching series, pulling me back for yet another episode. The only qualm I have overall, would be the ending of the anime. It ran a little short, but still, sufficient to tell the story.Finally:Toaru Hikuushi e no Koiuta was good. If you are new to the romance genre coming from shounen anime, it has a nice balance between action and drama. Although it didn\'t jerk any tears from me, it does have a touching and engaging story.

Although the MC wants revenge, the anime itself isn't revenge-focused. It's more about MC's life in the present. The war genre also adds an emotional element, and in each episode, you feel a lump in your throat due to what the characters were experiencing. This is a good emotional anime which moves your heart. I didn't cry, but it's truly heart-gripping.As for the art, I think it's pretty standard for a 2014 anime. Not...too detailed, but detailed enough. There's no awkward body proportions or movements and you can watch it quite comfortably. I think the best way to describe it is that it's got a comfortable/cosy style. too detailed, but detailed enough.

The worldbuilding is well done and surprisingly detailed for a show of this length.  The characters and drama are excellent.  If historical fantasy tearjerkers are your thing, make sure to add this one to your watch list.Positives:+ Unique setting that takes advantage of the animated medium.  The floating island of Isla and its heavy reliance on old timey airplanes is a well-realized and interesting stage for the story.  It\'s a series that would require a massive amount of CGI to tell in live action,...so it\'s the perfect usage of animation to tell a unique story that you otherwise couldn\'t.+ Good romance drama story.  It\'s predictable, but predictable doesn\'t always mean bad.  It can also mean that the story and viewer are simply on the same page with what the natural progression of events is.  It\'s engaging and emotional, with lots of good characters that you come to care about.+ Life and death have meaning.  It\'s a war story, and the series makes it abundantly clear from the start that not everyone will be coming home.  However, it manages to avoid the nihilism of many war stories and doesn\'t become grief porn where it kills off characters by the handful for cheap dramatic impact.  You get to know the characters and their lives, and when they die, you feel the loss and the pain it causes for the the people that care about them.  But it\'s not just about death and sadness either, the early episodes in particular are a celebration of their lives and the happiness they\'re trying to protect when things become grim later on.+ The art is good and the action is dynamic and intense.  Aside from very occasional case of the CGI looking bad, the art looks great and the CGI for the planes is well integrated overall.  The action is as chaotic as you would expect a real dogfight to be, and the series effectively establishes that any battle could be a character\'s last, so they always have you on the edge of your seat.+ Excellent characters, especially the female leads, Ari and Claire.Negatives:- Melodrama can sometimes be heavy handed, particularly when it comes to backstories.  While Isla is intended to be an island of misfit toys and you\'d therefore expect this to some extent, the unhappy childhoods can get a little over the top.- Ignacio.  Annoying brooding type, prime example of the ""not every character needed to have a tragic backstory"" problem this series sometimes has too.  Could have done without this guy.- Ending lacked catharsis.  Without getting into spoilers, when the series ended, I immediately felt that it needed another episode or an OVA to actually give you the big emotional moment that it unfortunately only leaves implied.  Even though you aren\'t really, it still feels like you\'re being denied a happy ending to the series after watching the characters go through so much. so it\'s the perfect usage of animation to tell a unique story that you otherwise couldn\'t.+ Good romance drama story.  It\'s predictable, but predictable doesn\'t always mean bad.  It can also mean that the story and viewer are simply on the same page with what the natural progression of events is.  It\'s engaging and emotional, with lots of good characters that you come to care about.+ Life and death have meaning.  It\'s a war story, and the series makes it abundantly clear from the start that not everyone will be coming home.  However, it manages to avoid the nihilism of many war stories and doesn\'t become grief porn where it kills off characters by the handful for cheap dramatic impact.  You get to know the characters and their lives, and when they die, you feel the loss and the pain it causes for the the people that care about them.  But it\'s not just about death and sadness either, the early episodes in particular are a celebration of their lives and the happiness they\'re trying to protect when things become grim later on.+ The art is good and the action is dynamic and intense.  Aside from very occasional case of the CGI looking bad, the art looks great and the CGI for the planes is well integrated overall.  The action is as chaotic as you would expect a real dogfight to be, and the series effectively establishes that any battle could be a character\'s last, so they always have you on the edge of your seat.+ Excellent characters, especially the female leads, Ari and Claire.Negatives:- Melodrama can sometimes be heavy handed, particularly when it comes to backstories.  While Isla is intended to be an island of misfit toys and you\'d therefore expect this to some extent, the unhappy childhoods can get a little over the top.- Ignacio.  Annoying brooding type, prime example of the ""not every character needed to have a tragic backstory"" problem this series sometimes has too.  Could have done without this guy.- Ending lacked catharsis.  Without getting into spoilers, when the series ended, I immediately felt that it needed another episode or an OVA to actually give you the big emotional moment that it unfortunately only leaves implied.  Even though you aren\'t really, it still feels like you\'re being denied a happy ending to the series after watching the characters go through so much.', 'This is a strange anime. It is decent, but it never really fulfils the potential it started off with. Perhaps a longer timeline with a more complex plotline, more action, and more relevant interaction might suit it better.It started with great potential. I hoped it would perhaps become a historico-political steampunk classic, albeit with slightly weaker art. Instead, the abstract mental struggles of the individual seemed to subsume all other themes with the loss of many key overarching elements that I would have liked to see this anime develop.Don’t get me wrong, I am not against the telling of individual stories as part...of greater struggles. The problem, however, arises in the vagueness of individual struggles and motivations of the characters. I appreciate that any historico-political anime must tell the struggle of individuals (or groups of individuals). But while this anime tries to delve into these individual struggles, there is no coherence to these struggles and little is said regarding their motivations, other than vague love side-plots, comradeship, and a nebulous sense of duty.This anime harks back to those frontier wars during the age of imperialism – far enough from the cores of power to be invisible, but not far enough for ordinary men to be sent to die. Like such stories, I feel this anime is not meant to make much sense; rather, it is a throwback of sorts, to the steampunk nostalgia of Last Exile and Laputa, even though it unfortunately pales in comparison. of greater struggles.

Ushio to Tora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/842/Ushio_to_Tora,"[""An Anime Classic, and must watch, Ushio and Tora is one of those good to see old-school animes. After watching a continuum of new Girl Meets Boy, and Gothic over tone anime I decided to do some looking up for something different. Luckly I stumbled on a game that recently came out for the PSP called Shonen Sunday Vs Shonen Magazine which featured many famous Anime and Manga Icons (I.E. Inuyasha, Negi, Ikki, etc), Ushio was one of the selectable characters. I was really interested in the character to begin with and decided to look up everything about it.The series started out as a 33...vol. manga that was featured in Shonen Jump Sunday, which eventually won the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1992. The manga quickly became a 10 episode seires which was a shortened version of the Manga but depicting many of Ushio's and Tora's main battles.The story is pretty solid and resembles many themes to Animes based on Japanese mythology. The main character Ushio was forced to release a demon that was imprisoned underneath his family shrine, which was imprisoned by the Beast Spear for 500 year, in order to protect his friends from demons that were running amok in his hometown. After that the Demon, which he calls Tora (due to his tiger like appearence), begins to haunt him and says that he'll eat him when he drops his guard. At that point Ushio keeps the Beast Spear with him at all times to protect others from Demons.Character wise, they are pretty generic. There is the typical Tomboyish girl childhood friend and timid girl classmate that hang around Ushio most of the time. Tora is big talker, thinking highly of himself all the time until the spear is pointed at him. Ushio develops a strong bond with Tora which is typical, and that's basically it. The entourage of villains in this series isn't strong, mostly random mythical monsters out for revenge or reeking havoc, but that's okay.If you're looking for high class animation with CG and all that stuff, you ain't finding it here. This is early 90's work so you get what you see. A few cut and paste scenes and not much detail on the character expressions. But that is what is great about old school anime, if it weren't these kinds of animes you really wouldn't have high budget stuff like Soul Eater, Code Geass, and Inuyasha.In the long run, it is worth watching and keeps you asking for more. The action series will get you addicted and might want you to start reading the manga, I know I will. Take my word for it, if you are such a Shonen fan or you just like animes with Mythological overtones this is your stuff.Yours Truly,OtakufreakPS; Sunday Vs Magazine is a bad fighting game but so addictive!!!

Check it out anyways."", ""My heart really goes out to classic anime featuring ghosts and demons, it really does. Ushio to tora when i first saw it kinda looked kinda dumb to me based on Toras design but when i actually took the time to watch the first episode i was surprised how much i enjoyed the series. This anime is mostly a goof spirit fighting anime that was pretty common at the time when it was made but it felt more original as it did not go for really overdone tropes.The story is pretty straightforward it doesn't get very deep or complicated, its very episodic and is mostly...about your enjoyment instead of anything deep. That being said i found pretty much every episode enjoyable and had a good time with the series as a whole. I like the character interactions and the different situations they got put in where they would have to develope more of a love hate partnership. I do wonder if it woulda held up past 10 episodes though or if i would have grown bored eventually.As far as characters the only two worth mentioning are ushio and tora obviously. Ushio a fun character cause is really quite strict and simple, he doesn't trust tora but he has to rely on him to protect everyone in town from demons and vengeful spirits. On the other side of that tora is a petty and rotten beast who often remarks about how he wants to kill or devour people. The characters really mix like oil and water for the most part but as the show progresses they start to work together in more of a dysfunctional partnership instead of two people at each others throats.As far as Art goes the show had some pretty good monster designs and had a lot more detail than i see in most modern anime. Aside from the highschool kids everything looked pretty unique. The backgrounds and scenery were also detailed and really conveyed the atmosphere of certain scenes. The Audio was not incredible but it was good for the most part and the voice acting was both comical and serious at times which is a good. I find it particularly rare that a voice actor has the ability or versatility to convey comedy and seriousness and make it feel convincing enough.I enjoyed this short series a lot and i think most people would get some enjoyment of it especially if they liked old spirit hunter animes. about your enjoyment instead of anything deep.

I also discovered that it was adapted into a series of OVAs in the early 90s and figured I might as well sample those for myself before I dive into the remake considering the little research I did indicated...that it\'d be to Mappa what Hunter x Hunter is to Madhouse, and we all know by now how I feel about Hunter x Hunter. Couldn\'t find the original Japanese version, but the dub was tolerable enough - unlike the original Hunter x Hunter\'s, which is so bad that I think people willingly drilled their ears after hearing it. So what\'d I think of it? Well let\'s get into what the series is about first.Long story short, Ushio to Tora is basically Natsume\'s Book of Friends as a shonen action series. It\'s got the relationship between a normal kid who can kick demon ass and a talking cat who threatens the kid just as much as he saves him from danger just like Natsume, but instead of wanting to heal demon\'s hearts (although there\'s some of that in this series) they\'re out to prevent \'em from eating people\'s heads off. And of course, Ushio doesn\'t have Natsume\'s personality at all, acting more like every kid shonen hero out there from the bull-headed determination to his obliviousness to girls - not helped by the fact that his two childhood friends belong to the opposite sex, one of whom is a tsundere and that\'s pretty much all you need to know and the other is basically that friend you talk to a lot and that can cause misunderstandings if you overdose on said discussions. But not having Natsume\'s personality is a good thing in this show\'s case, because I can\'t see Natsume surviving Tora\'s antics, let alone the demons that aren\'t willing to compromise at all when it comes to snacking on human flesh.The basic hook of the series is that after accidentally discovering the giant tiger in his basement, Ushio unleashes some kind of spell that attracts all sorts of demons to his area and in order to fight them, he must use a magic spear that turns him into an instant fighter and makes his hair grow long for some reason. However, since the spear was the only thing keeping Tora sealed, and since Tora is also a demon who feasts on humans, he has to keep the tiger in line and Tora isn\'t exactly a nice guy to begin with. I don\'t think I\'m spoiling anything here when I say that the main appeal of the show is their relationship and how it grows from really grudging allies to slight less grudging allies, and I\'m definitely not spoiling anything when I say that other than that, there\'s nothing really all that special about these ten episodes that you couldn\'t get from something like YuYu Hakusho or Inuyasha aside from the fact that there are some mass casualties in the real world.Ushio to Tora, to put it lightly, is a big product of its time and unless you\'re a huge fan of the shonen action genre or have nostalgia for the 90s, there\'s not really much to get excited for here. Now since there\'s only ten episodes, the series only covers the smaller arcs that make up the beginning of the manga without getting into anything real meaty; but even by those standards, the arcs themselves aren\'t exactly the most engaging things, mostly consisting of basic monster-of-the-week stuff that introduces one or two new plot elements into the mix, but not much more than that. The last one sort of gets interesting due to its environmental agenda, but the fact that you need to resort to that lame method of instilling importance into your story doesn\'t really speak well of the entire product. Seriously, was environmentalism as big in manga as it was for American films/cartoons back in the late 80s/early 90s? Was everyone just trying to copy Miyazaki during that period?The humor is also pretty dated, being as basic shonen as it gets, with a mix of ""I don\'t really love him"" humor from the tsundere childhood friend. Just about the only jokes that amused me was when Tora was interacting with humanity and getting screwed for it, and it wasn\'t exactly comedy that would make the Brits smirk. In fact, that pretty much describes Tora in general. Like I said, he\'s the only real interesting character and his relationship with Ushio is the only big draw the show has amongst all the other tepid cliches. But even that positive point is hampered by the fact that he\'s not exactly Hobbes or even Nyanko-sensei in terms of personality. It\'s really hard to describe his appeal in words beyond the basics I\'ve already outlined, so all I can say is he\'s similar to Hades from Disney\'s version of Hercules in that he\'s the one lone bright spot due to how amusing he is, but not enough to really carry the entire product.Not that I\'m saying the product isn\'t fun, because it is. Kinda. Well, it\'s passable at the very least. But passable ain\'t good enough for me I\'m afraid, and it doesn\'t help that unless it\'s really well-executed, the kind of product that Ushio to Tora is will never be able to really grab me. I\'ll still be watching the remake because...well have you seen the rest of the Summer anime? It\'s got to be better than 90% of them. And at the end of the day, I\'m still really interested in seeing what Mappa does with the project. But unless they add something real meaty to the original material, it\'ll probably just be something I watch once and forget over time. Assuming it doesn\'t go longer than my patience will allow me to keep it on, that is. How many cours is that remake anyways? The original manga is over 33 volumes and given Mappa\'s high hopes for the project, I\'m afraid it\'ll go on for a long LONG time. that it\'d be to Mappa what Hunter x Hunter is to Madhouse, and we all know by now how I feel about Hunter x Hunter.

You can\'t. Especially something from the post-yokai boom.Ushio and Tora is one of those series that is so shonen it\'s amazing. I personally found it to be quite bland, Ushio finds a beast in his basement, Tora helps him against his will to fight beasts, blah, blah, blah, but it was so from back in the day that I liked it. It reminded me of Inuyasha. Or, the other way around. There is no plot line in this anime. It\'s just a series of ""yokai of the week"" episodes, but that\'s what...I expected. I love how they added some hints of Gegege no Kitaro in this anime by expanding on what the story behind each yokai is. Personally, I was disappointed it was only 10 OVA\'s. You WILL want more. You sadly won\'t.The art work gets a grade A because it\'s mostly hand drawn. Even though some of the cells jump up and about that is not a problem. There\'s just something about it. There are problems though. Tora looks plain crude at times and being from the 1990\'s there\'s no excuse. It\'s impossible to capture Mr. Fujita\'s dirty scenes in anime and while it sounds bad it isn\'t. Mr. Fujita has a certain style that appears almost brush stroke like. However this doesn\'t show.Both dub tracks are amazing. The gags are extremely funny especially when Tora is confused about something. There\'s just something about Tora\'s voice that makes it sound hilarious. Asako sounds terrible in both dubs though. She just sounds forced.

You can also visually see Ye Yanran\'s dissapointing frown in higher quality... /sCharacter: 5/10Apart from the introduction of Dragon god\'s spirit, there aren\'t many new character establishments this season. Furthermore, this season has morefocused on female lead characters Ye Yanran and Ah Yun so other characters haven\'t had the spotlight. Ye Xingyun\'s cultivation has finally progressedbut it\'ll stop in a few episodes after he learns the Qi family secret art that opens up the 8th meridian.Overall: 6/10Not bad, not good. still worth watching if you enjoy Ye Xingyun playing impostors with everyone.']"
Zettai Karen Children OVA: Aitazousei! Ubawareta Mirai?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7745/Zettai_Karen_Children_OVA__Aitazousei_Ubawareta_Mirai,"['For some weird reason, I get addicted to Zettai Karen Children. After I finished the 51 episodes, I quickly jumped to the manga and has been following the series ever since. So naturally I\'m ecstatic with the release of this OVA titled Changing Love! Take Back the Stolen Future? It was released on July 16, 2010 and it took me this long to watch it because of the same reason why I am not up to date at all with my summer anime: life.The OVA takes place a few years after the Children last appearance in anime so they are more well developed. If you...read the manga then you are happy to notice that even the PANDRA children has joined the Children at their school which mean, Yuri/Feather/Phantom Daughter is around too.The story line for this OVA might be meh but the production team went to great length to make it clear in this OVA of the canon pairing of Kaoru and Minamoto so I\'m a happy camper about that. I\'ve been rooting for them even when Kaoru acted like an old man and sneaked around to see the girls pantsu. I approved.The art and animation haven\'t differed much from the first season. They still wear unusual villain clothes and shit like that. I found it rather funny actually since the series looks like it was targeted for the younger children/teen but the manga has that ""mature"" tag to it. The irony.Aya Hirano is still the seiyuu for Kaoru so obviously she does a good job at it. For the first time I though Yuuichi Nakamura sounds mighty sexy. I guess the plot kinda acquired Minamoto to have a sexy voice. I\'m definitely going to remember him now, along with Tomokazu Sugita and Jun Fukuyama. The OP and ED still have that quality to it that will only remind you of the series without even have to second guess. I like the BGM during Minamoto and Hyoubu encounter before the real fight unfortunately I have no idea who sang it or what is the title of that song. It was pretty cool.You can probably deduced of the character that I like the most (Kaoru) to my least favorite character (Yuri/Feather/Phantom Daughter) so I am not going to repeat myself here.All and all, I like this OVA. It wasn\'t spectacular but it is something that will probably lead to second season of this series. I\'ll look forward to that. Let\'s make it official that I am now is gay for Kaoru as well read the manga then you are happy to notice that even the PANDRA children has joined the Children at their school which mean, Yuri/Feather/Phantom Daughter is around too.The story line for this OVA might be meh but the production team went to great length to make it clear in this OVA of the canon pairing of Kaoru and Minamoto so I\'m a happy camper about that.

Ao no Orchestra,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51614/Ao_no_Orchestra,"['As a violinist for a decade I was excited to see this anime pop up in a rare genre. So far, some plot parts aside, the musical aspect is relatable, especially the parent influence. As for the animation, it’s very variable. In the beginning, the mendelssohn violin concerto is animated precisely and beautifully. Bowing follows the slurs, and fingers are in the right place. For the second episode, some small perks like tuning the violin were impressive to see. However, when it got to Canon, the fingers were still and the bowing became a seesaw. It felt like they forgot to animate it. For the...3rd episode, oh man I actually saw another orchestra in an anime. I was a bit disappointed that it was visibly CGI and that the violins became robotic, but an orchestra isn’t small and it must have been hard to animate. Overall, I’m excited to see how far this anime goes in terms of plot, musicality, and animation.Edit for 5th episode:There are some good parts and bad parts for the animation. Let me start with the sauce. The sound and the animation was great  at showing the dynamics, especially with Saeki deviating away from the original dynamics and adjusting the counting and pace, and Aono also playing fortissimo on the tremolo.  The fingering was mostly correct when going over the piece Spring. Akine’s Canon playing was flat at times, but that could be attributed to her experience. I will note that her tone quality has significantly improved. For the ensemble part, it was also cool to see that the CGI was not completely robotic and that the concertmaster had more accentuated body language focused on guiding the ensemble.As for the bad parts.The bowing lagged behind on some parts on Spring, especially the accompanying part that Aono was playing. And for Akine, they switched to CGI. For three or four notes, Akine‘s fingers were also on the wrong string. Specifically, the A string when it was supposed to be the D string. For the ensemble, using the body language of the concertmaster to induce “Harada Magic” is certainly far from realistic, but at least it emphasizes the role of a concertmaster.These are my animation thoughts thus far. So far, it’s not bad 3rd episode, oh man I actually saw another orchestra in an anime.

So far, it’s not bad', 'When was the very last time we actually got something close to something like a traditional orchestra portrayed in anime? If 2019\'s anime adaptation of Kono Oto Tomare! wasn\'t even enough evidence, then the closest semblance would have to be KyoAni\'s Hibike! Euphonium franchise series hemorraging since the 2010s, or even going back to Piano no Mori or Nodame Cantabile of the classic late 2000s.Most certainly, no one would\'ve expected mangaka Makoto Akui\'s musical coming-of-age melodrama work of Ao no Orchestra a.k.a Blue Orchestra to make a small note in modern anime, largely because this show was overlooked thanks to the fact that there\'s no...licencing from either Crunchyroll or other Western licensors for that matter, even for a show that only premieres on NHK Educational TV, the kids channel arm of the conglomerate Japanese TV station NHK that brought you the Mairimashita! Iruma-kun a.k.a Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun series since 2019. Despite the fact that I would tell you to sail the high seas to watch this show, this work clinching this year\'s 68th Shogakugan Manga Award in the Shonen category (together with Yofukashi no Uta a.k.a Call of the Night), for an award-winning manga, that should say something about this show that to be honest, I wish that TwoSet Violin will cover this show in a blimp someday since it\'s right under their ballpark.The proper way to describe Ao no Orchestra a.k.a Blue Orchestra would be this: A lone violin virtuoso. The power of harmony and friendship.The violin prodigy of the Aono family: father Ryuuji, a total marksman of a player in both instrumentals and life. Being a famous musician and a professional violinist who has won numerous competitions, all looks set for the meteoric rise of Ryuuji...that is until he got himself into trouble, and not in the kindest of ways: a scandalous affair, which broke the entire family apart with devastating results. As a result, his current ex-wife and their only son, Hajime, were distraught by the media, creating a high-profile paparazzi affair where they were being harassed day and night. This is especially so for Hajime, whom his father had taught him violin from an early age, and set up to be his successor in the same vein that he did in his years of becoming a professional musician, who, with that scandal, put a stop to his growth because of the harsh memories associated with it to take care of his ailing mother who\'s been a strong supporter of him in his growing-up years.The girl who was constantly berated for being a bully in her early years, who became the bullied — that is the life of Ritsuko Akine. Almost like Mushoku Tensei\'s tsundere Eris of all people, Akine is an earnest girl who just loves living and breathing life, but her rash personality can easily be a negative for misunderstandings, which is why she\'s constantly being bullied. Fortunately, her saving grace is that she always turns to the violin if she\'s feeling down, and that has been her passion ever since, which in turn, touched Hajime\'s heart to pick up the violin once more and play to the best he ever could, with his father\'s nightmare spirit in tow of overcoming the harsh familial scandalous episode in his life. And together with Takada, their homeroom teacher that saw them through their worst episodes, he inspires them with confidence and spirit as they move forward from middle school to high school.Yet, another boy\'s claim to fame was that he\'s admitted to the orchestra purely based on musical talent; this is Nao Saeki\'s life as someone who unceremoniously is also somewhat of a foreigner due to his hair colour being a pure-white accent. Like Ryuuji, Saeki is seen as a child prodigy, but his success in that aspect is one that began once he met Hajime, and both of their personalities clash for better or worse. To make matters worse, the fate that intertwines both boys make for one hell of a realism melodrama that is hard to avoid any conflict that consequently will make and separate both of them.The other storymaker of Haru Kozakura: like Hajime, she stands alongside him as one of many candidates trying to be the next child prodigy in their childhood days of winning as much of the violin competition chunk as possible. But, he\'s so affixed on his walk to victory that she can only notice him from afar, and she develops a crush for Hajime, being the kind and shy girl who always hides behind others\' backs, and one that like normal girls who are jealous of romantic love, sees him and Akine\'s growth together so much that they\'re like a couple musically, far from the truth that they both were brought up in different circumstances, and the violin being the constant common interest in their lives. Like Hajime, she\'s an only child being supported by her mother, and has had her fair share of standing out, so confidence is not her strong suit that is overcome with time.The story of many dysfunctional characters in an orchestra that makes them tuned with each other: a boy whose future was bright, and it all came tumbling down with a single spark; a girl who was constantly bullied for all her life until a passion sparks her joy; another boy who questioned his existence until he came over to realise who he was all along; and another girl who had confidence issues and was finding confidence in who she really is. It\'s a fairly cookie-cutter kind of melodrama seen in most AniManga, and the realism of sticking its guns to real-life examples, despite the manga being a slow burn, gives that edge of humanity that even if you have been in a band/orchestra or not, choose any ""sport"" and it\'ll speak to you.Based on the experiences of real-life bands, the highly-prestiged Umimaku High School Orchestra Club is as real as anything could get, with their numerous awards and rich history that even a single misstep would paint a grim picture for the club\'s future. Headed by its conductor, Hiroaki Ayukawa is a strict teacher who gets straightforward to the crux of making the orchestra club improve with time and highlighting talents that would help spur the club forward. Its concertmaster, 3rd year student Sou Harada, is as akin to Ayukawa\'s right-hand man as anyone could get, supervising the club and making sure that all members are strictly confined to the conductor\'s high standards before his arrival. Together, from its 3rd year club president, Mari Tateishi, and the same-grade students to the section leaders that help mould Hajime, Akine, Saeki and Haru\'s growth, the orchestra club grows from strength to strength, anchoring the good and sieving out the bad to become a club that outsiders would expect nothing but high expectations for and raising the future young generation of potential players.I\'ll be very blunt here: director Seiji Kishi hasn\'t gotten the best overtime, and despite being one of Studio Lerche\'s in-house directors, this show feels like it\'s his side hustle while preparing for You-Zitsu a.k.a Classroom of the Elite\'s return for Season 3 next year. To be fair, scriptwriter-cum-series composer Yuuko Kakihara\'s magic works here as par for her course of keeping the series consistent in its execution, which it does decently to a degree of effectiveness. And despite the show being handed over to the old-timer studio of Nippon Animation, their modern returns in the form of 2021\'s Yakunara Mug Cup mo a.k.a Let\'s Make a Mug Too and last year\'s Love All Play don\'t look all that impressive from a production standpoint, and that even tells in Ao no Orchestra that they had to implement CGI especially for the big performances, to me, it feels like this was too big of an ambitious job for the rather dated studio to try something new, But I guess props for trying, despite it looking jarring at first, you\'ll get used to it for the show\'s long-haul, 24-episode run.Obviously, the highlight has got to be the music, which is supported by real Japanese musicians portraying the main and side characters, which makes a big impact for a musical work like this. In terms of the OST, I\'ve really gotta say that I admire Novelbright\'s OP ""Cantabile"" for being one of the most slow-but-classy OP songs of the year; it really gels well with the OP visuals (despite it being like a lyrical MV of sorts), and you really can\'t afford to skip on one of the most impressive, soul-feeling Anisongs of 2023. And yes, as a musician myself, I may hate how Pachelbel\'s Canon has become one of the most overused classic songs in the history of music (so much that it hurts my ears), but I have to say that I kind of enjoyed soshina feat. Yuika\'s Canon variation ED song, which is just a different canonically sounding Canon.Ao no Orchestra a.k.a Blue Orchestra, even if it has Blue in the name (like Blue Period), may not be the show that everyone cares, but for the minority, to me, it\'s good enough that this show gets the traction from those who really care. A decent series for all that\'s worth, even for a slow burn, and overall, a pretty good shape.Just one thing that I need to teach you: be a pirate and sail the high seas for shows like this; your experience will be elevated. licencing from either Crunchyroll or other Western licensors for that matter, even for a show that only premieres on NHK Educational TV, the kids channel arm of the conglomerate Japanese TV station NHK that brought you the Mairimashita!

While the story seemingly focuses on violin, it includes great slice of life and dramatic aspects that drive the story. While I have seen many music anime, Blue Orchestra’s storytelling is not like the others. It blends music and drama to create a story that appeals to the audience. It doesn’t simply focus on the violin instrument but rather, extends towards other musical elements of the orchestra.  Blue Orchestra’s true appeal comes from depicting the orchestra’s greatness from...the perspective of the youths, the high school students of the story who bring the music and story to life. the perspective of the youths, the high school students of the story who bring the music and story to life.', ""I've known about Ao no Orchestra for about as long as I have been actively engaged in seasonal anime. I am a musician who has participated in band and orchestra. Hibike Euphonium is my favorite anime of all time. I watch almost anything music related that airs. Needless to say, I have been anticipating and looking forward to this adaptation for a while now. I will go into some minor music details that I appreciate, so stay tuned if you like that stuff.The story poses a common backstory which some pretty cookie cutter characters, but don't get the wrong idea, that doesn't necessarily need to...hinder its performance. In fact, the kind of backstories presented here remind me of the people I was surrounded with in my time in band and orchestra. It feels very homey which gives it a good personal connection. I will have to give it some more time for more characters to develop as there looks to be a decent sized cast, but that's only speculation. They will need to do that well in order to compete with some of the other highly praised music anime shows.The music so far has been about what I expected, but what I like is how real it is, and there's 2 reasons for that. First, you can tell, at least in the individual playing moments, that these are real and not just some MIDI recordings. You can hear the human touch in the sound. I have yet to listen and understand if they did the same for full orchestra settings, so that will have to wait. They also don't overdo the music visuals in other shows such as Piano no Mori and Nodame Cantabile. It was one of the biggest things that goes against music listening etiquette. This allows you to fully listen to the music without the visual distractions unless you get distracted by CGI.As the trend continues, the orchestra plays in CGI, and with an ensemble of that size and the complexities of individual performance, I understand why. When they showed a full orchestra, I am led to believe that they were accurate in tracing musician playing. Accurate fingering, mallets, slide positions, and bowings added to the experience. Once again, can't confirm that the audio comes from that same tracking, but it does lead to a good case for it. I hope to hear some more great orchestral pieces from this show.CGI aside, the rest of the visuals are okay. They're certainly no KyoAni, but they're fine. There's enough going on there to not deter my attention elsewhere.Looking forward to how the story and characters develop along with maybe some cool little small details that trigger my musician history and hopefully add to my experience. Will hopefully do a full review at the end of the 2nd cour! hinder its performance.

I mean, even licensors neglected to pick it up, which is a shame because this is such a gem of a series with an engrossing story and well written characters.What stands out the most about Ao no orchestra is how real all the characters feel. There’s no excessive fan-service, cringe jokes or overly anime-y vibes. The kids all feel and act like normal teenagers who use music as an outlet for their stress and anxiety. The friendships that are formed over the course of the show feel very authentic. It’s one of those series...where you can forget you’re watching an anime.. until the CGI comes up.Now this is probably my biggest gripe with the show. Ao no orchestra is a musical anime, which means you’re going to have performances. The issue is that the CGI is God awful in this show and ruins a lot of the performances. It’s a shame because the story is great, the characters are great, but the musical performances are just really bad. I’m not going to put the studio down too much for it, they’re a smaller studio and it’s probably just a resource issue. But it had to be said nonetheless.While the performances may be weak, the actual music information and knowledge that’s introduced in the show is very good, though. While you’re not going to learn how to play the violin from this show, it’s totally reasonable that you might be motivated to learn after watching this. It does give a really cool insight into the world of orchestra and some of the technical aspects. This combined with the story being so good really made up for the shortcomings of the performances.As I mentioned before, the characters and situations feel very real. A big part of that is due to the great job the seiyuus did in this one. There’s no super cartoonish or high pitched squealing and traditional anime style talking. It sounds like normal teenagers. Aono, the MC, in particular has a very subdued and natural sounding voice in this which really just makes scenes more believable.Ao no orchestra is a very real feeling anime. If you’re a slice of life or music fan who wants a more realistic take on the genre, this is the one. Loveable characters, an interesting and emotional story and great performances. One of the hidden gems of 2023 for sure.Ao no orchestra gets 8 out of 10. where you can forget you’re watching an anime.. until the CGI comes up.Now this is probably my biggest gripe with the show.

This combined with the story being so good really made up for the shortcomings of the performances.As I mentioned before, the characters and situations feel very real. A big part of that is due to the great job the seiyuus did in this one. There’s no super cartoonish or high pitched squealing and traditional anime style talking. It sounds like normal teenagers. Aono, the MC, in particular has a very subdued and natural sounding voice in this which really just makes scenes more believable.Ao no orchestra is a very real feeling anime. If you’re a slice of life or music fan who wants a more realistic take on the genre, this is the one. Loveable characters, an interesting and emotional story and great performances. One of the hidden gems of 2023 for sure.Ao no orchestra gets 8 out of 10.', 'Now, I might be biased as I am someone who has played in orchestra throughout middle school, high school, and now in college, but I really enjoyed this anime overall. I do think some of the arcs that focused on some of the side characters were sometimes boring and felt underdeveloped. Although, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the ""melodrama"" involving Hajime. A musicians relationship with an instrument is not always easy, but like Hajime as soon as the conductor gives the down beat all of that melts away. My conductor says that even on days where he feels bad physically or mentally, by...the end of rehearsal he feels a lot better and I feel the same. I also associate orchestra with youth so the high school orchestra setting gave me quite a bit of nostalgia. I also appreciated the care the anime took in showing off each piece of music though I can see how it might drag for people who don\'t have a great interest in classical music. Also I\'m docking a few points for viola erasure (JK, but where were the violists?) I liked how it was presented almost as a sports anime in some ways because playing stuff like Dvorak is not light work. So, to end it off I can see how this anime might not appeal to everyone and how it can be seen as dull- there were some episodes were even I got a little bored- but if you are interested in classical music I think you\'ll enjoy this anime, especially if you\'ve played in some kind of youth orchestra in the past! the end of rehearsal he feels a lot better and I feel the same.

At first glance, you would think this show was created a decade ago and not in 2023. The art quality feels a lot worse than other shows. Hype/tense moments get completely killed by the use of 3D models. 5 episodes in and I'm fairly certain every single performance so far has been CGI.Hard to immerse yourself when the most important and focal point of the...series, the musical performance, is laughable.If you dislike CGI in anime as much as I do, this show is not for you. series, the musical performance, is laughable.If you dislike CGI in anime as much as I do, this show is not for you."", 'This anime feels like a cross over of ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" and ""Hibike! Euphonium"" but isn\'t particularly good at anything. It lacks in the drama part compared to ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"" and in the orchestra/music part compared to ""Hibike! Euphonium"". A lot of parts are filled with cliche and slow story development. The characters are mostly dull with the occasional event thrown in to make the story work. For the music part they could have added more pieces rather than repeat the same piece over and over. The animation is mixed with CGI which ruins the music performance since it can\'t...convey the intensity of the performance like ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"", ""Kono Oto Tomare!"" or ""Nodame Cantabile"" do.Overall it\'s a 5/10 for me. If it had less CGI and a more varied selection of pieces together with a bit more characters development it could have gotten a higher rating from me because the story is actually decent. convey the intensity of the performance like ""Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso"", ""Kono Oto Tomare!"" or ""Nodame Cantabile"" do.Overall it\'s a 5/10 for me.

Ever since I had the chance to finish watching Your Lie in April, classical music has been a type of music that I have always been aware of. Besides that, coming of age is another element that’s a good accompaniment to the music genre of anime, making it more interesting by depicting the story of youths dealing with their struggles and chasing their dreams. In my perspective, the anime does have some flaws in terms of animation, but the story telling was somehow beyond...average, and let’s talk about it later.The story begins by introducing the protagonist, Aono, who has an in-depth background and has suffered from family issues. Aono, who used to be a pro violinist when he was a child, has not played the violin for a long time due to his broken family. Not just Aono; the other characters from various backgrounds are also facing their own dilemmas. With that, the anime needs to be able to depict the emotion of each scene, and Blue Orchestra has done it quite well, in my opinion. The stability and consistency of delivering what is supposed to be received by the watcher are just fine and it keeps improving throughout the series. From a personal watching experience, the show does have an adequate capacity for each scene, and most of them are well arranged so that you will not feel as if the show has any missing parts.Other than that, Blue Orchestra also has its own decent moment that somehow gives me goosebumps. For example, Aono ultimately picked up playing “Canon” with violin at the riverside in episode 2, or during the audition that surprised everyone in episode 12. In all these scenes, the music plays a crucial role in enhancing the watching experience. As the show often displays the characters practicing their performances' pieces, the music has resonated frequently enough to make you remember it. For instance, the “New World Symphony” by Dvorak. Likewise, the OST was relaxing that it fits well with the tone and mood of each scene.It can’t be denied that the animation has some flaws; the character’s expression was off-model, but it’s slowly getting better, especially after the hiatus. The improvement has further enhanced the overall presentation of the plot. If you have noticed that there are some imaginary scenes being portrayed while a song has been played as if the characters are indulging in the music score. Besides, the background setting is rather attractive, which shows a lot of what a daily neighbourhood and street look like for a high school student in Japan to come across. Many of them are real-life locations in some parts of Japan, and it's just amazing to see a real location appear in anime that hopefully someday you could pay a visit. Familiar place in anime, Umimaku High School, but it’s called Chiba Prefectural Makuhari Sohgoh High School in real life.Putting the 3D animation aside, Blue Orchestra has been an awesome adaptation. Obstacles, collisions, growth within individuals, and friendship are what make this show good. It could be merely a mid-adaptation, but at the same time, it wasn’t bad at all. average, and let’s talk about it later.The story begins by introducing the protagonist, Aono, who has an in-depth background and has suffered from family issues.

In fact, it\'s just another average rom-com anime but with music.There are some interesting plot points. For one, the fact that the father is divorced instead of dead brings some uniqueness to it. Maybe in another episode he\'ll come back or something? And what about Haru who might have had a childhood crush on him? How did they know each other?

Takt Op. Destiny,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48556/Takt_Op_Destiny,"['Takt opt Destiny is a derivative greedy waifu bait that emerges from an intent of making a mixed-media project for a gacha game, how fitting by its nature. By using the collaboration of two extremely hyped studios that have an enormous catalogue of quality animation, be it MAPPA, and be it Madhouse, almost like the old school collaborating with the new school, like the Conrad Tokyo of the industry, the anime invited us to watch a visually appealing anime, but while it does so in one way or another because the animation is pleasing to look at, the whole anime sucks nevertheless, being one of...the tackiest that I’ve seen this year.There is a formula that will not fail in anime, or well, it hardly fails. The equation is “Music+Anime=Success”, you could make the most stupid, pandering or bait plot, but if you include music it could hit anyways, just watch how Your Lie in April succeeded while being a predictable and obviously manipulating anime with inhuman characters. To fail at such formula seems like something so out of reach that it dumbfounds me how the music aspect of this anime feels as forced as the research of an antivaxxer. It is terrible. There is a guy, that plays piano, but cant play it, because plot, and there are characters that are supposed to fight with the orders of the music conductors… but they fight with weapons anyways so the music is just background. That is, that is the music aspect, and don’t get me started about how this guy can only think about playing piano for the whole first 3 episodes, and how apparently his play should evoke something on us, how can it provoke something when this character is nothing more than an excuse to play piano and manipulate a waifu like a pokemon trainer. Yeah, I will just go to youtube and hear someone playing piano, it would be the same as this anime, or maybe it would be better, because I wouldn’t hear any of that annoying dialogue that has less deepness than the research of Valkyrae cream. Honestly, the only point of using music in this anime as a source of power is because they will eventually create a climax through music, like Vivy but replacing the annoying robot with an annoying blonde girlThen the next problem is that the characters are completely out of the concept of creativity, well, apart from their designs which are kind of attractive. Just let me explain it like this; the main trio is composed by an obsessive guy that wants to be free (To play music) and eliminate the D2, while also holding a special power given from the gods of plot that nobody knows how it works, it also has a girl that is extremely badass, edgy to the core, and fights extremely well, and a girl that serves as a bridge between them both and acts as a straight woman but would be better off dead because who cares about her. Now, which anime did this before? Maybe my brain is foggy, I would let you stick the pieces, I won’t attack that here, but I’m not saying that this titanic derivation is originated from there either, just telling how uninspired this is. And I’m not even going to start telling how every other single character is a mess, like seriously, a gay character that sexually harass the main character? a quirky loli character? What will they include next, a terminally ill musician that wants to hear music for the last time?Anyways, I have to be sincere, most of us didn’t really watch this abomination for the plot, just read the fucking premise, we all watched this because it was a MAPPA x Madhouse project, and the fact that this sucks hard is not because the plot and the characters are completely terrible and out of any conception of originality, this sucks hard because it is just a soulless attempt to sell us a product. The anime is not trying to tell us anything, it is just exposing over and over again an edgy waifu doing edgy shit in an edgy environment because that is what sells today, that is why this anime lacks creativity, because it is using proven formulas and concepts from the latest best-seller anime that have been going hard. If for some reason fighting with swimwear while riding a sausage was successful as a concept take it for granted that this anime would do it, and the main guy would be wearing a speedo the tackiest that I’ve seen this year.There is a formula that will not fail in anime, or well, it hardly fails.

Destiny may rival Fate/Apocrypha and Fate/Grand Order as the single most kludgy, embarrassing, confused mishmash of otaku-culture stew that the Japanese anime industry as ever attempted to pour down my throat. You have to be confident when you recognize vapidness to say, “This is vapid. There is nothing of value here. I cast it aside. I’m moving on with my life.” And this show desperately calls for that kind of an axe-grinding. If you can watch even the first episode of this gacha game commercial and see anything other than lifeless, artless, cynical trash appealing to the absolute lowest common denominator of the...anime community, then I imagine you'll be fine with anything it does or anywhere it goes so long as it continues to have waifubait and vaguely cool-looking, lopsidedly produced action scenes to keep you horny and awake. I beg you, please don’t take this the wrong way. I’m not trying to condescend. This is my genuine recommendation. Watch Takt Op. Destiny if you legitimately do not care about the quality of the anime you watch.Anime adaptations of manga, light novels, and even anime-original concepts have a story at their core and something they are trying to portray or convey while also attempting to expand the audience of the original work, but shows like this have nothing at their core except shitty mobile games designed to drain money from gullible pay pigs. This is a business model you should feel insulted to have aimed at you. It's why there's absolutely no creativity or originality in any of its story beats. As with all generalizations, exceptions exist—projects like Shingeki no Bahamut exist—projects rooted in gacha games where the producers gave the studio creative freedom and money to guarantee their audience be treated to high-quality TV anime they wouldn't have had otherwise, but Takt Op. Destiny is no such example. You can tell when a corporation just dumps money on a committee of burnt out writers and borderline enslaved animators, and they just vomit out whatever they last ate onto the animation frames. They are in it for the paycheck, as they frankly should be, and all you get is sterile, soulless mediocrity.The pitch meeting for this was just one executive going, “Guys…GUYS! What if we just…COMBINED Vivy and Fate?” While the rest of the board room proceeded to desperately try and mark their bank accounts while simultaneously suffering from violent orgasms. Every central element this series features is a shameless, boldfaced rip-off. Master/servant relationship; autistic kuudere waifu heroine; loudmouth ponytail tsundere who gives exposition dumps and advises the master/servant duo; self-insert MC on the ground looking up at the blonde, stoic, female warrior backed by the moonlit night sky. I mean, they literally got Takahiro Miura himself to storyboard that exact same shot from Fate/Stay Night into episode one of this shit. It’s like one producer went, “Shit! These otaku losers aren’t buying enough Saber merch anymore! How will I pay for my fourth yacht?!” And another one just said, “Dude, calm down. Just make her fourteen years old and stick her in a lolita road movie.” Then they had to make her an idol and add the music theme because POWER OF MUSIC GUYS MAKE SURE TO BUY OUR SOUNDTRACK!It rips-off Guilty Crown as well, but I hesitate to even bring this up, because comparing that gorgeous Production IG original to this pile of rat shit just feels insulting. Everyone who criticizes this show insists on saying, “Basically everything about this show sucks, but at least it has good animation.” But it doesn’t. It looks atrocious, and this isn’t just another case of, “Oh, 90% of the show looks cheap, but the action scenes are flashy enough to get kids hyped about it, therefore no one cares about its usual quality.” This is different. The action scenes themselves look bad. This was a joint production between Madhouse and MAPPA, and while the Madhouse episodes humiliate the MAPPA episodes, the Madhouse fight scenes still look fucking terrible, and it’s not always the fault of the animation—it’s the compositing, the cinematography, and the utter lack of consistent in-between frames. It tries so pathetically hard to copy how ufotable does their action sequences, but since its 2D animation is so choppy and off-model, all it can muster up is that horrific, abrasive, epilepsy-inducing digital effect spam they do.First of all, they use foreground focus to hide shitty digital background art. It’s like a bootlegged version the depth-of-field blur you see in KyoAni shows like Hibike! Euphonium or Violet Evergarden, only it's implemented in such a way you know is only done to hide bad compositing and hideous backgrounds. Next is the hazy cinematography. The Director of Photography was also DOP on Attack on Titan: The Final Season, and holy fucking shit, I could’ve told you that from a mile away. When it’s not assaulting your eyeballs with that ufotable digital effect spam, all the colors look so washed out and arid. It could very well be a stylistic choice, but it’s not stylized enough for that to be apparent. I don’t know if the compositing was done at Madhouse, MAPPA, or if it was outsourced, but if it was MAPPA, I wouldn’t be surprised, because while there was no laughably egregious shit like the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen running on air with CG backgrounds twirling around behind them, it’s not too far off. I invite you to go watch the first six or seven minutes of episode one so you can see everything I’m talking about.The only other projects this director has ever had any significant involvement with is a forgettable Nanoha continuation and Granblue Fantasy (another hollow, lifeless advertisement for some video game I have no interest in buying), and you can tell. Random monsters appear with no rhyme or reason outside of a few bare-bones mechanics necessary to facilitate tensionless fight sequences and ambiguous anime superpowers for our special chunni heroes to fight them with. No matter how much they try to gild it with recognizable studios, it's still just your everyday soulless gachashit. The MC has zero personality to better facilitate self-insertion by the gachabrain, his harem only grows as the show goes on, and every girl is cut from the exact same sheet of cardboard. As if idols fighting aliens through the power of music didn’t sound fucking retarded enough already, the scriptwriter’s god-awful track record stood strong, and everything about the screenwriting is a heap of trash fire. The dialogue is cringe inducing at times, and the character development is so incredibly surface level it hurts.Takt Op. Destiny is more corporate filth taken straight off the assembly line. Its main gist is to market some potentially profitable anime girl, so when they start pulling out the hamfisted dramatic backstories, I rolled my fucking eyes. I don't mind watching some tongue-in-cheek Fate rip-off if I have enough alcohol in my system, but slogging through paper-thin backstories for these non-characters who no one will ever remember or give a fuck about two days after the show’s finale just shows how the creators responsible for this garbage have no idea what the tone of their show is supposed to be. It’s the definition of lacking self-awareness. The ambient animation looks awful enough even without factoring in the blurry cinematography, the plot was nearly nonexistent, and where they did actually try to advance something it was terribly paced. Last but not least, the setting was criminally wasted. It was extremely jarring to see these people who were supposed to be saving the American countryside happily destroy people's homes and businesses and just laugh about it like callous, detached psychopaths.It’s a music themed anime where the BGM is completely lackluster. It felt like a series that needed someone like Hiroyuki Sawano but instead got music that is pretty generic. Yoshihiro Ike composed the soundtrack with ryo as the music producer, but the soundtrack never felt particularly outstanding. Sawano’s work may sound a little samey after a while, but his standout tracks are simply fantastic, and I don’t know anyone who wasn’t blow away by his output from 2009 to 2017. But ultimately, this show’s attempt to sell itself with music and classic orchestra just falls flat. Everything about it is totally insipid and lacking in any substance. When I first called this show a rip-off, I had to lure you in with big, famous names like Fate, Vivy, and Guilty Crown, but now that you’ve stuck around, I can finally reveal the series which Takt Op. Destiny rips-off the most. It’s called Shinkyouku Soukai Polyphonica. What’s that? You’ve never heard of it? Well, that’s good. The plagiarist hacks responsible for Takt Op. Destiny were counting on it. Fuck this show and everything it stands for. If Beethoven were still alive to see his work used in this way, he’d tear his eyes out so he could be deaf AND fucking blind.Thank you for reading. anime community, then I imagine you'll be fine with anything it does or anywhere it goes so long as it continues to have waifubait and vaguely cool-looking, lopsidedly produced action scenes to keep you horny and awake. I beg you, please don’t take this the wrong way. I’m not trying to condescend. This is my genuine recommendation. Watch Takt Op. Destiny if you legitimately do not care about the quality of the anime you watch.Anime adaptations of manga, light novels, and even anime-original concepts have a story at their core and something they are trying to portray or convey while also attempting to expand the audience of the original work, but shows like this have nothing at their core except shitty mobile games designed to drain money from gullible pay pigs. This is a business model you should feel insulted to have aimed at you. It's why there's absolutely no creativity or originality in any of its story beats. As with all generalizations, exceptions exist—projects like Shingeki no Bahamut exist—projects rooted in gacha games where the producers gave the studio creative freedom and money to guarantee their audience be treated to high-quality TV anime they wouldn't have had otherwise, but Takt Op. Destiny is no such example. You can tell when a corporation just dumps money on a committee of burnt out writers and borderline enslaved animators, and they just vomit out whatever they last ate onto the animation frames. They are in it for the paycheck, as they frankly should be, and all you get is sterile, soulless mediocrity.The pitch meeting for this was just one executive going, “Guys…GUYS! What if we just…COMBINED Vivy and Fate?” While the rest of the board room proceeded to desperately try and mark their bank accounts while simultaneously suffering from violent orgasms. Every central element this series features is a shameless, boldfaced rip-off. Master/servant relationship; autistic kuudere waifu heroine; loudmouth ponytail tsundere who gives exposition dumps and advises the master/servant duo; self-insert MC on the ground looking up at the blonde, stoic, female warrior backed by the moonlit night sky. I mean, they literally got Takahiro Miura himself to storyboard that exact same shot from Fate/Stay Night into episode one of this shit. It’s like one producer went, “Shit! These otaku losers aren’t buying enough Saber merch anymore! How will I pay for my fourth yacht?!” And another one just said, “Dude, calm down. Just make her fourteen years old and stick her in a lolita road movie.” Then they had to make her an idol and add the music theme because POWER OF MUSIC GUYS MAKE SURE TO BUY OUR SOUNDTRACK!It rips-off Guilty Crown as well, but I hesitate to even bring this up, because comparing that gorgeous Production IG original to this pile of rat shit just feels insulting. Everyone who criticizes this show insists on saying, “Basically everything about this show sucks, but at least it has good animation.” But it doesn’t. It looks atrocious, and this isn’t just another case of, “Oh, 90% of the show looks cheap, but the action scenes are flashy enough to get kids hyped about it, therefore no one cares about its usual quality.” This is different. The action scenes themselves look bad. This was a joint production between Madhouse and MAPPA, and while the Madhouse episodes humiliate the MAPPA episodes, the Madhouse fight scenes still look fucking terrible, and it’s not always the fault of the animation—it’s the compositing, the cinematography, and the utter lack of consistent in-between frames. It tries so pathetically hard to copy how ufotable does their action sequences, but since its 2D animation is so choppy and off-model, all it can muster up is that horrific, abrasive, epilepsy-inducing digital effect spam they do.First of all, they use foreground focus to hide shitty digital background art. It’s like a bootlegged version the depth-of-field blur you see in KyoAni shows like Hibike! Euphonium or Violet Evergarden, only it's implemented in such a way you know is only done to hide bad compositing and hideous backgrounds. Next is the hazy cinematography. The Director of Photography was also DOP on Attack on Titan: The Final Season, and holy fucking shit, I could’ve told you that from a mile away. When it’s not assaulting your eyeballs with that ufotable digital effect spam, all the colors look so washed out and arid. It could very well be a stylistic choice, but it’s not stylized enough for that to be apparent. I don’t know if the compositing was done at Madhouse, MAPPA, or if it was outsourced, but if it was MAPPA, I wouldn’t be surprised, because while there was no laughably egregious shit like the characters in Jujutsu Kaisen running on air with CG backgrounds twirling around behind them, it’s not too far off. I invite you to go watch the first six or seven minutes of episode one so you can see everything I’m talking about.The only other projects this director has ever had any significant involvement with is a forgettable Nanoha continuation and Granblue Fantasy (another hollow, lifeless advertisement for some video game I have no interest in buying), and you can tell. Random monsters appear with no rhyme or reason outside of a few bare-bones mechanics necessary to facilitate tensionless fight sequences and ambiguous anime superpowers for our special chunni heroes to fight them with. No matter how much they try to gild it with recognizable studios, it's still just your everyday soulless gachashit. The MC has zero personality to better facilitate self-insertion by the gachabrain, his harem only grows as the show goes on, and every girl is cut from the exact same sheet of cardboard. As if idols fighting aliens through the power of music didn’t sound fucking retarded enough already, the scriptwriter’s god-awful track record stood strong, and everything about the screenwriting is a heap of trash fire. The dialogue is cringe inducing at times, and the character development is so incredibly surface level it hurts.Takt Op. Destiny is more corporate filth taken straight off the assembly line. Its main gist is to market some potentially profitable anime girl, so when they start pulling out the hamfisted dramatic backstories, I rolled my fucking eyes. I don't mind watching some tongue-in-cheek Fate rip-off if I have enough alcohol in my system, but slogging through paper-thin backstories for these non-characters who no one will ever remember or give a fuck about two days after the show’s finale just shows how the creators responsible for this garbage have no idea what the tone of their show is supposed to be. It’s the definition of lacking self-awareness. The ambient animation looks awful enough even without factoring in the blurry cinematography, the plot was nearly nonexistent, and where they did actually try to advance something it was terribly paced. Last but not least, the setting was criminally wasted. It was extremely jarring to see these people who were supposed to be saving the American countryside happily destroy people's homes and businesses and just laugh about it like callous, detached psychopaths.It’s a music themed anime where the BGM is completely lackluster. It felt like a series that needed someone like Hiroyuki Sawano but instead got music that is pretty generic. Yoshihiro Ike composed the soundtrack with ryo as the music producer, but the soundtrack never felt particularly outstanding. Sawano’s work may sound a little samey after a while, but his standout tracks are simply fantastic, and I don’t know anyone who wasn’t blow away by his output from 2009 to 2017. But ultimately, this show’s attempt to sell itself with music and classic orchestra just falls flat. Everything about it is totally insipid and lacking in any substance.

I don't know about the next episodes, just I'll write my views only up to ep4.I follow this anime myself, but until episode 4, the story and characterization did not seem to reach a satisfactory level. Before examining the other strengths and weaknesses of the anime, I must say that this anime is at a very high level in terms of graphics, and if you are only looking for an anime with attractive graphic fights, see this work without reading other views.But if storytelling and characterization are important to you, I don't...think this anime can satisfy you much.As I said, I follow the anime myself, but I think this work is unable to progress in the story because it is original, and it may be boring and repetitive.Other weaknesses of the characterization that can be mentioned, the main character of this story and also the two girls next to him. For example, the main character's goals and feelings are very superficial and destiny's feelings are not understandable at all. The supporting characters of the story can not help the story as their place at all and look weak. The story may seem mysterious, but it leaves the viewer in only an aura of ambiguity, and the viewer cannot understand deeper into the ideals and goals of the main character. And the other thing that bothered me the most was the story villains. The story has not been able to address the D2s in any way. At least he could create creatures in these four episodes that would delight the viewer or create different types of these creatures, each of which has certain tangible abilities.Finally, I must say that it is possible to develop the anime in terms of story, but what is characteristic is that this anime is still a work that has powerful graphics but is empty from the inside, and this work is famous only because of destiny's face and clothes and the graphics. think this anime can satisfy you much.As I said, I follow the anime myself, but I think this work is unable to progress in the story because it is original, and it may be boring and repetitive.Other weaknesses of the characterization that can be mentioned, the main character of this story and also the two girls next to him.

Madhouse has an even more extensive history tracing all the way back to the 1970s. Fash forward to 2021 and the rest is history. When you put these two studios together to producer a quality show, what can go wrong? Well, let me tell you. A lot.Since the announcement in March this year, the franchise didn't really spark much hype at the time. After it was revealed that studio MAPPA and Madhouse would handle the production, the show got boosted interest. The previews and promotional...material speaks for itself, at least on a technical level. With a mixture of 2D and 3D artwork, Takt Op. Destiny did on some levels, take the world by storm. That doesn't make it an anime of the year contender but does bring in more eyeballs. But yet, somehow, they couldn't completely capitalize and became a shell of its technical accomplishment.Watching Takt Op. Destiny first felt like seeing a cinematic movie, at least for the first few episodes. The flashy fights, cinematic sequences, and overall chereography makes an impressive debut on the screen. Then, there's the plot dealing with a fictional enemy to humanity known as the D2. The show makes it clear that music plays a prominent role against them, and hence, we have two type of resistance: Conductor and Musicart. The story follows two prominent characters who play this role known to us as Takt Asahina and Cosette Schneider (aka Destiny.)Joining them also includes a girl named Anna, who plays a valuable role as an ally. Together, these three try to make a difference in the world as evidenced by their actions.At a fundamental level, Takt and Cosette shares a somewhat personal and professional relationship. Both characters get the job done when it calls for it but it's also clear that the duo has some interpersonal issues. For instance, Takt takes music perhaps too seriously and is generally considered anti-social with an indifferent attitude towards almost everything but music. Cosette can be brutally honest although she appears to be more friendlier than Takt when dealing with people. While the two are compatible, they form a peculiar character chemistry that I find to be confusing. It's hard to get emotionally attached to the pair when everything seems like clockwork. Almost every episode have them fight the D2 and the story rarely evolves from its base premise. There's some occasional background storytelling for them but ultimately, the show suffers from an engaging plot. Character development is limited as well when the majority of the show focuses them on taking missions. They work like robots day and night and even during off-time, following their adventures quickly grows into a chore. You may get entertained by Cosette's sharp tongue, witty humor, and sensational appetite towards sweets at times. But is that all the anime has to offer?Looking deeper into the anime, it feels like the show has little personal connection towards the main characters when they are doing their work. Every episode falls short in developing our cast. One somewhat unique element I do want to mention is the realistic settings of the modern world. Takt Op. Destiny almost feels like a futuristic dystopia at times but retains mostly a real feeling of familiarity. Settings such as Las Vegas are what we are familiar with while New York has its metropolis vibe. There's not too many places our characters journey across the world but it's safe to say that the anime has a degree of realism, despite all the otherworldly shenanigans.Outside of Takt and Cosette, the rest of the cast are ambigiously underdeveloped. I say this because it's difficult to feel invested about the characters. Even though they have their reasons for fighting (Lenny being a noticable example), they are often overshadowed by the plot's purpose or Takt and Cosette. That is to say, they are still somewhat important to the overall story but it's obvious from day one that the anime is mainly about Takt and Cosette. And for for better or worse, Anna feels more like a main supporting character than the middle girl of the trio. Acting as a big sister type for Cosette, the anime does go into some depth to show her kindness. The overall character chemistry is unfortunately, meek at best. Oh and before you ask, this anime does not have any real romance. You may get a surprise at how Anna responds to Takt near the end of the story, but overall, don't expect any sort of love to bloom between the main characters. Takt and Cosette aren't in this show to start a relationship. No way.Even though it's been mentioned already, Takt Op. Destiny's most outstanding feature is its technical accomplishment. It's one of the few CGI/2D art mixed anime that I've been impressed by in recent years. The colorful visuals sometimes reminds me of ufotable for their high level production. This is especially true in the first few episodes that looks and feels like a movie. Character designs are also highly decorated for the Musicarts with Cosette/Destiny being the poster girl. Even the D2 in this anime inspires a sense of fear with their monstrous look and impact of their actions. And overall, the road-trip like story adventure takes us to realistic places around the world. Take some notes, Tesla Note.Takt Op. Destiny is the type of show that had a fantastic start but began to degrade over time, with each episode, to the point where it never managed to truly recover itself. Maybe some people set higher expectations than me after watching the promotional material.

What are the most prominent features that comes to mind when Japan always has these type of mixed-media anime that just basically exists just to promote the numerous amout of mobile games at their disposal?Is it the concept that\'s derived from the setting basis of the mobage?Is it the characters that are meant to bait the viewer into purchasing them like DLC after watching the anime?Is it the ""original"" wack writing concept of the story, plot and characters?Is it the subpar animation that makes and/or breaks the experience?Is it the mediocre OST that more than skipping...the OP/ED, just didn\'t do enough for enticement?Is it the actual mobage that it being influenced from the anime\'s promotion, tends to always suck, because you don\'t live in Japan and/or are thankful that Japan banks heavily on these subpar games and you wish to not have a hand on the game?This season, look no further than the over-hyped and under-delivered Takt Op. Destiny, a show that\'s meant to promote Bandai Namco and DeNA\'s brand new {tákt: op.} musical sci-fi action mobage in Japan, and that the only thing that will catch people\'s eyes is the collab between two well-established studios for such a mixed-media project that\'s the ""best of the best"" of mobage adaptations ever seen yet. Be VERY honest, a MAPPA x Madhouse project we will all not shun our attention from, but it\'s the same tried-and-true formula to sell a product that only Japan will enjoy, and we the audience living elsewhere just couldn\'t give two flying effs about the mobage, our critique is only based on the anime which is just the same wash, rinse and repeat marketing ploy.This marketing ploy consists of a story where ""The Music is Already Dead"" because of monsters called ""D2"", produced by a black meteorite containing Black Night Siderites which fell from the sky, hating humanly-produced music and drawn to the music source to attempt destruction, as it\'s the only thing that can ensure their decimation. To the defense, the New York Symphonica created ""Musicarts,"" young girls drawn and inspired from classical music sheets that are directed by human ""Conductors"". Should be easy to digest, but given the usual fanfare of mobage adaptations, this is very basic.The marketing ploy is supported by its main characters: Takt Asahina, Destiny and Anna Schneider. A music geek and a piano genius, Takt comes off as being an aloof, inert and misanthropic, compared to his father Kenji, who was a famous conductor before the situational pipeline of the D2s took a toll on his life. The Musicart to the Conductor is Destiny, or otherwise known as Cosette, the younger sister of the Schneider sisters that\'s borne from Beethoven\'s Symphony No. 5. Cosette used to be an easy-going, happy-go-lucky girl living with her older sister Anna, before the freak accident with encountering the D2s while playing classical music with Takt on the streets caused her to lose her memories and rebirth as the Musicart Destiny. But this chain reaction wasn\'t a clean process, and if at any time that Destiny is called forth, Takt transforms his right arm into a conductor\'s baton, while corruption seeps slowly through his entire being. The more the unstable Destiny is utilized, the worse the corruption spread. Anna on the other hand, acts as an in-between parental guide between Takt and Destiny, while searching for a way to turn the latter back to the younger sister that she knows.With bits and pieces of character development, these somewhat decent characters can be likable, especially for the Musicarts which are bait-and-switch waifus due to their unique designs done by the one and only LAM. One such example lies from yet another Musicart-Conductor pairing: Leonard ""Lenny"" Flyheart and Titan. The former is a former Symphonica conductor whose existence is thanks to Takt\'s father Kenji, whom influenced him to take the music route until his unfortunate death from the D2s, and the latter borne from Mahler\'s Symphony No. 1 is a carefree soul whom speaks with onomatopoeic behaviour , and is a serious fighter. Arguably the only pair of characters that truly fits the adage of ""action speaks more than words"", it\'s easy to get invested into both characters, from being tutors to both Takt and Destiny to the occasional downtime.The New York Symphonica on the other hand, I\'m not the only one who feels that the villain plot is so wasted on these guys whom have such a reputation of an organization behind their backs. The opportunity to correct the tides of time became its utmost failure, because the Symphonica are nothing more than your stereotypical coporate dogs meant to serve for the greater good while easily hiding true intentions behind the face of the organization. The CEO of the Symphonica, Sagan, does at least feel like a decent villain with that much backing and power on his hand. Felix Schindler on the other hand, he\'s the worst offender of the ""lot"" commanding the unassigned Musicart Valkyrie/Walküre that\'s borne from Wagner\'s Die Walküre for his own gain. Yep, talk about dull, uninspired, and ""trying"" to insert more hype musical waifus to promote their character worth playing for the mobage.This is all pinned to series composer Kiyoko Yoshimura, of which her writing skills really aren\'t all that spectacular to begin with. Her recent works of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series and being the in-house series composer to many more recent MAPPA works (Granblue Fantasy S2, God of High School, Koi to Producer: EVOL×LOVE) just proves time and time again that she only keeps getting worse at her scriptwriting and composing craft, of which it all culminates to affect this show in its rear-headed ugliness.The only advantage (that comes back to bite all involved) of Takt Op. Destiny being in the visuals and animation, even that is a misnomer in and of itself. I\'d already expect that this mobage adaptation is a rather high-profile one because of the collaboration between MAPPA and Madhouse, but don\'t let that ever sway your overall expectations of the entire show as a whole. Being another show part of the endless sweatshop schedule of MAPPA announced at their 10th Anniversary Stage event, I\'d not be surprised that the studio is firing all guns at whatever they have, it does not take away the fact that MAPPA has turned from a quality studio to a desperate corporate shill of quantity that there\'s no more substantial evidence enough to shield them. It\'s good that Madhouse is back to showcase the quality that we\'ve come to expect from the studio that has been in hiatus for a year, but MAPPA, you\'ve shat yourselves up big-time this time.The unmistakable ""we all agree this is good"" part will lie in the music department, that is a central focus to the show...in name only because of the Musicart origins. The OST is impressive no doubt, that\'s really expected of the OP composed by Supercell\'s ryo feat. Mafumafu and gaku, and Mika Nakashima\'s ED. But this is a case of quantity over quality, and as much as the music really shines in its bombastic glamour, it will always be overshadowed of the fact that the entire show just tries too hard to stand out even with all the pompous hits that manages to stick out more than most.So there you have it: a very new, just released mobage that unexpectedly had the highest of high of budgets that I\'ve seen ever in subpar adaptations, only for that same subpar-ness to slowly seep into the entire show quite expectedly. Never thought that I\'d pay so much attention to the regular shitty mobage adaptation that the anime industry has for years, and Takt Op. Destiny adds a number to the same reception that mobage-to-anime adaptations should not exist as mere promo material quality. A disappointment this is too easy to dismiss, but we the audience should learn this one thing: learn to not put insanely high expectations, of which the majority will never, ever learn to get out of this ruse. the OP/ED, just didn\'t do enough for enticement?Is it the actual mobage that it being influenced from the anime\'s promotion, tends to always suck, because you don\'t live in Japan and/or are thankful that Japan banks heavily on these subpar games and you wish to not have a hand on the game?This season, look no further than the over-hyped and under-delivered Takt Op.

Cosette used to be an easy-going, happy-go-lucky girl living with her older sister Anna, before the freak accident with encountering the D2s while playing classical music with Takt on the streets caused her to lose her memories and rebirth as the Musicart Destiny. But this chain reaction wasn\'t a clean process, and if at any time that Destiny is called forth, Takt transforms his right arm into a conductor\'s baton, while corruption seeps slowly through his entire being. The more the unstable Destiny is utilized, the worse the corruption spread. Anna on the other hand, acts as an in-between parental guide between Takt and Destiny, while searching for a way to turn the latter back to the younger sister that she knows.With bits and pieces of character development, these somewhat decent characters can be likable, especially for the Musicarts which are bait-and-switch waifus due to their unique designs done by the one and only LAM. One such example lies from yet another Musicart-Conductor pairing: Leonard ""Lenny"" Flyheart and Titan. The former is a former Symphonica conductor whose existence is thanks to Takt\'s father Kenji, whom influenced him to take the music route until his unfortunate death from the D2s, and the latter borne from Mahler\'s Symphony No. 1 is a carefree soul whom speaks with onomatopoeic behaviour , and is a serious fighter. Arguably the only pair of characters that truly fits the adage of ""action speaks more than words"", it\'s easy to get invested into both characters, from being tutors to both Takt and Destiny to the occasional downtime.The New York Symphonica on the other hand, I\'m not the only one who feels that the villain plot is so wasted on these guys whom have such a reputation of an organization behind their backs. The opportunity to correct the tides of time became its utmost failure, because the Symphonica are nothing more than your stereotypical coporate dogs meant to serve for the greater good while easily hiding true intentions behind the face of the organization. The CEO of the Symphonica, Sagan, does at least feel like a decent villain with that much backing and power on his hand. Felix Schindler on the other hand, he\'s the worst offender of the ""lot"" commanding the unassigned Musicart Valkyrie/Walküre that\'s borne from Wagner\'s Die Walküre for his own gain. Yep, talk about dull, uninspired, and ""trying"" to insert more hype musical waifus to promote their character worth playing for the mobage.This is all pinned to series composer Kiyoko Yoshimura, of which her writing skills really aren\'t all that spectacular to begin with. Her recent works of the Cardfight!! Vanguard G series and being the in-house series composer to many more recent MAPPA works (Granblue Fantasy S2, God of High School, Koi to Producer: EVOL×LOVE) just proves time and time again that she only keeps getting worse at her scriptwriting and composing craft, of which it all culminates to affect this show in its rear-headed ugliness.The only advantage (that comes back to bite all involved) of Takt Op. Destiny being in the visuals and animation, even that is a misnomer in and of itself. I\'d already expect that this mobage adaptation is a rather high-profile one because of the collaboration between MAPPA and Madhouse, but don\'t let that ever sway your overall expectations of the entire show as a whole. Being another show part of the endless sweatshop schedule of MAPPA announced at their 10th Anniversary Stage event, I\'d not be surprised that the studio is firing all guns at whatever they have, it does not take away the fact that MAPPA has turned from a quality studio to a desperate corporate shill of quantity that there\'s no more substantial evidence enough to shield them. It\'s good that Madhouse is back to showcase the quality that we\'ve come to expect from the studio that has been in hiatus for a year, but MAPPA, you\'ve shat yourselves up big-time this time.The unmistakable ""we all agree this is good"" part will lie in the music department, that is a central focus to the show...in name only because of the Musicart origins. The OST is impressive no doubt, that\'s really expected of the OP composed by Supercell\'s ryo feat. Mafumafu and gaku, and Mika Nakashima\'s ED. But this is a case of quantity over quality, and as much as the music really shines in its bombastic glamour, it will always be overshadowed of the fact that the entire show just tries too hard to stand out even with all the pompous hits that manages to stick out more than most.So there you have it: a very new, just released mobage that unexpectedly had the highest of high of budgets that I\'ve seen ever in subpar adaptations, only for that same subpar-ness to slowly seep into the entire show quite expectedly. Never thought that I\'d pay so much attention to the regular shitty mobage adaptation that the anime industry has for years, and Takt Op. Destiny adds a number to the same reception that mobage-to-anime adaptations should not exist as mere promo material quality. A disappointment this is too easy to dismiss, but we the audience should learn this one thing: learn to not put insanely high expectations, of which the majority will never, ever learn to get out of this ruse.', '""What is a good character nowdays?""""Well, it\'s one that\'s dynamic.""...""okay, I don\'t see any way to change this character, can we just kill her and make a new one?""""Yeah and such an dramatic turn of events will drastically effect the other characters as well.""...""Then let\'s just stow all character developement into 10 seconds (combined) in one episode, the ""sudden action"" and ""realization"", then we don\'t have to go through it for the later episodes to come""""Sounds great""...MyAnimelist ranking: ""This is a good watch""...This show had an ineresting plot point, but failed to execute it, and they can\'t fix that and it won\'t change.

We’re essentially thrown into a beautifully rendered world brought to life by MAPPA and Madhouse, told there’s a war between humans and aliens who hate music, and made to fend for ourselves. In fairness, the backstory is fleshed Outstanding a bit more, but that doesn’t mean the writing gets much better. This show honestly felt like a tech demo for new animation and storyboarding techniques. Like imagine those Unreal Engine 5 play-tests, but...in anime form. If that’s what the creators were going for, they certainly succeeded. From the very first episode’s first few minutes I was blown away by the attention to the detail of the artists who worked on the show. It’s not exaggerating to say that Takt OP. has some of the best animation ever in the medium. Unfortunately, it doesn’t have the story to back it up.That said, story is important, but it’s not everything. You can definitely enjoy an anime that has a weak story, that’s not a crime. I really did enjoy seeing Takt and Destiny grow together over the course of the anime. I found a lot of similarities between their relationship and Artoria and Emiya from the Fate series. In fact, the whole musicart/maestro dynamic seems like it’s taken straight from the Type-Moon universe. The ending was “ok” at best, but I still felt most of the characters got a decent conclusion to their arcs. The writing just wasn’t really good from the beginning for them to get much better. Even though this isn’t the strongest show out there, I did have a lot of fun with it. The fights, slice of life and overall artistic quality made it an enjoyable experience and I definitely think everyone should check the anime out, if only for the sakuga.Takt Op. Destiny is somewhat of a preview of the future of anime. I think some time in the not too distant future, shows will consistently be made with this type of artistic quality. It also seems like collaborative efforts between studios are becoming more common. This means more staff working on a project, less stress on staff and a better product for consumers.

A win win for everyone.Takt gets 7 pianos out of 10.', 'Takt Op. Destiny was one of the most disappointing shows in 2021. Ambitious project involving cooperation between two of the most beloved studios in the anime industry (Mappa and Madhouse) turned out to be a simple eye candy with no substance or depth in it... Probably most regretful thing about it all is how much potential this story has in it:Musical themes, awesome waifus, complex story and lore, interesting characters, great action.Unfortunately authors fall short to deliver high quality writing to back this premise up and instead we get:Failed musical themes, hollow waifus, bad story with inconsequential lore, blank or awful characters, meaningless action with...confusing combat system.Takt Op. Destiny is placed in a post apocalyptic world where earth was showered by mysterious magic stones, first ones were harmless with some mysterious power in them, but then came the EVIL STONES. It looks like bad stones spawned evil monsters known as D2\'s which hate music for some reason. When humanity was on the brink of collapse Magicarts and Conductors showed up (show never explained how they were created btw), which had the power of GOOD STONES and managed to save United States and presumably rest of the world (idk this show doesn\'t care about other countries). Now D2\'s are coming back and we need to live in a dystopian reality where merciless government prevents us from listening to music... because apparently in the year 2047 they have no headphones. If this sounds like a convoluted premise don\'t worry, it isn\'t important for most of the series.Visually Takt op. is a colorful assault on your eyes.This anime tries to look great and distinctive while failing at both with a third of the environments consists of deserts, which gets boring fast. They also somehow managed to make fights that feel like they had a lot of effort put into them while looking mediocre at best.Music and sound of this anime are pretty good, matching circumstances and with nice feel to it. This alone would be good enough for most other animes but not in this instance. As a show with music as its main theme, Takt op. hardly does enough to develop this idea.Story is centered around a musician, with characters born from music in a world without music, but it is important how authors miss opportunities to elevate their ideas further while also giving them some meaning.The most important idea of this show (conductor musicart relationship) is bad.Musicart is basically a female transformed by the power of music, after which she becomes a weapon to fight D2\'s. Conductors on the other hand are made up of normal human males which use musicarts as tools while enhancing their abilities (I don\'t know if there is a story reason behind those genders being assigned to those roles, as musicarts are more numerous and with more interesting designs I suspect it is simply to make more waifus). How do conductors use musicarts? By waving their sticks around. This is a problems and a missed opportunity, why leave music out of combat? First thing that comes to mind is to have conductors use instruments which would give them something interesting to do instead of sitting in the back with their sticks while doing nothing. This whole stick thing relegates music in action to just being a soundtrack.Second problem is with inconsistency of this relationship. We are told that conductors are there to boost musicart\'s abilities, but... when Takt (mc) uses his conductor stick his magicart sometimes does a different somewhat stronger kind of attack and sometimes she doesn\'t and sometimes she does strong attacks without Takt and his stick movements.We also have a bunch of magicarts running around without conductors while fighting with high efficiency even beating musicarts which are supported by conductors. We are told how this should work, but see something completely different which ends up making everything confusing and makes outcomes of fights unpredictable in a very bad way. This also raises a question ""are conductors even necessary?""Someone might say that we have a good example of how conductor can be useful as a commander in the back who can observe the entire situation, but musicarts aren\'t dumber than humans... if all you need is a commander then just make few teams of musicarts with one commanding the rest. In this situation not only such a musicart can defend herself and won\'t need protection, but also when fight gets heated she can attack as wellSo in combat musical themes are undeveloped and the whole \'no music\' problem is so bad that authors had to literally delete the existence of headphones. How about characters?We have Takt an introverted person with a tragic background, he is also an unlikeable and uncaring psychopath who needs to play on piano so much that he will do it even if someone will be put in the risk of death because of him, while also making himself completely responsible for a lot of destroyed property. He tries to write music from time to time, but this thread goes nowhere..Then we have Cosette or Destiny later on who becomes Takt\'s Musicart (why she transforms into a musicart? never explained). She probably had most potential in our main trio for being somewhat interesting, but then anime turned her into basically a robot which over time is becoming slightly interesting. But it is cool because this robot of a character is here to be cute! Look, she just accidentally blew up our house! Look, she came out through window instead of using the door! Look, she loves sweets!!! Isn\'t that cute?!And then there is Anna with no character development, she is here just to care for our protagonists and scold them from time to time. Anime is also hinting her romantic interest in Takt (with whom she has sibling like relationship) at 11th episode out of nowhere... so that\'s something I guess.Are those characters an embodiment of musical animes? You decide. So what about character development that we do have?Takt goes from piano psycho to piano maniac who now cares about some people. Destiny becomes somewhat human while also getting recognized as a person. Thats it. Plus this growth isn\'t even executed that nicely, you would think that someone would at least try to challenge Takt\'s love for music but no. They even made an antagonist who hates music and created an opportunity for some meaningful conflict, this would require good writing tho...You also need to know that this anime loves to waste your time making artificial problems for a while only to forget about them when action is about to kick in (they literally had started episode with few minutes of examining their destroyed car which then magically repairs itself when they abruptly have to get to the place of action) or sending protagonists on a series of side quests(New Orleans).Anime as a whole seriously slows down at least two times which is very puzzling taking into consideration how much it later speeds up in last episodes. The end of this story is rushed to say the least. We have two finale antagonists, where we know almost nothing about the first one and didn\'t know that the second one existed at all until the 11th episode. I mean how can you take things so slowly if you are planning to make such a convoluted and complex finale? There is also the third antagonist that I didn\'t mention which shows up before the climax and let me tell you he is one of the most insulting characters I\'ve seen in a while.This moron has so many issues that I decided to write an entire spoiler rant at the end of this review, if you don\'t feel like reading it all you need to know is that he is basically a very annoying, psycho version of Thanos with even dumber idea of how to use his power to change the world that is of course rightfully his.It is worth mention how convenient this show is for its plot. Characters randomly and without reason find each other all the time and Destiny sometimes will feel where Takt is but not when he is following her and so on.If after all of this you still want to watch at least the first episode let me spoil it for you. It also nicely encompases what happenes in a typical episode of this anime when there is some action.Intro starts saying that \'not too long ago\' there was a post apocalyptic event of which anime shows no signs in landscape (maybe I\'m overly interpreting how catastrophic this event was). Than there is a lot of talking about stones from sky and their \'mysterious powers\' musicarts and conductors apparently use powers of those stones. Then came the black stones and with them D2\'s, but fortunately humanity had conductors as well as their magicarts (according to what we see in this into in those days both conductors and magicarts where able to fly.). Afterwards they saved humanity from D2\'s. If you finished this series there is a large chance that you forgot about all of this, which just shows how unimportant this sequence is.Okay we passed the intro, first episode at a second watch is a really confusing experience which I will try to recreate here.So you start watching and apparently Takt and destiny decided to lure a single D2 into the city while endangering civilians instead of killing it in the wilderness. They do it with a piano that just sits there in public, in a perfect condition, where some random kiddo can press one key and doom this whole town. What is even stranger, Destiny was fighting this one D2 outside the city without being transformed. So they actually started fighting D2 outside, but then Takt was like screw this shit I\'m out and went to play piano? WHAT!? And then Takt teleports on top of the roof and we have a fight. After the fight it turns out that to kill D2\'s you have to destroy a stone in their chest which after this episode will never be shown again or have any importance at all. We get some bad attempt at comedy, which is followed by dialogue with Destiny, who scolds her \'maestro\' leading to a back and forth between them. She also says something about tuning her adjustment when they will reach New York, which is never brought up again. After that comes Anna to scold Takt, apparently they were shopping and then we somehow got into this situation. WHAT!? Later on we are also shown that Takt (as I guess \'special\' conductor) can sense D2\'s which in few episodes will be forgotten. This level of confusion and bad writing will be consistent throughout this whole series (in episodes without much filler) with always somewhat similar dynamics between characters as seen here.Takt Op. Destiny is a bad anime at almost every level and at best passable in terms of action scenes if you are willing to accept that for the sake of those fights you can watch it, I just have to warn you that it isn\'t a battle anime full of those fights.Now it is time for my SPOILER RANT about Schindler.Schindler is one of the worst and laziest anime antagonists i have seen in a while...Obviously he is one of those boring psychos full of ego who believes that music is stupid and world doesn\'t need it (because why not) and that he is the only one fit to RULE THIS WORLD. One of his most ridiculous ideas is to kill of all the poor people because USA doesn\'t have enough resources tosustain them so he uses power of his musicart to control D2\'s and kill all those pesky peasants.If authors made him at least a tiny bit smarter Schindler would come up with a much better idea of using Hell (his magicart) to draw D2\'s far away from human settlements reclaiming a lot of usa, making room for more farmland and getting support of the people in Schindler\'s future takeover of the government. Instead he is losing more lands to D2\'s making his future realm weaker, getting rid of even more limited recources they have and creating a refugee crisis that affects all leftover prosperous lands left in america, how those actions helped our antagonist in his goals? Of course Schindler is just a puppet, but to be a puppet while doing something so stupid irritates me greatly.It is also dumb how they made Hell ignore Schindler\'s orders which breaks rules of this world. She herself said that musicart bound to a conductor can\'t ignore his will. Sure it is possible that she lied, but it would imply that it is hard to check this information, which it isn\'t. All you have to do is to give an order to your Musicart. With how easy it is to check it, knowledge if Conductors can control magicarts fully or not should be widespread.Takt first goes from only thinking about his music composition, to then having a totally different mindset where he\'s motivated and committed to fighting Schindler. And then after Schindler is at his mercy Takt just doesn\'t really care.Also if you think that sticks are useful than watch 10th episode.Lenny is using his stick, Takt is using his stick through half of the fight, Sagan just stands there. Who wins? Sagan... sticks don\'t matter.I could go much deeper in this review, but it would require more time then was spent into writing this anime. confusing combat system.Takt Op.

And then after Schindler is at his mercy Takt just doesn\'t really care.Also if you think that sticks are useful than watch 10th episode.Lenny is using his stick, Takt is using his stick through half of the fight, Sagan just stands there. Who wins? Sagan... sticks don\'t matter.I could go much deeper in this review, but it would require more time then was spent into writing this anime.', 'Well what can I say ... at some point in my life, music became something I couldn\'t go a day without. Now, I don\'t really listen to classical music but I have a huge appreciation to the people who created all those masterpieces. In this anime, we can hear A LOT of different classical music pieces that suit incredibly well in the scenes they are played at!I love how many scenes, just as ""Titan\'s finale"", Lenny starts playing 4th/Final movement of the 1st symphony of Gustav Mahler - which funnily enough, this symphony has the nickname ""Titan"" - how cool is that?Obviously there are...a lot of other interesting musical moments throughout the show, which will take a long while for ma to list, but what I can say is that, Takt Op. Destiny is one unique anime that contain a little bit of everything with the biggest impact being - music.

Then I started analysing the story, art, music, characters, the lot. And what I found was most of them are either very good or very bad.STORY (3/10)What was Takt\'s original goal again? It is to save the young girl. But halfway through the show it seemed like the show forgot all of that. 2 villains appeared. First one was a one-dimensional, power hungry villain who got defeated in 1 episode and was never heard of again. The second one is...a guy whose motivation did not serve any purpose to Takt\'s journey and goal whatsoever.The plot is all over the place. Every episode felt disconnected. We were given backstories that create more questions than answers. It felt like the writers came up with the premise and then struggled to think of what to do with it. And the result is a story that felt like the first draft and a plot full of holes.SOUND (9/10)The music is incredible. As expected from a musical anime.CHARACTER (6/10)I feel that they managed to do the bare minimum to make me at least root for the protagonists. Takt and Destiny had good chemistry. The characters themselves are just barely decent. Destiny was totally emotionless at the beginning but start to develop feelings especially to Takt. And Takt had at least the determination to save the world and music.Other characters are written terribly. Especially the villains. The fight with the first one felt like a side quest. It had no connection to the story. It\'s just a guy who is jealous of Takt and he is power hungry. No emotional threat. Same goes with the 2nd villain. I know he caused the death of Takt\'s father and Lenny, but Takt killing him felt empty. And despite the long conversation between Takt and the 2nd villain in the final episode, I had trouble trying to understand what the villain\'s motivation is.PLOT HOLESWhat happened to Destiny?What happened to the 1st villain?How does the crystal that controls the D2s work?We will never know.OVERALL (6/10)It succeeds in animation and music. The duo protagonists have good chemistry. But the story is not good. The villain backstory in the final episode felt like it was made up in the last minute.

Remember how much it brought to the table, only to fall flat on it's face with it's concept, and be a complete and utter mess? Well you'll be pleased to know, that this show isn't that, and is actually WAY more interesting, and way more polished then Listeners ever could've hoped to be.Sure, both shows have their own styles, so I can't take too many jabs on it, but as someone at the time, who I had recently watched Smyphogear, and got to liking this idea of music and fighting being connected within an...anime, I was seriously disappointed with how Listeners came out. Takt on the other hand, is a massive step up on Listeners, and is a rather enjoyable watch from start to finish, let me explain why I believe that.The story, and the characters, along with the overall presentation of the show in general.The story feels so much more deep, and thought out. Imagine a world that has basically BANNED music, and leaving future generations to not know what music is, or even have heard such. All because of the emergence of D2. An invasive species originating from a black meteorite that fell to Earth, and to prevent any further deaths, music and melodies alike, has basically been outlawed.  With the only defense being Musicarts, young women representing pieces of classical music; and Conductors, the ones controlling them.But that, combined with the mystery of the D2s, and also how the Musicarts are basically came into existence, is all interesting and deep. To the point it makes you want to watch more, to find out so much more about it. You only have to take episode 2-3, to really see for yourself, just how deep this mystery goes, and how certain moments, can really hit you right in the feels. Some really thought provoking stuff I can tell you.That doesn't even tell you about the characters. While a show like Listeners can seem more child like in a way, Takt feels more adult like with it's characters. But also treating them like such. Even if they may seem a little too cold in some cases with some of them, it's their more deep backgrounds, that really set the scene, but they're a great cast so far, to the point because of how they're written, that you would want to see more of them, and what they come up against. Combine that with the good writing in this show, then you have a recipe for success.The art style is another high point for sure. Sure, the animation can look a little weird and janky in small cases. But in terms of presentation of backgrounds, the characters looks, and the shadowing and such. Then it all looks splendid and top notch. Being bright when it needs to, and dark and gritty when it needs to be such.  Top tier quality stuff. Much like the sound in general, a lot of is super fitting for purpose, and the OP song is just a jam. All good.Takt is one of the animes of the season for sure.

I tried so *very* hard to enjoy Takt, the first 3 episodes was some of my favorite content to come out of Anime this year. Takt\'s musical prowess paired with the incredibly apt classical music and composer bias, alongside the absolutely outstanding sound design of the early episodes was incredible to experience. The music bled the emotion and passion of the characters that brought it to life, the action was punchy and wonderfully choreographed, the characters were simple and easy to get behind but had...plenty of potential, especially with the intertwining of Destiny and Takt. There\'s so many wondrous things that these first three episodes bring viewers, and it screams of what could have been endless potential and a contender for Anime of the Season, at the very least, and at best a beacon of hope for mixed media projects and Anime Originals. The keyword in the previous sentence was \'could\', if that wasn\'t clear. It *could* have done all of that, but decided to not and instead embarked on the most confusing, hair pulling, heart crushing, train wreck of a story that\'s a spider\'s web of media tropes and pathetic attempts at advertising to hopefully convince a few poor souls to attempt to throw money at a mobile game that\'s been delayed indefinitely.One of my biggest gripes with where Takt Op. Destiny went was its music. There\'s some great pieces in there, and previously there was some good theory around *why* specific pieces of classical music were played and what their importance was to each character, but that was before that world came crashing down. Original pieces with concrete meaning in the scenes that they\'re played in are replaced with a pathetic attempt to incur ""immediate nostalgia"". That means that they replay the same pieces of music over and over and over in a desperate attempt to capture your attention as the show basically screams, ""Hey! Hey! This music was used in that one part early on that you *really* liked, right? We\'re using it here so you should like this part too!"". Not only is it monotonous and incredibly low-effort for an Anime that markets itself as ""all about music"", it\'s depressing. Music is such an awe-inspiring thing in life. There\'s rhyme and reason to it such that there\'s obvious paths to take with it, but despite the semi-concreteness of the profession an Artificial Intelligence can\'t make music. There\'s something incredibly human to it that can’t be recreated without a heart or soul. Rather than make full use of those two aspects of humanity, Takt decides that it’ll pick the ‘10 Best Classical Pieces’ and interweave it with a disparagingly small amount of original music. Episode 1 had a great symphony piece that, to my ears, seemed original. Episode two brought us some prohibition style piano music, and after that… after that. Nothing really came after that. There was *maybe* one or two more original pieces in the series that were actually used with the intention of *being* music, rather than just weak background noise, and if you’re lucky it might be something modern sounding like the heavy metal of episode 5 which feels woefully out of place aside a pair of classically inspired musicarts. Any important music that pretended to have any use in the anime itself was shamelessly reused, and/or entirely limited to classical music. Where’s *more* prohibition-era music? There’s a Musicart that seems to have their character designed loosely inspired by the era, but they don’t get combat soundtracks like Destiny and Takt. There’s an entire rebellion waiting to happen against the censoring of music, I mean, how many bands are out there that challenge that sort of stuff? Rage Against The Machine Anyone? Run The Jewels? There’s a plethora of artists and styles to draw from for some absolutely incredible pieces and inspired Musicarts for rebellion, which you’d *think* would be a big piece in a story where music is entirely censored while the rich get the okay on it (will cover that later), but it’s nowhere to be found. There’s even musicarts called Heaven and Hell, but no religious inspired music. Walkure (In English: Valkyrie) is even a thing, but not once do you hear anything resembling Die Walkure or any other Valkyrie related music.I could probably write this entire review just purely based off the egregious offenses in regards to music, but that doesn’t paint an accurate picture. So you’re not a huge fan of music or its accompanying theory and meanings, that’s fine, that’s cool not a problem. We then enter the next stage of the problem, Waifus. Sure some series are better off for it and it’s the premise of them because they’re satire, parody, ecchi, etc. Takt is none of those things, but it hints that it *really* wants to be. All the Musicarts are women, nice and easy red flag. We didn’t see any other ones until later down the road, first pair we see is a man and a woman like Takt and Destiny, that’s fine it’s his mentor so they can be similar. More and more Musicarts get introduced and they all continue to follow that pattern, there’s not a single male Musicart, nor is there a female conductor. It’s a simple problem, with a *really* simple solution. Instead though, they went full steam ahead on using the Musicart as half-hearted advertisement to appeal to the basest of desires and interests. There’s never even an *attempt* at an explanation as to why they can only be women. So maybe you can get past the female only cast of Musicarts, credit to you for finding a way to power through, but you get to the next issue. Cookie-Cutter personalities. I was fine with Destiny when it was *just* Destiny, with each new Musicart they added another painful stereotypical and one dimensional personality to the grab bag of Build-Your-Waifu. There’s the Kuudere, The Tsundere (which as a bonus *also* includes the public morals committee personality aspect!), The Yandere, and get this, they even went full circle to add another Kuudere. Oh, and there’s a Loli as well of course. It’s just such blatant advertisement and fan-service that it blew my mind when they introduced more and more of these characters. Almost a negative effort was put into the creation of these Musicart and even less into their subsequent development. They took a look at all the stereotypical love interests in bad (and when I mean bad, I mean *bad*) RomCom anime and said, “We’ll take the lot!”. There’s not a single moment in my mind that I believe any of these characters have where they have gotten “good” development. Has there been development? Maybe? Depends on who you ask. The happy-go-lucky Loli going all serious and murder-y on people can count as development depending on who you ask. The kuudere learning to process and show emotion while simultaneously falling in love with the MC? If you want it to I guess it can be. What about the Yandere that wants violence but is actually sort of out to protect her love interest and their desires? Can check that box off too. I think you get the point here, depending on your requirements for “development” and “personality” the quality of these Musicart varies quite widely. In a critical sense however, absolute garbage. It felt like totally incoherent rambling from someone way too confident for what they’re doing, who subsequently leaves you with a charismatic smile and a, “Right?”, after they just forcefully removed all but one of your brain cells.So we’ve ruled out any hope with music and the Musicarts themselves, what about art and animation? I mean, it’s MAPPA and Madhouse, it *has* to be good… right? Right? Well, you’re half right and half wrong. There’s no denying that, at the very least, the first 3 episodes are nothing short of outstanding. Dynamic and punchy, high fidelity with some incredible movement and creative freedom, plenty of impact and oomph to it. It had everything you could ask for, even some really outstanding cinematography and fight choreography. Unfortunately, the latter episodes all but render that useless for large scale destructive ability “because big laser beam that takes up the entirety of the screen is cool!”. There’s smaller scale moments but the further you get in the more insane and utterly pointless it becomes until they quite literally come full circle and start beating each other up with their bare hands. Hand to Hand combat on the same level of smoothness and quality of Episodes 1-3 would have had me crazily excited, but I’m going to be honest, the choreography was rough at the best of times and the reasoning for hand to hand combat in said situation is essentially nil so it rendered itself entirely moot. The quality most definitely dipped after episode 3, but that’s only in relation to MAPPA and Madhouse, it was still largely impressive and high quality (for the most part) if it were by any other studios. The choreography and cinematography was just brutal after exiting episode 3 however. Everything was zoomed out and frozen, or up tight and dynamic to the point you can’t really make out what’s going on. There wasn’t anything truly unique like you’d see in episode 1, it felt bland and cookie-cutter in nature like they didn’t have the energy or passion left for the rest of the season. For the big fights past those episodes they really just took all the typical camera angles and movements from old school Shounen battle series. There isn’t anything inherently wrong with that sort of stuff, but this very clearly isn’t a battle shounen nor should it be treated like one. It was a project with two of the biggest names in animation behind it that couldn’t muster uniqueness and quality on par with earlier scenes of itself, just a painful experience.So maybe the saving grace is in our Main Character, Takt? Or-or, maybe side characters like a mentor or the villains of the series? Takt stood a good chance, he had a lot going for him with music, but the series sucked all that passion and life out of him bar for a few moments that feel so out of place that they elicit largely nothing when in regards to music. Takt has two (2) substantial moments with music outside of the first 3 episodes, in my opinion. One ties itself back into that prohibition story thread which refuses to be explored, and the other. The other, uh. The other doesn’t really make any sense. They *say* Takt’s doing something in regards to music, but they don’t show it. Well, they show it, but they don’t *show* it. There’s no passion or interest or frustration behind Takt’s stone cold visage. The passion in the earlier episodes for music and other aspects of his life have all but disappeared and have been replaced with, “ahhhh, I kind of want to play music and stuff, I guess”. He has his momentary explosions but has overall locked his earlier emotions in a cage where they will never be released from. So let’s move on to the mentor then, really nice personality to him, enjoyable backstory that I think works well. The issue here, and boy is this a big issue, we spend next to no time with him and his “profound” knowledge for Takt is essentially worthless. A series revolving around the mentor of this series would have performed better given what we’ve seen and know about him. He’s wise but likes to be coy and friendly for the most part, always soft spoken but very articulate and cunning, he’s a character that’s been undeservedly dropped into Takt Op Destiny and left to die the equivalent of a Dog’s Death in regards to potential character development. He gets nothing of the sort and is used to tie Takt and Destiny and Anna into the god awful faux-villain to real-villain plot line. I know that sounds spoilery but trust me when I say it’s not. It’s very painfully clear that the first “villain” introduced isn’t really the “real” bad guy, and they even suck at playing the fake villain. They’re the equivalent of a rich boy throwing a temper tantrum because they can’t bully their friends. There *might* be a reason behind the malice, and I’m not against characters that are evil for the sake of being evil, but that’s not the case here. The character is just plainly awful and is bad *because the story needs them to be*. There’s also a dead giveaway that he’s meant to be a bad guy with a certain aspect of his character which makes it even worse when doing the whole faux-villain real-villain thing. That said, the real villain isn’t even a villain. He’s just some sort of fecal matter that was excreted by a dead animal. Zero development, zero rhyme or reason to *anything* they do, they get maybe 5 minutes screen time total but they’re meant to be the endgame of the series somehow. They don’t even have a reason for doing what they’re doing, and explicitly mock themselves as they lose as if they already knew that their reasoning was worse than garbage.Alright so side note of other awful things, and I know I’m going to be missing a whole bunch. First off, Musicart/Maestro abilities make no sense. They’re meant to be synchronized, where the Maestro provides the melody for the Musicart and their harmony is how their power is produced but that’s never explained and used properly outside of the first 3 episodes. Musicarts never target the Maestros, which are *meant* to be the sources of a great deal of their power, which is in contradiction with the fact that we’re shown countless Musicarts fighting without the aide of a Maestro, but also have examples of ones that fight without a Maestro that are pathetically weak? I don’t know, the power system makes no sense and doesn’t attempt to make any sense to the point that a science based character breaks the fourth wall and says “Actually, I guess you don’t care about the details” when *attempting* to explain how Musicarts work. I mean, that’s one of the worst tropes/cliches to use with stuff like this and they threw it in there anyways. As I mentioned earlier there’s that very obvious thread of Prohibition and Rebellion parallel, that is *continually touched upon but never used* and I can’t understand why. Outside of that there’s the hilariously simple nature of the D2 that becomes more and more altered and inexplicably aggressive. At first they’re monsters that hate rhythm/music, so a largely docile and unassuming beast that’s taken residence across the world. Cars and things like that can make vibrations that have a rhythm to them, so I can understand staying away from denser areas of them like is mentioned in episode 1. The problem comes in later episodes. The D2 become more and more aggressive and less defensive in each conflict. They appear out of nowhere with little to no reason and serve as endless hordes of mobs to fight. Even worse is that by the end, Humanity previously had to apparently fight an entire war against these D2 with the D2 themselves being the aggressors of the conflict. A pathetic last ditch effort at drawing sympathy out of viewers. Even better is this little tid-bit. The United States of America is shown to be suffering and in a bet of a reset period where there’s not an overwhelming amount of technology or anything of the sort. They drive beater cars and have to resort to farming to live and things like that, for the most part. So then why, on God’s Green Earth, does the Symphonica have the world’s most advanced technology concentrated in a single area. Where do they get the funds to operate, how were they established in the first place. Why is cryogenic sleep a thing but the rest of the country is suffering in one way or another? Just some god awful closed book writing that doesn’t care about the rest of its world. A very strong 0 out of 10 for worldbuilding.I know I’ve bagged on Takt Op Destiny for nearly 3,000 words already so it can easily seem like I wanted to hate it from the start, but I well and truly didn’t. I was raving about the first 3 episodes to everyone and anyone that would lend an ear, it was an electric start to the series and I loved where it was going. There was so much potential, but that was all there was, potential. Execution decided to jump off a cliff as passion and interest hanged themselves in the office. Creativity died a gruesome death and corporate greed chose to don its skin in hopes that people wouldn’t notice. It was the sorriest sight I’ve seen in a long time in anime, and by far the biggest let down I’ve ever experienced. A pair of huge names in the anime industry attached to an original series that has one of the most unique concepts for an anime in a while. It wasn’t some bottom of the barrel low effort, minimum budget anime that got zero recognition or hype in the community. If it was that would at least soften the blow, or if it was just bad from the start I could stomach it as it is. But it wasn’t, it was something truly great and interesting that held meaning and value and passion and all sorts of other great feelings. It was something that for those 3 short weeks I endlessly looked forward to, but soon grew to detest. An awful example of corporate shilling in the anime industry that I hope doesn’t need a repeat.So I say to MAPPA X Madhouse for Takt Op Destiny from Episode 4 onwards: What you’ve just given us is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever experienced. At no point in your rambling, incoherent anime were you even close to anything that could be considered a passable scene. Everyone that has watched this series is now dumber for having done so. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul. plenty of potential, especially with the intertwining of Destiny and Takt. There\'s so many wondrous things that these first three episodes bring viewers, and it screams of what could have been endless potential and a contender for Anime of the Season, at the very least, and at best a beacon of hope for mixed media projects and Anime Originals. The keyword in the previous sentence was \'could\', if that wasn\'t clear. It *could* have done all of that, but decided to not and instead embarked on the most confusing, hair pulling, heart crushing, train wreck of a story that\'s a spider\'s web of media tropes and pathetic attempts at advertising to hopefully convince a few poor souls to attempt to throw money at a mobile game that\'s been delayed indefinitely.One of my biggest gripes with where Takt Op. Destiny went was its music. There\'s some great pieces in there, and previously there was some good theory around *why* specific pieces of classical music were played and what their importance was to each character, but that was before that world came crashing down. Original pieces with concrete meaning in the scenes that they\'re played in are replaced with a pathetic attempt to incur ""immediate nostalgia"". That means that they replay the same pieces of music over and over and over in a desperate attempt to capture your attention as the show basically screams, ""Hey! Hey! This music was used in that one part early on that you *really* liked, right? We\'re using it here so you should like this part too!"". Not only is it monotonous and incredibly low-effort for an Anime that markets itself as ""all about music"", it\'s depressing. Music is such an awe-inspiring thing in life. There\'s rhyme and reason to it such that there\'s obvious paths to take with it, but despite the semi-concreteness of the profession an Artificial Intelligence can\'t make music. There\'s something incredibly human to it that can’t be recreated without a heart or soul. Rather than make full use of those two aspects of humanity, Takt decides that it’ll pick the ‘10 Best Classical Pieces’ and interweave it with a disparagingly small amount of original music. Episode 1 had a great symphony piece that, to my ears, seemed original. Episode two brought us some prohibition style piano music, and after that… after that. Nothing really came after that. There was *maybe* one or two more original pieces in the series that were actually used with the intention of *being* music, rather than just weak background noise, and if you’re lucky it might be something modern sounding like the heavy metal of episode 5 which feels woefully out of place aside a pair of classically inspired musicarts. Any important music that pretended to have any use in the anime itself was shamelessly reused, and/or entirely limited to classical music. Where’s *more* prohibition-era music? There’s a Musicart that seems to have their character designed loosely inspired by the era, but they don’t get combat soundtracks like Destiny and Takt. There’s an entire rebellion waiting to happen against the censoring of music, I mean, how many bands are out there that challenge that sort of stuff? Rage Against The Machine Anyone? Run The Jewels? There’s a plethora of artists and styles to draw from for some absolutely incredible pieces and inspired Musicarts for rebellion, which you’d *think* would be a big piece in a story where music is entirely censored while the rich get the okay on it (will cover that later), but it’s nowhere to be found. There’s even musicarts called Heaven and Hell, but no religious inspired music. Walkure (In English: Valkyrie) is even a thing, but not once do you hear anything resembling Die Walkure or any other Valkyrie related music.I could probably write this entire review just purely based off the egregious offenses in regards to music, but that doesn’t paint an accurate picture. So you’re not a huge fan of music or its accompanying theory and meanings, that’s fine, that’s cool not a problem. We then enter the next stage of the problem, Waifus. Sure some series are better off for it and it’s the premise of them because they’re satire, parody, ecchi, etc. Takt is none of those things, but it hints that it *really* wants to be. All the Musicarts are women, nice and easy red flag. We didn’t see any other ones until later down the road, first pair we see is a man and a woman like Takt and Destiny, that’s fine it’s his mentor so they can be similar. More and more Musicarts get introduced and they all continue to follow that pattern, there’s not a single male Musicart, nor is there a female conductor. It’s a simple problem, with a *really* simple solution. Instead though, they went full steam ahead on using the Musicart as half-hearted advertisement to appeal to the basest of desires and interests. There’s never even an *attempt* at an explanation as to why they can only be women. So maybe you can get past the female only cast of Musicarts, credit to you for finding a way to power through, but you get to the next issue. Cookie-Cutter personalities. I was fine with Destiny when it was *just* Destiny, with each new Musicart they added another painful stereotypical and one dimensional personality to the grab bag of Build-Your-Waifu. There’s the Kuudere, The Tsundere (which as a bonus *also* includes the public morals committee personality aspect!), The Yandere, and get this, they even went full circle to add another Kuudere. Oh, and there’s a Loli as well of course. It’s just such blatant advertisement and fan-service that it blew my mind when they introduced more and more of these characters. Almost a negative effort was put into the creation of these Musicart and even less into their subsequent development. They took a look at all the stereotypical love interests in bad (and when I mean bad, I mean *bad*) RomCom anime and said, “We’ll take the lot!”. There’s not a single moment in my mind that I believe any of these characters have where they have gotten “good” development. Has there been development? Maybe? Depends on who you ask. The happy-go-lucky Loli going all serious and murder-y on people can count as development depending on who you ask. The kuudere learning to process and show emotion while simultaneously falling in love with the MC? If you want it to I guess it can be. What about the Yandere that wants violence but is actually sort of out to protect her love interest and their desires? Can check that box off too. I think you get the point here, depending on your requirements for “development” and “personality” the quality of these Musicart varies quite widely. In a critical sense however, absolute garbage. It felt like totally incoherent rambling from someone way too confident for what they’re doing, who subsequently leaves you with a charismatic smile and a, “Right?”, after they just forcefully removed all but one of your brain cells.So we’ve ruled out any hope with music and the Musicarts themselves, what about art and animation? I mean, it’s MAPPA and Madhouse, it *has* to be good… right? Right? Well, you’re half right and half wrong. There’s no denying that, at the very least, the first 3 episodes are nothing short of outstanding. Dynamic and punchy, high fidelity with some incredible movement and creative freedom, plenty of impact and oomph to it. It had everything you could ask for, even some really outstanding cinematography and fight choreography. Unfortunately, the latter episodes all but render that useless for large scale destructive ability “because big laser beam that takes up the entirety of the screen is cool!”. There’s smaller scale moments but the further you get in the more insane and utterly pointless it becomes until they quite literally come full circle and start beating each other up with their bare hands. Hand to Hand combat on the same level of smoothness and quality of Episodes 1-3 would have had me crazily excited, but I’m going to be honest, the choreography was rough at the best of times and the reasoning for hand to hand combat in said situation is essentially nil so it rendered itself entirely moot. The quality most definitely dipped after episode 3, but that’s only in relation to MAPPA and Madhouse, it was still largely impressive and high quality (for the most part) if it were by any other studios. The choreography and cinematography was just brutal after exiting episode 3 however. Everything was zoomed out and frozen, or up tight and dynamic to the point you can’t really make out what’s going on. There wasn’t anything truly unique like you’d see in episode 1, it felt bland and cookie-cutter in nature like they didn’t have the energy or passion left for the rest of the season. For the big fights past those episodes they really just took all the typical camera angles and movements from old school Shounen battle series. There isn’t anything inherently wrong with that sort of stuff, but this very clearly isn’t a battle shounen nor should it be treated like one. It was a project with two of the biggest names in animation behind it that couldn’t muster uniqueness and quality on par with earlier scenes of itself, just a painful experience.So maybe the saving grace is in our Main Character, Takt? Or-or, maybe side characters like a mentor or the villains of the series? Takt stood a good chance, he had a lot going for him with music, but the series sucked all that passion and life out of him bar for a few moments that feel so out of place that they elicit largely nothing when in regards to music. Takt has two (2) substantial moments with music outside of the first 3 episodes, in my opinion. One ties itself back into that prohibition story thread which refuses to be explored, and the other. The other, uh. The other doesn’t really make any sense. They *say* Takt’s doing something in regards to music, but they don’t show it. Well, they show it, but they don’t *show* it. There’s no passion or interest or frustration behind Takt’s stone cold visage. The passion in the earlier episodes for music and other aspects of his life have all but disappeared and have been replaced with, “ahhhh, I kind of want to play music and stuff, I guess”. He has his momentary explosions but has overall locked his earlier emotions in a cage where they will never be released from. So let’s move on to the mentor then, really nice personality to him, enjoyable backstory that I think works well. The issue here, and boy is this a big issue, we spend next to no time with him and his “profound” knowledge for Takt is essentially worthless. A series revolving around the mentor of this series would have performed better given what we’ve seen and know about him. He’s wise but likes to be coy and friendly for the most part, always soft spoken but very articulate and cunning, he’s a character that’s been undeservedly dropped into Takt Op Destiny and left to die the equivalent of a Dog’s Death in regards to potential character development. He gets nothing of the sort and is used to tie Takt and Destiny and Anna into the god awful faux-villain to real-villain plot line. I know that sounds spoilery but trust me when I say it’s not. It’s very painfully clear that the first “villain” introduced isn’t really the “real” bad guy, and they even suck at playing the fake villain. They’re the equivalent of a rich boy throwing a temper tantrum because they can’t bully their friends. There *might* be a reason behind the malice, and I’m not against characters that are evil for the sake of being evil, but that’s not the case here. The character is just plainly awful and is bad *because the story needs them to be*. There’s also a dead giveaway that he’s meant to be a bad guy with a certain aspect of his character which makes it even worse when doing the whole faux-villain real-villain thing. That said, the real villain isn’t even a villain. He’s just some sort of fecal matter that was excreted by a dead animal. Zero development, zero rhyme or reason to *anything* they do, they get maybe 5 minutes screen time total but they’re meant to be the endgame of the series somehow. They don’t even have a reason for doing what they’re doing, and explicitly mock themselves as they lose as if they already knew that their reasoning was worse than garbage.Alright so side note of other awful things, and I know I’m going to be missing a whole bunch. First off, Musicart/Maestro abilities make no sense. They’re meant to be synchronized, where the Maestro provides the melody for the Musicart and their harmony is how their power is produced but that’s never explained and used properly outside of the first 3 episodes.

I wasn't familiar with the games but I thought that music would play a much larger role in the action than I found in the show. At many points, I wondered why the Musicarts (Pokemon) even have Maestros (Pokemon Masters). At one point we even see a girl straight out of a fantasy anime with a sword and shield, not even being controlled by a Maestro, so what even is the point?Would it not be better if the weapons and characters had some sort of musical theme? For instance the main chick is...from Mozart, so her battle theme should be classical. But it seems all of the characters just have the same music playing when fighting. It would be interesting if each character had a different music genre, and in order to fight together well they would need to combine their sounds and harmonise or something like that, but nothing is explored.The characters are all generic as hell and not enjoyable. Anna is the only interesting character with personality plus she's hot af so that's cool I guess.Obviously, the fight scenes animation are great thanks to Mappa. Unfortunately, it is paired with average music, which is kinda crazy given how this universe is supposed to revolve around music.The story is nothing to write home about either, just like the characters it is generic and uninspired. The dialogue (due to the characters personalities) is mostly uninteresting and expository. Even with all the expository dialogue, many things are not explained well, such as what the point of the Maestro is, and who is associated with which organisations.Overall, very disappointing, I watched it with some friends and we just talk over it until the battle scenes come on.

I can agree that they rarely make some niche references, but the actual application of anything vaguely musical is surface level at best. There is nothing that makes me as a musician think ""they actually thought about this - I\'m impressed"". Every time music comes up, I feel like it\'s been shoehorned in in a way that anyone who actually understands and has dealt with music in their lives would know is...just bullshit. It\'s plainly obvious when you scan the rest of the reviews, and everyone who says ""I know nothing about music"" gives this a 9/10, yet anyone who cares enough about music gives it a 5/10 or lower.My point is this; It\'s pretty, and it\'s got action. If that\'s all you need to enjoy it, then good for you. Unfortunately, the misuse of music here just puts me off. As long as you\'re OK with music being a word that means ""sounds that makes people feel the good good inside"" then give it a shot I guess.If you are still not convinced that this show doesn\'t take music seriously, consider watching a show that actually tackles music in a real and respectful manner, like Hibike! Euphonium, and compare this with that. You\'ll see that the only thing driving this show\'s score up is gacha buyer\'s remorse and explosions.Apart from the visuals, the rest of the show falls flat.tl;dr - If you\'re a musician this isn\'t worth your time. just bullshit.

That\'s it,...it\'s just well animated, as is to be expected with two industry powerhouses manning the guns here.The show does NOT have an outstanding great story. (As of episode 4). You get a decent bit of world building and some backstory, but overall the general depth of the story feels similar to what Fireforce has to offer, just with a greatly condensed cast of characters (again, as of episode 4). There are some hints of an overarching mystery-esque plot going on, but overall so far it\'s been pretty much based around the main character with an ""in medias res"" start and a bunch of backstory afterwards.The show\'s music is pretty good, but it should absolutely NOT be expected as a music anime. Music plays an important role, but as a musician I can definitely find myself seeing a lot of ""popular appeal"" rather than actual music knowledge going into this. You\'re not going to learn just about anything about playing a piano from this show, and also not find any proper in depth discussions about the nature of music - but it\'s a shounen-esque show, so I wouldn\'t expect that. The focus of this show is definitely the battles, and not the music - music just happens to be part of the power system of the world.The main cast are going to make or break it for you probably in terms of enjoyment. I personally really enjoy the main cast, but I can see why people might not.We have:-the classic gloomy wannabe edgelord main character who is actually a decent guy but just way too much of a teenager- the bigger sister who\'s always looking out for the main characters, the voice of reason, and also ignored by our two lead teenagers- and the living weapon that\'s just an absolute moron. Not incompetent in battle, just really really dumb or uncaring of anything out of the mission. Kinda like Arthur from Fireforce to draw the parallel once more.- Bonus: The slightly gay mentor character who is an absolute delight whenever he is on screen. Seriously my favourite character so far, and I hope he shows up more over the runtime of the show.Bonus points that the show gets from me: As of episode 4 we have straight up no fanservice in terms of borderline ecchi shit. There is a somewhat romantic subplot going on (maybe?), but for what its worth, this show about a gaccha game does NOT include any incredibly obvious boob shots for the sake of booba on screen. Really appreciate a show not going overly ham with that straight off the bat. That being said, we got a hint at a femme fatale character in the OP of the show, so that\'s probably going to change at some point later in the show.Overall a show I\'d recommend to anyone who feels a lack of Shounen this season, and doesn\'t have too high of an expectation when it comes to depth of the show. it\'s just well animated, as is to be expected with two industry powerhouses manning the guns here.The show does NOT have an outstanding great story.

Destiny is marketed as an Original Music anime by Mappa and Madhouse, one of the biggest collabs you can imagine in Anime.Takt op\'s pacing is slow and their travels where they meet other people was supposed to make the main characters grow but they obviously didn\'t, wherein the animation can\'t even ease the boredom you can feel just by watching this anime. Everything doesn\'t make any sense until they came to New York.My biggest concern is the ""music"" part of the anime. Earlier this year, an Original Music anime also dropped which is...Vivy. With that I was expecting the Music part of the anime to be integral or within the story\'s core. The title and some hints in the anime made me think that Takt op. Destiny must be Takt\'s music title once he finally completes his musical composition, but what we get is just a couple of hums in the end. Also, aside from that the only time you\'ll hear the music is when they fight and the music is just classical music playing in the background with no direct connection to what is happening, and the Musicarts dont actually have powers that produce music. Which clearly suggests that the ""Music"" part of this anime is nothing but just some words on the tags.The Villain\'s motive is also vague and dumb, I mean why would he gather all the d2\'s inside a heavily populated city if his goal is just to seal them all?The ending isn\'t also fully explained, did Anna became Destiny because her VA is the same as the game\'s Destiny VA, which means you need to play the game to understand it which is to be expected as this is also an advertisement for their game.Overall a very mid type of anime with the ""mappa hype"".If you enjoyed it it\'s okay. No anime is perfect and don\'t let other\'s judge what you like just dont judge other\'s if they like something you hate. Vivy.

Which clearly suggests that the ""Music"" part of this anime is nothing but just some words on the tags.The Villain\'s motive is also vague and dumb, I mean why would he gather all the d2\'s inside a heavily populated city if his goal is just to seal them all?The ending isn\'t also fully explained, did Anna became Destiny because her VA is the same as the game\'s Destiny VA, which means you need to play the game to understand it which is to be expected as this is also an advertisement for their game.Overall a very mid type of anime with the ""mappa hype"".If you enjoyed it it\'s okay. No anime is perfect and don\'t let other\'s judge what you like just dont judge other\'s if they like something you hate.', ""This anime gets way too much hate, especially for the amount of episodes released so far. I have a feeling that those who will drop it early on will miss out.No Spoilers in this review: This is my first time doing a review for an anime, but I feel like I need to say what needs to be said about this anime. I will not write a synopsis, because that's the job of the description of the anime, so I am solely writing about how I feel about this anime. At the time of this review only 5 episodes have aired, so there is yet...much more content to release. However, I wanted to write this review to emphasize how great this anime already is in the span of only 5 episodes. To start off, the art is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Animated by MADHOUSE and MAPPA, the animation is incredibly stunning, even rivaling that of Ufotable's, I dare say. Second, the OSTs and SFX are also great, which is extremely important in the music-themed genre of anime it rests within. As for the characters, they are very interesting themselves and have unique designs, although some more about Takt and Destiny's personalities will hopefully develop throughout the remaining episodes. Finally, the story. Since only 5 episodes have been released so far, it's obvious that I cannot give an opinion on the entire story. However, I feel like this anime could likely create an amazing story at the rate it is progressing. Overall, I am expecting Takt Op. Destiny to turn out to be a 9/10 or even a 10/10 for me, basing off of how much I am enjoying this so far. much more content to release.

""There may be some spoilers in this short review"".I can\'t remember when the anime was announced but when I learned that Madhouse and MAPPA will be collaborating on it I was a bit hyped and later knowing that it was an upcoming gacha game I had thoughts of giving it a shot to watch it.Let me put it nice and short, The pilot episode showed a lot of promise, it showed the base plot of a world without music and the so-called Musicarts saved the world from destruction from D2\'s. I mean it started really fine not until...the next few episodes where it left a big hole and a lot of question marks story-wise, let me give an example. Who was the whistleblower on why the D2\'s appeared is it Takt\'s Dad? and What is Cossette\'s connection to the musicarts? or in General why is Cossette the only one turned into a musicart in her family? or maybe I\'m not paying that much attention to the story.It felt like the story was rushed especially midway thru the series and somehow I understand why, BECAUSE ITS A 24min GACHA GAME ADVERTISEMENT maybe if we play the game the story will be clearer I guess. the only thing likable here is the musical score, the animation and some of its characters. the next few episodes where it left a big hole and a lot of question marks story-wise, let me give an example.

Honestly I don't think I'd recommend this anime to anyone because of that reason. And there's nothing really memorable about it besides Destiny. Story is meh overall. Art/animation is fantastic. Sound not really majestic in an anime that is has music elements. Character development was kinda slow, or really fast at one point. But the animes pacing didn't help with that. Overall I don't recommend it. I did hear it's for a mobile game that suppose to come out? So I...mean if that's the game you're wanting to play then I guess watch the anime lol------Thoughts of episodes 9 and before below--------Edit: Glad I gave it some time. The characters and the story are becoming more interesting. I planned on updating this once it reached episode 12, but couldn't wait. Currently finished episode 9. So yeah the music still isn't really majestic as one would expect, but the story and character building has been becoming better. So this has increased my overall score of this anime to an 8 maybe 7.5 if that was possible-------OG thoughts from episodes 1-4 below----------Should you watch this anime? As of episode 4 it's still kinda in a gray spot. There are aspects that I like about the anime, but it's just currently the last two episodes seemed kinda slow in a sense. But I think that's because it's focusing on character development. Characters can be likeable and are unique. I think this anime definitely has potential and we can really see some real plot twist and crazy stuff that'll happen, but it'll take time to get there. Will update as the episodes progress, but for now I'm giving it a 7 out of 10.Story: Story is good, so far the backstory is really the only story we have right now explaining how they got to where they are today which takes place in episode 2. Some animes do this like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. And I believe this anime did it very well.Art: I like the eyes. It gives them a uniqueness but makes them look like Zero Two in a senseSound: Well haven't really found anything majestic, though I would've expected it to be as it's partly an anime that has music elements in the story.Characters: They're unique in their own ways, but I think I need to see more grow in them. Like if Destiny started getting feelings like how Cosette was.Overall: Still too early to determine if this anime is a hit or miss.

A stupid story with no real direction? If so, this is the show for you.Looking at the seasonal charts and the PVs, this looked to be a very promising anime with generic but competent story, but as it turns out, the writers have no idea what they're doing. Characters are flat and boring, story is painfully predictable and even though it looks really good the direction for the show is not very good. Just an endless cluster of cliches and uninspired storytelling that makes this show a pain to watch....This might get better, but honestly, I wouldn't have hopes for this one. This might get better, but honestly, I wouldn't have hopes for this one."", ""Welcome to M1c3f's condensed Anime review. I'll be giving you all the necessary information about a show in just a few sentences and a following recommendation.Today featuring: Takt Op DestinyFirst and important to know: Yes, there are many battle waifus. You might enjoy it or find it to be annoying. Yes, the show is based upon an upcoming gacha game, should you have prejudices because of that. No.The three protagonists have a really weird relationship that's hard to read. If you compare the protagonists with food they would be a microwave heated slice of pizza. It tastes dreadful yet you still somehow liked...it because it's pizza. Once you have chewed the first bite you know you should have either just eaten it cold, thrown it away, or made the effort to heat it up in the oven. Make up your mind about that analogy if you wish or trust that feeling I build up inside yourself because we can all relate to eating microwave pizza.The antagonist(s) are batshit stupid the definition of bad villains no further explanation is needed. They literally made some episodes almost unwatchable.The world is just un-immersive. It's a superficially explained setting that is torn between picturing a post-apocalyptic hazard and a lively routined civilization. At first, the storyline is rather weak and ungarnished but eventually picks up some depth and pace. On its way to the climax, the story shifts into unreasonable unexplainable absurdity. Much like and in connection with the appearance of antagonists.The battle scenes look gorgeous they are impactful and dynamic. All in combination with great sfx. The Cinematography outside battle is ok'ish. Really plain and basic without a sense of depth. The background art is genuinely nice.There is little connection between the musical theme with the narrative and the fighting mechanics.The music composition is extraordinary making one of the best anime led by classic orchestral music.Recomendation?: It's worthwhile for the fantastic OST and the good action scenes. The first few episodes are a bit tough to get through. The amount of action makes it up for that though. The musical direction gets better and better albeit in the end you will be frustrated again because the plot gets so out of touch with common sense.My score:Story: 2.8Characters: 3.7Animation: 9.4Sound: 10Enjoyment: 6.8Overall: 5.6(Also refer to my profile for scoring criteria) it because it's pizza.

Maybe I'm stupid and didn't understand the intricacies of the series but to me the only selling point of it was MAPPA × MADHOUSE and Music, and still I couldn't differentiate most of the times which music is a weapon and which is just background music. Characters were very bland none left long lasting impression, maybe Cosette/Destiny but she too will be forgotten. That's my take, if I offended someone then that's that. Music was good i love piano...so yeah. Art was good well it had to be with the production houses behind it.Overall not recommended if you value your time. If you play the game go for it but i think you'll be disappointed.6/10 ( for the kiss scenes cuz I'm a sucker for romance +1).Well thanks for reading. See you later.❤✌ so yeah.

See you later.❤✌"", ""*a spoiler free reviewTakt. Op Destiny was one of the most hyped shows this season, so when I popped into the review tab and spotted the hate, boy was I surprised. This is my first review, and I'm writing this so that people don't think that the show is complete trash, as others seem to suggest.I'll start with talking about the story, which, to be frank, is the worst part of the anime. It's not an original plot by any means and you can kind of tell that it's made as the promotion/backstory of a game. However, the story is not horrible by any...means, just done before, and if you've watched any number of battle shounen/isekai before, you'd know that the same plot done again can be great if executed right. Of course, if you're a person that's seen the same kind of plot again and again i.e. creature invasion, main group goes on a journey with an end goal, main group fights against creatures, etc. that might be enough to turn you off, and that's fair. Still, I would suggest giving this show a chance.This leads to why, and that would be the art. Yes, I know, a show being pretty doesn't make it quality, perfectly polished shit is still shit, BUT Takt. Op Destiny... is really dang pretty. In every episode there are beautifully animated fight scenes and character movement, and the teamwork of MAPPA x Madhouse never fails to make my eyes shine with delight and awe, reminding me why I'm following this weekly. On top of this, I'm a pretty big fan of the character designs, especially the Musicarts. Destiny, Titan, Walkure, Hell, and I'm sure more to come are all gorgeous and they stick in your mind. I also like the simplicity of Takt and Anna's designs, they contrast the Musicarts and complement their surroundings whilst remaining in my mind as well.My next point would be the sound, since this is a music anime. Most of the points I've given go to the opening and the ending, since the opening is absolutely beautiful and one of my favourites of the season, whilst the ending is also beautiful and kind of leaves me with a bittersweet feeling. I definitely enjoyed the piano piece that we hear in earlier episodes and the bgm has thus far been either good or adequate. Personally, I hope we get to see more actual music in the show in future episodes.Next up is character. This is a weaker point of the show, since there isn't too much to say about the characters. The main trio is as follows:Takt has a deep love for piano and cares greatly for Anna and Cosette. Destiny is badass, D2 obsessed and very naive, like a small child. Anna is the big sister of the group, the negotiator, the only character with her head on completely straight, and a kind-hearted, just and hard-working character. She'd usually be the forgettable one of the group but I've taken a liking to her and she's currently my favourite character in the show. Other characters fit neatly into characters types, the loli, the tsundere, the crazy bitch and the bastard villain, for example. Even if they are a little bland, I personally don't think they drag down the show, and they're still quite lovable in their own right (excluding the ones you're supposed to hate, of course).Takt. Op Destiny is flawed for sure. But saying that, it's a hell of a fun ride, at least in my opinion. I have not yet been bored by it and my eyes have certainly been enjoying the dynamic animation and vivid colours to bits. I also quite like how they've executed the admittedly cliche storyline, and how it feels somehow relaxing to me despite the weekly fights. If it stays the same or improves and sticks the landing, Takt. Op Destiny might be one of my favourite new anime of the season.If you think you might just enjoy it, I'd advise giving it a shot :) means, just done before, and if you've watched any number of battle shounen/isekai before, you'd know that the same plot done again can be great if executed right.

Thought we\'re show as to how one Conductor by the name of Sagan became such a psycho after touch a certain crystal that belongs to them ""D2"", it doesn\'t explain as to what have transpire, what we\'re show was...supposed him making us think that he\'s the overall culprit , but as it turn out he was not the main villain that would end them ""D2"" onslaught  . We also have that plot hole as to how them Musicarts came to be and how they allied themselves as weapons for a selected  number of humans to fight off the ""D2"".Art-Decent 4:  Well, studio  Madhouse and MAPPA, did add some eye candy with Destiny\'s outfit in that overly decorated battle uniform and with Heaven\'s summer outfit and Valkyrie\'s Greek Amazon outfit, the most fashionable was Anna\'s early 2000\'s look and that Ford Mustang that the trio used to travel from somewhere in the mid west to New York....Overall , they never rely on fanservices to make this anime sell.....Though , it would\'ve been nice to see Anna and Destiny to be in their bikinis.Sound-Good 7: Nothing to say around here, given that the voices of them characters need not have to pretend to be teens.Character-Poor 3: Ok, let\'s go over each of those group of characters around here:The TrioTakto a guy with a tsundere attitude, who somehow has a problem with the world ever since his father died after the D2 onslaught at a theater where Lenny serves as a witness......the confusing part about him, was, ""Why him?"" as in why him who has to be this kind of conductor whose life force was shared with his Musicart Corsette / Destiny.

Music ky thing ?that is on screen, clear vibrant colours and a good soundtrack to keep us pumped. There is noticeable CGI while animating the characters playing the Piano but, that is understandable since animating precise finger movements in 2D is hell of a task.2)The VAs do a pretty good job but they are greatly overshadowed by the music in this anime HAS TO BE TOP TIER , I mean of course it is about music but also looking at the budget one can be assured they spared no expense on making the music be probably the best this season , be it the fight scenes , the OP , or the slice of life moments ,THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC TO LOOK FORWARD TO …………But this is where we start getting into the problems ….. THERE is seriously nothing else other than the wo above to look forward toNow the Not-bad-but-very-generic partsThe characters are very generic , seriously this and its story is where this anime falls apartThere is nothing interesting about the MC , nothing at all just some dumb kid loving doing something that will endanger everything around him lke any shounen protagonists ,and yes we can all tell the rest of the journey will be about him making up for his mistake of letting cosette die? Go into comma? Become an android waifu? . yep cosette as a hole is just a cute waifu android with a little bit of osananajimi (childhood friend) thrown in the mix for more spice.he onee chan seems to be alright so far , I did not like her reaction to the whole ordeal but it was still believable .Oh man is the story giving me and many others deja vu , The story is awfully familiar and generic to most shounen sob story melodrama , I mean i understand this is not mapaa or madhouses fault THEY WERE not given much to work with. Hell the project is probably just a go fund me for them ,yet they are giving it their all in the animation and music department so this not a complete cash grabSo basically a fund raiser anime , that was just made for the purpose of selling the mobile game , The hype has made the expectation go to a level of no return but , If you keep expecting more from this show other than music or animation you are in for some heavy disappointment . This is a good show to watch only if you aren't looking for a story rich or character driven anime and I still think it's a good watch but will probably recommend waiting for the hype to die down, and reducing the expectation one might have , the best way to do that ? wait for more episodes to come out. a great score and since I did admit my bias above , I guess we can all admit another one of ours too?Most of us WATCHED THIS ONLY because of Mappa x Madhouse.I honestly was not interested in this anime , the synopsis made my head hurt and i felt like it was gonna be something in the lines of dokyuu HxEROS but yes I will admit I am pleasantly surprised with what takt op destiny has to offer, But the only downside being it only delivers in two things while the other important aspects of what makes anime great have been pretty much buried in the coffin.Lets go over the goodparts first,1)The art and animation is certainly up to the mark and delivers on the hype and anticipation we all had one we saw that “mappa x madhouse” , the fight scenes on the other hand Are magnificently done , fluid movements ,proper impact being felt on each attack ? special move? Music ky thing ?that is on screen, clear vibrant colours and a good soundtrack to keep us pumped. There is noticeable CGI while animating the characters playing the Piano but, that is understandable since animating precise finger movements in 2D is hell of a task.2)The VAs do a pretty good job but they are greatly overshadowed by the music in this anime HAS TO BE TOP TIER , I mean of course it is about music but also looking at the budget one can be assured they spared no expense on making the music be probably the best this season , be it the fight scenes , the OP , or the slice of life moments ,THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC TO LOOK FORWARD TO …………But this is where we start getting into the problems ….. THERE is seriously nothing else other than the wo above to look forward toNow the Not-bad-but-very-generic partsThe characters are very generic , seriously this and its story is where this anime falls apartThere is nothing interesting about the MC , nothing at all just some dumb kid loving doing something that will endanger everything around him lke any shounen protagonists ,and yes we can all tell the rest of the journey will be about him making up for his mistake of letting cosette die?

I had high hopes for this anime especially since I was a fan of Supercell and the animation for the anime is just spendid all around with MAPPA and Madhouse being the studios working on this project.But alas, this anime has one glaring weakness! The poorly written storyline and characters!It pretty much comes down to the antagonists for the anime, Sagan and Schindler. They are literally just pointless villains that does nothing for the story and better yet, you do not even see much of them throughout the entire run of the show. Heck, their...motivations for why they are being villains were just terrible and had only a few episodes to even give any background on it.Thus, with such crappy villains that I could care less for, this just makes the all the challenges that the Main character have to go through to save humanity from a bunch of music hating monsters seem so insignificant.What a waste it truly is because, the animation, the fight scenes, the music was great throughout these 12 episodes. What made me invested in the show from beginning was takt's beautiful character design, all that bright red coupled with her fighting alien invades gave me RWBY vibes. I also loved the road trip adventure style that they were doing with them having a new experience in each new town.I honestly feel that they should have made maybe a 3 part movie or even 24 episodes for the anime which would allow more time to make a better storyline and help flesh out the characters personalities and motivations because the way that it was done for the anime was just poor and it did not allow me to be invested in the series in anyway.5/10 (AVERAGE) because of purely the animation, the music, the lovely musicart character designs coughs WAIFUS, and the first seven episodes of the show which was decent.The latter half of the show with all the plot reveals for the antagonist was just pure bitter dissapointment. motivations for why they are being villains were just terrible and had only a few episodes to even give any background on it.Thus, with such crappy villains that I could care less for, this just makes the all the challenges that the Main character have to go through to save humanity from a bunch of music hating monsters seem so insignificant.What a waste it truly is because, the animation, the fight scenes, the music was great throughout these 12 episodes.

Destiny is a show that has no tact to it.And I\'m not talking just about the \'waifu bait\' people keep bringing up, I\'m talking about everything else that it represents. It\'s by far the most generic trash anime that I\'ve seen in EVERY single characteristic. Sure, there\'s the whole part with using music as it\'s main theme, all music anime have some sort of ground to stand on even when they are accumulated crap within a clogged toilet, but that\'s just the tip of the iceberg.The art... It\'s NOT GOOD. I\'m tired of people assuming that these studios animate well, when in...fact they do the bare minimum. I get it if stuff doesn\'t look perfect, but everything here is done in the cheapest way possible; The cut corners everywhere... They end up making triangles out of their walls. And it\'s not even a thing that happens rarely, it\'s in the DAMN opening. Art looking zoomed in for no reason, backgrounds with inconsistent lighting, Characters with missmatched framerate in the same shot, characters teleporting after 3 smear frames of them in their initial position. Nothing has bounce, or look, or style, or anything for that matter, except an abundance of trash frames -or lack of them, randomly-. It\'s trying to trick you into thinking it\'s got good animation the same way they often do. They try their hardest to make everything MOVE. More movement doesn\'t mean better animation! The fact that characters move from one spot to the other in singular frames 5 times in a row doesn\'t make a visually stunning scene, it only makes for some confusing visual trick that gave 5 frames to something that needed 20. If I can\'t tell what\'s going on during the battles, you\'ve done a bad job as a story teller. Maybe you animate real good, but making stuff clear is the bare minimum.The characters? the protagonist: Generic guy, looks like Joker from Persona 5 which is SUPPOSED to be generic. He lacks an arm during most of his appearances, because apparently symmetry is not a concept this anime understands.The main girl: Silent robot girl with white hair and red highlights and she likes to eat sweets a lot. Wow, that\'s unexpected, her personality must be so deep!The other main girl: She looks like a boring version of Athena Sykes, except she\'s even more slapped on to the story.The only character I enjoyed was a dude named ""Lenny"", and mostly because I\'d make fun of how his abs are designed so badly it looks like he\'s got four pecs.And if the characters are bad... Do I need to tell you what the story is? Probably, but I don\'t feel like it.The only thing that is kinda commendable in this show is the sound design, at least the piano recordings are human, which just means they probably got it from a stock music place, because classical music is so common, you don\'t even need to get new assets. I guess the 3D animation team did a great job syncing the piano sounds with the hands, but of course, that won\'t get any recognition because it\'s 3D....I\'m was bored of this show after 2 episodes, now it\'s been 5 and I\'m just uninterested. This isn\'t an enjoyable show, it just banks on trying it\'s best to make everything seem larger or more impressive than it is.

I can't even believe I was able to finish watching this, the visuals definitely carried this anime overall, to say the least. If that's what you're looking for then I'd say you can try to watch through this plot hole-filled mess. Anna as a character was nothing special whatsoever. She didn't need to be included at all. I hate characters like her and then in episode 12, they try to give her some role by making her a Maestro and hinting at something else with...that ending. Which nobody asked for and I definitely did not understand. It doesn't even make sense that she'd qualify to become one and only within a few months at that. (If you're paying attention to the date up top it wasn't even a year) So yeah, didn't like her at all the entire series she's just some girl that drives Takt and Destiny around trying to cope with the trauma of losing a sister. Her only goal was getting them to New York. Even then after meeting Charlotte or Lotte for short, they just tell Takt and Destiny that they came all that way for nothing, and drag Takt around to eat sweets with Destiny which is more filler than we needed in a 12-episode anime. Lenny dying for no reason. Sagan's purpose for all this was even more pointless than Anna herself. Overall very confusing plot that you wouldn't be able to keep your attention watching even if you tried. But the visuals were great which is why at the very least I'll give this a 3 star. that ending. Which nobody asked for and I definitely did not understand.

Nice graphics, great music, story and characters looked pretty good as well. Expectations increased even more when it was revealed that MAPPA and Madhouse, two powerful studios that had produced more than one anime that deserved the title of a masterpiece, were to be produced. Then what can go wrong?A lot. Let\'s start with the plot. The action focused on ""developing"" the main protagonists and adding new characters, but they did not develop the presented world anymore. We haven\'t learned many details about the creatures that the main characters fight -...D2. We don\'t know how the rest of the population deals with these monsters. Instead, too much screen time is taken up by fights or little story-driven dialogues. The plot does not have many plots, and the existing ones do not get sufficient development.Now let\'s move on to the two main characters. The first is Takt. We get to know his character, history (by the way, it\'s one of the few things in this anime that in my opinion has been 100% developed) and what he has in common with the other two main protagonists. He cannot be called a weak character, he is firm, brave, but at times reckless. In general, I don\'t rate him badly, he\'s a good character. Destiny is a bit worse. I did not necessarily like this character, I missed its story, additionally forced under potential waifu. The creators tried to expand it a bit, even at the end it had a love theme. The biggest disappointment is the figure of Anna, who accompanies our heroes on their journey to New York. She was not developed, after a few episodes I treated her as a supporting character, I even started to get irritated by her constant sighs. And she, too, finally got a love thread, which in my opinion was very tight. The worst character of the entire series, or even the entire Fall 2021 season. What about supporting characters? Some had a big impact on the story and were well developed (like Lenny), and some were not developed and had minimal impact (but still more than Anna). The antagonists, in turn, leave much to be desired. They often do not have a specific motive and purpose for their actions.Graphics and animation is certainly a strong point of this production. The fight scenes that this anime is rich in are nicely done and carefully elaborated. It is similar with the characters and the scenery themselves. The opening is very catchy and overall the music is nice too.From the first episode, my rating went down by four. Maybe I wasn\'t counting on a masterpiece, but definitely something much better than what came out in the end. Still, it wasn\'t even that bad, I think if the series were a few episodes longer, it would definitely have been better. The creators could develop undeveloped plots and characters. For now, I believe that the Takt Op. Destiny for mediocre anime. Ultimately poor storyline and average characters, but great graphics and very good music. 5/10. D2.

Everything just doesn\'t have any depth to it and just comes off as incomplete. I feel like there\'s something that could\'ve been done better. But I can\'t put my fingers on to what it\'s missing because there\'s a lot. I can\'t really list them all of cause spoilers.But I\'ll try to at least give out the general problems and missed potentials it have. First, the story. It already failed on expanding it\'s world building because of how out of focus the episodes are. The direction is just jumbling on the characters, the...circumstances of what\'s happening, and the ""mystery"" is just there as confusion. The resolution for the problems is generally underwhelming and it makes you question why they hide it to the audience in the first place. The direction and pacing is pretty bad too, having only 12 episodes to tell a grander story than they could handled. Each episodes comes off as either too fast or just a waste of time. There\'s no perfect balance cause the show can\'t decide if it wants to have character moment scenes or scenes that moves the plot forward.The power system was handled pretty abysmal. It doesn\'t have any proper explanation on how it works or what differentiate other Musicarts from each other. It\'s just pure mess.Next, the characters. I\'ve yet to see a decent character from the cast. They are either too one-dimensional or just there to exist. The main characters are some of the weakest main cast I\'ve seen this season. They are neither interesting nor well-developed. It\'s mostly because of the show\'s abysmal direction that this problem exist. They didn\'t give out reasons or character moments that makes me wanna like them or even relate to them. The side characters aren\'t that much better since they don\'t really do anything. They serve no purpose other than to be a plot device to move the non-existent plot forward. Then there\'s the antagonists who I argue have better character than all the cast combined. They at least have motivations and personality.That\'s probably enough bashing around the show\'s problem. Let\'s move on to it\'s strengths and prob the only reasons you wanna watch it.The animation. I\'m generally not a fan of MAPPA\'s animation due to how fast pace it is and how there\'s no breathing room for the audience to understand wtf is happening, but here they absolutely nailed it. Probably due to Madhouse\'s help and their incredible direction. The animation was easy to understand even though it was incredibly fast pace, and the effects they use to each fights have great color combinations that makes the art of the frames looks better than it already it.Then the music. The ost is fucking Godly. There\'s only a few tracks that made me eh, but other than that everything else are bangers. Though the opening and ending is just decent compare to the Godly OSTs.Overall, it\'s probably better if you don\'t watch this anime. It\'s too clusterfucked to even be recommended. If you wanna see the animation, I suggest just looking it up from AMV\'s or just short clips in YT or something.(4.8/10) circumstances of what\'s happening, and the ""mystery"" is just there as confusion.

With the collaboration of MAPPA×Madhouse what else could possibly go wrong? Well ostensibly a lot.STORYThe synopsis was very intriguing for me and that is what led me to watch this show and I was expecting a serious anime with a dark and gritty atmosphere but it was a disappointment. There seems to be no seriousness of any sort and no dystopian feel of post-apocalyptic shows. D2s appear out of nowhere, the Conductors and musicarts eradicate them and...it goes on a reiterate. Still are the D2s really a menace? People seem to be chilling out in the suburbs just fine. The pacing was abominable and the worldbuilding was awful. How did all the mysterious D2 birthing crystals magically disappeared? Also seems like D2 are still present but now with Sagan not calling them with that tuning fork so what was the point of it anyway? Even after the show, there were a lot of answered questions.CHARACTERSThis anime is a conspicuous waifu-bait which is composed of uninteresting characters with easily predictable one-dimensional traits. First of all we have a cold protagonist who is just horny for music and doesn't seem to care about anything else. Then we have two waifus, first a sweet loving emotionless musicart who doesn't seem to be aware of the fact that doors and windows exist and second a fappable hottie who seems to take care of the other two.The fact that both Anna and Takt got over Cosette's death so facilely alone just make them two apalling characters. Takt wasn't confused upon losing his arm, gaining the power of Conductor, his friend being turned into a fancy dressed musicart and acts as if he is thoroughly cognizant of what he is doing which is just underwhelming and illogical. The common people are either cretins or people who value music over their lives as upon hearing music panicking or taking shelter should have been the most logical option but that doesn't seem to happen here.What was the point of a Conductor anyway, aside from acting as energy batteries? It's said that they control the Musikarts but in the final battle like many before, we can see that Destiny was able to defeat Hell/Heaven even without Takt waving his stick around. This brings to my next point, how in the fucking world was Destiny able to defeat Hell/Heaven? Destiny stood no chance against Hell or Heaven separately, defeating their combined form while herself being heavily injured signifies the massive Plot Armour in this anime. The character development was also trash with Takt being the only characters who developed while Lenny and Titan being well written. I would say Lenny's death was the peak of this show. Sagan was nonsensical character, his goal made no sense at all. It really felt like they made some bullshit up on the spot so we would have a big bad to defeat in the final episode.SOUNDMusic is a highly subjective opinion and personally for me, it wasn't that great. Music is what should have been the heart and soul of this anime but it doesn't feel like it has any relevance to the character motivations, fighting and overall atmosphere of the show. I usually Shazam a score that peaks my interest and nothing of that sort has been happened with this anime. The opening song was a banger and the ending song was average.ARTThe animation seems to carry the anime and it is probably the biggest pros as expected from a MAPPA×Madhouse collaboration. If you are someone probing for visually stunning art and doesn't really care about other aspects of the show then this is the exact eye candy you're looking for.The action is visually gorgeous but repetitive and doesn't seem to crave for ingeniousness.CONCLUSIONTakt op Destiny was not copacetic for me. Still the only way for you to enjoy it is if you turn off your brain and wholeheartedly accept whatever the shit is going to be shoved down your throat.Thank you for reading :) it goes on a reiterate.

Technically this is a post-apocalyptic anime, but with the running water, electricity, cars, pristine suburbia, and plentiful food, it sure doesn\'t feel like it. There is a flashback to show just how bad it was before, but it\'s way...too late in the series to have any impact.The only parts that are dangerous are the poor road conditions and the strange-looking monsters. Hardly anything is know about the monsters - known as D2s - aside from what\'s revealed in the opening episode: they\'re big, they\'re bad, and they hate music (maybe they\'re going through a phase or some shit). Naturally our generic music-crazed protagonist has a problem with this. This serves to get the plot moving, along with the D2 version of a drone strike in episode 2. The story is hard to get invested in because while there are things that are unknown to the viewer, the characters and plot aren\'t compelling enough to want to uncover the truth. So the mystery just feels annoying, and when it\'s solved, it\'s painfully predictable.Sound: 7/10 The sound is good enough. Since Takt Op. centers around music, one of the gimmicks is the inclusion of classical music during battles. It goes well enough, but it\'s not any better than other soundtracks from high-profile shounen. Voice acting is perfectly fine, and the battle scenes sound... ""crunchy in a good way"" I guess. There isn\'t a better term I can think of. The intro is a banger while the outro is just there. Not that much else to say, which isn\'t a good sign when the whole shtick of the anime is y\'know: music.Characters: 1/10 Takt, Destiny, and Anna; otherwise known as the one the really fucking loves music, the one the wants to rid the world of D2s, and the one that is fed up with the other two.  Seriously, these three are flatter than cardboard. The character dynamics change ever so slightly through the series, but chances are you will not be invested enough to notice. Perhaps the writers aimed at ""classic dysfunctional trio,"" but they ended up with ""teeth-grindingly insufferable"" instead. There are some uninspired and tropey side characters, a smattering of hot Musicarts (gacha game gonna gacha game), and a villain who\'s motivation is nonsensical even by anime standards. The characters eclipse the story as the worst part of Takt Op.Art: 8/10 The animation in Takt Op. is the main selling point, and it does deliver. The American setting feels somehow even more American than the USA is in real life. This is thanks to great attention to detail and skill on part of the animators. The human characters wear outfits ranging from 1960\'s waitress dresses to a grey shirt and suspenders. Varied, but sometimes overly simple. The Musicarts on the other hand, are all some variation of badass battle girl, and have elegant and colorful designs to suit their (pretty cliche) personalities. The action is colorful, clean, and well-animated, and there is plenty of it, but the choreography of the fights is uninspired. Arguably the two most impressive parts of all the battles throughout the whole series are just some really flashy power beams that leave a scar in the landscape to show just how powerful they were. The art is the best part of this anime, but is not enough to save it.Overall: 3/10 The main problem boils down to the fact that Takt Op. is just bland. I\'m giving it a 3, which is not an average of the individual scores, but is a reflection of my overarching opinion. The art and sound are good, but the characters and story are very much not. It\'s like the creators crammed a delicious part and a distasteful part together and expected the good to overpower the bad. But instead it feels like you drizzled chocolate syrup on Brussel sprouts: it still ends up tasting awful. Please, avoid Takt Op. Destiny and watch something more deserving of your time. too late in the series to have any impact.The only parts that are dangerous are the poor road conditions and the strange-looking monsters.

Both have brought so many delightful animations to life in the past few years, such as One Punch Man and Jujutsu Kaisen, that I was under the impression they had conceived, at the very least, another visually gorgeous work, even if the story wasn\'t that promising in my eyes. Then, a weird thought came up. ""Who cares about plot, right? Let\'s just enjoy a bunch of cool and flashy fight scenes and call it great!"". Sometimes, we just want...to ""turn off"" our brains and escape from a boring reality, don\'t we?Well, here\'s a lesson I learned by going through a lot of rough experiences: there\'s no such thing as ""turning your brain off"" without dying. Simple as that.When I think about Takt Op Destiny, the first word which pops up in my mind is ""plastic"". It feels very artificial, so to speak. Not a single line of dialogue sounds spontaneous, as if the writers were trying really hard to emulate generic exchanges from other pieces, instead of conceiving unique, organic and creative interactions. Ok, I might be exaggerating. There\'s a few moments which depict kinda well human beings talking like actual human beings. Are they enough? Probably not, considering how difficult it was to simpathyze with each character, from start to finish. Most scenes just repeated the whole ""Hey, look at Takt! Isn\'t he such a obsessive prick who only cares about music, despite having a good heart deep down? Oh, there\'s our Destiny − a perfect waifu material, quite gorgeous and addicted on sugar!"" over and over again, through annoyingly similar deliveries. The same pattern goes for other characters, such as Anna (a worried onee-san) and Titan (a cheerful loli).I won\'t even make a deep dive into the plot, because it\'s almost non-existant. Giant monsters started to attack mankind, causing society to rely on a strict set of individuals capable of striking back − how many times have you seen this? Well, that\'s basically it, with a cheap conspiracy plot that doesn\'t tell anything new or meaningful. Even the main villains managed to disappoint me with their lame motivations. On the other hand, the soundtrack is kinda captivating and the action is decent, although the fight coreographies could impress a lot more given its animation\'s quality.Takt Op Destiny turned out to be just a shallow and forgettable experience. What a shame. For those brave enough to explore the game, good luck.

Destiny is quite boring despite its explosive action sequences, flashy animation and good-looking character designs.Three characters, Takt, Cosette and Anna are too simple and one dimensional.Takt is obsessed with music. Cosette is obsessed to kill monsters. They both are extremely reckless and Anna has a hard time managing them. Their motives are also spelled out loudly, and seem to have no other intentions. Every thing is clear as day and there is nothing contradictory, challenging or mysterious to them. This show will heavily rely on the side characters, a lot who are shown in the OP, so maybe...there are better chemistry that awaits.Plot has a simple arrangement and gives away a few crucial info right at the first episode, spoiling the suspense that could be cultivated in the next episodes. Plot develops in an extremely slow pace too. A lot of the time are spent on hunting monsters which contributes nothing to the plot. It is also very easygoing with the cause-and-effect. Despite the large scale destruction or dangerous events, our characters don't have to be held responsible for anything then just move on with their journey, the victims are happy. Also, they always win because they are genius. There is nothing to worry about and their growth is assured (because they are genius).But why should I condemn Takt Op. Destiny when a lot of flashy anime with just as boring plot are praised to heavens? I give Takt Op. Destiny a 10/10.

That does not necessarily mean that it’s meant to draw attention to an adapted source manga or light novel, though. Anime as advertisement could also be for the studio that made it, as certain studios have established clout or reputation, and thus naturally have more attention drawn to their works. Other times, an anime could act as an attractor for a new enterprise altogether, serving to drum up enthusiasm and hook in a new audience to the emerging property.""takt op.Destiny"" was a Fall 2021 anime that served to draw attention to the takt...op franchise. As a new collaboration between studios MAPPA and Madhouse, a show like this has a two-fold mission that it must complete – succeed as a standalone piece of media, while also being good enough to make people think to themselves that the mobile game it’s helping to market is also worth their time and energy. Making an anime is already hard enough especially in the current anime industry climate, and these extra expectations upon the show don’t exactly make its job any easier.In an apocalyptic future, monsters known as D2s violently attack any location that plays music, as music is the only thing that can hurt or kill them. To battle the D2s and attempt to bring peace and music back to humanity, various individuals called Conductors are imbued with the power to command Musicarts, superpowered beings that use music as a combative force. The Conductor Takt Asahina and his Musicart Destiny start a journey with their mutual friend Anna to the New York Symphonica, hoping to learn the truth behind the D2 appearances, all while trying to stop them and allow music to be played freely once again. Along the way, they will meet other Conductors and Musicarts, battle D2s, and struggle.The series starts off well by integrating its exposition with actual events. Takt is well-oriented as being the odd duck out in this post-music world, being so drawn to the piano that he plays it, despite knowing the danger it would entail. Destiny’s laconic personality clashing with Takt and Anna’s impatience at Takt and Destiny paints a good foundational tableau, establishing the chief dynamic among the three. With an action sequence to show the power of the D2s and Musicart concept, ""takt op.Destiny"" manages to convey most of its information effectively. The intriguing premise behind Musicarts and the D2s, and the comedic moments with Takt, Destiny, and Anna, gives the first episode a strong first impression as they travel on their merry way.But the potential fun of a road comedy action series gets derailed quickly once more time is spent with the main trio beyond the first episode. Takt’s personality is so disenfranchised and aloof that unless someone is having a discussion related to music, moments just seem to mostly bounce off of him. He’s cold, and while that might make sense in a post-apocalyptic landscape, it makes getting endeared to him far more difficult. Because she is neither a Conductor nor a Musicart, Anna serves as little more than the means to get the group to the Symphonica by driving them, or is trying to make contributions to the relationship between Takt and Destiny.As far as Destiny is concerned, it is revealed very early in the show that she used to be a human named Cosette, that she was Anna’s younger sister, and that she also likes music. Her relationship to Takt is, at best, incredibly vague and at worst is stunningly underdeveloped. The idea that they are bound together by their Conductor-Musicart connection reads more as a flimsy attempt to give Cosette characterization without actually going through the effort of doing so. Any character development that Destiny would undergo, or that Takt and Destiny would undergo together down the line, becomes too rickety and forced because not enough time is taken to make Cosette a more rounded character beyond being adorable. Whether it be through Anna attempting to make Takt and Destiny get along, or Destiny realizing something about Takt, herself, or the world around her, it reads as clumsy.And the bit of development that we see from Destiny isn’t that engaging, either. Since she functions as a robotic or emotionally blank character, she falls into a lot of the common trappings associated with such an archetype. Calling something a “creature” instead of a “cat,” or a “tool” instead of a “hammer,” Destiny’s bed of knowledge seems almost completely centered around fighting D2s and food. The latter of which is mostly used for comedic purposes, even if it’s supposed to refuel her to continue fighting. Aside from a character obsessed with food not being inherently funny, Destiny’s actual switch from emotionally blank to a more-complex emotional palette doesn’t have a solidified point of orientation. The result is that the shift is abrupt and crammed.Also crammed is the idea of how music factors into this story. ""takt op.Destiny"" offers a lot of proselytizing about how great music is, but largely without probing it further. Music is, supposedly, more-engrained in the show’s DNA both in regards to the plot and the characters, but is kept bizarrely at a distance throughout most of the run. This even impacts moments where music is meant to take centerstage. There’s a sequence where Takt is playing jazz piano and Destiny talks about what Takt’s music does to her, but so little of the music actually plays that it never got the opportunity to enter myself as a viewer. Destiny’s discussion happens in a setting completely divorced from Takt’s playing. This sequence, and others like it, insinuate that music’s contribution to the story is limited to being a plot device or gimmick, rather than an actual force that moves things forward. This also factors into the series soundtrack – despite all the famous classical pieces, we so rarely hear good quality recordings or re-orchestrations of the works, which takes away from the sense of raw power that they allegedly have.That’s not to say that the show doesn’t try to incorporate music, because it does, albeit not very well. One other Conductor-Musicart duo, Lenny and Titan (which is probably a Leonard Bernstein reference), meet with the main trio and they try to train Takt and Destiny. It ultimately boils down to Lenny saying, “Feel the harmony,” without actually explaining what that means. I can readily accept that becoming adept at battle requires practice, just like music requires practice. But the idea that a single phrase or battle somehow manages to put Takt and Destiny in such synch together makes little sense. I wanted to believe that it was going to go for an angle that their synchronicity was a sign that Cosette was within Destiny somewhere. It would have helped salvage the ambiguous relationship between Takt and Cosette. Unfortunately, that doesn’t happen, nor is their relationship ever put in its proper limelight.Visually, the series manages to be just adequate on most fronts. The action sequences are alright, but never blew me away despite their fluidity. The landscape depictions are decent, and the designs on the D2s crazy forms and the Musicarts show creativity. Speaking of the Musicarts, just like music’s ability to take on different forms and genres, the various Musicarts all have distinct designs that establish them as their own individualized beings, emotional content notwithstanding. Some of the ways they’re able to incorporate their forms into attacking are fun, although ""takt op.Destiny"" misses an opportunity to make even fuller use of this. Each Musicart is named after a piece of classical music, yet it never seems like the piece of music serves as an actual influence on the attacks themselves or their personalities. The composition names are framed more as namedrops instead of having a deeper, symbolic connection to the character. “Destiny” as a designation is indeed a reference to a Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony nickname, but it doesn’t extend any further other than implying that Destiny the character is a protagonist, “destined” to stop the D2s. I guess I’m just confused as to what this show was trying to accomplish with all its musical business.And that, in a sense, is why ""takt op.Destiny"" doesn’t work; it’s a series confused about what it actually is trying to do. It wants to be a mahou shoujo action piece, but also wants to aspire to more meaningful discussions about what music means to people. It wants to be a road comedy, but the comedy dries up so quickly that it breaks down rather than cruises. It wants to make the D2s out to be malevolent, but leaves them without direction. Not knowing what the point of the D2s or their attacks was remained until the final episode, making the show’s building to the climax come across as ill-conceived and desperate.""takt op.Destiny"" fails as road comedy, action romp, and thought-provoking show about music. Its characters are never given enough time to fully flesh-out their personalities beyond small quirks or emotions, and the true aim of the antagonists is kept in the dark for far too long. The action pieces are merely passable despite some decent individual moments, yet do not salvage the languishing story. Its discussions about music cannot move beyond simplistic blanket statements about how wonderful the art form is, and it never sufficiently explains the connection between Musicart and Conductor.

I wanted to like takt op. Destiny from the very beginning, and for a long time I really did! I loved tuning in every week to see how the plot developed and the characters progressed. Honestly I was pretty content with this anime, the animation is breathtaking and I really liked a majority of the characters... that is until the finale.When I had finished the final episode I sat and really thought about my thoughts on it as well as the anime as a whole for a few...days and then it finally dawned on me. After 12 weeks I finally had my answer... this anime was bad. Okay well maybe bad is overkill but it definitely was NOT good. The finale really put into perspective just how paper thin the plot was. Character motivations were flimsy and never fully realized or achieved. The world building was confusing and poor. But perhaps my biggest problem with this anime was none other than the titular character; Takt. He is an unbearable protagonist. Just a pain to watch and at no point did I ever root for him. He\'s unnecessarily unkind to the ones closest to him and always dragging things down. They tried to do the grumpy main guy trope but just made him a complete asshole. He also doesn\'t grow in the slightest from episode 1 to episode 12. No change. Just the same stagnant uninteresting character. Thank god Destiny and Anna are part of the main cast because otherwise this would not be an easy watch. At first seeing Cosette\'s very charming personality be stripped into the husk that is Destiny was a bit of a letdown. but overtime I really learned to appreciate Destiny as her own character. And Anna, her sister, and the rest of her family accept her as her own individual person and welcome her with open arms. A lot of her development revolves around ""serving"" Takt which sucks but aside from that, I love her character. Another favorite for me (or favorites) is Lenny and Titan. These two were so fun whenever they were on screen and were just so pleasant and nice, unlike Takt\'s hating ass 😭. I especially loved Lenny since character\'s like him are so rarely seen in such a respectful light. They never overdid his more flamboyant qualities or made him a caricature that the other characters would be weirded out by. Too bad this anime hates me personally and kills both him and Destiny off at the end. Speaking of:My next issue with this anime is the villains. The first one, Schindler just gets told off by Heaven in a very admittedly satisfying scene but after that, we never see him again. It\'s like the writers completely forgot he existed. You\'d think after that he\'d come back and swear revenge or something but no. Sagan seemed like a cool idea for a villain as well but is also very unceremoniously taken care of. His motivations are kinda weak and I wish they expanded upon or fleshed it out better.It became very clear that this anime was basically just a commercial for their upcoming mobile game, seeing as it ended pretty open endedly and it\'s library of colorful fighting girls called ""musicarts"" seem perfect for a anime battle gacha game. If they were going to go that route I wish they would have put more care in the anime\'s story. After the anime leaving a sour taste in my mouth I have no intention in seeing how the story continues in their gambling anime girl cash grab.

The best thing to come out of this anime musically was it\'s OP by ryo (supercell) whose music I already enjoy. At least the one significant cultural impact this anime had was the return of such a prolific producer. days and then it finally dawned on me. After 12 weeks I finally had my answer... this anime was bad. Okay well maybe bad is overkill but it definitely was NOT good. The finale really put into perspective just how paper thin the plot was. Character motivations were flimsy and never fully realized or achieved. The world building was confusing and poor. But perhaps my biggest problem with this anime was none other than the titular character; Takt. He is an unbearable protagonist. Just a pain to watch and at no point did I ever root for him. He\'s unnecessarily unkind to the ones closest to him and always dragging things down. They tried to do the grumpy main guy trope but just made him a complete asshole. He also doesn\'t grow in the slightest from episode 1 to episode 12. No change. Just the same stagnant uninteresting character. Thank god Destiny and Anna are part of the main cast because otherwise this would not be an easy watch. At first seeing Cosette\'s very charming personality be stripped into the husk that is Destiny was a bit of a letdown. but overtime I really learned to appreciate Destiny as her own character. And Anna, her sister, and the rest of her family accept her as her own individual person and welcome her with open arms. A lot of her development revolves around ""serving"" Takt which sucks but aside from that, I love her character. Another favorite for me (or favorites) is Lenny and Titan. These two were so fun whenever they were on screen and were just so pleasant and nice, unlike Takt\'s hating ass 😭. I especially loved Lenny since character\'s like him are so rarely seen in such a respectful light. They never overdid his more flamboyant qualities or made him a caricature that the other characters would be weirded out by. Too bad this anime hates me personally and kills both him and Destiny off at the end. Speaking of:My next issue with this anime is the villains. The first one, Schindler just gets told off by Heaven in a very admittedly satisfying scene but after that, we never see him again. It\'s like the writers completely forgot he existed. You\'d think after that he\'d come back and swear revenge or something but no. Sagan seemed like a cool idea for a villain as well but is also very unceremoniously taken care of.

The ending was also a really solid song which was really nice to listen to after finishing a episode.Plot:The premise was fine musicart that descended from heaven...help human fight monster that came to earth by meteorite.

Where do I even begin...?I don't think I've seen such a mixed bag of review scores. Its either high eights or tens or low fours and twos. And I agree with both. Now I understand the inherently paradoxical nature of this statement. So let me explain, and maybe you will agree, disagree - whatever conclusion you have drawn, I ask that you hear me out.Takt Op. Destiny is fantastic show. Its could also be one of the worst shows. And that's largely gonna depend on what you are looking for in an anime.To start, what do I think? This is, so far,...my Fall pick for the Best Seasonal Anime. Granted, I am catching up on both Jobless Reincarnation and Eighty-Six. However, given what I've seen of all of them, and how much I compare it to the beginning of Takt Op. Destiny, I vastly prefer this over both of those. There's a lot I love about this show: its visuals, the character dynamics, the sounds and OST, and the world. Takt, as a package so far, has entertained, wowed and satisfied me beyond belief.But as a story with compelling characters, nuance and such? Maybe. Remains to be seen. But as of now, its lacking on that front. I adore the dynamic between the main trio, and there were some early story beats that allowed me to sympathize on a basic fundamental level with the characters. But you won't be getting Attack on Titan level characters here. Partially why I believe there are so many low reviews is because there's a lot of expectation on this show to be something its not. Either its too early to judge (episode 5 as of this review) or this is the reality of this show. And I don't think that's a bad thing. When I sit down to watch a show, I wanna enjoy myself. And the enjoyment I've gotten out of Takt Op. Destiny is well worth my monthly subscription for Crunchy Roll.Are my standards low? Probably. I'm pretty easy to please. But I also dislike many shows that are liked by many, such as Bunny Girl Senpai, Fire Force, and Tokyo Revengers. At the end of the day, there will always be something fundamentally that keeps us from enjoying a show. I have yet to find that reason with Takt, so I will continue to tune in every week.My verdict? It entertains, and you may find it to be as charming as I have. And if you don't? No harm done. Its not for everyone, and I say that as someone who loves this show to bits. my Fall pick for the Best Seasonal Anime. Granted, I am catching up on both Jobless Reincarnation and Eighty-Six.

Is this the next big thing? Nope. This is a shallow one, but not everything on the market has to be deep or life changeging. This one is great if you don't have the expectation of a deep and complex story and just want to look at characters fuck shit up.I personally enjoy this anime, its a nice watch, the character designs are great but so far it's not too deep or ground breaking. As of EP5 there's still a lot unexplained and I hope the next episodes will give us some more exposure.The fightscenes are nice to...look at, the banter between Takt and Destiny is something I personally enjoy. Speaking of characters (slight spoilers ahead)Takt is a grumpy teenager, and to be honest not the worst one I have seen in anime, Destiny/Cosette is the inhuman cold one — which I personally enjoy as even though we get to meet the original Cosette for like 2 Minutes is a nice contrast to her nice and caring personality. I wished that overall the other characters feelings about loosing ones sister/childhood crush which then gets replaced by someone who doesn't understand the world and is cold all the time would be explored more but as this series is more on the shallow side I don't see it happening — if it does, I'm going to be pleasantly surprised. look at, the banter between Takt and Destiny is something I personally enjoy.

Oh, wait - I forgot - they don\'t save the world with song, they just use violence. Old-fashioned, top-notch sakuga violence - set to classical piano which is pretty fantastic ngl.The need to know plot points are basically that D2 are (pick one, interchangeable) monsters/demons/kaiju that are attracted to music and nearly destroyed civilization, but then random robot angels began to show up and bond with human ""conductors""...who direct them in battle against the D2s with their big musically trained brains... WAIT!! Don\'t go! Are you still here? Okay good - you also need to know that the battles. are. epic! Incredible work here by Mappa, really living up to their growing reputation for top-notch fight scenes. But I have to complain about what they FAILED to animate, which for me really held this show back and turned what could have been.I\'ll get to stuff I do really like about this show in a minute - but wat they failed to animate was MC Takt Asahina\'s piano playing. Also a failure by the sound team. As a character, there isn\'t anything wrong with him at all! He\'s a well WRITTEN character. His character centers around his love for piano and music, and as a byproduct of the chip on his shoulder about music basically being forbidden since the D2s showed up, he has an acidic disdain for literally everything and everyone else that isn\'t related to his perspective on piano and music. I don\'t mind that he\'s a grouchy, rude, egocentric bastard who would marry his piano and have a litter of baby grands if he could. I don\'t mind that he\'s a jerk who pretty much ignores the needs of the people who care about him, and doesn\'t deserve or appreciate any of the one-sided personal relationships he happens to have. What I do mind, very much - is far more superficial than that... when he sits down at the piano and plays, he\'s the most mundane, boring ass piano player ever!Takt Asahina never improvises, he doesn\'t appear to be interested in what he\'s playing, and has a garbage repertoire of songs anyone can and anyone would play. Yet no matter who hears him, contrary to his own antisocial and dismissive attitude towards others including musicians, everybody loves his piano playing. Huh. Well, this is a WIDE miss by the production team. The animators are KILLING IT with the fight scenes, and they just needed a couple scenes of this guy crushing it on the piano for this show to work despite the odd theme. Sweating, making faces, throwing his head back, leaning his head in, vibrating with the mood of his playing... doesn\'t seem hard to do compared to the brilliant fight scenes every episode. Yet it wasn\'t done, so it\'s impossible to feel like this guy is the real deal. Never in your life would you hear this guy play piano and think ""wow, THAT GUY can play!"".It would have been so much more interesting if they had set this up such that he thought he was really good because he\'s been playing by himself in his garage since he was 2 but he actually sucks - then people tell him the truth, in particular career musicians of which he meets many, but he\'s delusional and maintains his self-image. That would have been great! Or just make us feel like he\'s any good at his obsession - but they couldn\'t and because the whole show revolves around music to a degree it feels 110% phony. The impact of this oversight is hard to overstate in this particular show, and it\'s a tough pill to swallow.But it\'s not that tough, because the characters overall are actually quite well written and have fantastic chemistry as well. There\'s like a Tarantino-esque vibe they manage to achieve sometimes, not all the time, and when they do it really let you look past the warts on the story. That said, this story has got some serious witchface going on. However, the frequent battles set to classical piano are excellent and the visual presentation of the waifu ""musicarts"" is top-notch (Mappa so yeh). There is also this excellent motif where Takt has to lose his arm to sustain his Waifucart Destiny in battle, and it looks really cool. The battles are a treat, and worth watching the show just to see - they will keep you coming back that\'s for sure.The character models are also lovely - in general the art and the background art is top-notch, they vary the setting to a higher degree than you will usually see in an Anime. Further, in the character department once more - Lenny is an absolute Chad. A very strong, very gay character - probably my favorite in the show thus far. The way they handled him in general was admirable, as was the way his backstory was revealed long after he was introduced, and in a context that was topical to the current struggle of the main characters. But, they did kind of cock it up in a recent episode where what happened to him just didn\'t make sense in that particular situation.So a lot of diconnected thoughts there, but this is a disconnected Ahnime. Still -it is excellent for its action anime components - you can do way worse than Takt Op Destiny, and although it certainly is missing some gripping element or identity the production values of the action, well written characters, pacing, and variation in the settings as they travel make it very enjoyable to watch.

Destiny had no reason to be an actively bad show, if I were to make an apt musical comparison, I\'d liken it to an orchestra that starts with a beautiful melody.However eventually, as the performance goes on, many of the individual performers begin to mess up individual notes, until eventually, not even the conductor can keep the performance together and it fades into an incomprehensible mess.At the beginning of this show airing, I thought it had a lot going for it, the setting in midwestern America felt like a refreshing breeze compared to the usual setting of ""random small town in Japan"",...even as someone from the east coast I much preferred this to the later scenes in New York. The music went in a unique direction too, adding small flourishes of piano to the battles, and the opening was my favorite of the season. The character dynamics were basic and predictable but enjoyable to the point where I could say I was having fun whenever a character opened his/her mouth. Takt and Destiny\'s beginning antics as foils to each other worked well, and Anna served as a great character to ground the audience. The worldbuilding was the least impressive part, a basic apocalypse setting with the added quirk that all music is banned, or at least extremely dangerous to play. The concept held promise for future character drama in the lives of some of the civilians Takt and Destiny have to protect.Where does the show go after this? After the first 2 episodes, the show begins to miss notes, Takt and Cosette\'s backstories are unremarkable and with very little drama that can\'t be found in other anime, the setting begins to feel more like a basic apocalypse, and the realization that the show\'s shtick of ""no music"" actually doesn\'t change all too much hampers the engagement of the show. After Lenny and Titan each character introduced is actively bad, I could describe each in about two words based on their tropes.""But none of these blunders can ruin a show, as long as the core concepts stick"". I thought. ""And this is a mobile game adaptation, they\'ll probably throw about 20 characters our way, maybe something else will stick.""The show then proceeds to double down, seemingly intent on focusing on the absolute worst parts of itself. Revisiting this show for this review I thought it was 24 episodes instead of 12 because each one dragged on so long. Every interaction is just similar tropes repeating over and over. Fights no longer hold meaning, no technique is used, it\'s just colorful characters swinging blades and/or shooting at each other.The same tracks are repeated for the same ""dramatic"" moments, souring the overall OST. For a show focused on music there was very little variety to be found. Takt and Cosette undergo some basic character changes in the middle of the series, but then stagnate in the final few episodes. Their characters near the end of the show are 10 times less interesting than the ones we saw in episode one. It\'s like the show goes out of its way to destroy the likable relationship between Takt, Destiny, and Ann. Major character development happens in the last minutes of the show between Takt and Ann, which is not foreshadowed, makes no sense in canon, and destroys their fun character dynamic. And if you have watched any number of action anime, you can probably guess what happened just from my vague description.All of these complaints are just exemplified by the fact that the overarching plot doesn\'t create any suspense. Each objective is nothing but a vague goal that matters only to the characters, and not to the audience. This is especially bad in the finale, where the main antagonist is so vague and unthreatening that there was nothing to keep me motivated to watch the show.There was only one real character arc that could grip me throughout the show, and that was Lenny and Titan\'s, however as soon as that arc ends, the characters go on and never mention it again.At the end of Takt Op.

And the potential wasn\'t even anything spectacular.', ""The fact that Takt Op. Destiny was made to promote a gacha game was all you needed to know to not expect much. Everything gacha touches turns into sludge. The result is yet another series that is all animation and cute girls but nothing else. Not only that, many times the animation looks hilariously ugly, and still frame power point presentations make an awful lot of appearances for something that's been getting praised so much for it's animation. Here's an anime about music even though there rarely is any. They could have at least tried using some lesser known works to be more unique. Even...rarer than that is character develop.This series is a prime exactly of how not to do character development. Takt is an annoyingly bitter piano player who is also stinky. I did develop a bit of a soft spot for him because of his struggle to write a good song, but mostly I felt bad because his character was overly poorly done. His character goes nowhere in the series from beginning to end. All that build up to write a song they only showed you 3 seconds of. It's like they ran out of budget or time to compose one more piece; and it was the most important one, in fact. Ana somehow became one of the most useless and irrelevant characters I have ever seen. They cheated by making her relevant out of nowhere at the last second. Near the end they decided to have her do something that made no sense because there was no build up to it, and she still had no development other than being reduced to a piece of fan service. It was the writers last ditch effort to make her relevant. It's hilarious that the whole time the viewers thought Destiny would consume Takt but it was really Ana who consumed Destiny for the sake of the plot in the end.Then there's Destiny. She is yet another boring and bland Violet Evergarden rip off done wrong. After having no development for a large part of the series, they rush through it towards the end and her emotions flipped 180 degrees so fast it was executed terribly and felt awkward. After that she goes back to her apathetic ways. Her personality is so deceased it became annoying. Cossette was a much more likeable character that sadly got barely any screen time. If I was to try and justify it, maybe emotional Destiny was so bizarre and out of character because it was Cosette coming out. A split personality would have been better for this character. Destiny and Cosette were truly a tragedy. It felt like an insult to them for the writers to just toss them away when the romance between her Takt was what actually had development and build up. Of course Ana had to come out of nowhere, and Cosette sadly became a ghost forever after episode 3.The plot itself is a boring road trip across the United States. They couldn't even make that fun and instead infested the series with irrelevant side quests. It felt episodic, and episodic anime feels mostly hit or miss most of the time; at least in my experience. Sakugan is another series suffering from this.The D2 represent something that annoys me about several series: The inclusion of nonsensically written villains that are too easy to beat, and thus there are no stakes or risks. They appear aimless and are there for the sake of animation and just being something for the protagonists to fight. They feel so hollow as they have no clear motivation, goals, or proper backstory. Monster writing in To Your Eternity and Wonder Egg Priority fell this way also. By the time they try to introduce bigger villains who were actually in control, they come off as hilariously badly written and bland. Hell was amusing at first, but with no development, since not doing any is this series' specialty, her character got too hollow and eventually too annoying with her over the top personality.Was there anything good or respectable? Titan and Lenny were, and they deserved better than what this lump of coal of a series gave them. They're much better than Takt and Destiny as main characters and should had been the main ones. I have little complaints about Lenny besides him rarely being there, and Titan at least had character unlike that pale ghost with the pretty colors. An amusing fact about Titan and Lenny's voice actors is that they worked together before in The Aquatope of White Sand as Kukuru and her boss. Now that I think about it, I've been enjoying Scarlet Nexus and Deep Insanity: The Lost Child more than this.This is a series that almost offends me. The only thing it really excelled in is being one of the biggest disappointments of the Fall season, considering how much many viewers were looking forward to it. It's a soulless disaster hardly worth talking about. Speaking of this promoting a gacha game, have fun playing it; it got indefinitely delayed. rarer than that is character develop.This series is a prime exactly of how not to do character development. Takt is an annoyingly bitter piano player who is also stinky. I did develop a bit of a soft spot for him because of his struggle to write a good song, but mostly I felt bad because his character was overly poorly done. His character goes nowhere in the series from beginning to end. All that build up to write a song they only showed you 3 seconds of. It's like they ran out of budget or time to compose one more piece; and it was the most important one, in fact. Ana somehow became one of the most useless and irrelevant characters I have ever seen. They cheated by making her relevant out of nowhere at the last second. Near the end they decided to have her do something that made no sense because there was no build up to it, and she still had no development other than being reduced to a piece of fan service. It was the writers last ditch effort to make her relevant. It's hilarious that the whole time the viewers thought Destiny would consume Takt but it was really Ana who consumed Destiny for the sake of the plot in the end.Then there's Destiny.

Having said that, I think the preface of this series has a lot of potential and the fact that it dwells on classical music (not the same as a musical anime, where music theory is central to the plot) and unravels more of its world and characters,...will make it better with time.

Overall, I am having a good time watching the episodes and will keep watching them.', 'small spoiler warning for the ending of the showWow. When I had heard that a show being animated by Mappa and Madhouse was coming out, I was instantly hooked. Even though I don’t love everything the two studios put out, they certainly have stellar animation, so I was excited to feast my eyes on some great sakuga.Well, the show started to come out and it started out pretty strong with a pretty decent first episode, I was thinking to myself ""man, this is it, best anime this season."" but then the show continued.Unfortunately, with each episode I found myself liking it less and...less (with the exception of episode 6). But why was this so bad you Fiend of the festering fries you fanatically fawn over you may ask? Well, have no fear dear reader for I will elaborate.Let’s first talk about the one good thing and that was the art and animation. Like I said I knew going in that the animation was going to be great and I wasn’t disappointed. The show has some great moments of action and scenes where the animation and lighting really shine. The fight scenes look awesome, and I actually really liked the style too. These two studios collaborating on something is a dream come true, sadly it had to be wasted on a bad story with terrible characters. (Why madhouse couldn’t help Mappa with attack on titan is beyond me).The story has a very interesting premise. Basically, a quiet place but instead of noise its music. Music being entirely gone from this world is a cool idea and it attracting the monsters is also neat. plus, the only way to beat them is by using these musicarts is also cool. This is where the good stuff ends because a lot of stuff is left unexplained. Where did the D2s come from? Why are they attracted to music? While some of these might be elaborated on in the future it would have been helpful to get some hints. Another thing that really bugs me is that a lot of the times (with the exception of episode 6) people are constantly telling and not showing. They constantly tell you how music is awesome, how music impacted them so much, how they will find a cure for a certain character, how they will rule the world. We aren’t shown that stuff. SHOW how important music is, show us how this person is constantly struggling to make an antidote (outside of the last like 2 episodes). The ending also leaves so many questions unanswered and its extremely rushed with no explanations. The main villain literally loses to the MC because the MC just tells him that he is stupid. There were so many places this story could have gone but instead they just introduce tons of plotlines that go nowhere.The characters aren’t helping either. First is the main character. takt. The son of a famous conductor, who is also a piece of garbage. He is so unlikable and yeah yeah I get they\'re trying to go for the whole kinda Tsundere or person who is rough on the outside and soft on the inside. But you have to actually make him somewhat likable for me to care. His companion destiny/Cosette doesn’t help much. They aren’t unlikable but they are very bland, and they have one trait: they like food and sweets. This is because they can make people go: OH MY GOSH SO QUIRKY I LIKE FOOD TOO HEHEHE. Lenny is actually likeable, and he does have some good moments, he might just be the only half decent character. Unfortunately, he isn’t a main character. There was also this one character called anna who tagged along but she is just kinda there and then she kisses takt without any romantic buildup. Finally, the villains have no real motivation and are just kinda evil because well, you wanna see the hot waifus he has, right? All of these characters are so underdeveloped, and they go nowhere so it’s hard to form a connection with them.as for the other things like sound, voice acting, music, etc, I really can’t comment besides they were all average. I think the music being average is really bad because the whole point of the show is to prove how awesome music is but oh well.All in all, Takt Op. Destiny seems to have been only OP in the animation. the story and characters go nowhere, and the ending leaves more questions than answers. I was really thinking a show like this needed to be longer but then I remembered other shows that had 12 episodes like Mob psycho 100, kaguya-sama, and the promised neverland and how I got so attached to them in such a small period of time. This just goes to show that this show really needed better writing to actually succeed. If this show gets another season ill watch it and I actually do really hope that it gets better. I don’t hate this show but I see the potential for greatness and I hope later on we can see some of that. less (with the exception of episode 6).

It's no surprise that an anime made in collaboration with MAPPA and Madhouse would look this good; the animation is phenomenal and the art direction is on the right track... but that's about it, its a pretty show, but the fights are painfully...dull, with little strategy, or stakes for that matter. During the entire duration of this show, there wasn't a single fight I saw that pulled me in and dangled me at the edge of my seat, they're insanely predictable and almost telegraphed in their execution, if it weren't for the animation I doubt anyone would've really given them a chance.p.s. the monster designs feel very uninspired, they're basically just animals but bigger, and with an alien-esc color palette.Sound 6/10For an anime based around using music to fight off an alien threat, the music was kind of dull. There's been no standout tracks, no amazing scores or memorable pieces, it just feels like there's nothing really there. This is made all the more painful when I realized they didn't even used any classical music in this, I swear to god they had the perfect opportunity to use flight of the Valkyries yet somehow didn't, great. I will say however that when the main character Takt, plays the piano it's actually good, but only in the moment, plus the sound effects quality  is remarkably good.Characters 4/10If you're looking for a show with deep or engaging characters, go watch something else, as this shows cast is skin deep at best. From the very beginning we're introduced to the our main ensemble, Takt Asahina, Destiny/Cossette, and Anna, their roles and dynamics where essentially set in stone from there onward. Takt is a music piano obsessed loner, Destiny was and emotionless kudere obsessed with food,  and Anna was the straight woman who had to haul around the two idiots across the united states all the way to New York. This is the show, to be fair I feel that Destiny was the only character who got something resembling development, I don't know what it was but O actually liked her. Takt was kind off just... I don't know, there? I'd say he was mostly apathetic, he was more concerned with finding a piano, telling people how much he wants to play the piano, playing the piano, and reminding is how much he needs to play the piano, it got very annoying very quick.Anna was also much more bearable, though again, she was mostly just there, and I'm surprised how nonchalant she was about the who thing that happened to Cossette; She played her role as a straight man the whole way through, and that's kind of it. I can't say more about the side characters, they were there, much like the main cast, but they were even more paper thin than the main trio which was worse.Story 4/10I wasn't expecting much seeing as this was a mixed media project, the studio couldn't write a complete story because then the gatcha game wouldn't really have anything to tell. Knowing this I came in with low expectations, but Jesus Christ did they somehow still disappoint. The story was sort of advertised as a road trip, that's what we got, but that's it, each episode was episodic in nature, the main trio finds a town, they have some trouble with D2's, Takt sometimes plays the piano, they fight the monsters, and they call it a day. Now of course there are episodes where the formula is bent a little, but its practically unnoticeable, bar like one exception.Don't even get me started on the inconspicuous asshole that got introduced like 5 episodes in, then surprise surprise, he's the villain, definitely didn't see that coming from a mile away.Overall 4/10This show was just mediocre, it had so much going for it, I swear if they had not only more episodes but a better writing team, this could've been one of my anime of the season, but sadly, that's just not how things went. I know MAPPA and Madhouse are capable of making great works, they've done it before and even continue to do it, it's just that every so often, we get shows like this, and even the pretty animation can't save them for me. dull, with little strategy, or stakes for that matter.

The light that illuminates the heart.""- Asahina Takt.Yes, you read it right. Those are the deepest words that Takt (and any other character in the show, for that matter) has to offer on what music is. Music is a metaphor for light. For visuals, not sound, not touch, not even heat. Light. This sums up pretty well what the anime has to offer.The positives of ""Takt op. Destiny"" are art style, character design and, in most occasions, animation (though it gets lacky at times). You can see the pattern. Visuals, not music. To be fair, the soundtrack and sound effects in this show are......acceptable. They are well structured, there is technical knowledge behind it, clearly... but it lacks any ""soul"", anything that would make it memorable or meaningful. Much like our protagonist Takt, who can play very complex pieces, but can\'t reach his audience and provide an emotional experience to them (until he does, for some reason). You\'d expect this to be intentional and a major point for the development of the story, but it\'s not. It\'s boring until the very end.To talk about story, oh, well, do we really need one? Just make some monsters that hate music fall on earth or something. D2s are one dimensional evil creatures with little explanation and no apparent motivation other than stopping music, which threatens them. That goes hand in hand with Schindler, the first major villain of the show, because we need a megalomaniac human villain too, to show that not everything on the human side is black and white. Humans can be bad too. They can even hate something so beautiful and harmless such as music... because... well... anyway. Moving on.Sagan, the 2nd villain of the show, is another bland and mentally inept character. His motivations arise as a mean to ""fight fire with fire"" or eliminate pain by re-signifying pain, which supposedly were to give him more honorable goals. Sagan actually comes up with a half decent idea on how to deal with the D2; although an incomplete plan, it could realistically gather support or, if necessary, even a conspiracy to his side. But no, Sagan tries to do it all alone for no good reason, and in the most harmful way possible, despite there being much better alternatives that could spare many innocents\' lives... like just letting people know what he\'s doing and giving them time to escape.When we stop to analyze the plot events and the tension (if any) in the story line, it can be confusing. What is the main conflict? We know that music is censored and controlled due to the D2, but they don\'t have an explanation. Human counterparts don\'t offer anything better for that purpose. Do we even have real stakes? Meaningful drama? Well, we can put some Beethoven when the generic psycho waifu is choking one of our protagonists, I\'m sure the 5th Symphony- which no one ever heard before - will add more spice to that scene!Regarding characters, the protagonist is supposed to be someone obsessed with a hobby, but he\'s written by a person who doesn\'t seem to possess that passion. There is no convincing reason for his intimate relationship with music neither through dialogue nor through his actions - yes, he always wants to play the piano, but why? The best justification is a father complex after he died, which was not further explored. In all honesty, the depth of characters in this show is nonexistent. They will be very glad to state their plot role with plain tropey words. There are a couple character deaths in the anime, but none of them felt compelling enough, either because the script was terrible and the events happened solely to benefit the plot and provide poor shock value, or because it didn\'t feel like they died at all. If I have to be fair, there are some fun dynamics between Takt and Destiny, but there\'s not much more to it.We have to mention some questionable choices audio wise; missed opportunities, I\'d say. Like the music playing in the background and the fight happening on the screen having little connection other than the obvious matching tone - fight scene, glorious combat music, sad scene, violins and a low tempo. There\'s also so much battle noise during some of the fights that I could barely hear the music sometimes. Why couldn\'t the music be the battle noise instead? There was room to make more unique decisions, but ""Takt op. Destiny"" sticks to the comfort zone of average direction.Another point in that regard is using background tracks so often even though the show is trying to convince you that music is, supposedly, banned from this world. It would be very interesting if we had solemn silence instead, if the anime could focus more on using sound effects to create depth and immersion, while leaving music only for the battle scenes with Musicarts or other scenes where it\'s actually supposed to be playing. Then, each play would have more meaning in contrast to the consuming silence of the in-betweens. Of course, that\'s not what happens in ""Takt opt. Destiny"". Music plays at the same frequency as any other show, and has the same impact on the audience as any other show. It\'s generic, and not deserving of the ""Music"" genre. acceptable. They are well structured, there is technical knowledge behind it, clearly... but it lacks any ""soul"", anything that would make it memorable or meaningful. Much like our protagonist Takt, who can play very complex pieces, but can\'t reach his audience and provide an emotional experience to them (until he does, for some reason). You\'d expect this to be intentional and a major point for the development of the story, but it\'s not. It\'s boring until the very end.To talk about story, oh, well, do we really need one? Just make some monsters that hate music fall on earth or something. D2s are one dimensional evil creatures with little explanation and no apparent motivation other than stopping music, which threatens them. That goes hand in hand with Schindler, the first major villain of the show, because we need a megalomaniac human villain too, to show that not everything on the human side is black and white. Humans can be bad too. They can even hate something so beautiful and harmless such as music... because... well... anyway. Moving on.Sagan, the 2nd villain of the show, is another bland and mentally inept character. His motivations arise as a mean to ""fight fire with fire"" or eliminate pain by re-signifying pain, which supposedly were to give him more honorable goals. Sagan actually comes up with a half decent idea on how to deal with the D2; although an incomplete plan, it could realistically gather support or, if necessary, even a conspiracy to his side. But no, Sagan tries to do it all alone for no good reason, and in the most harmful way possible, despite there being much better alternatives that could spare many innocents\' lives... like just letting people know what he\'s doing and giving them time to escape.When we stop to analyze the plot events and the tension (if any) in the story line, it can be confusing. What is the main conflict? We know that music is censored and controlled due to the D2, but they don\'t have an explanation. Human counterparts don\'t offer anything better for that purpose. Do we even have real stakes? Meaningful drama? Well, we can put some Beethoven when the generic psycho waifu is choking one of our protagonists, I\'m sure the 5th Symphony- which no one ever heard before - will add more spice to that scene!Regarding characters, the protagonist is supposed to be someone obsessed with a hobby, but he\'s written by a person who doesn\'t seem to possess that passion. There is no convincing reason for his intimate relationship with music neither through dialogue nor through his actions - yes, he always wants to play the piano, but why? The best justification is a father complex after he died, which was not further explored. In all honesty, the depth of characters in this show is nonexistent. They will be very glad to state their plot role with plain tropey words. There are a couple character deaths in the anime, but none of them felt compelling enough, either because the script was terrible and the events happened solely to benefit the plot and provide poor shock value, or because it didn\'t feel like they died at all. If I have to be fair, there are some fun dynamics between Takt and Destiny, but there\'s not much more to it.We have to mention some questionable choices audio wise; missed opportunities, I\'d say. Like the music playing in the background and the fight happening on the screen having little connection other than the obvious matching tone - fight scene, glorious combat music, sad scene, violins and a low tempo. There\'s also so much battle noise during some of the fights that I could barely hear the music sometimes. Why couldn\'t the music be the battle noise instead? There was room to make more unique decisions, but ""Takt op. Destiny"" sticks to the comfort zone of average direction.Another point in that regard is using background tracks so often even though the show is trying to convince you that music is, supposedly, banned from this world. It would be very interesting if we had solemn silence instead, if the anime could focus more on using sound effects to create depth and immersion, while leaving music only for the battle scenes with Musicarts or other scenes where it\'s actually supposed to be playing. Then, each play would have more meaning in contrast to the consuming silence of the in-betweens. Of course, that\'s not what happens in ""Takt opt. Destiny"". Music plays at the same frequency as any other show, and has the same impact on the audience as any other show. It\'s generic, and not deserving of the ""Music"" genre.', ""Story: 5/10It's basically a road trip to new york with the occasional plot of some bad guy manipulating things.

I enjoyed the animation in fight sequences (which basically are carrying this somewhat generous score), so you can watch the show for that, and use it as background noise when that...isn't happening.

This was my favorite Anime from the FALL line-up. It was my most prioritized one. The story was making me feel like it\'s gonna be an emotional ride to the end. All of it now... WAS.The ""needed more time"" and ""It was rushed"" excuse could be used, but none can justify how they didn\'t even manage to send one single message properly by the end of the story.At first everything was...looking great, with story seemingly focusing on one main point: Reviving Music. The story was focusing on Takt whose entire character revolves around music. Most of the side-characters will be mostly in support-mode for him, or even share his goal of bringing music back to the world who now fears it. Even the romance between him and the female-lead felt like it was only there to be his character motivation. Add to that the very lovely OSTs and everything was going great story-wise.Unfortunately, the plot eventually divided the attention to multiple other things: World-building, multiple Villains set-up, and the heroine\'s existential crisis.While it\'s a great idea to setup everything, and a lot of things to make a story interesting, it\'s not that good of an idea when you only got 12 Episodes to spare, and the only thing you managed to do in 4 episodes was setup the MCs backstory, and barely solidy their character motivations yet.By the latter half of the series, Takt didn\'t feel like he was on a journey to achieve something. Story-wise, it\'s because he still wasn\'t aware of the real threat. But realistically speaking, it was bad writing. He was just made aware that there\'s a reason why ""D2"" monsters shows up. But then when they reached their destination, he was still clueless. And that made it a bit hard to care for the next events that occured as it felt like it was completely unrelated to his goals even when it does, it just that it wasn\'t properly established yet.Unmei\'s (Female MC) character development was far from a bad idea of course. But maybe it shouldn\'t have strayed away too much from it\'s purpose of being Takt\'s motivation for his goal. The existential crisis felt like a filler instead of a necessary development because it wasn\'t really explained how they (MusicArts) existed in the first place. They felt very much like normal people, except with deadly powers.Anna, while I appreciated in most parts of the series, shouldn\'t have played too much of a part in the story, as it also just took some attention away from the ""Music"" plot, and even amounted to nothing by the end.There\'s also the villains. The first one was basically just a delusional psychopath who, for some reason was jealous of Takt. Accompanied by a very devishly sadistic Musicart named ""Hell"". For a while, they felt threatening enough to be the main villains of the story. That was until the villain was replaced with another... who\'s basically the same darn thing. And imo, that one was disappointing. They didn\'t have enough time left to set him up so he ended up being just another delusional psychopath, but with 2 monstrously strong Musicarts this time. You\'d expect they be more threathening, but nope. They were not. Pointless I say.Art wasn\'t that good to be honest. I liked the character designs but, quality was really inconsistent specially for fight scenes. At first it worked just fine with the story still leaning on the Emotional, Music-driven Drama. But when Action started, it began to noticeably look bad.While it had a lot of lovely BGM, they didn\'t do enough for an Anime who\'s main story revolves heavily around music. I do have this Anime to thank for introducing me to ""Pathetique"" Symphone no.8 2nd movement by Beethoven. Been playing that a lot in this past recent months.Overall, I don\'t hate this Anime, I\'m just disappointed. Heart-broken even.

Or maybe even the first five minutes. After you do that, tell me what you think. Or don’t, because I already know exactly what you’re thinking, seeing as I thought the same thing: why is everyone so cringe? What you have to understand is that the word “cringe” is probably the worst word in English. It’s funny; the word cringe, is itself, cringe. To be honest, I could think of 20 other negatively inclined words that would describe this show, but...“cringe” is regrettably the most fitting.If you want to best experience Takt Op. Destiny, don’t. Just watch some clips of the fights on YouTube or something, cause those are literally all the show has to offer. God I hate the characters. Takt’s entire personality is “I miss Cosette'' and “I must write this song.” Look, it’s not wrong to be passionate about things; even I have my weird obsessions. But when his entire character is writing this song, I’m sorry, he just becomes flat after a while. Although I will admit, his banter with Destiny is actually pretty funny for the first few episodes.When reading the preliminary reviews for the show, I often saw the term “waifu bait” being thrown around. While I’m not really sure what that means, Destiny very much panders to those seeking a “waifu.” She has a distinct quirk (her obsession with sweets), she’s competent (she does all of the fighting), and she’s cute, if you’re into that. But does this make her a good character? Not really. Her infatuation with sweets is funny at first, but later becomes stale. The same joke recycled over and over again will almost never be funny. But I digress that Takt’s eventual acknowledgement of  Destiny and Cosette being different entities was actually pretty touching.The one character I liked the most is actually the one I have the least to say about. Lenny is a whole-ass bro, through and through. Love that guy. His flamboyance and outgoing nature made for a great contrast against the obstinately stoic Takt. I don’t really have anything bad to say about him, except for what they did to him was a fucking crime. I don’t care.Now oh man, the villains are even worse. The biggest redeeming quality of this show is that the villains get a relatively short amount of screen time compared to the main cast. I don’t even know if I could finish the show if the fight scenes were extended any more than they already are. I just fucking hate them so much. Especially that bitch Hell. She adapts the worst shounen battle trope ever. You know that one where people find battling “fun?” that’s Hell, but multiplied. Whenever she appeared in a fight, which is pretty much all the fights in the latter half, I just wanted to stop watching. That stupid smile on her face just made me cringe harder than nails on a chalkboard. You know, I’ve found that pretty much all of my least favourite characters find killing, or fighting, or whatever, fun. Bro, can you be any more edgy? Like “my favourite sound is the cries for help my enemies muster when I slit their throats with my stupid fucking roller skate shoes.” Okay, she didn’t actually say that, you get my point. I swear, when Hell was 14, she wrote Billie Eilish lyrics on the walls of her middle school bathroom. Her unhinged “not like the other girls” nature developed into this cumsock-spawn we now know and hate. Enough about that. Just thinking about her just makes me want to vomit.But what about those fights? Are they any good? Dude, they’re fucking sick. I mean, It’s Mappa and Madhouse; what do you expect? The animation of the fights is obviously S-Tier. The vividly iridescent colours perfectly contrast the grim, apocalyptic American countryside, which make for  an immaculate background for the perfectly choreographed climatic fights, which clearly are the crowning achievement of Takt Op. Destiny. All these factors perfectly beget these beautiful action scenes, which are plentiful throughout the show. Unfortunately, these fights are without emotional substance or stakes due to the lack of care I felt towards the participants.I didn’t even mention people like Anna, Schindler, Sagan, or Titan when discussing the other characters. Why? Cause I want to forget those fuckers ever existed in the first place.Takt Op. Destiny is at its best when it displays its high-budget, nuts-to-butts action. I don’t care about the people or the world. The D2s could take over everything, and I wouldn’t care. Oh yeah, I didn’t even talk about D2s, whose invasion of earth is the main plot device. It doesn’t really matter though, since they have such little presence and provide such little threat that they aren’t even worth talking about.In the end, Takt Op. Destiny is like a hot girl with a stupid voice. She’s hot, sure, but she doesn’t ever stop talking about stupid shit with her yappy voice.

Very good watch, definitely recommend if you have nothing to do and feel like watching something \'impressive\'.', 'Cool, this is cool. Music in the form of badass girls that shoot laser guns and swing swords like, damn. What a cool concept but DAMN... what a poor execution.So you got this world where music can no longer be played. Why, you ask? Weird fecking crystal monsters birthed from a space rock don\'t like music and they kill all in sight. So what do the people do? Make fecking music girls who will kick the shit out of the monsters of course! It isn\'t the worst plot point for a fictional universe, and you can roll with it until it just starts barrelling out...of control all of a sudden.The story follows Takt, our little piano boi with an icicle so far up his ass he makes Jack Frost look like a fecking joke (now, admittedly his personality gets somewhat better, but sweet balls I just want to tea-bag his corpse). Takt is a ""conductor"" as we learn and he has this... thing...? Person...? IDFK what you should call it other than it\'s a ""musicart"" called Destiny, which is like an embodiment of a classical song complete with its unique weapon (which I don\'t remember if that ever gets explained).Honestly, now that I think about it, I can\'t remember if there was an explanation for half of the shit in this anime. As a matter of fact, WTF was Takt\'s goal to begin with? The story goes from him trying to save a character who I GUESS was important to him (this motherfu^ker is so cold and emotionless sometimes you can\'t tell who or what is important to him other than he has a hard-on for pianos) and then seemingly switches to some kind of whacky ""Save The World!"" plot. Not to mention how fecking rushed this all felt. You\'ll get to the last two/three episodes and be like, ""How can you possibly be ending it already?"" It\'s fecking weird man... it\'s like I only watched half of this anime. There are so many things in this story that don\'t get explained, and at this point, I don\'t even care since this probably won\'t have another season (this is apparently being turned into a mobile game so I\'m gonna agree with the masses on this one, that this anime is just a shitty trailer for the game).Characters. F^ck don\'t get me started. You already know I think the protagonist, Takt, is such shit. The kind of shit a cat would forget to cover up because it\'s too busy throwing up its motherf^cking guts. Yeah... maybe that\'s being really harsh since in reality, he is not the worst character in the wide world of anime (FFFFFF^CK you Kirito), but I think I hated him so much because I wanted to like this series so much. I think it could\'ve been so much better if the protagonist was different and had a more interesting, clear achievement they were after. Other than him, the other characters were fairly average but some of them just did weird shit that made no sense. I say this because the character development seemed to be happening in the background. Like in the week that I waited for the next episode, two characters were suddenly closer than the previous episode as if they hung out the entire time off-screen... like WTF. Or two characters that share absolutely NO development between each other, and they suddenly have a fecking kiss scene??? Were the creators just trying to appease hopeless romantics, like, WTF was the purpose of this? It really was just so sad how the characters (who had the ability to be interesting) were uninteresting despite how cool some of them were. That sounds weird but that\'s how it feels to me right now after finishing that God-awful ending like 20 minutes ago as of writing this.The animation and sound were the only things I enjoyed most about this. The animation fights were cool, but it didn\'t blow me away. The anime would\'ve been better off with more of them in my opinion. Regardless, the animation throughout was smooth, clean and the fights didn\'t look like a slideshow.Naturally, the music was great since that is technically what this is supposed to be about. Other than that, nothing special.Would I recommend this? No. It\'s not that it was horrible (like the protagonist was), it just wasn\'t all that enjoyable. I was left with confusion, disappointment, and ruined hopes for what seemed like a great idea. Plus whiplash from how fast they pulled that ending like holy f^ck knuckles I would\'ve been happier with dragging it out to another season so I could at least process the bullshit you fed me MAPPA/Madhouse... So if you like the pain of not understanding what the f^ck is going on, characters that change overnight, and a shitty protagonist similar to Kirito (I\'m sorry SAO fans)... then Takt OP. Destiny is a watch for you.p.s. don\'t waste your time. watching your dog take a shit in the yard is more entertaining than this show.p.s.s. no, I am not encouraging you to watch your dog while it takes a shit, that is f^cking weird and I feel bad for your dog if you already do that. of control all of a sudden.The story follows Takt, our little piano boi with an icicle so far up his ass he makes Jack Frost look like a fecking joke (now, admittedly his personality gets somewhat better, but sweet balls I just want to tea-bag his corpse).

As a matter of fact, WTF was Takt\'s goal to begin with? The story goes from him trying to save a character who I GUESS was important to him (this motherfu^ker is so cold and emotionless sometimes you can\'t tell who or what is important to him other than he has a hard-on for pianos) and then seemingly switches to some kind of whacky ""Save The World!"" plot. Not to mention how fecking rushed this all felt. You\'ll get to the last two/three episodes and be like, ""How can you possibly be ending it already?"" It\'s fecking weird man... it\'s like I only watched half of this anime. There are so many things in this story that don\'t get explained, and at this point, I don\'t even care since this probably won\'t have another season (this is apparently being turned into a mobile game so I\'m gonna agree with the masses on this one, that this anime is just a shitty trailer for the game).Characters. F^ck don\'t get me started. You already know I think the protagonist, Takt, is such shit. The kind of shit a cat would forget to cover up because it\'s too busy throwing up its motherf^cking guts. Yeah... maybe that\'s being really harsh since in reality, he is not the worst character in the wide world of anime (FFFFFF^CK you Kirito), but I think I hated him so much because I wanted to like this series so much. I think it could\'ve been so much better if the protagonist was different and had a more interesting, clear achievement they were after. Other than him, the other characters were fairly average but some of them just did weird shit that made no sense. I say this because the character development seemed to be happening in the background. Like in the week that I waited for the next episode, two characters were suddenly closer than the previous episode as if they hung out the entire time off-screen... like WTF. Or two characters that share absolutely NO development between each other, and they suddenly have a fecking kiss scene??? Were the creators just trying to appease hopeless romantics, like, WTF was the purpose of this? It really was just so sad how the characters (who had the ability to be interesting) were uninteresting despite how cool some of them were. That sounds weird but that\'s how it feels to me right now after finishing that God-awful ending like 20 minutes ago as of writing this.The animation and sound were the only things I enjoyed most about this. The animation fights were cool, but it didn\'t blow me away. The anime would\'ve been better off with more of them in my opinion. Regardless, the animation throughout was smooth, clean and the fights didn\'t look like a slideshow.Naturally, the music was great since that is technically what this is supposed to be about. Other than that, nothing special.Would I recommend this? No. It\'s not that it was horrible (like the protagonist was), it just wasn\'t all that enjoyable. I was left with confusion, disappointment, and ruined hopes for what seemed like a great idea. Plus whiplash from how fast they pulled that ending like holy f^ck knuckles I would\'ve been happier with dragging it out to another season so I could at least process the bullshit you fed me MAPPA/Madhouse... So if you like the pain of not understanding what the f^ck is going on, characters that change overnight, and a shitty protagonist similar to Kirito (I\'m sorry SAO fans)... then Takt OP. Destiny is a watch for you.p.s. don\'t waste your time. watching your dog take a shit in the yard is more entertaining than this show.p.s.s. no, I am not encouraging you to watch your dog while it takes a shit, that is f^cking weird and I feel bad for your dog if you already do that.', ""The best thing that anime has to offer is animation, after that I thought it was going to be beautiful in terms of music but the truth was I was disappointed.

If I had known Takt Op Destiny (TOD) was like this, I wouldn\'t have planned to watch this weekly as a dreadful chore to fulfil.Because out of all the video game/visual novel adaptations, whether they\'re compressed of the original source or...its anime is served as either a prequel, sequel or a spin-off, 99% of it has made me believe that I shouldn\'t get my hopes up for their anime adaptation to be made of worthy storytelling; not to mention that there are many scenes that\'s blatantly telling me, or whoever notices like me, that TOD is a blatant gacha ad in order to get anime viewers to purchase and play the gacha one in the near future. And that\'s how TOD fails to do this for I\'ve seen some comments from gacha lovers that after watching TOD anime, they\'ve lost motivation to be interested in the gacha.For starters, TOD should\'ve gotten another cour to flesh out the characters, important plot elements/devices and coherent plot progression that would\'ve been able to make me like it like what Princess Connect anime adaptation did for me. Nonetheless, there are some one-cour series that have managed to do what I\'ve just mentioned above.The trouble with TOD is that the writing department staff thought that they should put all of the potential elements crammed into 12 episodes because these elements are made up of good quality writing stuff, right? No and no; because too many good ingredients can make the dish taste bad when the ingredients aren\'t managed properly.TOD\'s disorganised ingredients includes the male protagonist who just go with the flow of whatever the plot wants him to do and whose conveyed feelings feels monotonous in my ears especially, a major supporting female character who just kissed the male protagonist out of nowhere without any scenes indicating her body language (particularly her eyes) that she\'s in love with him from the start, the female protagonist\'s character development was unmemorable, not to mention she\'s only developed when her body language doesn\'t keep up with so-called character development, and the villains of this anime are one of the lamest & uninteresting ones I\'ve ever seen in this medium.

I do not hate Anna (the only character I dislike very much was Takt) but they could have built that up. They could have showed us PROPERLY that Anna has romantic feelings for Takt.

That\'s not to say that takt op. Destiny is terrible, or that Arknights: Prelude to Dawn is perfect (it\'s definitely not), but the former is just one of the weirdest ways to try and hype people up for a mobile game (that still isn\'t released yet lol) I\'ve ever seen.Almost everything it should need is there: fun characters with arcs, nice animation, some VERY nice character designs, and cool music. Sure, the plot is pretty substandard, but that...can be made up for if everything else is good. The problem is, it all feels rather hollow; the whole thing lacks a real emotional core, and thus nothing else really has the impact it should. I never felt any kind of emotional connection at all to these characters until about episode 8, and even then it was more of a ""aw good for them :)"" than any kind of real investment.  This is a huge shame because the show had the potential to do something legitimately interesting, by way of its main superpower girl, Destiny, having effectively possessed the dead body of someone very close to our other main characters. This is a great setup for some emotional conflict, but instead, everyone just seems to be totally okay with this fact, and it gets mostly forgotten about after episode 3.Other characters just sort of come and go, never really developing much past their immediate surface-level traits. Obviously-evil characters are evil, mysterious nice supporting characters are good, and I probably could have predicted the entire plot of this show after watching the first episode. That\'s not to mention the show\'s strange aversion to world building; we only ever get a very vague idea of what Musicarts, Conductors, and D2s are. It definitely feels like the board room meeting was just ""let\'s do Fate but with classical music instead of historical figures, and generic alien things instead of anything interesting"". Also, have to say, I did not understand at all what was supposed to be happening in the last 5 minutes if the last episode. It\'s totally ok to show things in a more artistic way to make it interesting, but don\'t make it confusingly so. I had to go read a summary online to understand what was supposed to have happened.There\'s some good things, of course. I did think our main trio had some nice chemistry, and Anna was a lot of fun to watch (it does give me some hope that she is obviously intended to be a central character moving forward in this franchise). MAPPA does a great job, as they have with most everything over the past few years, and the show looks really nice when it wants to. The character designs, or at least those of the superpower girls (who obviously had a whole lot more work put into them than the others), are vibrant and gorgeous. The music ranges from ""ok-at-best"" to pretty damn good, the opening in particular being great imo. I also thought it was pretty neat that the show was a bit of a road trip set in America, something you don\'t see too often in anime.Overall, it\'s one of the saddest things to me when I finish watching a movie or show and realize that I feel basically nothing about what I\'ve just watched. This show is fine, but being just fine is kind of worse than being bad. I doubt I\'ll remember anything about this show in a month, save for some of the music and character designs. At least the game looks mildly interesting...? can be made up for if everything else is good. The problem is, it all feels rather hollow; the whole thing lacks a real emotional core, and thus nothing else really has the impact it should. I never felt any kind of emotional connection at all to these characters until about episode 8, and even then it was more of a ""aw good for them :)"" than any kind of real investment.  This is a huge shame because the show had the potential to do something legitimately interesting, by way of its main superpower girl, Destiny, having effectively possessed the dead body of someone very close to our other main characters. This is a great setup for some emotional conflict, but instead, everyone just seems to be totally okay with this fact, and it gets mostly forgotten about after episode 3.Other characters just sort of come and go, never really developing much past their immediate surface-level traits. Obviously-evil characters are evil, mysterious nice supporting characters are good, and I probably could have predicted the entire plot of this show after watching the first episode. That\'s not to mention the show\'s strange aversion to world building; we only ever get a very vague idea of what Musicarts, Conductors, and D2s are. It definitely feels like the board room meeting was just ""let\'s do Fate but with classical music instead of historical figures, and generic alien things instead of anything interesting"". Also, have to say, I did not understand at all what was supposed to be happening in the last 5 minutes if the last episode. It\'s totally ok to show things in a more artistic way to make it interesting, but don\'t make it confusingly so. I had to go read a summary online to understand what was supposed to have happened.There\'s some good things, of course. I did think our main trio had some nice chemistry, and Anna was a lot of fun to watch (it does give me some hope that she is obviously intended to be a central character moving forward in this franchise). MAPPA does a great job, as they have with most everything over the past few years, and the show looks really nice when it wants to. The character designs, or at least those of the superpower girls (who obviously had a whole lot more work put into them than the others), are vibrant and gorgeous. The music ranges from ""ok-at-best"" to pretty damn good, the opening in particular being great imo. I also thought it was pretty neat that the show was a bit of a road trip set in America, something you don\'t see too often in anime.Overall, it\'s one of the saddest things to me when I finish watching a movie or show and realize that I feel basically nothing about what I\'ve just watched.

Destiny foi uma grata surpresa para mim, pois eu não esperava realmente nenhuma profundidade narrativa vindo de um anime de matar monstros alienígenas gigantes, mas eu realmente gostei de como a obra foi desenvolvida dentro de suas limitações. Eu diria que sim, o saldo é positivo, mas com algumas ressalvas.Não importa qual a origemAntes de nos aprofundar nessa resenha, gostaria de deixar uma coisa clara, NÃO IMPORTA A ORIGEM DE UMA OBRA. Vi muitas análises, onde a maior crítica se baseia no fato do anime ser...baseado em um jogo mobile, um gacha no caso, sabendo disso eu te pergunto: No que isso interfere na qualidade de um anime? Se o anime fosse baseado em uma novel ou um mangá, faria alguma diferença? Eu realmente discordo dessa opinião, assim como um anime baseado em um mangá pode ser bom, um anime baseado em um jogo ou qualquer outra coisa também pode.O incrível mundo da músicaNa minha opinião, o maior ponto positivo dessa obra é a construção e apresentação de seu universo, que ao longo do anime, vai se mostrando ser um mundo muito vasto, com uma lore muito interessante, principalmente quando falamos das Musicarts. Uma das coisas que mais me intriga nesse universo é o que de fato são as Musicarts? pelo que entendi, eles são seres que nascem da música, e utilizaram corpos hospedeiros para que possam cumprir um proposito, que é extinguir os D2s, que são criaturas que assolam esse mundo “pós apocalíptico”, mas existem diversas pontas soltas sobre o que são realmente esses seres, se eles nasceram dos cristais que caíram na terra anos atrás, ou se eles simplesmente são uma energia que se apossam dos corpos dos seres humanos, e perceba como esse mistério é aplicado de maneira sutil, em nenhum momento o autor coloca um diálogo expositivo ou uma cena auto explicativa para mostrar a origem desses seres, pois isso não é de fato relevante para a história principal, e principalmente para o desenvolvimento do arco narrativo do Takt.O autor soube bem aplicar bem uma técnica de roteiro chamada “economia de roteiro”, onde se retira ou minimiza tudo aquilo que não tem o objetivo de desenvolver um personagem ou avançar com a trama principal. Então o autor tomou a decisão certa, pois tudo se trata de “objetivo”, tudo se resume ao qual o objetivo que o autor quer chegar com sua história, e com isso em mente, fica fácil retirar o que não é relevante para a alcançar esse objetivo, e isso é extremamente raro nessa indústria de animes, onde tudo, absolutamente tudo precisa ser extensivamente explicado, e em algumas vezes mostrando em tela no formato de um diálogo expositivo. **coff coff Naturo coff coff**Outro mistério que o autor nos apresenta é como ocorreu realmente o “fim desse mundo”, se foi com a chegada dos cristais, ou com os seres que se originaram dele? Em certo ponto, a forma com qual o autor decidiu nos apresentar a origem dessa história, me lembra muito o que o mestre Miyazaki faz com seus jogos, como Dark Souls por exemplo, nos mostrando como tudo se deu, e o cerne daquele universo, e o restante fica a nosso cargo “investigar”, pensar sobre como se deu tais fatos, e novamente, esse tipo de narrativa é muito incomum nos animes e mangás, e só por isso, o diretor de Takt Op. Destiny já merece nossa atenção.Takt é irritante, e isso é bom!É muito importante saber diferenciar um personagem que não nos agrada, devido a sua personalidade ou por seus atos, de um personagem mal escrito ou mal desenvolvido, e aqui temos um claro exemplo disso. Takt é um personagem irritante, sua personalidade e forma de agir é extremamente negativa, o que me lembra muito um adolescente, que sempre acha que tudo está ruim e nunca está contente com nada, e devo admitir que odeio adolescentes, então é obvio que foi difícil simpatizar com um personagem que pensa e age como um adolescente, mas isso não tira o fato de que Takt é um personagem bem desenvolvido.O arco de personagem de Takt é algo muito bem feito, nos mostrando toda a sua evolução, desde sua infância, sendo obrigado a passar por um trauma bem forte, que o fez se apegar muito a música, pois era a música que o confortava e o consolava pela morte de seu pai, até a sua evolução como um condutor, que são as pessoas que “controlam” uma Musicart para lutar contra os D2s, então aqui temos tudo o que precisamos para entender sua motivações, e isso torna ele um personagem multifacetado, um personagem real, que tem sentimentos, possui objetivos, tristezas, e é isso que torna Takt um bom personagem, não um personagem relacionável, pelo menos para mim, mas o torna um personagem objetivamente bom.Outra personagem que também foi muito bem trabalhada foi a Destiny, pois conseguimos acompanhar toda a sua história, desde seu nascimento como uma Musicart, sendo uma pessoa “fria” e sem sentimentos, para aos poucos aprender como os humanos pensam, como se sentem, até alcançar o ápice do sentimento humano, que é quando descobre que ama o Takt. Acho que o único erro da obra foi o desenvolvimento da relação entre a Destiny e o Takt, mas irei falar melhor sobre isso ao longo dessa resenha. Os demais personagens dessa história são só utilitarista, pois suas ações são motivada somente pelo “bem coletivo”, como é o caso da Anna ou do Lenny, eu não consigo os enxergar como seres humanos, com desejos, anseios, pois todas as ações feitas por eles, visam somente esse objetivo maior, e não desviam em nada desse objetivo, coisa que é naturalmente impossível (ou quase), por isso que até me espantei quando a Anna beija o Takt, pois em nenhum momento esse sentimento se demonstrou minimamente crível no desenvolvimento daquela personagem, então podemos dizer que todos os personagens dessa história não são humanamente críveis, com exceção do Takt e da Destiny, que nem humana é.As falhas do amorA relação entre Takt e Destiny me pareceu muito estranha no geral, pois nunca fica claro o que um realmente sente pelo outro, sabe? Não que o autor precisasse mostrar isso de maneira clara com alguma cena ou algo do tipo, mas nem nas entrelinhas eu consegui perceber os sentimentos de afeto amoroso que um sentia pelo outro, o que torna o final do anime um pouco decepcionante em certo ponto, pois sempre pensei “é claro que no final eles provavelmente vão ficar juntos, vai rolar um beijo ou algo do tipo” e realmente é o que acontece, porém o caminho até chegar a essa cena foi mal escrito realmente, não fica claro e nem subjetivo os sentimentos de Desnity quanto a Takt, até então nos parece apenas uma relação de um condutor com sua Musicart, o que torna tudo ainda mais estranho, pois durante muito tempo, o Takt ainda vê a Destiny como Cosette, e de forma bem repentina ele começa a trata-la como Destiny, mas eu não sei se eu dormi durante algum episódio, pois eu não vi essa trajetória entre o ponto A e o ponto B, então realmente toda essa relação amorosa deles dois não foi muito bem desenvolvida.O subtexto em Takt Op. DestinyFalando brevemente sobre o subtexto dessa obra, a meu ver, ficou relativamente explicito a mensagem que o autor quis passar com o “Macro” de sua história, sobre os malefícios o “bem” subjetivo pode trazer, isso fica claro com o plano do Sagan, onde ele pretendia tentar matar todos os D2s, sacrificando milhares de vidas em troca, até porque, o fim justifica os meios, não? Bom, pelo menos na visão do autor, a reposta é não. É clara a crítica feito aqui a ideologias totalitárias, que visão o bem coletivo de uma maneira relativamente deturpada, o que vai de encontro com o utilitarismo que é pregado pelos personagens secundários dessa obra, afinal de contas, porque a minha visão de “bom” é melhor que a sua? Essa discussão é relativamente interessante, mostrar como uma pessoa, pode cometer atos atrozes em prol do bem comum, mas até que ponto o “bom” pode ser considerado realmente “bom”?Madhouse & MAPPA = casamento perfeitoTecnicamente falando esse anime é muito bom quando precisa ser, todas as cenas de ação (que são relativamente poucas) são muito bem animadas, e não só bem animadas, como também bem dirigidas, toda a condução das cenas de ação do anime, os enquadramentos, as técnicas utilizadas como o câmera shake, tornam essas passagens muito intensas e prazerosas de se ver, ainda mais em conjunto com a trilha sonora desse anime. Incrível, é incrível como eles conseguiram aplicar uma trilha sonora composta basicamente por música clássica casar-se tão bem com a estética da obra, e claro, a trilha sonora faz ai uma brincadeira metalinguística com o enredo da obra, pois a história de vida do Takt é envolto da música clássica, o que torna a trilha sonora dessa obra ainda mais impressionante.E essas passagens de música clássica não fica somente preso as cenas de ação, pois ela também se mostra presente em diálogos mais ocasionais, ou então para nos ajudar o sentir o que o autor que nos passar, como a cena do Takt conversando com o Lenny na varanda. Então essas trilhas compostas por violinos, pianos, violão celo são muito bem-feitas e bem aplicadas nessa obra, o que a faz ganhar alguns pontos comigo.Uma boa obra, envolta de críticas infundadas.Resumindo, Takt Op. Destiny nos apresenta diversas qualidades, como a construção e o desenvolvimento de seus personagens principais, bem como a apresentação da lore do universo, usando a técnica do “find for yourself”, assim deixando vários aspectos em aberto, técnica narrativa essa que é muito bem-vista por mim. Porém a obra peca em outros pontos, como por exemplo o desenvolvimento do principal antagonista do anime, onde apesar de o anime ter apresentado brevemente suas motivações, eu as considerei extremamente mal explicadas e desenvolvidas, o que não me fez simpatizar com o personagem, narrativamente falado claro. Por essa e outras, acredito que sim, essa obra é sim uma boa obra que vale a pena ser vista. Existem diversas críticas que podemos fazer a ela, mas não podemos nos resumir a chamar o anime de “extremamente ruim”, apenas por ser baseado em algo que você não gosta.____________________________________________________________________[English]Takt Op. Destiny was a pleasant surprise for me, as I wasn\'t expecting any narrative depth coming from an anime where the ""main theme"" is killing giant alien monsters, but I really liked the way the anime was developed within its limitations. I would say that yes, the balance is positive, but with some caveats.No matter what the originBefore delving into this review, I would like to make one thing very clear, NO MATTER THE ORIGIN OF A WORK. I saw many reviews, where the biggest criticism is based on the fact that the anime is based on a mobile game, a gacha in this case, knowing that I ask you: How does this interfere with the quality of an anime? If the anime were based on a novel or manga, would it make any difference? I really disagree with this opinion, just like an anime based on a manga can be good, an anime based on a game or anything else can also be good.The Amazing World of MusicIn my opinion, the biggest positive point of this anime is the construction and presentation of its universe, which throughout the anime, is shown as a very vast universe, with a very interesting story, especially when we talk about the Musicarts. One of the things that most intrigues me in this universe is what in fact are the Musicarts? From what I understand, they are beings born of music, and used host bodies to be able to fulfill a purpose, which is to extinguish the D2s, which are creatures that plague this ""post apocalyptic"" world, but there are several loose ends as to what these beings really are, whether they were born from crystals that fell to earth years ago, or if they are simply an energy that takes possession of the bodies of human beings, and notice how this mystery is applied in a subtle way, at no point does the author put an expository dialogue or a self explanatory scene to show the origin of these beings, because this is not really relevant to the main story, and especially to the development of Takt\'s narrative arc. So the author made the right decision, because it all comes down to ""goal"", it all comes down to what goal the author wants to achieve with his story, and with that in mind, it is easy to remove what is not relevant to achieving that goal, and that is extremely rare in this anime and manga industry, where everything, absolutely everything needs to be thoroughly explained, and sometimes shown on screen in the format of expository dialogue. **coff coff Naturo coff coff coff**Another mystery the author presents us with is how did the ""end of this world"" really occur, if it was with the arrival of the crystals, or with the beings that originated from it? At a certain point, the way the author decided to present us with the origin of this story reminds me a lot of what master Miyazaki does with his games, such as Dark Souls, showing us how everything happened, and the core of this universe, and the rest is up to us to ""investigate"", to think about how these facts happened, and once again, this type of narrative is very unusual in anime and manga, and just for this, the director of Takt Op. Fate already deserves our attention.Takt is annoying, and that\'s good!It is very important to know how to distinguish a character that we don\'t like, due to his personality or his actions, from a poorly written or poorly developed character, and here we have a clear example of that. Takt is an irritating character, his personality and way of acting is extremely negative, which reminds me a lot of a teenager, who always thinks everything is bad and is never satisfied with anything, and I must admit I hate teenagers, so it was obviously difficult to sympathize with a character who thinks and acts like a teenager, but this doesn\'t take away from the fact that Takt is a well developed character.Takt\'s character arc is something very well done, showing us all his evolution, from his childhood, being forced to go through a very strong trauma, which made him very attached to music, because it was music that comforted and consoled him for the death of his father, to his evolution as a conductor, which are the people who ""control"" a Musicart to fight the D2s, so here we have everything we need to understand his motivations, and this makes him a multifaceted character, a real character, who has feelings, has goals, sorrows, and this is what makes Takt a good character, not a relateable character, at least for me, but it makes him an objectively good character.Another character that was also very well worked was Destiny, because we were able to follow her whole story, from her birth as a Musicart, being a ""cold"" person with no feelings, to slowly learning how humans think, how they feel, to reaching the apex of human feeling, which is when she discovers that she loves Takt. I think the only mistake was the development of the relationship between Destiny and Takt, but I will talk more about this throughout this review. The other characters in this story are only utilitarian, because their actions are motivated only by the ""collective good"", as is the case of Anna or Lenny, which is of course impossible (or almost), that\'s why I was even amazed when Anna kisses Takt, because in no moment this feeling was shown as minimally believable in the development of that character, we can say that all the characters in this story are not humanly believable, except Takt and Destiny, who is not even human.The Failures of LoveThe relationship between Takt and Destiny seemed very strange to me overall, because it\'s never clear what they really feel for each other, you know? Not that the author needed to show this in a clear way with some scene or something, but even between the lines I couldn\'t make out their feelings of affection for each other, which makes the end of the anime a little disappointing at one point, because I always thought ""of course at the end they will probably be together, there will be a kiss or something"" and it really happens, but the way to get to this scene was poorly written, It\'s not clear or subjective Desnity\'s feelings about Takt, until then it just seems like a relationship of a driver with his Musicart, which makes it even stranger, because for a long time, Takt still sees Destiny as Cosette, and very suddenly starts treating her as Destiny, but I don\'t know if I slept through an episode, because I didn\'t see this trajectory between point A and point B, so really this whole love relationship between the two was not very well developed.The subtext in Takt Op. DestinySpeaking briefly about the subtext of this work, in my view, it was relatively explicit the message that the author wanted to pass with the ""Big Picture"" of his story, about the harm that the subjective ""good"" can bring, this is clear with Sagan\'s plan, where he intended to try to kill all the D2s, sacrificing thousands of lives in return, because the end justifies the means, right? Well, at least in the author\'s view, the answer is no. It is clear the criticism made here to totalitarian ideologies, which view the collective good in a relatively distorted way, which goes against the utilitarianism that is preached by the secondary characters in this work, after all, why is my view of ""good"" better than yours? This discussion is relatively interesting, showing how a person can commit atrocious acts for the common good, but to what extent can ""good"" really be considered ""good""?Madhouse & MAPPA = perfect marriageTechnically speaking, this anime is very good when it needs to be, all the action scenes (which are relatively few) are very well animated, and not only well animated, but also well directed, the whole conduction of the action scenes of the anime, the framing, the techniques used as camera shake, make these passages very intense and enjoyable to watch, even more in conjunction with the soundtrack of this anime. It\'s amazing how they managed to apply a soundtrack composed basically of classical music to marry so well with the aesthetics of the work, and of course, the soundtrack makes a metalinguistic joke with the plot of the work, because Takt\'s life story is wrapped in classical music, which makes the soundtrack of this work even more impressive.And these passages of classical music are not only connected to the action scenes, because it is also present in occasional dialogues, or to help us feel what the author wants us to feel, such as the scene of Takt talking to Lenny on the balcony. So these tracks composed of violins, pianos and acoustic guitar are very well done and well applied in this work, which earns it some points with me.A good anime, shrouded in unfounded criticismIn short, Takt Op. Destiny presents us with several qualities, such as the construction and development of its main characters, as well as the presentation of that universe, using the ""find for yourself"" technique, thus leaving several aspects open, a narrative technique that is very welcome by me. But the work fails on other points, such as the development of the anime\'s main antagonist, where although the anime briefly presented his motivations, I found them extremely poorly explained and developed, which did not make me sympathize with the character, narratively speaking of course. For this and others, I believe that yes, this is a good anime worth watching. There are a lot of criticisms we can make of it, but we can\'t limit ourselves to calling the anime ""extremely bad"" just because it\'s based on something you don\'t like. baseado em um jogo mobile, um gacha no caso, sabendo disso eu te pergunto: No que isso interfere na qualidade de um anime? Se o anime fosse baseado em uma novel ou um mangá, faria alguma diferença? Eu realmente discordo dessa opinião, assim como um anime baseado em um mangá pode ser bom, um anime baseado em um jogo ou qualquer outra coisa também pode.O incrível mundo da músicaNa minha opinião, o maior ponto positivo dessa obra é a construção e apresentação de seu universo, que ao longo do anime, vai se mostrando ser um mundo muito vasto, com uma lore muito interessante, principalmente quando falamos das Musicarts.

Takt is an irritating character, his personality and way of acting is extremely negative, which reminds me a lot of a teenager, who always thinks everything is bad and is never satisfied with anything, and I must admit I hate teenagers, so it was obviously difficult to sympathize with a character who thinks and acts like a teenager, but this doesn\'t take away from the fact that Takt is a well developed character.Takt\'s character arc is something very well done, showing us all his evolution, from his childhood, being forced to go through a very strong trauma, which made him very attached to music, because it was music that comforted and consoled him for the death of his father, to his evolution as a conductor, which are the people who ""control"" a Musicart to fight the D2s, so here we have everything we need to understand his motivations, and this makes him a multifaceted character, a real character, who has feelings, has goals, sorrows, and this is what makes Takt a good character, not a relateable character, at least for me, but it makes him an objectively good character.Another character that was also very well worked was Destiny, because we were able to follow her whole story, from her birth as a Musicart, being a ""cold"" person with no feelings, to slowly learning how humans think, how they feel, to reaching the apex of human feeling, which is when she discovers that she loves Takt. I think the only mistake was the development of the relationship between Destiny and Takt, but I will talk more about this throughout this review. The other characters in this story are only utilitarian, because their actions are motivated only by the ""collective good"", as is the case of Anna or Lenny, which is of course impossible (or almost), that\'s why I was even amazed when Anna kisses Takt, because in no moment this feeling was shown as minimally believable in the development of that character, we can say that all the characters in this story are not humanly believable, except Takt and Destiny, who is not even human.The Failures of LoveThe relationship between Takt and Destiny seemed very strange to me overall, because it\'s never clear what they really feel for each other, you know? Not that the author needed to show this in a clear way with some scene or something, but even between the lines I couldn\'t make out their feelings of affection for each other, which makes the end of the anime a little disappointing at one point, because I always thought ""of course at the end they will probably be together, there will be a kiss or something"" and it really happens, but the way to get to this scene was poorly written, It\'s not clear or subjective Desnity\'s feelings about Takt, until then it just seems like a relationship of a driver with his Musicart, which makes it even stranger, because for a long time, Takt still sees Destiny as Cosette, and very suddenly starts treating her as Destiny, but I don\'t know if I slept through an episode, because I didn\'t see this trajectory between point A and point B, so really this whole love relationship between the two was not very well developed.The subtext in Takt Op. DestinySpeaking briefly about the subtext of this work, in my view, it was relatively explicit the message that the author wanted to pass with the ""Big Picture"" of his story, about the harm that the subjective ""good"" can bring, this is clear with Sagan\'s plan, where he intended to try to kill all the D2s, sacrificing thousands of lives in return, because the end justifies the means, right? Well, at least in the author\'s view, the answer is no. It is clear the criticism made here to totalitarian ideologies, which view the collective good in a relatively distorted way, which goes against the utilitarianism that is preached by the secondary characters in this work, after all, why is my view of ""good"" better than yours? This discussion is relatively interesting, showing how a person can commit atrocious acts for the common good, but to what extent can ""good"" really be considered ""good""?Madhouse & MAPPA = perfect marriageTechnically speaking, this anime is very good when it needs to be, all the action scenes (which are relatively few) are very well animated, and not only well animated, but also well directed, the whole conduction of the action scenes of the anime, the framing, the techniques used as camera shake, make these passages very intense and enjoyable to watch, even more in conjunction with the soundtrack of this anime. It\'s amazing how they managed to apply a soundtrack composed basically of classical music to marry so well with the aesthetics of the work, and of course, the soundtrack makes a metalinguistic joke with the plot of the work, because Takt\'s life story is wrapped in classical music, which makes the soundtrack of this work even more impressive.And these passages of classical music are not only connected to the action scenes, because it is also present in occasional dialogues, or to help us feel what the author wants us to feel, such as the scene of Takt talking to Lenny on the balcony. So these tracks composed of violins, pianos and acoustic guitar are very well done and well applied in this work, which earns it some points with me.A good anime, shrouded in unfounded criticismIn short, Takt Op. Destiny presents us with several qualities, such as the construction and development of its main characters, as well as the presentation of that universe, using the ""find for yourself"" technique, thus leaving several aspects open, a narrative technique that is very welcome by me. But the work fails on other points, such as the development of the anime\'s main antagonist, where although the anime briefly presented his motivations, I found them extremely poorly explained and developed, which did not make me sympathize with the character, narratively speaking of course. For this and others, I believe that yes, this is a good anime worth watching. There are a lot of criticisms we can make of it, but we can\'t limit ourselves to calling the anime ""extremely bad"" just because it\'s based on something you don\'t like.', 'This show just went nowhere. Entire premise is an odd and interesting one. Not sure we\'ve had something like this before and I quite liked the idea of this weird post-apocalyptic world without music where musicians are sort of soldiers.Then nothing happens for 12 episodes. We have male main character which doesn\'t develop one bit from episode one. Then we have female protagonist who keeps claiming she\'s the best only to get smacked in the face very next shot. Some additional characters are introduced and nothing happens with them either. And that\'s about it. Animation is good, sound design is good which is quite a...strange contrast to pile of dog shit that is story and character development.Show is so bleak and uneventful I keep forgetting am watching it. Only when it pops up in feed I go ""oooh right, I am watching this thing"".Should you watch it? I don\'t know. It\'s animated by Madhouse which means art is good and they don\'t like taking shortcuts when it comes to that. Sound is good as well. But story is entirely forgettable. strange contrast to pile of dog shit that is story and character development.Show is so bleak and uneventful I keep forgetting am watching it.

But story is entirely forgettable.', 'For those who saw all the episodes one after the other, noticed the difference in animation quality + story in the transition period from episode three to four.The first three episodes saved the desire to watch until the end, but the fourth is a beautiful disaster, 25 minutes of cliché and nothing interesting.With that in mind, I have an opinion that Mappa is the most dogshit animation company in terms of stability, the animation difference is extreme, from one episode to another the art decays ridiculously. Not counting the story that affected a lot, the fourth episode is the total opposite of the first...three. three.', ""Looked great. Sounded great. Interesting setting. Road trip through America? Yes, please. But the soul of it was not quite there. It aimed to be serious and dramatic but couldn't quite reach it. Oh yeah, and this was supposed to be a prequel for a mobile game.Story 6/10All the ingredients were here for a really good tale.There was a good setting: You got the overarching theme of classical music. They had to do a road trip through anime America. The team was composed of a pair of lovers and the girl's older sister.There was an alien invasion that was mitigated but resurged....Our heroes had to investigate and deal with it.It didn't come together though. The aliens never seemed to be that big of a menace. They just randomly popped up to provide some excitement.I really liked the road trip aspect of the story. They went from setting to gorgeous setting, met some people, fought some monsters, and moved on. Good stuff and fitting for an episodic show. We got a sprinkle of the main bad guys halfway through. Interesting stuff.Once they got to New York and met up with the Symphonica organization, there was some tomfoolery. Decent fare.But somehow, all of it didn't add together to create something better than it's parts. The characters didn't grow. The situation was revealed a little bit but wasn't developed. Maybe they were saving the story for season 2. I don't know. But the story felt like events were just bolted together. They were decent events to tell a story about but never had a cumulative, cohesive effect.It felt like the characters stepped on their marks, read their lines, did their thing, and moved on to the next scene.Characters 4/10The main man was not interesting. He was just kind of there. He seems like a bunch of traits. He didn't have a personality. He liked music. His girlfriend died when he was playing the piano with her so he got scarred. He was mostly quiet and just does what needs to be done. He had a disease. Boring guy.Cosette was cute. I liked her in her street clothes - the dress with the hairband looked good. Her Musicart form was stunning. Character and personality wise, she was sparse. She was mostly cluelessly innocent, loyal to a fault, self-sacrificing, and totally obedient. And she likes snacks. Is that even a character trait? She was a cute shell of a character.I guess it may not be completely fair to her to describe her that way. SPOILERS -- She was a human form before the meteor strike turned her into a Musicart. It was an early episode and I don't remember too much of it, but I remember her being a bit of a standard sweet girl who loved music and was in love with the MC.Then there was Anne, Cosette's older sister. Another very cute character. I loved her character design. She had the long pony-tail, the choker, the jacket, the tube top, and the flares (nice throwback to the 90s). Personality-wise, I guess she was the responsible one of the group, the mother figure. She drove like a maniac. She was always good for a quip here and there. Basically Misato.The supporting characters are there too. There was the other conductor who was buff and fruity and his rainbow Musicart. They were older good guys who understood the situation and did their best to support the MCs.The bad guys were bad guys. Again, interesting character designs but not much else going on. They did make an interesting appearance somewhat early on in the show. I like it when they show off the bad guys and allow their force to be felt along the way.On the whole, I'd say that the character designs were the best part of the characters. Personality traits and dialog were weak.Art 10/10The art was absolutely beautiful. The characters, the setting, the backgrounds, and the landscapes. Wow. Everything looked splendid. There were frames from each episode that you could blow up into a poster.The ED art was top of the mountain stuff. Absolutely gorgeous. I liked the song, the story, and the storybook painting style.The fights were well-animated. Direction-wise, the fights were not as compelling as they could be. I mean, the girls shoot gun and do sword fighting. I was hoping that they'd be able to weave the classical music angle in some way. The conductors somewhat directed their Musicarts, but not really.While I'm on the subject, I'll say that the entire Musicart-Maestro relation felt very artificial. It was just an excuse to play up the relation of the characters. Not quite as eggregious as the doggy-style pilot position in Darling in the Franxx, but still pretty hokey. The story would have been the same without the relation. Even without the conductors, the Musicart girls kicked ass. They were doing all of the work! I really didn't see what the conductors did to help the girls fight.Sound 7/10Music is a central theme in the story so I was hoping that the music would be good. And it is. Symphonic music for the BGM. It sounded high quality. I didn't like the OP. It was a slow, non-rhythmic, and sounded wonky. I found out that it was sung by someone famous, so I guess there's that. The ED was a ballad sung by some chick. I liked the ED because of the art.It sounded pretty good overall.Enjoyment 5/10I'm not even sure why exactly, by I wasn't feeling this one. I wasn't engrossed in the story. The plot points seemed good enough but didn't grab me and hold me.The art was amazing. I found myself getting through the entire season to see what part of the USA they'd animate into something amazing. I wasn't let down. It's an understatement to say that show is visually stunning.There is the waifu factor. I'm all about pretty anime girls doing their thing. And this show delivers. But it felt forced as hell. It was partly because the maestro-Musicart connection. It was partly because the getups had nothing to do with anything. The costumes were just shoehorned in.I'm guessing my gripes mostly result from this anime being created to support the mobile game. Regardless, I can't say that I had a good time watching this all the way through.Overall 5/10The production quality was there. The animation was flex-level. The music wasn't my thing but I have to admit it was high quality. But the plot, the story, the way characters played out weren't there for me. This was eye candy.

The music side doesn\'t really intertwine with any other aspect of the show. Like, the monsters get attracted to music. Okay, then why the only things that can kill them do that with magic shotguns, swords, etc.? The OST is also pretty unremarkable for a music-themed anime. The romance could\'ve been better, even considering that this is not a romance anime.They also somehow managed to make a filler in a 12 episode series. The show wasted too much of it\'s own time. ', 'I was going to give this up after two episodes, but Gigguk raving about the fight scenes made me start over. And the fights in episode 1 are indeed spectacular. The trouble is, the fights occur less and less. Much of what was set up in episode 1 isn\'t held together, even though 2-4 are flashbacks (leading, I\'m guessing, to episode 5).There is clearly some weird stuff going on beyond a new form of ""bad things from space that can only be defeated by human girls powered by good things from space"". It\'s tough to come up with a decent variation on this scene (cf,...the horrific ""Listeners"").And watching Takt, I once again wish characters in anime had access to mental health care. His childhood trauma makes him narcissistic, which is pretty unpleasant to watch. I don\'t think that\'s what they were aiming at. I get tired of characters written with no nuance, no depth, nothing but one or two over-the-top traits that are used to flog the viewers pointlessly.I\'m hoping the beauty of episode one is recaptured, and dreading that that one episode got 80% of the show\'s budget. the horrific ""Listeners"").And watching Takt, I once again wish characters in anime had access to mental health care.

So let\'s start! :)Minus Point : StoryI do think that this show starts with a promising start,it feels like this show is gonna has second season seeing the pacing of the story from the first few episodes feels slow, But! I enjoyed it a lot! there is so much thing to discover that I honestly can\'t wait to be explained, I mean, this type of anime really stands out you know, I mean like It is using...its original formula for storytelling instead of using the common trouopes (eg. Isekai, Hero\'s Journey, etc), So I do really excited at first waiting in this rare and unknown storytelling!But !Suddenly the story escalates really fast when they arrived in New York (small spoiler here sorry!)

I like the character designs especially Corsette but I don't like the design of the villain monsters; those ape-thing creatures. this anime is pretty disappointing I was expecting something more. i thought it would revolve around music like it could be a theatrical type because music is one of its genre.p.s. this is my...first anime review. first anime review."", 'Let`s start by saying that if you want some good action and really good soundtrack, then this show is for you. If you also want a good, well paced story and interesting characters, then you will be disappointed as most of the people were.I`ll talk without spoilers. It`s really beautiful anime... sometimes. Not every episode was animated godly. One or two episodes looked straight up ugly. But fights that were good were really good. The other problem the anime had was pacing. It started of good and then it was really slow for few episodes without contributing anything to the story even tho most...of the things were still unanswered, and unfortunately, they remained unanswered. Then they just rushed the last few episodes and it really shows because things went from 0 to 100. The other strong point of the show other then animation and fights is music. Soundtrack is really good but that`s as far as it goes. It`s never explained why is music so important except that it gives people hope. Like how are musicarts born from music or how are their powers connected to music since they just swing their swords and shoot guns. What powers do conductors have? Or why do D2`s hate music so much. Anime just ends without giving any explanation to any of that. Music is just their so fights would have good music following them and because MC likes music. Characters and loveable but nothing more. They have some personality but it`s all one dimensional and character development is really minor and kind of forced. Villains are just bad.

As a classical musician I thought the show was… interesting. Don’t get me wrong, a story about angelic beings called musicarts who literally represent some of the greatest symphonic works ever composed controlled by conductors battling aliens called D2’s who literally hate music for some reason is very cool in an anime kind of way, especially thanks to the joint effort of Madhouse and Mappa bringing it too life, but it doesn’t have quite enough substance to back up all of it’s style and push it into 8 or 9/10 territory.Let’s start with the positives. Like...I said Madhouse and Mappa made this so the animation is sakuga smothered, sensory overload nearly all the time and it’s absolutely glorious. Like a sweeping orchestral suite the combat is sharp, crisp and dynamic as it sings off the screen into your ears and eye holes. Music is used sparingly to empathise a world without and is only used to punctuate combat, an emotional scene or when an instrument is being played.The core cast of three are likeable too. Takt is an aloof. piano prodigy who only thinks about playing music whilst his musicart Destiny is an emotionless, snarky D2 killing machine who only thinks about killing D2’s and eating cake. The two get on each others nerves even though they must work together to get to New York safely, but luckily Anna is there to drive them across America and to be constantly exasperated by them all the time. The three of them together give a sort of band on tour with their manager vibe and I really enjoyed it.The supporting cast were… fine. Titan was my favourite cinnamon roll with a shot gun, but her conductor Lenny is unfortunately another flamboyant, aggressive gay stereotype who comes off more as a creep than endearing. The antagonists are also not very well fleshed out or interesting. The main two Symphonica soldiers they meet and fight have very cliche motivations which sort of ruin the story a bit towards the end and Hell the musicart fights whilst laughing and screaming which gets annoying very quickly. I also personally think the whole conductor controlling the musicarts actions with a conductors baton looks silly in practice and sort treats the musicarts (who are all women by the way) like Pokémon. It just doesn’t really work.As a high concept apocalypse story it’s not great. A lot of the major plot points are not expanded on and unless theres a plan to continue with another season a lot of the world building as well as character plot lines are just left unanswered. However, viewing Takt Op. Destiny as a weird, slice of life, road trip sitcom set in the apocalypse about two individuals who have lost their ability to empathise and feel emotions learning to become more human again with lot’s action on the side makes it a much better show in my opinion. This show could’ve easily been a quick cash grab to promote the mobile game, but I’m glad it came out as good as it did warts and all. Also the sound track slaps.7/10 Good.

A lot of the major plot points are not expanded on and unless theres a plan to continue with another season a lot of the world building as well as character plot lines are just left unanswered. However, viewing Takt Op. Destiny as a weird, slice of life, road trip sitcom set in the apocalypse about two individuals who have lost their ability to empathise and feel emotions learning to become more human again with lot’s action on the side makes it a much better show in my opinion. This show could’ve easily been a quick cash grab to promote the mobile game, but I’m glad it came out as good as it did warts and all. Also the sound track slaps.7/10 Good.', 'Takt op. Destiny seemed like a masterpiece both for how well structured the characters are and for the simple but functional animation it has. The story was not very good but it was also very functional and that a great anime is created from that simple story that makes me have a lot of hype for the 2nd season. The characters are very interesting and with an incredible story like that of Kouki Uchiyama (Takt Asahina) which makes you feel a great feeling with the character. (Sypnosis): Takt Op Destiny takes place in the year 2047, a future world where music cannot be freely played...because it attracts monsters called ""D2"". These monsters were produced by a black meteorite containing Black Night Siderite that fell from the sky years ago. They hate music produced by humans and are drawn to the music source and try to destroy it. To combat the D2, ""Musicarts"", girls drawn from classical music sheets and deriving their power from ""Harmonia Ore"", are led by human ""Conductors"" to fight the monsters. because it attracts monsters called ""D2"".

Some may not like it, some may.The music, the animation, the story (the story is fair), etc... its all good.If this anime is only a 12 episode I really hope there is a 2nd season.Althought its very unlikely because iirc its supposed to be a promotional anime for thetakt op game?...my anime list is telling me to write longer so here i go!idk what to write but i hope this is longer my anime list is telling me to write longer so here i go!idk what to write but i hope this is longer"", 'This anime is vastly overrated.

Good anime, not great.Yet, if you are a music lover, You will like this anime. I dont like music anime, so just finishing the anime is kind of...a chore to me. You might fare better.

But things were too rushed as the studios wanted to cover things only in 12 eps. Thats not how short 12 ep anime's work. I really didn't get many facts of it's plot. A lot of its plot is still unclear. It's just a good looking but disappointing anime. I just couldn't fully enjoy this.At the end I wouldn't recommend this...to any one, cz its plot too much rushed.

However I'm giving it 7/10 only because the Animation was Lit and Anna is the best girl.I'm new at writing reviews. Plz pardon any mistakes."", 'The best way I can describe Takt Op Destiny is by comparing it to a musical performance. A musical performance in which the performers are using almost every instrument that they can find, and playing them with any symphonia or rhyme. Every instrument plays a portion of a note and stops, then the next takes over and does the same. Sometimes they play solo and sometimes in duo or trio or even above. And all of them are playing the most basic notes without any variation in them. In this way, you are unable to enjoy any of the notes and all of them feel...incomplete and unimpactful. As a result, the entire performance feels like a rushed, unmanaged mess. That`s what I feel about the anime. It feels like a collection of plotlines and story points that are playing one after another. Many don`t go anywhere and are left unresolved or answered (like Takt`s song and Cosette`s ultimate faith), while many feel under utilized or never explored enough or in the right way to leave an impact (like D2`s origin, and Sagan`s plan and ultimate faith. The pacing and order is very bad, especially in the first few episodes. The script is over stuffed with story points and ideas of other stories. The whole anime feels like a rushed, unmanaged mess, and it makes it very hard to enjoy or like it.All of this would be enough to label it as a colossal failure. However, that`s not it. Coming back to the performance: Even though the performance feels like a mess, you can`t but help like part of it. Because there are few instruments that you like or appreciate and enjoy listening to. And also, because so many of them are playing in quick succession, you rarely feel bored. On top of that, while the performance may not sound or feel good, it defiantly does look good. The lighting on the stage, the multiple color, the performers and their dresses, all look stunning. This makes the performance more appealing and enjoyable. And that`s also what I feel about the anime. There are so many story points that you end up liking a few. And because most of the fight and exposition happens in quick rapid succession, it keeps you entertained for the most part. It`s animation style and aesthetic are visually striking. It`s character design, abilities and world setting are also very interesting. And while most of the story doesn`t work, some actually feel complete and go some where, like Lenny`s story and Saga`s flashback during the first D2 invasion. And while the side characters aren`t very interesting, they are still feel appealing and don`t feel annoying. This make the anime more appealing and enjoyable.However with all said and done, the anime has so much flaws and issues that it`s a miracle that I ended up liking anything. Everything in it feels bland, rushed and incomplete, especially the story. There is so little world building and the story barely explores the many plot points. Things like the origins of D2 and music-arts are barley explored. The anime also never resolves plot points like what happened to Takt`s song or what or how the hell happened at the end with Takt, Cosette and Anna at the end. The most awkwardly done part was the message or the struggle of the anime. The aim or Takt and father was reintroduce music in the world, so that the world can feel happiness and hope again. However, instead of making that their main drive to fight and eliminate the D2, Takt and father thought the best approach would be to hold a stage performance out in the open, when D2 warnings are in the air. I really find it hilarious that they think witnessing a stage slaughter after a performance will give hope to the people. And it`s never made clear why does it really attract D2. Or why do they attack and kill everything else along with the source of the music. Or why haven`t the instruments been destroyed all together, and instead are placed for display.Anyway, those are my thoughts about Takt op Destiny. I enjoyed some of it`s part, but it`s a real mess.

Our main protagonist, Takt Asahina, might seem irritating what with his obsession with music but he at the very least does grow during the course of the series. Same goes for the other main characters in the show. If you want to see a truly horrible character, go watch Rent A Girlfriend.

It has a standard dystopian plot with cute girls that can fight and a side of character development, which is kinda rare these days. If you like the sound of that, you might like Takt Op. Destiny. If nothing else, I really enjoyed watching it.By reading the MAL reviews, you would think that this is the most bait-y fanservice-driven show to come out this season. It's honestly far from it.It has a few cute girls that are appropriately dressed and little, if any, time...is given to fanservice. There is no romance, no harem, no nothing. It's just a bunch of teens/young adults trying to travel to New York and fighting some monster things that show up here and there.Going into Takt. Op Destiny, I knew nothing about the show. Didn't have a single clue about the studios working on it, plot, or anything of that nature. I knew it was a music anime and I started with that.The story is somewhat basic and predictable, but not in a way that left me mind-numbing staring at the screen with my brain turned off. The art was engaging and I really liked the character designs for all characters, including the background characters which I thought was nice. At times, the art could be blatantly CGI, which I don't mind, but it was certainly more noticeable at times.For a music-action anime, the music was rarely at the forefront of battle. However, if you're a classical music enjoyer, you might be pleasantly surprised by the music at times. That being said, Takt Op. Destiny's music was nothing to write home about.For me, the most enjoyable part of this show was seeing how the characters grew within the 8 episodes I watched. As of right now, Takt Op.

Takt op Destiny was a double edge sword as it can be either liked or hated depending on its content. Aside from the questionable story choices, the collaboration between Mappa and Madhouse was a feast for the eyes. For an anime original, this anime has difficulties for others to watch. I enjoyed it, even though the anime's flaws are too noticeable at certain times.The plot and its events were a mix in between intriguing and generic at times. I loved the concept of...a music-based action anime and found it unique, especially how the Musicarts are after famous pieces. The world-building in this anime wasn't my favorite. Even though it took place in America, I didn't find it interesting as I am an American, so I already know what those areas would be like when they get revealed. The goal of reaching New York while fighting D2s was generic that it gets repetitive over time, but the anime was able to make the fight scenes look incredible. Even though I liked the battles, the other events, such as villain reveals and their motives in the past are pretty bad. The writing for those reveals could've been better, but I wish the villains weren't too generic as it was too obvious from their status. Many plotholes were left untouched, but I believe that the game will explain them more thoroughly.Despite enjoying the story of Takt op Destiny, it is the weakest part of the entire series if not understood properly. The plot of Takt op Destiny focuses on the main protagonist, along with his Musicart and childhood friend reaching New York while hoping to bring back music. And to accomplish that goal, he must defeat the D2s in the process. At the beginning of the series, many tragedies occurred around the protagonist's life, and it was the cause of his journey. Towards the end, it's a final battle set up for the game with some high-quality animation, lots of character development, and death flags. The story started strong, but its quality decreased as each episode was released. While I found the story to be action-packed and emotion-driven, I enjoyed all the music-related substance to be enjoyable and its ending to a great prologue to the story to come in the Takt op game.The characters are a hit or miss, but I found their interaction with each other good. The designs for them look amazing, especially the Musicarts. The central trio of Takt, Destiny, and Anna was fun to watch, plus their appearances are well-detailed. At this point, the character designs by Mappa are starting to become more notable to me, but I don't have a problem with it. As for the other characters, such as Lenny and Titan, both of them were the best designs in the entire series, plus their personalities made them an instant fan-favorite to me. In terms of the villains, their outfits look cool, but their motives for being evil didn't agree with my standards. The only negative aspect of the character interactions is the confusion related to relationships. Even though Anna is a good character, her kissing Takt made no sense as there was no romance in their relationship one bit. The character development for Destiny was the best part of her partnership with Takt as she became more human emotionally while maintaining her kuudere character trait. Overall, the design is incredible, but the interaction is debatable based on specific characters.The animation was the carrying force that kept the hype for Takt op Destiny alive. Because Mappa and Madhouse collaborated, the fight scenes were smooth and straight to the point. Its visuals for the energy attacks were breathtaking and show how supernatural Musicarts are in the anime. At times, some of the non-action parts were stiff, such as Takt's piano playing. But it might have been complex to animate that, but the CGI for Takt playing the piano was implemented neatly. Overall, the visuals and animation in the action scenes are the best part of the anime, and it made up for the decent story we received. Here's hoping that Mappa will continue to animate future anime like that and for Madhouse to stay in that level of animation quality.The music is a crucial part of the series. Along with the many references to famous pieces, such as Beethoven's music, the soundtrack for the anime was phenomenal. The sound design is incredible, and the concept of music itself was another carrying factor of the anime. The opening is peak fiction, starting quiet, then transitioning to an exciting tone. That part of the opening is the best and is my favorite part of that song. The ending was more peaceful than the opening, but the transition from Cosette to Destiny is intriguing symbolism for acceptance, which matches the song's vibe. As someone who loved music anime such as Vivy, the soundtrack is already a masterpiece, as those songs were created by famous composers from the early decades.Overall, Takt op Destiny had its issues, but in my opinion, I enjoyed this anime so much. The animation and soundtrack are spectacular, but the only thing that could've been better is the story. Many questions remain, but I look forward to those plotholes getting explained in the game. Even though this anime is hated by many fans, it can be considered the prologue for the game adaptation released in the future.

It\'s a relatively chill anime, though all the talking and exploring they do serves an over-arching character development. I never felt like my time was being wasted. The action is pretty well animated for what it\'s worth.I do feel, however that the character development is missing some ""rawness"". I miss more contextualization. The plot in general could have been fleshed out better. With that said, I\'m not bothered by certain things not being explained, like what D2s are exactly or where they come from or what exactly happened during the ending. Conveying mood...and the character\'s journey being shown can be more important than the plot being logically coherent.In terms of criticism I think the start of the anime could have dropped the in medias res structure, as I found it didn\'t really add anything ultimately.

Destiny, I wouldn't go as far as to call it a bad anime because it's pretty decent but it could have been better. More effort could have been put into character development and even though things lined up throughout the anime I feel like there wasn't really any significance besides what is shown on screen. What I mean by that is that it gives a clear idea of...what is happening but other than that it doesn't have any important or small details hidden for people to find.So besides the bad things, mainly the best part of the anime is how it looks or the music. The visuals are really good and flashy so that makes it enjoyable to watch but it is not always flashy. The music isn't bad but mainly the best music is the opening.So if you are considering going in and watching this anime then I would still recommend watching it but please don't put too much hope into it as the story isn't as well done as you may expect when going into it.Hopefully this review was helpful what is happening but other than that it doesn't have any important or small details hidden for people to find.So besides the bad things, mainly the best part of the anime is how it looks or the music.

I fell in love with the Mc and that was the only reason i could continue to watch it. The art in this anime is amazing i didint expect anything less from MAPPA and madhouse. But the story was full of plot holes and simply bad writing. This anime was basically promo for the mobile game with the same premise i like to believe they wrote the best story they could with limited material. The music in this anime was ok they over used well know classical music for...fights. I wished there was more music made for the show but there wasn’t. The ending was lackluster and simply confusing. Nothing was resolved except the “main villain” situation. If a second season came out i still would watch it because i would like to see where the attempt at a “cliffhanger” would end. fights.

I give 2 decent points for the wonderful animation by MAPPA and Madhouse, the only saving grace of this series. I'll start with my conclusion of this series for the entire part of this review is just about me saying how bad it is: Takt op. Destiny was as bad as Shion's cooking before she gained the master chef skill. It was inedible.Of course, having MAPPA and Madhouse for the animation was incredible and the only good thing, unfortunately, of this series....Everything else was half-baked. I had quite an expectation upon deciding to watch this anime but I was foolish to expect anything from it.  It felt like I just stepped on a dog's dung after the last episode expecting that it was clean concrete. It wasn't a story instead it was a plot trying so hard to be good but every concept and idea poured into it were burnt eggs on a dry and black pan. It was inedible and destined to be thrown into the trash bin. I sometimes think that maybe not all anime (no matter the time, money, and effort given to it) are worth the time and effort to be watched at all which leads them to be useless hard work and money. What a waste of energy and space in the World Wide Web. Why do humans spend so much on such commodity that chooses to be rubbish through and through?If it was meant to be a promotion for the game, why don't they act like it is? Or maybe just like the series it is rubbish? That is so far what I can see from this. Everything else was half-baked.

It's obvious that the director assumed people don't care about quality here or are simply not experienced enough to see what's going on. Because it is an anime that takes popular concepts from other anime and just throws them together, adds some pretty animation and emotional elements and thinks it will sell a mobile gatcha game. It gives it a stunningly obvious fake AF feel, even if the concept is original... like How.The opening...and ending songs are good and the fighting scenes are fun to watch. Also the girls (musicarts) are well made (combined with some good VA), but man the main character... I don't remember when I've last seen such a dreadful character.

The animation was fantastic, as were the characters, choice of classical music, etc. And it was really cool to see the transition from a more action-focused episode (ep 1) to a more calmed-down music & character focused episode (ep 2). After that, it dropped heavily.-----The calmer & artsy side of the show remained decent, but it quickly became repetitive. It re-used the same two classical pieces repeatedly to set the mood. The choice of Beethoven\'s 5th as well as his Pathetique sonata in the first episode were awesome.But then they literally use those same...two pieces like 10 or more times throughout the future episodes. It came off as pretty lazy, given that there are like a million classical pieces to choose from. And I was honestly dissapointed, because I was looking forward to the show whipping out new classical pieces to set the tone. But nope, let\'s just do Adagio Cantabile for the 10th time to make this scene sad.-----As for the other side of the show -- the action & story focused side -- that just straight up dropped hard, and it pulled down the quality of the rest of the show. The plot from episodes 3-6 were just boring. And for 6 onwards it was just awful. I won\'t spoil anything, but the antagonist for this season was one of the worst I\'ve ever scene, as others have commented. The writing for that storyline felt amateurish and forced.Also, characters\' personalities in this ""mode"" of the show also are really inconsistent with how they are in the calmer side of the show. Takt goes from being sullen & music-obsessed, to then being: energetic, motivated, and ready for action. It literally feels like two different characters.Oh, and the animation drops hard too in my opinion. Like in later episodes it\'s a bit jarring to see people using shotguns while having no recoil or visible/satisfying impact.---Anyways, this show really disappointed me. And it honestly feels like the first two episodes were just a trap for them to introduce future gacha characters (""musicarts"") in the later episodes.

In this review, we review the anime and anime only; and we\'ll disregard any relations this show might have with any other works.As I\'m unsure whether to mark this review as spoiler free or not, please consider this review as one having LIGHT SPOILERS.Moreover, keep in mind that this review interprets both the plot and characters as specific symbols / ideas. It is highly possible that the authors did not intend to leave this impression in the slightest, but at the...very least, it might offer you a different perspective on the show.Without further ado, let\'s take it piece by piece and talk about all that Takt Op. Destiny is.1. Story: 6/10The plot of Takt Op. Destiny might as well be the worst aspect of this show. A more accurate choice of words would be ""the one aspect that\'s not as well polished as the others"". The overall idea of the story is rather simplist. The show features a softer post apocalyptic world, one which has been plagued by creatures known as D2 - an aggressive species which has one particular trait - intense hatred for music. For this reason, the act of playing melodies has been banned and the only way humans can defend themselves against this threat is through the powers of the Musicarts, which are women born out of music itself, as well as Conductors, the only ones who can control their power. As you might have guessed, our main characters, Takt and Destiny are also a Conductor and a Musicart respectively, and the story follows their journey across the country, on their trip to New York, where they hope to reach the Symphonica\'s Headquarters, in an attempt to fix the problems that Destiny presents whenever her powers are needed.Although the setting insists on the music theme, ""music"" in this story can represent a lot of things. For Takt, it represents his one and only passion, for the everyday people, it can represent hope. For older people, it might be a nostalgic reminiscences of better times, and for others it might as well as a simple pleasure which they long to indulged in. For these reasons, I believe music in Takt Op. Destiny is a motif that encompasses all those listed above. Why music? Because unlike painting, sculpting or other forms of art, music is something that each and every one of us enjoys, and we can all agree that a world without music would be boring and soulless.2. Art: 10/10I can only describe the art of Takt Op. Destiny as ""music to my eyes"". With bright, vibrant colours, fluent animation and a flashy art style that pays greater attention to all the little details, the show has a rich enough production value to stand firmly beside major titles such as Demon Slayer or Fate.3. Sound: 10/10As a piano enthusiast, the music of Takt Op. Destiny managed to hit just the right chord. The show features a rather diverse repertoire of music genre, raging from classic music, with masterpieces such as Moonlight Sonata in the very start, to popular jazz songs such as Georgia On My Mind from Ray Charles. Trying to identify each song played throughout the show is definitely an experience that I find fun and entertaining. Moreover, one key aspect of the show\'s sound is how natural each song sounds. Instead of feeling like a synth, every piece sounds authentic, and has plenty of details to further enrich this feeling, such as the sound of Takt\'s foot pressing on the piano\'s pedal. The anime also features a rich set of clear and pleasant sound effect. There\'s something about the twinkly sound of Takt\'s arm exploding that simply feels so harmonic and satisfying.4. Characters: 10/10The characters aspect is what this makes this show really shine.A. Takt - cold and distracted, the guy who prioritizes music over everything. It only took a few episodes to realize that Takt is a way more relatable character than what I initially thought. For example, being rather lazy and uninterested at times, or impatient when it comes to our goals and desires is a situation that we might often find ourselves into. After all, who wouldn\'t want to take more than a few days off and do absolutely nothing aside from the things they actually love? I find Takt to be a symbol for the everyday person that each one of us is, a representation for the passionate person that wishes to find fulfillment in the little ( or grand, like a piano ^_^ ) things that he enjoys, and this comparison becomes more visible after analyzing this relation with Destiny.B. Destiny - which appears to have a rather blank personality at first, but turns out to be a blank canvas, waiting to be painted. Although Takt often complains about her usefulness, he cannot deny his utmost care when it comes to her wellbeing. In the same way, Destiny is a symbol that represents the physical manifestation of our passions. An empty piece of paper that is longing to have a great story written on it. While there are times when we might feel like slacking off for a while, when those long hours of practice might feel like too much, or when we\'d rather take a day off and do nothing, being able to see the results of all that hard work will always bring about a satisfied smile, no matter how tiering the whole process was up until that point. After all, Op. or Opus in music, represents a work number assigned for a composition. So what could be more obvious than the show\'s own title - Takt op. - Destiny.C. Ana - although a support character, i believe she deserves a very special mention, not only due to her proeminent presence throughout the whole show, but for the role she plays in the whole interpretation as well. After all, Ana is the character which will often scold Takt for being so carefree, but nonetheless appear caring and supportive towards Destiny - Takt\'s music incarnate. In this whole idea\'s perspective, Ana represents the people around us, be it our friends or parents, that support us through little gestures. While she is the big sister than complains she can\'t sleep due to Takt\'s late night playing, she might as well be your little brother that, although he does not care about what you\'re about to show him, he\'ll watch and listen nonetheless - all these are little motivation boosts to keep us going.There are, obviously, more characters to talk about here, but we won\'t go into greater details in order to not spoil much of the show.5. Enjoyment: 10/10All in all, I\'d say Takt Op. Destiny is a truly enjoyable anime for multiple reasons, be it the art, the sound aspect of it, or the simply watching the characters grow and develop on their journey.6. Overall: 9/10While Takt Op. Destiny is a truly remarkable anime, the simplicity of the plot points prevented me from rating this a 10.At the end of the day, for me, this show represents yet another welcomed source of motivation for learning not to compromise when it comes to the things we truly love to do. very least, it might offer you a different perspective on the show.Without further ado, let\'s take it piece by piece and talk about all that Takt Op.

At the beginning of this season that this show was looking good, but that being about it. And I feel confirmed.This show does one mistake from the get-go. In fact the entire first episode is a mistake. For some, definitely not financial reason, they decided to make the first ep pretty much a promo for what is to come. It is ok wanting to present action in the first episode, as a lot of shonen jump series do this too, in order to get good ratings for the first...chapter. However it becomes problematic when that first episode is not ever referenced again and at the same time spoils the second episode, which is btw the only interesting plotpoint in this series. Anyways, off we go:Story:There isn't really much to say here. It is a surprisingly boring story with not much driving force. Now this could work with the right characters, but we'll come to that. It is relatively slow paced, but feels slightly accelerated towards the end with some questionable plotpoints to spice it up, but pacing is not the big problem anyways.Art:Well this is MAPPA X MADHOUSE so it is quite good but not the best each of them could do. If you know how MADHOUSE does fights, then you will recognise them here. MAPPA seems to be responsible for the rest here and it shows. You might think that there shouldn't be any problems with them taking over the rest, but oh boy. So positive first: extremly well done scenery and you got your typical MAPPA shader slapped onto this. But negative: the characters don't always move fluently, the perspective always looks kinda flat, there's never any attempt to make them look hq even when standing still, face shadow isn't really a thing and so on.Sound:The best aspect of this anime. As this is an anime about music, you can expect that, but really. As music is pretty subjective I can only say that the ost never destroyed the mood or felt unfitting in any way.Character:The worst aspect. While two of the three main characters are actually quite likeable, that's about where it stops. The third mc is one of the most annoying characters in the last few seasons of anime, and so is the rest of the cast. I get easily annoyed with bad characters but this really ticks all the boxes for presenting annoying characters, that wouldn't even have to be so annoying in order for the story to work.Enjoyment:I liked the fights, but that's about it. As you can tell I didn't really enjoy anything besides that. But gladly there's a lot of fights in this anime. I never got my hopes up when I saw the trailer, so it's not an disappointment for me. chapter.

That, I say it.Every single thing is good, except the plot.The animation, the Seiyuu, the music (OP and ED), everything is good.. Unfortunately, the story is not.I feel the story is rather choppy and disconnected from one episode to the next one. Maybe if there is more episode, the plot can be delivered or developed better..?If it's not for the plot, this anime will probably be one of the best anime this year. I feel like it's such a waste of outstanding animation with how the story progressed. I felt disconnected in the middle of story, and when I...feel connected to the story again, it either made me cry or upset--then it's over.Nevertheless, thank you so much for all the production team for the hard work. feel connected to the story again, it either made me cry or upset--then it's over.Nevertheless, thank you so much for all the production team for the hard work."", 'Massively TL;DR of why this show will make your inner (potential) artist ache:It\'s a shame. A huge shame. Simply put, the first 5-6 episodes are incredible--like, really incredible. You had amazing characterisation; you had amazing set pieces; you had amazing pacing; you had a soul-creaking 1min30 Intro; you had suspense, mystery, a unique palette for a landscape (American 50\'s), an amazing Hook to grab you in, and even the music or the passion behind at least being a pianist or a composer, was purely palpable. Heck, look, I gave Story/Art/Sound a score of 8+! SO HOW DID THIS GO SO DOWN-HILL?! (No seriously, how? gjhsgjdhgsd).Takt....Op: Destiny... Well: Inspiring, even. It was; up until a point.But then we had the final 5\'ish episodes (it\'s hard to pin-point where the tone-shift began) and it felt like their slow-burn of a deliberate & well-articulated atmosphere & musically-characterised plot, picked up the rocket fuel and blasted off into \'Here\'s A Template\' territory.Here. In my mind, this is the impression I have of how things began to go wrong:It\'s kinda like someone gave the studio a plan - which was followed to the T - only for NASTY-BADGUY X to barge in mid season and tell everyone, ""Wooow, wait, why are you only up to here in the plan! Don\'t tell me you\'re all so stupid you can\'t read a simple plan? You\'re going at 1/4th the speed you were meant to! Sigh, I understand, you\'re all new & incompetent [*palpable irony*]--but don\'t worry! Now that I\'m here, we\'ll get this plan back on track! *cough, fuck I hate stake-holders, I can\'t believe they changed their minds mid season and don\'t want to fund a 2nd Cour [season], what am I even meant to fkin\' do! ... *beep Email*... The CEO sent me a How To Write Shounen for Dummies.pdf... Fuck"".You get the gist? This show had tremendous potential. For a former musician, I found the first 5 episodes inspirational enough to want to take up piano again after 10 years. (Spoiler: I will be)The beautiful selection of classical, jazz, and rag-time piano pieces, along with the Protagonist\'s smug attitude towards his craft & how he constantly taps his fingers on objects around him whilst envisioning music with every tap, I can confirm: pianists are EXACTLY like this!...But things were brought to a boil midway through & served as a Shounen Template Buffet. Every evidence of shounen-contradition that\'d happened till said point suggests that this wasn\'t the direction they initially set off towards, so it\'s confounding how things ended up this way (esp. whilst the animation remained nearly untouched, budget-wise).What a distorted melody. A melancholic disappointment. Oh well. Once again, mobile game adaptations prove to be an insufferable waste of time. As someone who swooned over the first half of this show: I\'m so mad.

(Spoiler: I will be)The beautiful selection of classical, jazz, and rag-time piano pieces, along with the Protagonist\'s smug attitude towards his craft & how he constantly taps his fingers on objects around him whilst envisioning music with every tap, I can confirm: pianists are EXACTLY like this!...But things were brought to a boil midway through & served as a Shounen Template Buffet. Every evidence of shounen-contradition that\'d happened till said point suggests that this wasn\'t the direction they initially set off towards, so it\'s confounding how things ended up this way (esp. whilst the animation remained nearly untouched, budget-wise).What a distorted melody. A melancholic disappointment. Oh well. Once again, mobile game adaptations prove to be an insufferable waste of time. As someone who swooned over the first half of this show: I\'m so mad.', 'Started out well, but then the writers remembered ""This is just an ad for a mobile game"". (6/10)Full Review:I knew it was a cash-grab anime just to advertise for the mobile game, but with Madhouse x MAPPA being heavily mentioned in the advertisements for this anime I would be lying to say my expectations weren\'t high. And I can honestly say some expectations were met. Others weren\'t. Did it make me want to play the game? Actually, yes, so it technically did its job. Aside from that the anime as a whole was somewhat disappointing.A quick overview of the show: Monsters who hate music are...taking over the world and terrorize cities where they hear the music. Musical entities called Musicarts are equipped to fight these monsters with the help of human Conductors. Our MC is paired with a Musicart and they road trip to New York to meet with the organization of Musicarts and Conductors.Story:Basic, full of fluff. At points it did try to give itself a serious story, but it was mainly ""hey monsters are here"" ""Oh really?"" (fights) ""OK Let\'s keep going to New York"". It does end on a cliffhanger, which may lead to a new season or into the game (likely the latter).Art/Animation:Gorgeous and one of the only redeeming thing in this entire show. The fights were top notch and the style of the world and characters were great. The design of the Musicarts were unique and stood out from the normal humans, which I quite enjoyed. Seriously, this is the best part of the show and if you just wanna turn your brain off and watch gorgeous animation, this is a perfect anime for that.Music:Fantastic and the best part about the show. Listening to classical music during some intense fights, some that are even familiar to a classical pleb like me, honestly made the show bearable and almost convinced me this was the best action I\'ve ever seen. This is completely my opinion but this, along with the art/animation, made the showCharacters:Most characters were boring aside from Lenny and the Musicarts. Our MC is a moody boy to the likes of Sasuke, Todoroki, etc. Anna was the big sister whose character gets ruined by a certain scene (which kinda gets explained at the end but yeah...) The villains were boring and there was no motive for what they were trying to do. Side characters do absolutely nothing unless they are a Musicart.OVERALL 6/10. This anime could\'ve been great if it had better writing. It really started out well but got lost in the fact that there will be a mobile game next year. taking over the world and terrorize cities where they hear the music.

It may have the best two episode hook I\'ve seen in a long time, but then it falls flat on its face with out any good payoff. If you want to look as some real pretty s*it with cool music this show is for you. Its a shame that ""emo piano protégé controlling wiafu to fight aliens"" didn\'t come with more than just the tag. Worst part is you can\'t even play the game its selling in the states.***********SPOILERS*********************The worst part is the...second episode actually got me invested in the girl but then they killed her replaced her with a robot and used the ""shes never coming back"" heart pull once an episode.

Such a shame, I really thought MAPPA could have done better this time with...their Listeners experience, maybe this will be an anime only worth it for those that want to know the game backstory, but even that I don't think is worth watching this.The art is good, so is the animation, but what's the point of being beautiful if it lacks content? their Listeners experience, maybe this will be an anime only worth it for those that want to know the game backstory, but even that I don't think is worth watching this.The art is good, so is the animation, but what's the point of being beautiful if it lacks content?"", 'Now, this is rather mediocre advertising if you ask me. Takt Op. Destiny is an anime solely focused on advertising the game that will be coming out soon, and every anime fan, including myself, had to be somewhat intrigued by the collaboration of MAPPA & Madhouse, and yes, they did deliver, to some extent, just not the most important aspects of a show.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Comedic/Romance themes /20STORY: 8/25First of all, that\'s a weird futuristic America there, I would have appreciated some cultural references to America, but aside from the food, didn\'t see a whole...lot of it. Aside from that, the show provided a rather bland execution of a plot that had some promise. Now going into this, I didn\'t expect a mind-blowing plot at all, but this was certainly disappointing. The plot revolves a futuristic American society where music does not exist anymore, because monsters called D2s, despise music and annihilate any city that produces any sort of music.The story also focuses on our three main characters, Takt Asahina, Destiny, and Anna Schneider. Takt is a withdrawn, rather uncongenial piano player, son of world-renowned conductor Kenji Asahina, who had his music felt worldwide before the D2s put a stop to his music, and took his life. Destiny is the Musicart of Takt, a rather robotic girl turned from a previously energetic girl, Cosette, who also met her demise by D2s, and Anna is Cosette\'s big sister, and in a way, Takt\'s big sister too, the caretaker of the group. The three strive to save the world and rid the world of D2s while uncovering the darkness at the Symphonica in New York.The story fails at drawing in the viewer as most things are extremely underdeveloped, especially the villains. I failed to see any sort of motivation besides ""Saving the world"" from anyone at the Symphonica, and with the rather poor character development overall, the story felt like a confused mess that only hit the surface of what it could achieve.ART: 9.2/10Excellent animation in the fight scenes, definitely a highlight of this work.MUSIC: 9.1/10Very solid opening and ending, combined with a rather pleasant and exciting OST. Definitely captured my attention during important scenes.CHARACTERS: 7/20We do see bits and pieces of character development, but nowhere near enough for it to be truly engaging. The relationship of Takt and Destiny was intriguing that Destiny changed from being robotic, to having a little bit of a personality. The romance between them was a bit out of place I feel, and so was Anna\'s weirdly timed kiss towards Takt. The most intriguing duo had to be the Musicart-Conductor duo of Leonard ""Lenny"" Flyheart and Titan, the ""mentors"" to Takt and Destiny. Titan was a joy to see, a highlight being that she mentioned she would smile for other people, which was rather beautiful.Where the show does not shine, is the development of villains. I struggled to find a purpose for their actions other than ""saving the world"", and in the end, what is the Symphonica? Why do they release D2s? A lot of questions are left unanswered, with the rather static villains such as Heaven, Hell, Felix, and Sagan. I could argue Sagan had a little bit of backstory, but otherwise, a very bland, uninspiring showing of villains.ENJOYMENT: 10.3/15Cheap storylines and bad characterization didn\'t take away from the decent fight scenes, I\'ll give it that.COMEDIC/ROMANTIC THEMES: 9/20Perhaps comedy wasn\'t the main point, but any semblance of comedy just took a nosedive in the second half, and the romance felt extremely, extremely forced, like what was that kiss from Anna even for? I would have been ok with more subtle romance between Takt and Destiny, but with poor character development comes random forced romance scenes that left me scratching my head at points.OVERALL: 5.26/10Not the worst show the season had to offer, but certainly far from the best. A high budget blown on a mediocre show, and while some things were enjoyable, this show continues to teach us not to put all the faith in the world on an advertisement for a mobile game, and not to get misled by big company names.

The art style was good.  The action sequences were well executed. The overall plot was a pleasant change from the normal generic anime. It was good to see an anime where female characters can be endearing while still clothed.Then we turn to the music. I know classical music may not be everyone\'s taste, but the pieces chosen are great pieces that are used well and not tacked on as an afterthought.  The concept...of sacrifice and a price to winning recurs throughout. There are profoundly sad moments in this anime that are not diminished by a sudden ""well, they died but they got better"" moment seen in many animes.I found the ending to be as moving as the endings of Angel Beats, Your Lie in April, or Anohana... which is high praise for the writing and the story telling.All in all a great little anime.  Probably not to everyone\'s tastes but still fun, profound, and very sad in places. of sacrifice and a price to winning recurs throughout.

Destiny is a show that had a very promising start but unfortunately fell off quite a bit towards the end, the story kinda just fell apart which was a shame since I was very hooked at the beginning. The animation was pretty crazy throughout (again more so towards the start) which I'm sure as well is what brought a lot of people into the show, with it being done by madhouse and MAPPA after all.I liked the main characters, I think they had a really interesting dynamic and were pretty unique and the world building for the most part was intriguing, it definitely...did feel immersive and I think it felt quite believable too.Overall I'm not sure if this show is worth watching, I enjoyed it for what it is and I loved the earlier episodes but the later eps really just weren't satisfying for me. did feel immersive and I think it felt quite believable too.Overall I'm not sure if this show is worth watching, I enjoyed it for what it is and I loved the earlier episodes but the later eps really just weren't satisfying for me."", ""God....okay, … I don’t like Tack.Op Destiny to be honest. I wasn't even hyped for it either, it was just there, so I gave it a watch. And this is a no from me, dawg.I don't hate it per se. There's nothing glaringly wrong about it, it's just that there are so many little gripes and problems that build up and bother me.It just feels like the writers didn't try.STORY-Basically Takt is a  better version of listeners ,but that's honestly not a compliment.Both shows are about two people  in a world where music is almost gone from the world, and they go...on a journey and fight with something music related.In Listener’s the people fighting are called “Players’ and in Tackt Op. The people fighting are called “Musicarts”. But just like both, their stories are very vacuous,hollow,and basic,and both are really boring.I already made a review on Listeners,but the problems I have with takt are mostly similar to Listeners,just keep that in mind.But focusing on Tackt Op.destiny(which has the most clumsy title of an anime ever and a pain in the ass to type)The themes about music feels less like a theme and more like an ambiguous plot device, the only times music plays a role is when the show reinforces over and over that Takt likes music and to use the concept of music as some ambiguous conceptual being that the villains monolog about.Despite it being about music, the style or setting of the show doesn't incorporate music that much into it.I feel like the only reason that the anime takes place in USA is because of the music culture there,but instead of exploring different types of music,incorporating it into battles more than just having a fancy conductor stick, or hell being somewhat creative with it, it's just fight scenes mainly. Fight Scene on top of fight scene on top of fight scene. WIth loud ass music.I think the best way to describe the writing in Takt is like a video game adaptation of a video game that didn’t exist.(note-i didnt realize until i checked on mal that it was based off a mobile game that came out at the same time this aired,but i fukin called that shit so yea)There are just a lot of things that make no sense, and the show doesn't explain that much about where the D2 come from or how they exist, also the explanations about the Musicarts and the Maestros is murky at best .Despite having long flashbacks and info dumps, there is barely anything valuable to get out of most of these scenes,and it feels like the show is just using fightscenes to distract you from how little the story is actually progressing.there is a lot of exposition that barely matters repeating info we already knew but also not addressing other important things,it doesnt help that the dialogue is trying way too hard to be clever, and for a journey anime, it's soooooooooo boring.Each episode is almost the same, The gang go to a location, Destiny fights the D2 and that's about it.Sometimes there are episodes where  nothing fucking happens. And it's not because of world building since they already have an American setting to work with.There are no situations to help shake things up, build the characters or anything, there are just fights and more fights that are so over the top and trying so hard to be flashy by having the most goofy ass sound effects. And there are just over the top emotional moments for the shallow characters and in the words of the famous artist Icona Pop: “I …….don’t ……….care”And the setting bothered me too. The show takes place in 2047, but for some reason it feels like a setting older than the one we're in now. I know the D2 have destroyed a lot of civilization,but for some reason technology regressed???? People still use paper maps, watch old vintage television, and one of the girls still uses a FUCKING LAND LINE TELEPHONE IN THE YEAR 2047???????I don't think anyone uses smartphones either.so it feels like this setting taking place in the future didn't matter at all.CHARACTERS-The characters are one note ,inhumane like, and don't have chemistry, the main two are at each other's throats for half the show.Cossette’s whole character is that she likes to eat and break things.I get the writers wanted to make her the alien entity who learns about human nature, but her main sign of character development is her repeating character personalities over and over to other people. Even characters who did not matter to the plot.its like her voice actor pulled up the character wiki's and read aloud from it. She does develop late on but its way too little and waaaay too late,The thing about her is that she is a new entity called Destiny who in the body of a girl who passed away called Cossette,but by the end of this show, Destiny had less character personality than the girl who passed away in episode 2.,What really pissed me off though, is that the characters kept stating how much she has grown and im like “bich, really?”Destiny went from a sugar eating robot, to a one dimensional sugar eating human.And the main dude, Tackt,was just a bore. He has no personality outside of music,he is insanely bland,so full of himself,and feels like a puppet controlled by the plot.He’s like a caricature of an art student, focusing only on what he makes and literally not caring about anything else.His character development really peaked in episode 2.His dynamic with Cossette was heartwarming,but when Cossette turned into Destiny, that dynamic vanished and Tackt turned into a sodden, pretentious,ass, with little to no likeability or personality outside of “I like piano , i love piano, i wanna have sex with piano, i wanna tap dat piano ass”.You might say he could make a good “video game protagonist'' but without a player’s control on what his personality is.The show had so much potential to develop him and his dynamic with Destiny since she took the place of his dead sister, but its like the writers tried that in some scenes, gave alll the way up , and just turned him into heroic character who fights evil for the rest of the show.Anna doesn't matter,she is literally the chauffeur of the anime, her sister mattered to the plot more than her, all she did was fall through a plank of wood and tell the group to shut up when they were fighting.If anything the better characters I liked were Lenny and Titan, not because they were well written or anything ,but because they stole the show at some parts.Titan is cute and kicks ass resulting in her having the best fights in the show, And Lenny is….hot. I think the directors would agree with me because there are a lot of shots on his ass for some reason,aaaaand That's all I got for him. I didn't say the characters were well written did I? Because they aren't. Titan literally doesn't matter, she could've been anyone basically.And Lenny is a personified tutorial,showing the characters how to fight, catching up to speed about what's happening in the story(i.e. not much) and disappearing for a good chunk of the show.My only compliment is that the story by the end had a bare minimum of character development resulting in stakes and making the fight scenes more hype.Goes to show how valuable a character is to an anime. And its not much in this animeOh and the villains. They're not just lame, they're probably the worst villains I have seen in a long time in any medium.There are two of them, and you know they're villains right when you see them.The first one is like a dumber version of Syndrome from the Incredibles, he feels envious because of how others reject him and then later on he has this weird delirium where he wants to become a hero by causing destruction to happen and solving that destruction making him more praised by others.Incredibles took those two conflicts with him and made it work, but in this anime, those two conflicts feel like they contradict each other. Not to mention he’s fuking stupid. The villian after that is even stupider.The main villains motive is sooo bad.Not bad in like a “oh its evil” kinda way, Bad as in poorly written, stupid, and nonsensical. “ You know, people sacrificing their lives is not cool man, you know what would help? Basically Genocide, yea that will definitely stop people from dying” Ugh.ART AND ANIMATION/SOUNDI usually dont talk about art and sound last but there's not much to mention.Its a collaboration between two studios who both make fabulous looking things,Mappa and Madhouse.My problems with both studios is their inconsistency, Madhouse sometimes can make their anime look great and other times make it look like Overloard(aka dogpoo). And Mappa is basically the same way but more drastic since they make an anime every five seconds.Unfortunately, the inconsistency plagues this anime. It feels so unstable. The fights are really nice and top tier sure, but as is said before, the characters or story barely add any sense of investment to the fights so it leaves me bored going ohh and ahh mainly. Some scenes look like a standard tv anime and other cuts of the same scene are so jarringly higher in quality, it looks like a different anime entirely..There isn't a lot of harmony, which is ironic coming from a show revolves around music. Speaking of music its also inconsistent. Some of it is good, albiet a bit loud,like the piano tracks, and other tracks sound like stupid guitar music during fight scenes. Saddly most of it is unmemorable.And the foley was just obnoxious, its like a bad diarreha bowl of jojo sounds,micheal bay, and madoka magica. Even so much of a swing of Destiny’s weapon has like five different sounds.ENJOYMENT-Y’know after thinking about it, this show is bad, I can't deny it. It's not because it does anything awful, it just doesn't try, and falters in basically every area. The show tried when it came to looking good, but didn't try when it came to what mattered which was the writing. There are just so many holes that feel barely thought of.This show is one of the many that thinks its concept alone is enough for an anime and its lack of competent story and characters piss me off the more I think about it.And its nonending that made no sense really did it for me. Does no one care about writing a good anime story beforehand anymore? Probably not the case, Odd Taxi months later is still a masterpiece, AOT, Kageki Shoujo, hell, even Tokyo Revengers had a better story. And I'm sure there a lot of manga and written works that have yet to get an anime. Sadly they will have to wait for their time to shine, because right now, poorly written cash grab anime based on irrelevant mobile games will have to take their spotlight.And I hope Mappadhouse is proud of themselves if they ever break even from the sales of their ingame currency/blurays.Fuck it,Overall-4/10I started this review very ambivalent, but now I'm a little salty. I wasted my time on a show like this. If i watched this seasonally, I would’ve gone insane. on a journey and fight with something music related.In Listener’s the people fighting are called “Players’ and in Tackt Op.

Titan literally doesn't matter, she could've been anyone basically.And Lenny is a personified tutorial,showing the characters how to fight, catching up to speed about what's happening in the story(i.e. not much) and disappearing for a good chunk of the show.My only compliment is that the story by the end had a bare minimum of character development resulting in stakes and making the fight scenes more hype.Goes to show how valuable a character is to an anime. And its not much in this animeOh and the villains. They're not just lame, they're probably the worst villains I have seen in a long time in any medium.There are two of them, and you know they're villains right when you see them.The first one is like a dumber version of Syndrome from the Incredibles, he feels envious because of how others reject him and then later on he has this weird delirium where he wants to become a hero by causing destruction to happen and solving that destruction making him more praised by others.Incredibles took those two conflicts with him and made it work, but in this anime, those two conflicts feel like they contradict each other. Not to mention he’s fuking stupid. The villian after that is even stupider.The main villains motive is sooo bad.Not bad in like a “oh its evil” kinda way, Bad as in poorly written, stupid, and nonsensical. “ You know, people sacrificing their lives is not cool man, you know what would help? Basically Genocide, yea that will definitely stop people from dying” Ugh.ART AND ANIMATION/SOUNDI usually dont talk about art and sound last but there's not much to mention.Its a collaboration between two studios who both make fabulous looking things,Mappa and Madhouse.My problems with both studios is their inconsistency, Madhouse sometimes can make their anime look great and other times make it look like Overloard(aka dogpoo). And Mappa is basically the same way but more drastic since they make an anime every five seconds.Unfortunately, the inconsistency plagues this anime. It feels so unstable. The fights are really nice and top tier sure, but as is said before, the characters or story barely add any sense of investment to the fights so it leaves me bored going ohh and ahh mainly. Some scenes look like a standard tv anime and other cuts of the same scene are so jarringly higher in quality, it looks like a different anime entirely..There isn't a lot of harmony, which is ironic coming from a show revolves around music. Speaking of music its also inconsistent. Some of it is good, albiet a bit loud,like the piano tracks, and other tracks sound like stupid guitar music during fight scenes. Saddly most of it is unmemorable.And the foley was just obnoxious, its like a bad diarreha bowl of jojo sounds,micheal bay, and madoka magica. Even so much of a swing of Destiny’s weapon has like five different sounds.ENJOYMENT-Y’know after thinking about it, this show is bad, I can't deny it. It's not because it does anything awful, it just doesn't try, and falters in basically every area. The show tried when it came to looking good, but didn't try when it came to what mattered which was the writing. There are just so many holes that feel barely thought of.This show is one of the many that thinks its concept alone is enough for an anime and its lack of competent story and characters piss me off the more I think about it.And its nonending that made no sense really did it for me. Does no one care about writing a good anime story beforehand anymore? Probably not the case, Odd Taxi months later is still a masterpiece, AOT, Kageki Shoujo, hell, even Tokyo Revengers had a better story. And I'm sure there a lot of manga and written works that have yet to get an anime. Sadly they will have to wait for their time to shine, because right now, poorly written cash grab anime based on irrelevant mobile games will have to take their spotlight.And I hope Mappadhouse is proud of themselves if they ever break even from the sales of their ingame currency/blurays.Fuck it,Overall-4/10I started this review very ambivalent, but now I'm a little salty. I wasted my time on a show like this. If i watched this seasonally, I would’ve gone insane."", 'The series was a rollercoaster - excellent art and sound, alternated with some lousy, shallow characters and rushed plots. Each chapter created loose ends and open-ended plots. I kept coming back because of the art and overall quality, but honestly the final episode crapped all over the first 11 episodes. OP bosses that simply gave up. The entire totally-idiotic ""here\'s what really happened"" story, and the cliff-hanger nonsensical ending where the producers count on a 2nd season to complete anything. 11 episodes of being strung along then given a big middle-finger. Dropped my rating from a 9 to a 1. Watch the 12 episodes for...the quality, then forget you ever watched it because it was nothing but a massive ad campaign that will probably never see a 2nd season - but hey, you can buy the game and see how it ends. the quality, then forget you ever watched it because it was nothing but a massive ad campaign that will probably never see a 2nd season - but hey, you can buy the game and see how it ends.', 'A better produced ""Listeners"" with a better reputation due to being made by MAPPA and Madhouse.They used a tryhard non-original unsuccessful formula for the setting. Animeys with that kind of ""world without music because we have cratures that hate it"" just don\'t work.

Well, not much, unfortunately. Much of the music is forgettable. There was an attempt to make you care about the characters from the second episode onwards, but it all really never amounts to much. Of the characters presented, Lenny is probably the most endearing. Him and Titan have the best banter out of the entire cast, which isn\'t saying much. The title character ""Destiny"" is far stiffer than a walking plank, which is also her bra size. The other title character, ""Takt"" (oh god, did they really use edgy title drops to name their characters?) has...less personality than Shin from 86.I think there is a character named Anna who acts as their chauffer, but never really contributes beyond being the straight man in this trio. Lenny and Titan show up around the end of episode 2 if I recall, and immediately steal the spotlight. Seriously, Titan has this bubbly personality and is an absolute joy to watch. To quote Gigguk, ""I will protect this smile."" And, dear lord, that smile! I could go on about how amazing that smile is. Seriously, give Titan all the snacks, the pats, EVERYTHING.Um... the villains sucked. I disliked Promare\'s main villain, but at least that guy had a plan. Here, this ""Sagan"" guy is upset cause some soldiers died fighting the D2\'s. He had a big cry about it, and then realized life is suffering, and decided the US needed to become a containment zone for all the D2\'s. Oh, the D2\'s hate music. I\'m sure there is an allegory for something MURRICA there, but I really have no idea what it might be. Does the US hate symphonic music? Is that the allegory?Where was I? Oh, right. Lenny and Titan need their own series of them cruising around, getting up to shenanigans. I feel like we could get a Baccano 2 from this pair. Hey, why not?

A series with musicarts and conductors fighting against d2's sounded unique and interesting. I liked the premise, and the first three episodes was amazing and kept my hopes up for the future eps. But sadly, they gradually fell off and wasn't that great anymore as I would've hoped. The final episode was VERY disappointing and anti-climactic. You had three amazing musicarts, but you didn't do anything with them (Valkyre, Hell, Heaven). But I have to give credit where credit is due, the animation was immaculate. Mappa and Madhouse didn't dissapoint! It was an eye candy to watch the...fluid and amazing animation combined with the art, just *chefs kiss* perfect.

An anime that seemed to be one of the most hyped shows of the year, with incredibly high production values, that unfortunately never lived up to the hype due to the same general problems.  Coincidently both are also MAPPA shows.Story 5/10Takt takes place in the not too distant future from now where creatures called d2s are wreaking havoc across a rather barren and semi-post-apocalyptic US, and people known as Conductors ally with humanoid weapons called Musicarts to fend them off.  The main pull of...the story is finding a way for our titular main character to travel to NYC to be able to adjust his Musicart to possibly work more efficiently.  Normally this would be a great setup for a roadtrip style show, but they don't really do anything with the idea.  A proper roadtrip show would both go to interesting places and meet fun characters.  Unfortunately many of the locations look the same between long stretches of barren wasteland and small towns, only getting a nice location once they finally arrive in New York.  We'll get to the issues with the characters later.Art: 7/10yeah it loses some points from a set piece standpoint but gains a few due to the rather excellent models as well as quality sakuga.  Mappa and Madhouse have always done stellar jobs with animating their works no matter how weak the writing may be otherwise, and it's no different here.  (funny note though I'd never guess this was mappa or madhouse though if I didn't know already because sakuga wise, It more reminds me of something ufotable made.  Specifically both character models and fight scenes remind me of the Fate Series)Sound 10/10Yeah as expected from an anime in the music genre, the Sound is top notch stuff.  As mentioned before the sakuga was really good, and part of why that was was because they really did a good job handling sound during the fight scenes.  Both the op and ed are rather solid too, but the biggest standout for music is the OST.  Banger after banger after banger floods the fight scenes and every fight scene has some of the greatest masterpieces in classical music.Characters 4/10The other big issue is pretty much everything you learn about the main characters are covered in the first 2 episodes.  They don't go through much in the way of progression nor do they even get much in the way of development either.  One shot characters are kind of just there and the antagonists come off ass either one note or extremely pretentious.  Almost fake deep in a way.  The only reason why the score isn't any lower is the bright spot known as Lenny.  Legit the one shiny star in this.  I've always liked mentor figures in media, and he's the only one who seemingly gets measurable development in some way.Enjoyment 5/10 Yeah as you can expect from both the mediocre scores in both story and characters, I personally can't get too much enjoyment out of the show either.  The fight scenes are pretty nice and keep my attention, but everything else takes me out of the experience so 5/10 it is.Overall: 6.2/10It's very clear this show was made as advertising for the upcoming mobile game, and that hurts.  When I rate something a 6/10 It means while I thought it was rather fine and I didn't feel like my time was wasted, I don't feel inclined to return for a season 2, so that seems about right. the story is finding a way for our titular main character to travel to NYC to be able to adjust his Musicart to possibly work more efficiently.

It's in high definition, has great character designs, well animated, has beautiful colours and, even if the music aspect in this anime is a bait (it's not music-focused at all, MC is just a fan of music and that's it), it has really great sounds like piano songs played...on some times. Sounds are thus very originals and I love that unlike other animes with random songs in fight scenes.Character dev works to be honest, i wasn't expecting a masterpiece by this and, even it's not, it has a good character dev, well it has one unlike a bunch of other animes and it's not bad at all.

Destiny changes aswell for the best and becomes more humane.The only flaw I can see that stops me from giving this anime a solid 9 was the random story. It's not really deep even if it's watchable. It's basically, you know, destroy ennemies during the first half. Now it starts to improve because we're starting to get more pieces of info about people that are above on the hierarchy.

Destiny”. It is a mixed media adaptation, since it is a show to promote a video game and was able to gather two of the biggest powerhouses in terms of animation – Madhouse and MAPPA.Animation wise, “Takt Op. Destiny” is probably at the top of its peers in the Fall 2021. The characters are amazingly designed with vivid colours and traits, the backgrounds of the wasteland and rundown cities of the U.S. are very beautiful...and the monsters, despite far from original were interesting, nonetheless. Fight scenes and climax moments were awesome and very well executed, even though those fell in terms of quality towards the end.Then we reach the problems, and for a series that had my hopes up, unfortunately there are plenty. One of them was the decline of the animation as said before, starting with good choreographies and fights to standing still with a gun shooting lasers. The powers were a little bland, main characters aside, plus the ‘Conductors’ added nothing. There was practically zero development of any character or plot points, the story is poorly written and way too big for the time it had, the development was as tacky as it could have been, and the villains were predictable and one dimensional.The saving grace was the music that went along with the fights and action, but for a show that is based on music there was too little of it. I was expecting amazing symphonies and soundtracks throughout but ended up with some good fights and others were there was almost no music at all. Overall, seemed as the people behind the show gave up 1/4 of the way through and as a consequence, one possible amazing show turned out to be a let-down. and the monsters, despite far from original were interesting, nonetheless.

Destiny appears to redeem itself with dazzling scenic views and a great sense of adventure as the main characters embark on a long American style road trip. It this unique setup that is likely to get you interested in learning more and the second episode only reinforces this view as we get a good amount of backstory on Takt and Cosette that really has viewers itching for more.Unfortunately, it is at this point when the anime stumbles as the story from here...on travels at a very pedestrian pace. It is not like the series goes bad but if you are after an action series with a grippling and powerful storyline then you have come to the wrong place. Instead of expanding on the Takt Op world and the lore what we get is largely a character driven series that focuses chiefly on Takt and his partner Destiny.To the show’s credit the development in both Takt and Destiny is remarkable considering that they both started as almost gag personalities in the season opener with both exhibiting one-track minds. Over the course of the series though both characters show considerable maturity in their actions and by the seasons end you can really root for Destiny who develops from a mindless robot-like personality to someone you can really emphasise with. Whilst the same cannot necessarily be said of Takt his growth is undeniable and he really does respond and learn from the various near misses and disasters that surrounds him. To top things off there are some romantic elements by the end so if that is your thing that will be an added bonus.The secondary cast are also pretty strong as unlike the main pairing they are likeable from the start. This strong secondary/weak main dynamic actually worked quite well as the interesting backgrounds and personalities of the secondary characters meant they largely carried show through the earlier opening phase but when Takt and Destiny began to develop the secondary cast took a backseat so the mains could flourish. This dynamic ensured that throughout the shows running there was always a character to keep viewers engaged.The big weakness with the casting was the antagonists who were underdeveloped and their motives questionable. Those questionable actions never really made sense and instead of future episodes providing clarity we get more confusion as the actions made did not make logical sense. Those illogical actions even had a detrimental impact on the shows ending as while the antagonists final act was similar to a famous marvel movie villain the thing that made it fall flat was the final actions contradicted the moves made earlier on. It was puzzling and disappointing but if there are any positives it was that the ending did provide closure.What made these narrative shortcomings easier to overlook though was the overall theme of exploration as the characters visit various places in the states and the scenery and towns, they visited were great to watch. Although the series is based in 2047 Takt Op. draws a lot of inspiration with 1960s America with the classic muscle cars, white picket fence housing and the designing of various diners, restaurants and motels. These unique backdrops make Takt Op. standout from most anime series as not many shows are based in America and the few that are do not involve exploring various parts of America in this fashion.Animation/music:The animation in Takt Op. is for the most part strong as the vivid character designs for the various musicarts were always creative and a pleasure to see. They all looked distinct and was something I looked forward to watching. These good character designs were bolstered by the great scenic shots we got at various points of the anime but also by the unique backgrounds we saw as the characters visited various diners/motels and American style houses. Despite this series taking place in the future, it did draw a lot from 1960s USA.If there was one disappointment, I had with the animation it would be with the action scenes as the level of detail seen during those moments dropped dramatically reducing the impact and enjoyment of those scenes which was unfortunate considering this is an action series.Another weakness that was pretty ironic considering the musical theme of the anime’s premise was with the musical score of Takt Op. Both the opening and ending tracks were largely forgettable and even during the anime there was no music that really stood out for me. I was disappointed and thought more effort should have been put here. For those curious the opening song is ""takt"" by ryo (supercell) feat. Mafumafu, gaku while the ending is ""SYMPHONIA"" by Mika Nakashima.Summary:Takt Op. is an anime that bills itself as an action/fantasy series but if you go into this show with that expectation, you will likely become disappointed. What you get instead is a character driven show that even hints at romantic moments near the shows end. This drama and the memorable picturesque scenes that litter this series make these the two biggest redeeming points of Takt Op.As good as those points are they cannot cover up the obvious weakness this anime suffers from that are its pacing issues and lacklustre ending. As such, it is hard to really engage in Takt Op. from a narrative standpoint so I would not set big expectations over the storyline despite what the opening two episodes would suggest.It is this weak storyline that means I could not recommend this Takt Op. to most anime fans. There are better series out there and if you really have an itch for musical/action anime then I would suggest Symphogear or any Macross title as both deliver a better experience than this. If you are a fan of character/driven action series though then you will likely get more out of this than I did but even then, don’t expect to be knocked off your chair.Story 4 – The opening two episodes are strong but unfortunately, story wise, this is the high point of Takt Op. as the series suffers from a stagnant plot that only gets going in the final episodes. Even here though the ending left something to be desired especially if you consider the contradictory actions taken by the series antagonists in the previous episodes.Characters 7 – The personalities of Takt/Destiny are almost comically bad at the start but the growth both characters experience is so remarkable that by the seasons end the pair are effectively carrying the series. The secondary cast are also strong and fortunately they are good from the get go meaning they take the slack when the characters of Takt and Destiny are still found wanting.Animation/music 7.5 – The great scenic shots and the unique American backdrops make this one of the more memorable aspects of the anime. Like the cast, it is one of the main reasons to watch Takt Op. as the environments shown are consistently gorgeous. The same can’t be said over the action scenes and musical score. The latter weakness is particularly unfortunate considering the musical theme of this anime.Overall 6 – Takt Op. starts with a bang and offers a lot of initial promise. Unfortunately, a lot of that potential is left unrealised due to its lacklustre narrative. The main things that prevent Takt Op. from becoming a poor show is the casting and character growth of the mains which is above average. The animation whilst poor in the action scenes are an overall boon due to the way it effectively captures the sense of adventure that Takt Op projects.All things considered this isn’t a series I would recommend unless you are a fan of the Takt Op. games. If you want to watch a musical/action anime then I would take shows like Macross over this. on travels at a very pedestrian pace. It is not like the series goes bad but if you are after an action series with a grippling and powerful storyline then you have come to the wrong place. Instead of expanding on the Takt Op world and the lore what we get is largely a character driven series that focuses chiefly on Takt and his partner Destiny.To the show’s credit the development in both Takt and Destiny is remarkable considering that they both started as almost gag personalities in the season opener with both exhibiting one-track minds. Over the course of the series though both characters show considerable maturity in their actions and by the seasons end you can really root for Destiny who develops from a mindless robot-like personality to someone you can really emphasise with. Whilst the same cannot necessarily be said of Takt his growth is undeniable and he really does respond and learn from the various near misses and disasters that surrounds him. To top things off there are some romantic elements by the end so if that is your thing that will be an added bonus.The secondary cast are also pretty strong as unlike the main pairing they are likeable from the start. This strong secondary/weak main dynamic actually worked quite well as the interesting backgrounds and personalities of the secondary characters meant they largely carried show through the earlier opening phase but when Takt and Destiny began to develop the secondary cast took a backseat so the mains could flourish. This dynamic ensured that throughout the shows running there was always a character to keep viewers engaged.The big weakness with the casting was the antagonists who were underdeveloped and their motives questionable. Those questionable actions never really made sense and instead of future episodes providing clarity we get more confusion as the actions made did not make logical sense. Those illogical actions even had a detrimental impact on the shows ending as while the antagonists final act was similar to a famous marvel movie villain the thing that made it fall flat was the final actions contradicted the moves made earlier on. It was puzzling and disappointing but if there are any positives it was that the ending did provide closure.What made these narrative shortcomings easier to overlook though was the overall theme of exploration as the characters visit various places in the states and the scenery and towns, they visited were great to watch. Although the series is based in 2047 Takt Op. draws a lot of inspiration with 1960s America with the classic muscle cars, white picket fence housing and the designing of various diners, restaurants and motels. These unique backdrops make Takt Op. standout from most anime series as not many shows are based in America and the few that are do not involve exploring various parts of America in this fashion.Animation/music:The animation in Takt Op. is for the most part strong as the vivid character designs for the various musicarts were always creative and a pleasure to see. They all looked distinct and was something I looked forward to watching. These good character designs were bolstered by the great scenic shots we got at various points of the anime but also by the unique backgrounds we saw as the characters visited various diners/motels and American style houses.

There's a great deal of realism to the characters in...this anime. Not a lot of anime-tropes like damsel in distress, godlike protagonists etc. More human elements like anxiety and apathy towards the world outside your comfort zone, the importance of cameraderie among loved ones during a time of loss, and shared anger towards a system that harms innocent people under the guise of keeping others safe.In anime, often times you are numb to characters dying because it seems inconsequential. This anime makes you care so much about its characters, that you will feel something for every death you will encounter. I had my heartbroken over and over again. And it felt cathartic as heck.

The opening is also a bit of an earworm, although it took time to grow on me.While some feel the art is soulless, I feel exactly the opposite. I think the art style has so much charm and heart that it fits the world they are in perfectly, from the glow in the eyes of the Musicarts, to small intricate details on the Conductor batons and the sheen or dust on a piano. The animation for the music playing on the keys in particular is very impressive.What stuck with me the most is the theme of the importance of music as a form of universal joy in the world that resonates well outside the anime. Think about it, there's music in every form of media from anime to games, jingles on the news, memorable intro themes to cartoons, sitcoms, and every other type of show.

Destiny takes place in the US, where Takt Asahina is attacked by a D2 - a monster that originates from outer space.  During the attack, Cosette Schneider  covers him, and seemingly loses her life in the process.  However, instead of going away, her body is taken over by Destiny.  She is a Musicart - special beings who have the power to fight back against the D2s.  As they attack in sync with their conductor, their master, they are able to effectively kill these things off so that mankind can be preserved....Together, with the help of Cosette\'s sister Anna, as well as Lenny, another conductor, and his Musicart Titan, they hope to travel to New York City, where the Symphonica Headquarters are located.  It is there that they hope to find answers to what actually happened to Cosette and why she is now Destiny.Takt is deeply connected to his music, almost at an obsessive level.  So much so that prior to the current story, his health would begin to degrade because he wouldn\'t take care of himself.  He cares nothing about anything but music, but the D2s attack all sources of music, thus bringing their lives to a conflict with Takt.  He doesn\'t really bring much to the table as a conductor, and it feels like ideals that he already should have, are forced on him because he won\'t accept reality.  It\'s really not until the end where he develops a little.  Destiny is a pretty empty shell of a person, born only at the beginning of this series.  She knows it\'s her sole mission to eradicate D2s, but she doesn\'t really have any personality traits until the end.  Anna\'s the levelheaded person of the group, and not someone who should probably shine as much as she does.  Look, in a show about giant monsters attacking people who have these giant weapons at their disposal, someone who is just an ordinary human probably shouldn\'t be one of your best characters.  She thinks on her feet, does all the heavy lifting and knows what state the world is in.  That alone should present you with a decent character, but she has to keep the group together so often that she shines.Lenny is probably my favourite of the group.  He has strong ideals and watches out for Takt when he can.  He\'s a pillar of positivity, and his partner, Titan, displays just about the same amount of fun-loving affection has him.  Titan\'s powers aren\'t really as flashy as Destiny\'s, but they get the job done.  Sagan and Schindler belong to the association in New York and serve as the main antagonists in this story.  The problem?  They don\'t display any reason for doing what they do.  It\'s horrible, and brings what was a seemingly okay conclusion to a fall.  There\'s always this grand talk with our main hero and villain at the end, but the one at the end of this tale?  It doesn\'t mean anything.One of the main issues with the story is it\'s inconsistency.  It goes through ups and downs far too often in terms of good storytelling and I did not appreciate how little certain parts meant to the overall plot.  One such plot point has our main cast going from their home, to New York, and everything in between that did not contain Lenny was such a let down.  It doesn\'t really present new topics to our story and Takt and Destiny\'s underdeveloped characters don\'t help things at all.  While fights were plentiful, just bashing in ordinary D2s gets old after so long.  As our party nears its destination, fights got a little more exciting, even if it comes at a cost down the line.Some of the better episodes were near the end, outside of the final episode, and it\'s here that the script is a little stronger, with fights that mean a little more.  While the weaker cast of characters don\'t help things, it was at least a little bump up from where we started.  However, it does feel wasted once you can tell that the story takes a lot of inspiration from Guilty Crown, a series that had serious story flaws in itself.  So while the best moments mirror Guilty Crown, it\'s a little disappointing that it\'s so similar, including where it ends our story.  (Story: 5/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: Madhouse and MAPPA are two big names and they lend their talents to their series well.  Fights are very flashy, especially with Destiny\'s weapon design.  Most fights take place at night or in darker scenarios and it really makes the colours pop.  While there is some loss of quality very late, the series, overall, was done well.  (8/10)Sound: Music is equally up to the task, with some strong pieces, even if you\'re not a huge fan of the classical tone that this series takes its theme from.  The OP and ED are strong as well.  And of course, I\'m not at all surprised that Caitlin Glass voice directed this because the voice talent here was exceptional.  Emi Lo (Cosette and Destiny) isn\'t someone I\'m too familiar with, but she was strong here.  Alexis Tipton (Anna) and Jason Liebrecht (Takt) are two voice talents that are basically always strong, and they fit their characters very well.  Reagan Murdock (Lenny) lifts Lenny\'s character so much, and this, hilariously, is my second exposure to him after A Sign of Affection, which is literally airing right now.  (9/10)Overall: Takt Op. Destiny brings a mixed bag to the table because while it had some strong characters and plot points, there weren\'t nearly enough of them to offset the strong art and sound.

What the hell did I just watch?”And I wish it wasn’t.{HEAVY SPOILERS}This anime had a lot going for it. The excitement towards the start and ecstatic qualities shining through the eyes of countless watchers everywhere, glowing up and gleaming above and beyond with both music and animation quality. And yet, it mishandled itself like a nervous robbery in the middle of a parade. They fumbled the weapon and tossed it in the air, only to catch it by the front of the firearm and not the handle. They’re lucky they didn’t completely shoot themselves. So, what went wrong? Let’s start first with a small summary and characters.A Short Summary & Characters:In this anime we have our main 3 characters, Takt, Cossette and Anna. Takt is introduced as someone who consistently loves playing on the piano and acts like a social outcast to all. Then we have Cossette who later dies and becomes Destiny, is a loving sister of Anna who likes to try and help get (and mainly annoy) Takt out of the house to show off his piano skills. Anna on the other hand is the mother of the bunch, taking care of them both whenever possible. We’re left with this continuous and clear plot line after Destiny’s forthcoming into existence of “We have to get from A-B in order to help Cossett- I mean, Destiny!”. Which by itself, I liked the idea of and sat for the ride.With our overall characters, we have a decent bunch of generic characters. Takt is the edgy kid who lost their parents/ father in a supposedly freak incident where D2’s ended up attacking and Takt himself barely escaped with his own life. In terms of development, he experiences next to nothing in change and only the ability to come to peace?, with the loss of his father and Cossette. Oh and he can also make a song I guess now. As if that was really of any importance considering the story sidelined it towards the end, making him seem as if he’s been the same character the entire goddamn anime.Then we have Anna. What was her point? Being there, existing? She’s a character alright and a decent support/ main for the both of them. Although, I’m concerned as to why she isn’t also a main in MAL as she is there every episode and does have highlights with specifically her constantly. Doesn’t matter. She certainly has more substance than Takt because she has a deep complication within herself with trying to accept Destiny’s transformation from Cossette, and coming to terms with her complete and utter death. Which I liked as a plot point that consistently carried throughout episodes until she finally blew up because she couldn’t handle the guilt of it anymore. THAT was development, but she did barely pass the line with only a single complication and nothing more than being okay with Destiny and loving her for who she was, as her own sister still.Of course, we still have our helpful side characters that I didn’t mind too much, some I did.Titan, Lenny, Sagan, Schindler, Heaven, Hell. (Also Valkyrie.)Lenny, I liked. He was actually surprisingly a good character and I preferred him more of an existence of development in comparison to Takt, because he had an interesting back story. His back story was enveloped and shown off, he revelled in his guilt for Takt’s father’s death, constantly blaming it on himself and swore to protect Takt when the time came. I like how he was a depressed, sad and lonely man who only wanted to help others with music, given back to life by Titan. They were a really nice duo and perfectly fine support characters. Him dying, was not exactly justified in how he went out, but it was sad, it had some connection for me.Heaven and Hell, I couldn’t care less about. They were just annoying Musicarts that broke the law of logic and character rationality a handful of times. They both, apparently came from some gem or something? Story didn’t exactly explain in the end how Sagan got them.Schindler, he was boring and annoying as hell. His purpose was mind numbingly dumb. As surprising as this would actually be possible, hurts, but it goes to show spite doesn’t always win against the one with some handy powers (which I think don’t detract from the story) and a bit of plot power.And oh god, Sagan. I don’t understand the point of this character. Was he supposed to be a villain, or did he know he was being a villain? Did he see himself as a hero? Was he purposely being malicious? I’ll talk about the dumbness of this further down. God, was he a bad a character. Even Takt couldn’t stand him. Self inserted myself inside Takt whenever he was near Sagan, could feel that anger broiling within him.NONETHELESS, there was thankfully positive and actually non-excruciating development with 1 character.Destiny. I think, all the brain power in the development and writing studio only went into her. All of it, 200% of it, bothered putting it all into Destiny.It’s difficult to compile all of this. But I love Destiny / Cossette as a character. She’s obviously a bait waifu, but, even then, she’s such a good character in and of itself, she has the most development and personality curation out of everyone in this anime. In the start of the anime, so many symbols of dialogue and metaphors are thrown out, and many of them together towards the very end with Destiny and Takt. At the start, Destiny is nothing but a dutiful, sensible and hard working Musiccart with the sole aim of destroying D2’s. But it’s with growth that she evolves into this witty, yet responsible and sweet-sugar-cake loving maniac who does everything she can to complete the mission and keep Takt safe. The love that grows between them makes sense, the inner ability and love that resided from Cossette stays and finally shows itself as a resemblance to her when Destiny gives her goodbyes. The lines she utters during those scenes are magical and by far bring back connecting symbols to call to Takt. She had so much personality development. From being a seemingly hollow shell, to a character with traits of Cossette still inside her and forms of caring and traits developed from being around Takt and Anna, helping others whenever she thought to in her own time and off screen. It was just, pleasant to know she was changing like this. Whereas we barely saw anything different with any of the other characters, because there wasn’t enough time to develop them all fully. But it was more or so made up by the animation, music and close to great and enjoyable story/ plot before it fell on its face. God, Cossette is such a sweetheart. She’s not like the Detective from last season, by far. She might’ve been witty and cold hearted, but Cossette was robotic and dumb at times, not thinking ahead or doing everything based solely on needing to remove the enemy immediately. The Detective was different despite her small amount of development. It’s why she’s my favourite character in this anime.Now, I AM REQUIRED TO TALK ABOUT THIS SPECTACULAR THING CALLED THE MUSIC.Music / Sound:The. Music. Is. Stellar. Stellar. I need to repeat myself, this music, the score is absolutely stellar. It is out of this world in quality. The OP song is FUCKING INCREDIBLE. Not to mention the OP is an original made just for this anime, and lord does it encapsulate everything in this anime to a T. All the lost emotions, memories, broken hearts and lives gone, it’s all squeezed nicely and quietly like a puzzle piece fitting together within the melody of the opening song. And they barely even used it in the anime, which I say was a good call. It would’ve over saturated their abilities to make an incredible opening song like this and made the song overly repetitive. But. I can’t forget the music they played at the start and in the middle of the anime. I was so surprised by the stellar quality of the songs I was hearing bring pleasure to my ears. Music to my ears at its fitting quality to a comfort of positivity. I wish, I wish so hard that the anime was entirely about the MC, Takt using pianos or any other fitting instruments to fight the D2’s continuously. Not abandon the concept and idea of this in the last 3 episodes. I wish even, in the final battle, not the messy fight it is now, but somewhere they had Takt playing the piano and blasting Destiny’s abilities to the sky in strength as she might’ve marauded through enemies after enemies. Hearing (I believe) Mozart and Beethoven and Chopin songs all be played was fun as heck to hear. Especially as even in the music world they all reside in, many remember the classics. I would’ve for the anime to continue to carry on the tradition of playing classical music during battles, as it always had this mystical sense that I haven’t ever seen done before in anime the way they made use of it.Animation:This is by far the greatest element in this anime. Alongside the stellar score and overall music within this, we have this superb literal piece of animation. I am so completely and utterly disappointed by how well they used their animation abilities and killed the anime in the end of it while still displaying fantastic animation skills. It’s like watching a bit of Madhouse share it’s life blood as they compile it together with J.C Staff to make this glorious animation wonder with a piss-poor plot line of an ending. (Only checked later to realise it is Madhouse and MAPPA animating this  piece. I blame the writers for butchering the ending.) Straight from the first episode, the pilot episode, the anime was no stranger to showing of its highly qualified animation. From the smooth movements of Cossette and flow of fingers and hands in some the subletest movement’s, I could see every frame in its fluidity. It surprised me to what I had been expecting. The OP alone already gave me enough of what I hadn’t been expecting in the very first 10 seconds with Destiny running out of the house. So much effort, care and delicacy dropped into so many frames wether they’d been pointless or crucial to the story. Further, with every single fight scene, ALL OF THEM, had consistently remained top tier animation with it rarely ever lacking fluidity and smooth frames of drawings all connecting with each other in the way Destiny swung her weapons, Takt waved his wand or played music, the twirls Destiny took to doing several times when battling D2’s, the massive giant beams of energy that continuously looked accurately realistic (as realistic as it could be at least) in how it could fire out slippery smooth like butter. It’s difficult to keep praising this anime for its animation without repeatedly saying “smooth” over and over again, because that is quite literally what it is. And even with this incredible of animation talent, it all seemingly goes to waste given the end of this. Despite that, I still love and admire the quality of this anime when it came to passion and hard work squeezed into it, even in the final episodes it outputted spectacularly with itself. Add On: Madhouse truly never fails to output artistic art pieces when it comes to these anime, wether it be a gacha grab or a stand-alone anime off by itself, it comes out with plenty of positive traits wether they aim for it to be good or not.The Ending:Look, I can understand the love, treatment, all the symbols of Cossette still resembling inside Destiny, her loving Takt, the lines she spoke at the start of the anime of how music is like love and how it ended the exact same way, the witty dialogue. But- logic fails me here. How did they get to the beach by the sea? How were they 100 kilometres away from Symphonica HQ? They were both on the verge of death, and somehow got out of the building while parts of it was collapsing nearly unscathed. Not just that, what was the point of the main villain, Sargon? What was his motivation? To destroy the world, or help it? Was Takt being a simple, to the point “shut the fuck up” person to Sargon as he was impaled showed that he knew he was wasting his time and was a dumb person for not realising his actions meant nothing? Why didn’t Sagan bleed when he was impaled by Takt with Destiny’s weapon? Was the combination of Heaven and Hell supposed to be explained? Why did they suddenly freeze up into a calcified version when fighting Destiny? If it was Destiny’s abilities and hands doing that, why didn’t she beat the shit out of her in hand to hand combat in the first place? What the fuck was seriously going on? AND ESPECIALLY, Anna apparently turned into Destiny? Or did she manifest Destiny to exist still? Did she take up her powers? It makes no sense and clearly isn’t going to be explained since there is literally nothing to make a S2 from there. They actually had something really incredible going for an original, and somehow, it fumbles the entire ending like a nervous guy at his first day in the office. Showing Sargon just crying over some broken buildings isn’t going to tell me his motivations. Was it showing he basically gave up on trying to save humanity because he thought it was pointless? Maybe. Was it showing he had enough of it? Maybe. Did he decide to just turn to the dark side and try to destroy families and hurt people instead? Apparently he did, but then why was he trying to “sacrifice” the continent for the greater good? Not only is he just being plain evil for the sake of being evil, he decides to act like a hero because he wants it all to stop, after causing it to be worse himself. Makes no sense whatsoever. And that’s just the villain, the ending itself is lacking so much.We jump to Cossette and Takt on the beach of Ep 12. Somehow the most sense in this episode is there. Plenty of recalls to symbols and lines said at the start of the anime, made me a bit emotional. But, did Takt actually die at the end? Because Destiny, a Musiccart who was explained to be connected and only supported by Takt’s lifeforce, was supposed to disappear once he died. He did die, and then Destiny / Cossette disappeared after coming to complete peace with her love for him and giving him the sweetest kiss of the season. Now, even after a confusing ending like that, that was probably the only “good” scene in the episode if you separate it from everything else and it hadn’t been rushed like it is now.On the topic of being rushed, the ending was by far clearly rushed. This anime had the potential of going to a 2 cour (24 episodes), making the plot super deep and invested rather than making it a quick 10 minute-shove-it-down-your-throat-villain arc. They could’ve made it about them going to space, going underground to destroy a mother hive of them, finding out the cause behind them all, etc. But no, they decided to throw this dainty, lack of logic ending at us, with no compatible rationality. Which is honestly more disappointing than it is painful.Plot Error:I also want to add on to this confusing ending, one of the main plot points that threw me off was the fact that D2’s were still around, but also not. It’s confusing because multiple times in the anime they seemed have stated that “D2’s are long gone here and they don’t exist anymore after 2 years ago.” But then it immediately cuts to D2’s appearing for some reason, and the only explanation made clear is that Schindler is behind it, and then Sagan is too. But- the D2’s were happening all over the country of USA. So, more confusingly, do they actually exist any more, or is Schindler and Sagan these godlike beings capable of moving at sonic speed across the country to summon the D2’s? Are all the D2’s actually dead or buried underground and they’re bringing them back to certain locations through using the Diviner? It’s truly confusing what they’re trying to picture here. Do the D2’s even remotely exist, or is Sagan making them all himself? Since, as a plot point, it would’ve been PERFECT if they had it as if Sagan was an evil mastermind after trying to wipe humanity as they know it using the D2’s. Like it was a whole underground enormous breeding operation.Finished:So. I’m confused. Not completely, but I am confused. The ending is a tad bit fucky wucky. Up to about episode 10, the anime was scoring a high 9 in my books. Dropped to 8.5 in 11, then to a whole 7-6 right off after the end.One main thing, what the fuck was that ending? Seriously.Final Words:I had high hopes and wished for this anime to incredible, yet they somehow bombed this original near masterpiece to the ground. They could’ve had one of the best anime’s of the season but they cut it and burned it alive for the sake of nothing? Laziness? Advertisement towards a gacha game maybe, WHICH, to be honest most people won’t even understand a thing about what the gacha is about or trying to do. Out of the viewer base, you might get maybe 10% max of viewers to play this game as opposed to a possible 40% if they made this anime stick it’s bloody landing.I personally loved a lot of aspects of this anime, but they just threw this anime in the bin when they got to the ending. I’m honestly shocked, it took me 2 days to compile this in my head because it was just shocking that this went down the way it did. So many spectacular things in this anime, so much that could’ve been taken further and beyond. May this anime rest in pieces, as good as it was, it was so close to being one of the greats this year. of a;“So, I’m confused. What the hell did I just watch?”And I wish it wasn’t.{HEAVY SPOILERS}This anime had a lot going for it. The excitement towards the start and ecstatic qualities shining through the eyes of countless watchers everywhere, glowing up and gleaming above and beyond with both music and animation quality. And yet, it mishandled itself like a nervous robbery in the middle of a parade. They fumbled the weapon and tossed it in the air, only to catch it by the front of the firearm and not the handle. They’re lucky they didn’t completely shoot themselves. So, what went wrong? Let’s start first with a small summary and characters.A Short Summary & Characters:In this anime we have our main 3 characters, Takt, Cossette and Anna. Takt is introduced as someone who consistently loves playing on the piano and acts like a social outcast to all. Then we have Cossette who later dies and becomes Destiny, is a loving sister of Anna who likes to try and help get (and mainly annoy) Takt out of the house to show off his piano skills. Anna on the other hand is the mother of the bunch, taking care of them both whenever possible. We’re left with this continuous and clear plot line after Destiny’s forthcoming into existence of “We have to get from A-B in order to help Cossett- I mean, Destiny!”. Which by itself, I liked the idea of and sat for the ride.With our overall characters, we have a decent bunch of generic characters. Takt is the edgy kid who lost their parents/ father in a supposedly freak incident where D2’s ended up attacking and Takt himself barely escaped with his own life. In terms of development, he experiences next to nothing in change and only the ability to come to peace?, with the loss of his father and Cossette. Oh and he can also make a song I guess now. As if that was really of any importance considering the story sidelined it towards the end, making him seem as if he’s been the same character the entire goddamn anime.Then we have Anna. What was her point? Being there, existing? She’s a character alright and a decent support/ main for the both of them. Although, I’m concerned as to why she isn’t also a main in MAL as she is there every episode and does have highlights with specifically her constantly. Doesn’t matter. She certainly has more substance than Takt because she has a deep complication within herself with trying to accept Destiny’s transformation from Cossette, and coming to terms with her complete and utter death. Which I liked as a plot point that consistently carried throughout episodes until she finally blew up because she couldn’t handle the guilt of it anymore. THAT was development, but she did barely pass the line with only a single complication and nothing more than being okay with Destiny and loving her for who she was, as her own sister still.Of course, we still have our helpful side characters that I didn’t mind too much, some I did.Titan, Lenny, Sagan, Schindler, Heaven, Hell. (Also Valkyrie.)Lenny, I liked. He was actually surprisingly a good character and I preferred him more of an existence of development in comparison to Takt, because he had an interesting back story. His back story was enveloped and shown off, he revelled in his guilt for Takt’s father’s death, constantly blaming it on himself and swore to protect Takt when the time came. I like how he was a depressed, sad and lonely man who only wanted to help others with music, given back to life by Titan. They were a really nice duo and perfectly fine support characters. Him dying, was not exactly justified in how he went out, but it was sad, it had some connection for me.Heaven and Hell, I couldn’t care less about. They were just annoying Musicarts that broke the law of logic and character rationality a handful of times. They both, apparently came from some gem or something? Story didn’t exactly explain in the end how Sagan got them.Schindler, he was boring and annoying as hell. His purpose was mind numbingly dumb. As surprising as this would actually be possible, hurts, but it goes to show spite doesn’t always win against the one with some handy powers (which I think don’t detract from the story) and a bit of plot power.And oh god, Sagan. I don’t understand the point of this character. Was he supposed to be a villain, or did he know he was being a villain? Did he see himself as a hero? Was he purposely being malicious? I’ll talk about the dumbness of this further down. God, was he a bad a character. Even Takt couldn’t stand him. Self inserted myself inside Takt whenever he was near Sagan, could feel that anger broiling within him.NONETHELESS, there was thankfully positive and actually non-excruciating development with 1 character.Destiny. I think, all the brain power in the development and writing studio only went into her. All of it, 200% of it, bothered putting it all into Destiny.It’s difficult to compile all of this.

This show is no masterpiece, but you'd have to be blind to say the art/animation is bad. There are some genuinely enjoyable characters here that are well written, the fights are dynamic and entertaining, and the soundtrack is incredible.

I believe this show had the potential to be an AOTY contender, bar Odd Taxi. Had it another episode and some directorial changes, it could\'ve seriously given a strong showing (I will touch on this later). Unfortunately, as many have pointed out, it\'s strong introduction from the first few episodes was ultimately plagued by the production limits of being made to advertise a mobile game. I wanted so much for this to be a banger of a show, and unfortunately the ending felt forced and some directorial choices didn\'t match what I thought would...have been more impactful. Don\'t go into this show expecting a masterpiece anime. It isn\'t. Turn your brain off and just enjoy the show.SPOILERS START HEREStory: 6/10The ""story"" for the first 9(-ish? can\'t remember exactly) episodes were honestly pretty good in my opinion. It is more akin to a slice-of-life road trip style with some intermittent fighting scenes. I felt that these two parts were well maintained and separated as to not intrude on each other for these episodes and had reasonable plot elements to explain them. However, as with any slice-of-life component, most of the power is in the character, which I will expand upon more later. As for the last few episodes, the political corruption plot or whatever felt so forced and the motivations unexplained. Schindler was just your typical deluded power tripping guy that you see everywhere and just want to get off your screen, with some god-complex and culling argument that was beyond stupid, and then the actual Head Maestro (forgot his name lol) was a masochist or something? Had we hade more of an opportunity to expand upon his shift in perspective on suffering or whatever, things might have turned out better. This not only allows us as the viewers to not be scratching our heads at this guys maniacal logical jumps but also given the people working on it to really figure out what was going inside this guys head.Art: 9/10Animated by old legends Madhouse and recent legends MAPPA. Not a lot more needs to be said. Smooth dynamic fight animation with strong VFX to back it up, beautifully built towns (when they weren\'t desolated) and atmospheres to accompany the slice-of-life road trip, and sleek character designs. Only reason it\'s not a 10 is because none of these were groundbreakingly good; just very, very good.Sound: 9/10It\'s a show with a music theme. This better be banging, which I think it is. (I may also be biased because I was a classically trained musician). Sound effects across the board were pretty good, besides your generic weird synthesized moans from the D2s. Obviously the strictly ""classical"" (in quotes because I believe there was some blues and jazz music which technically doesn\'t go under the belt of classical music) performances were good. Upon reading some reviews (mostly on here and on reddit), I was honestly baffled that some people thought that there wasn\'t ""enough classical music"" for a show about music when most of the music used was actually just classical music. Albeit, not ones that everyone and their dog would know like Beethoven\'s 5th or that one Bach Cello Partita that Yo-Yo Ma is famous for, but still classical giants nonetheless (looking at you Mahler and Requiem). OP is straight banging, and I personally wasn\'t a fan of the ED, but that\'s whatever.Character: 8/10Lenny + Titan. Great. Nothing more to say if you\'ve watched it. Energetic, cheerful fun duo with strong convictions that show.Now, contrary to most people, I was actually pretty invested in the main duo. Destiny was trying to learn what she meant to the people around her, since she was aware of the death of a Cosette, but never what Cosette meant to Takt and Anna and the shoes she wanted to try and fill. Slowly through her interactions with the locals and helping them out, she was seen as a full person by them rather than just a tool. Takt, a prodigal pianist, only became a prodigy because he used music as a coping mechanism for his father\'s death. He claimed that music was the light to people\'s hearts (or something along those lines), but he never fully grasped what it meant to be the light in people\'s hearts. The death of Cosette was a hard reset on this understanding, and throughout his travels, he slowly learned what it meant again. I felt Anna was the ""blandest."" Just a big sister figure trying to keep everyone together. They tried to show a bit of character with the whole spiel about her still denying Cosette\'s death, but I felt there wasn\'t enough time to really have that pack a punch. There definitely was potential, I\'m just not sure how to bring it out. And you know how I feel about the ""villains."" Bruh. I also didn\'t mind the sudden Destiny confession. Cliche? Probably, but it the following sequence (almost) destroyed me.Enjoyment: 8/10I thoroughly enjoyed it, except for like the last 2 episodes (except for Titan\'s performance. you know which one) and anytime Schindler was on screen. For reasons stated above.Overall: 7/10Now to wrap up this review, I wanted to address my bold claim about how this show could\'ve been AOTY-contending. In my opinion, the weakest points were the villains and some directorial choices that I believe were due to the restrictions of being a prequel to a game.I mentioned before that a bit more spotlight on the villains would\'ve allowed the people working to actually figure out some decent motivation for the villains and give us time to understand it as well, instead of being your cringeworthy deluded villain.As for the directorial choices, my main gripe was pretty much everything that happened after Destiny\'s sacrifice. Yeah, her confession was pretty cliche and maybe felt strange, but I thought it was a good way to return to the point about the power of music being someone\'s light. Had there been more emphasis on Takt\'s effect on Destiny and a lingering shot to really let the sacrifice sink on would really bring out the emotion of it. On top of that, again although super cliche, a scene where we finally get Tatk\'s finish composition would be a nice homage back to who he wanted to compose it for, originally Cosette but also probably Destiny later on. Instead, they had to find some convoluted way to tie it into the game\'s story, where I\'m pretty sure Anna is like the successor to Destiny\'s power through that USB drive or something, and we don\'t get to hear his full composition because he\'s still in a coma or something. And before you say ""but a full original composition would be too much work / too expensive!"" I mean, they got a MAPPA x Madhouse collab, backed by Bandai Namco. They got the money, and stuff like this isn\'t unheard of (Hibike! Euphonium being my go-to example).CLOSING THOUGHTSPain. I wanted this to be so good. But it wasn\'t. Pain. have been more impactful. Don\'t go into this show expecting a masterpiece anime. It isn\'t. Turn your brain off and just enjoy the show.SPOILERS START HEREStory: 6/10The ""story"" for the first 9(-ish? can\'t remember exactly) episodes were honestly pretty good in my opinion. It is more akin to a slice-of-life road trip style with some intermittent fighting scenes. I felt that these two parts were well maintained and separated as to not intrude on each other for these episodes and had reasonable plot elements to explain them. However, as with any slice-of-life component, most of the power is in the character, which I will expand upon more later. As for the last few episodes, the political corruption plot or whatever felt so forced and the motivations unexplained. Schindler was just your typical deluded power tripping guy that you see everywhere and just want to get off your screen, with some god-complex and culling argument that was beyond stupid, and then the actual Head Maestro (forgot his name lol) was a masochist or something? Had we hade more of an opportunity to expand upon his shift in perspective on suffering or whatever, things might have turned out better. This not only allows us as the viewers to not be scratching our heads at this guys maniacal logical jumps but also given the people working on it to really figure out what was going inside this guys head.Art: 9/10Animated by old legends Madhouse and recent legends MAPPA.

It seems that, what this anime wanted to do, was give us a taste of the mobile game that is to come. That being, leaving us with an open ending and quite some confusion about what happened in the last episode.Since the start I\'ve really loved this anime. The animation is gorgeous, and so is its soundtrack. I got quite attached to the characters, and even though the story may be a bit cliché and...predictable at times, I don\'t find that to be an issue if done well. I felt like this was the case for Takt Op. Destiny, and looked forward to the new episodes every week. The journey was truly amazing in my opinion, and I would overall rate it 8/10.However, the last episode felt quite underwhelming. A lot of build up happened that made me a little nervous for this final episode, but it wasn\'t as powerful as I\'d hoped it to be, and I think that is why a lot of people are upset now. It\'s not that the ending is *bad*, in my opinion, just... the journey itself held a lot more power. Many things near the end seemed rather vague and rushed, and some things actually took rather *unexpected* turns, I guess as to say ""learn more about this in our mobile game"". This part I\'m a little conflicted about, since I loved every minute of this show, yet the ending leaves you with a feeling of ""wait... what just happened?"". That\'s why I\'m ""only"" rating this show 7/10 instead of 8/10.That being said, I still think it\'s truly worth watching. I don\'t know how to explain, but it felt somewhat soothing.

The art and animation accompanied by the beautiful score gave a sense of magnitude and epicness that felt good while watching.But, sadly, all of that was thrown out of the window in the last four episodes, the story started to loose its sense, doing random stuff that felt unnatural and rushed. The last episode is the worst in that aspect, giving an ending that didn't leave a...sense of closure, but of course, that's intentional, because all of this effort was just to sell a shitty mobile game in the end, they could've done so many different things to give us a good ending and still sell their game, but it felt like they were running out of ideas, time and money by the end.Overall, this anime is a good watch, but don't come crying after the last episodes leave a bad taste in your mouth.

The first episodes, specially Anna and Takt grief towards Cosette's fate really pulled the strings of my heart.

This is unsatisfactory work.I expect that MAPPA and MADHOUSE can do better, but no, both sides have retained their strength.(It’s never been a well-known and interesting directors such as Ajiang Supervisor and Kunihiko Kihara. From the moment he didn’t use his full strength, it may be that the main strength was all concentrated on ""chain saw man"".)As in the previous analysis, ""Itoo Yuuki"" did a good job in daily life and play, but the performance of the process was really boring. The more interesting scenes are 1, 2, 9, 10 (it’s true that there are six...episodes in the middle. Boring storyboard). Other episodes also have some excellent performances, but there is no amount of information, and it tastes like chewing wax.The character depiction of Lenny is very good, and Takt\'s arc can be better on the spiritual level, just like Cosette. However, all other characters are under-described, making it unclear to the motives and incentives of the incident.For example, Anna in Chapter 11, what the kiss is, is too far from the original description, I personally think that it would be better to change it to something like holding a man in his arms.The plot was forced to fit the beginning of the mobile game and couldn\'t let go. The problem is that there is a kind of forced feeling, which makes people look bad.In addition, ""Music"" has nothing to do with settings at all. I think this kind of ""New York Symphonica"" setting is good for mobile game setting.

the 18 minute mark.And then the last 5 ep rushed so hard that if it can be measure,it would be 10 times faster than light,shit just got brought up and forget,random plot point get mention even though it never happened and shit happen a pace that the last few ep of Darling in the Franxx would look like child playsArt:8Charcter design ok,nothing unique,the chracter design doesnt look very stand out

progressed, Takt Op felt like slowing down with not much story to tell.There were 2 things worth a praise in this 12 episode musical original anime. The first is the animation done by Madhouse and MAPPA which is undoubtedly one of the best animation of 2021. The second is the amazing soundtrack with catchy OP and ED as well.Takt Op is an example of what looks good outside isn't always the same on the inside....The strength of animation was dragged down by inconsistent story and an even more disappointing finale.

I would also say the plot hits the expected story beats, so there isn't really any major twists...that I was like woah at.Art 8I thought Mappa and Madhouse made the designs of the Musicarts really eye catching, they stand out against the background. I also thought the D2s had very eye catching animation as well. I thought the fight scenes felt smooth and entertaining. So overall I enjoyed the art.Sound 8Given that the anime has music as a focal point, I found the music thoroughly enjoyable. I really really enjoyed the OP and had it on replay for a bit, the ED is nice and a smooth transition out of the show.Character 6Regarding characters, I wasn't necessarily impressed or anything, the characters were pretty standard, and their progress seemed pretty bare minimum. Again hit the beats it needed to (no pun intended) I found that some of the interactions between two of the main characters felt overly repetitive and grating, and actively took away from the character's likability.  I also think the antagonist was a bit too predictable, and was a bit wasted in their motivations.Conclusion 7At the end of the day, I felt this anime was decent. I really enjoyed the animation and the OST, again that OP really just hit the spot, and I always was excited to hear it each episode and let it play through instead of skipping like I do for so many other anime.

The production members really need to put more effort in the storyboard becausethe show felt more like a gameplay/walkthrough video so I do not feel excited about playing the game when it is released if it is going to give you the same experience (the 1st episode totally felt like tutorial stage).There is a lot of characters in the anime (I assume the game going to be a gacha) but felt lacking in diversity of characters because Takt and...Destiny keep getting the spotlight throughout the show.Conclusion : Great animation but needs more effort in storyboard and more character introductions Destiny keep getting the spotlight throughout the show.Conclusion : Great animation but needs more effort in storyboard and more character introductions', 'No spoilers , It would have been 10/10 if not for that ending which leaves us confused and honestly ruins a lot of the enjoyment, they should have ended it at 20:14 of the last episode and even that would be a more satisfactory ending that whatever the hell they did, apart from that its actually very good and would recommend, but stop at 20:14 of the last episode in case you want to actually enjoy this show and dont want the horrible confused feeling after that, and I just came to know they made this to promote a game, with that ending you can...consider this one of the worst promotion for a game which will deter potential players rather than attract them. consider this one of the worst promotion for a game which will deter potential players rather than attract them.', ""Probably the best animation I think I've seen from any anime, pretty interesting premise, but just falls flat.It's like they had a story they wanted to tell but just gave up midway.

For me, it speaks to how a concept can grow as you watch it. To be honest, I wasn’t a fan initially, which appears to be a common sentiment many other preliminary writers among the reviews share. I’m not sure if the slow upstart and the brisk dialogue really turned people off, but I enjoyed it enough to at least see it through….and am so glad I did. Many other series follow a similar blueprint, Fate Last Encore comes to mind, and seemingly start out just...as slow and methodical. Same could be said for other similar action series, like Vivy, Guilty Crown, Code Geass, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if the animators or creators also worked on the aforementioned series somehow. Ultimately its story unfolds in a similar way, but aside from that, Takt Op is pretty unique and felt emotional all the way through, while keeping the action refreshingly fun. There aren’t any list toppers for best fight scenes in my opinion, and yet I was fully engaged every encounter.What made the series emotional was its musical element. Series like Kono Oto Tomare and Your Lie In April hit these emotional notes with the concept of music flawlessly! With a short amount of time to tell the story, Takt Op was able to pull me in to each character from the first episode. Destiny may be an exception, however, that changes as the series evolves. Takt is a similar story, hardly lovable from the get go. Both are characters you have to get to know and warm up to, but it’s worth it by the end. Some dialogue may seem unnecessary or overkill, yet they establish themselves well.Another great aspect of the series is the art and design, it’s an easy 10 for me. The environment, which is set in the one and only USA, is familiar while feeling otherwordly. The characters designs couldn’t have been done better either. Each music art, beings like Destiny that protect humanity against the aliens, is an individual in the truest sense. There isn’t one art that is identical to another. Each has her own sound, design, personality, and themed piece of music. This makes for enjoyable battles and conversations, and unique approaches to their relationships with their maestros.Lastly, the dedication to telling a particular story is admirable, rather than a jambalaya of multiple themes. In my opinion, it was a bold approach to not try and appeal to the broader audience. the story is as if Your Lie in April and fate Last encore merged, making a thoughtful appeal to music and action lovers alike. The surface level animosity generates a larger feeling of comfortability when characters do come together and agree. The villains even have some likable traits. I enjoyed the story personally, it just took a bit to heat up.Ultimately I get why someone may not like Takt Op Destiny. If shows like Fate or Guilty Crown aren’t your thing then this probably won’t be either. It’s very methodical, not constant action or romance.

Destiny brings to mind Re:Creators ... beautifully done, great sound with interesting characters.  Unfortunately, for me, the ""gaming"" roots of our story is currently keeping it from doing...more with our characters.If there is a second season, and I sure hope there is, I would like to see the following:1) more story about why girls would choose to become musicarts;2) what are the interior struggles that confront Cosette/Destiny related to split being;3) what does Sagan gain by his behavior;4) what is the bonding between conductor and musicart and why is it importantJMHO more with our characters.If there is a second season, and I sure hope there is, I would like to see the following:1) more story about why girls would choose to become musicarts;2) what are the interior struggles that confront Cosette/Destiny related to split being;3) what does Sagan gain by his behavior;4) what is the bonding between conductor and musicart and why is it importantJMHO', ""Everything about this anime was amazing except the plot, story and execution itself. This anime was meant to be an expensive ad for a game. To be very honest, I don't mind whatever the gaming company was doing to advertise their game, but come on. The execution wasn't very good. We never got the hang of this universe the characters live in. Most of the characters just died without having any explanation or meaning behind their deaths. There was no story given to the villains. And the fillers episode were too much. I think it would've been better if it was longer than 12 episodes...but now that everyone learnt the motive behind the anime. I think not. Nevertheless, the plot is amazing. It's not a unique concept (of people turning into weapons) but I still liked it. The visuals are impressive and the character's backstories too. This anime was almost like a trailer with little to no explanation. They expected us to play the game in hopes of knowing more about the anime but this thing just made people mad.

The ending of this story is also very bad.

Every battle scene is beautifully presented with stunning graphics.

I knew this before watching, and yet Mappa and Madhouse are two well-renowned studios, so I knew the animation would be top notch. What I mistakenly thought, however, was that there would be at least SOME semblance of a story, some reason to care aside from the pretty frames. And boy was I wrong.The writers for this show did not...even remotely try to create a cohesive plot, and it shows. The plot holes in this show...God I lost count. What the hell is a D2? Why do Musicarts exist? What is the connection to music, and why do sentient beings named MUSICarts have really nothing to do with music at all? The D2s are the most non-threatening beast-like incarnations that I have ever witnessed in a battle anime. I never once believed that the characters were in any danger facing these creatures, as they were the furthest thing from threatening. The Symphonica...where are they through the entire show? The final battle shows so many conductor-less Musicarts that we meet for the very first time, all who have unique looking abilities that would have been so cool to learn about. What is the purpose of conductors? Take is the only conductor who ever physically fights, where he displays ass-pull speed and power, which is never even remotely explained, considering no other conductor ever does something similar. Destiny and Titan constantly fight by themselves (Titan fights just as well after her conductor literally dies) but Destiny fades away even though Take is technically still alive? What kind of wishy-washy writing is that?Don\'t even get me started on the villains. You have Schindler, who falls into the same useless conductor category as Takt when it comes to controlling his Musicart Hell, who turns out to not even be his Musicart. He summons D2s just to wipe out the poor and less fortunate, feeling as though the world needs less bottom-feeder people in order to rebuild...or at least that\'s what I surmised, no ambitions of any character have any substance at all in this show. At least Schindler had some ambition, because the ""big bad"" Symphonica leader Sagan is a complete waste of space. He is the embodiment of evil for the sake of evil, which the writers try to add development in the final episode by giving us some bs sob story about his love for the world. It\'s a villain with zero motives, who is given zero screen time, who the viewer gives zero shits about, and the writers try to cram some emotional background into the final 10 minutes of the show. Really, really solid storytelling.The character development in this show is horrible, and practically non-existent. I wanted to like Takt, and to be fair, I kind of did in the beginning of the show. Until he truly showcases how flat his character is. The only time he shines as a character is when talking about what music means to him, which is well fleshed out in some scenes, but becomes extremely annoying in others, as it is all he talks about. He has such a tragic past with the death of his father that is mentioned a lot but barely touched upon aside from maybe an episode and a half. The show tries to get you to care about Cosette, but aside from the exposition dump in the beginning, she is no more than a memory. Destiny has a very flat personality and only speaks about fighting D2s and eating sweets. Anna could have been a decent character, but she is relatively useless in a combat-focused show, and her grieving of her dead sister is often pushed aside and rarely explored. There is not one single well-utilized and developed character in this show. There were plenty that had potential (Lenny, Anna, even Takt) but they all end up either one-dimensional or criminally underutilized. Some ""mentor"" Lenny is for Takt when they only spend time together in like three episodes.I don\'t want to write too much about the ending, because I don\'t want to make this review more spoiler heavy than it already is, but I will say that the ending is the pinnacle of everything wrong with the show. The big bad is defeated in a moment where the show tries to make you feel sympathy for him, despite never even trying to develop his character and that character\'s feelings, all the D2s seemingly vanish along with the mysterious crystals which are never explained, and Takt and Destiny...end up on a beach? It is here that Takt and destiny have an extremely bland conversation, in which Takt (in typical fashion) insults Destiny multiple times before ""taking a nap."" Destiny proceeds to KISS HIM, and declare her love for him before vanishing (for no good or explained reason I may add!!). Sure they had some nice moments together, but romantic feelings were not really explored that much between the two besides maybe a forced episode when they first get to New York. The love confession feels so arbitrary, put there to tug at your heart strings but it falls completely flat when you feel no real connection between Takt and Destiny romantically. Jesus, the random ass kiss that Anna gives Takt the episode before IN FRONT OF Destiny makes more sense than this to me. At least Anna seems to give a shit about him outside of combat. It just doesn\'t make any sense to me, which maybe it would have if the anime told a story in which their relationship developed, but this felt so forced for me.There is not much for me to say about the art and animation that I didn\'t already expect. Fight scenes were animated briskly and fluidly, and the visuals were very appealing to me. The OP and ED were enjoyable, particularly the OP. The OSTs, for an anime based around music, kind of fell flat and got stale for me, but overall the sound was decent. Character designs were also quite good, although I wish they utilized the cool designs of the unnamed Musicarts we see in the final episodes a lot more. But none of these things save Takt Op Destiny.I wanted to love this anime. I wanted it to be good, and I wanted to really enjoy it. When I first started watching, I looked forward to it every Tuesday. By the end, it felt like more of a chore to watch each new episode. A 6 for entertainment is actually quite generous, with the battle scenes and animation really saving the overall score from dipping insanely low. The story, Musicarts, D2s, the Symphonica, the unique conductors... this anime had so much freaking potential, and had two great studios at its disposal to be one of the best anime of the season. It may, instead, be one of the most disappointing. Do yourself a favor, and watch the battle scenes on Youtube or something. Trust me, you aren\'t missing anything important in the story department.

Overall: 5.4/10', ""Well this is my first review so it might not be that good , also considering i am new in this anime community . I have not seen a large amount of anime but still i would like to tell u all the reason i liked this anime so much . Coming to the first point :1) Made from game - Many people were saying this anime is not at all a good anime considering it is made from a game and not manga. Well I want to say many anime made for promoting games do not consider the story as their purpose but instead...promoting the game becomes their main purpose . Takt op destiny is not of course made for promoting but to tell the backstory of the game . Mappa and Madhouse did not compromise in the animation style and this did not feel like a anime made for promoting a game . DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT ELSE ARE SAYING , TRY IT YOURSELF AND THEN JUDGE2) Sound tracks - I mainly like anime with music and this anime gave many soundtracks which were unknown to me so thats another reason. This point is somewhat lame but as a musician myself i liked this a lot .3)Characters - i liked the characters of Takt and Destiny a lot because of the bond they developed during the hard times of fighting D2s and facing other villans . Lenny and Takt's father were also very motivating to Takt which gave him more confidence to fight the hardest battle of his life along with Destiny . Cosette also played a huge role in Takt's life and the time they were playing the piano it was so wonderful I  cannot explain . I think it was because of both Cosette and Destiny that Takt learned that Music was still alive and he could only save it4) Last point and rating - I think it might be somewhat better if they included some other points like how musicart are made in the Symphonica , the history of the D2s etc . As these points are missing i have to rate this anime a 9 because without these points the story somewhat becomes a little confusing .STILL I WILL TELL U TO GIVE IT A TRY promoting the game becomes their main purpose . Takt op destiny is not of course made for promoting but to tell the backstory of the game .

A cheap way to involve the romance in the charactization is the excuses of this borderline plot that would be used terribly.

Takt at the beginning is very shut-in, hates almost everything because of his past trauma but a girl named Cosette helps him come out of his shell at least a little. But as soon as he starts to open up tragedy strikes again and he loses Cosette in a tragic accident due to the monster D2  afterwards he slowly deals with her death and relearns why he loves music, it's not just a way to release his anger but something he genuinely loves, he also starts opening up to others again.Destiny is an almost robotic person whose sole purpose is fighting the monsters of the world and eating sweats along the way. she pays little attention to property damage or physical damage done to civilians. But after travelling with Takt and their friend Anna and interacting with others she starts to learn that there is more to life than just killing monsters.Enjoyment(8): Overall I think this anime is pretty good and I dislike all the hate because from the first 4 episodes the animation is carrying the anime, while it is true that the animation is probably the biggest part of the anime people wanna downplay the overall quality of this anime even though there isn't a main source material considering that this was all made about a game.Overall(8): Overall I give this anime a 8 I understand that some will have it lower but honestly if you have it lower than 5 I'm a little considered about how you enjoy almost anything other than the very peek of fiction lol. always amazing and usually enhances a scene, there are very rarely scenes where the music slightly breaks the immersion of a scene but those are few and far between.Characters (7): I personally see a good amount of character development in Takt and destiny.

I liked the the anime in the beginning, hoped that it will get even better as the story progresses, the animation is really amazing and the plot was decent enough to build a good show around it. Don't think the character development was bad or anything (apart from Sagan). In short it should have been a good watch...The show received a lot of hate from the start, but in my opinion the initial reaction wasn't really fair... It started off well and the ratings it received was justifiable atleast till the 7th or 8th episode. But in the end...the last few episodes were an unbearable watch. It almost felt like they just wanted to do away with the show as early as possible. Story progressed at a horrible pace ... overpowered Destiny all of a sudden,a stupid backstory of Sagan and lot more incomprehensible stuff.The anime was supposed portray the power of music (something like that ig), but the music wasn't really captivating or anything to me...the opening was good though.Few moments between Takt, Destiny &  Anna were enjoyable, and few action sequences were really good as well ( but that's not really about writing, that's just good animation).Anyway, I don't really know whether this show will get another season or not ( as it is not a manga adaptation so there is no readymade story to go forward with) ...but if it gets then they need to hire some capable writers if they really want to make this show watchable. the last few episodes were an unbearable watch.

I was a bit skeptical because I've seen a lot of poor reviews for it, but it was actually pretty enjoyable in my opinion.The story is interesting.

I read that it sets up the story for a game, but I don't know anything about the game.The characters really grew on me quickly. The animation was fine. Not great but not terrible either.Overall, if you're looking for an anime that is relatively short, but still...has a pretty touching story, I think this would be a good choice. has a pretty touching story, I think this would be a good choice."", ""5.5 / 10I had my expectations for the first chapter of the anime since it was very interesting but in the end it left a bad taste in my mouth, I am not saying that it is bad, that is to say clearly there are things that are bad but it also has its positive things and if not For the few scheduled episodes this anime could have been much better but in the end no, if we just see it, the anime is entertaining and interesting but if we go a little deeper there is the problem.The characters are very underdeveloped except for...Takt, Destiny and maybe Lenny and these are not wonderfully developed but in general at least decent rest no one gives more, they are all decent or mediocre although I really do not think that any It is really bad since I do not see them so flat since they showed some personality but nothing more than that.The protagonist is fine, he is one step down from decent but remains in what I consider good, is well built and does not feel flat, he also shows some personality so it does not seem flat to me adding some human traits that are not the great thing but something is something, the only bad thing I saw was why the guy suddenly in his first match against felix became strong out of nowhere, I assumed that they would explain that force later but no, nothing, but in general it's fine since that power doesn't ruin the plot so it's bad but not so bad.The production is good but the truth is that it does not seem spectacular to me, that is, I have seen much, much better work but I am not saying that the production is bad, I am just saying that it is good but it is not a great thing, the animation itself It seems very good to me and the detail of the drawing seems good to me but no more than ay, the opening is not bad but it is not something spectacular like the ending.the antagonists are not a big deal but at least they fulfill their function, I don't have much to say here.And now the end, in my opinion, is bad because of the incoherence in different points, the first is Anna's kiss to Takt which seemed stupid and incredibly forced since from the first chapter to the tenth we noticed that Anna sees Takt alone Like a friend or at most a brother or something like that, his love was more than all brotherly and not romantic, for which that kiss is totally absurd, taken out of nowhere only by the fanservice, there are also more inconsistencies such as the crystals that appear in the Chapter 11 that nobody knows what they are and even though the series is over we were never told what they are or what they were doing, they took them out of nowhere just to give a power up to the final villain because they did not know what to do with him, the batsalla The fusion of Inferno and Heaven is very bad since we were never told anything about mergers or in reference to that but suddenly at that moment not only does it exist but they can also do it and in the end Destiny draws power out of nowhere and ends up defeating the fusion because without that power up of Detiny she died so they put a script on her to win and in the end I don't know why or how but what destiny turns into a stone or whatever that is illogical and meaningless, never We were told nothing about that or an indication of at least why and how he did it, everything is so poorly explained that in the end it is not clear if Destiny died or what but anyway.In conclusion the anime had potential and surely it would have been at least good to have had more chapters but apparently they did not take that into account and that is why the final chapters are so mediocre and super rushed but at least before it was interesting at least before the battle against Felix was interesting and if he maintained that rhythm it could become good but no, in short, in conclusion it seemed decent to me since it continues to have its good points, I understand that it is also partly a propaganda for a game but if we take it as a premise of the main story oh yes I say this is a lot but what I said Takt, Destiny and maybe Lenny and these are not wonderfully developed but in general at least decent rest no one gives more, they are all decent or mediocre although I really do not think that any It is really bad since I do not see them so flat since they showed some personality but nothing more than that.The protagonist is

seems very good to me and the detail of the drawing seems good to me but no more than ay, the opening is not bad but it is not something spectacular like the ending.the antagonists are not a big deal but at least they fulfill their function, I don't have much to say here.And now the end, in my opinion, is bad because of the incoherence in different points, the first is Anna's kiss to Takt which seemed stupid and incredibly forced since from the first chapter to the tenth we noticed that Anna sees Takt alone Like a friend or at most a brother or something like that, his love was more than all brotherly and not romantic, for which that kiss is totally absurd, taken out of nowhere only by the fanservice, there are also more inconsistencies such as the crystals that appear in the Chapter 11 that nobody knows what they are and even though the series is over we were never told what they are or what they were doing, they took them out of nowhere just to give a power up to the final villain because they did not know what to do with him, the batsalla The fusion of Inferno and Heaven is very bad since we were never told anything about mergers or in reference to that but suddenly at that moment not only does it exist but they can also do it and in the end Destiny draws power out of nowhere and ends up defeating the fusion because without that power up of Detiny she died so they put a script on her to win and in the end I don't know why or how but what destiny turns into a stone or whatever that is illogical and meaningless, never We were told nothing about that or an indication of at least why and how he did it, everything is so poorly explained that in the end it is not clear if Destiny died or what but anyway.In conclusion the anime had potential and surely it would have been at least good to have had more chapters but apparently they did not take that into account and that is why the final chapters are so mediocre and super rushed but at least before it was interesting at least before the battle against Felix was interesting and if he maintained that rhythm it could become good but no, in short, in conclusion it seemed decent to me since it continues to have its good points, I understand that it is also partly a propaganda for a game but if we take it as a premise of the main story oh yes I say this is a lot but what I said""]"
Aoharu x Kikanjuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30205/Aoharu_x_Kikanjuu,"['I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen an anime with as many blatant plot holes and as much inconsistent writing as Aoharu x Kikanjuu. Now that doesn\'t mean it\'s the worst anime ever made (it definitely isn\'t), but it has a huge amount of wasted potential due to its weak story, horrendous characterization, and the fact that the author is seemingly completely clueless about how airsoft works.Initially the anime feels like something quite similar to Ouran Koukou Host Club as the protagonist is a girl (Tachibana Hotaru) crossdressing as a boy who ends up becoming indebted to a popular guy (Matsuoka Masamune) who works as a...host in the city. This notion is then quickly proven highly inaccurate as Matsuoka forces Tachibana to come join his ""survival game"" team and participate alongside him in an upcoming tournament. I say survival game, but that in and of itself is completely wrong; it\'s actually just competitive airsoft that we\'re talking about here. I don\'t know if it\'s a mistranslation or whatnot but either way if you\'re expecting some sort of thrilling life-or-death drama here you\'re going to be sorely disappointed because there is absolutely nothing lethal in this anime.So what exactly is it that makes Aoharu x Kikanjuu such a trainwreck then? Well there are many reasons but they can be roughly divided into three categories:1. The plotThe writing for this anime is bad. Terribly bad. The games themselves make no sense whatsoever (more on that later), but even ignoring that part the overall plot progression is simply all over the place. Initially, Tachibana thinks the airsoft games are childish and stupid. Then after playing *one* game she suddenly thinks they\'re the greatest thing ever and has become a full-blown addict. Sounds believable, right? Oh and you know how she originally joined the team because of a debt? Yeah that plot element is just handwaved away in a split second as if it never existed to begin with, completely ruining the entire premise of the story, yet it just keeps on going as if nothing ever happened.There are also all kinds of forced drama which feel completely unnecessary, totally out of place, and oftentimes insanely predictable. Time skips are pulled haphazardly which renders the pacing very inconsistent, and above all, there seems to be no semblance of coherence in the writing whatsoever. Let me just describe a certain scene from episode two here in order to make an example (minor spoilers I guess, but certainly nothing important): there is a segment where Tachibana is surrounded by her three opponents at only a few meters range. Then in the next second they\'re suddenly all standing on the same side of her, yelling ""corner her!"", as if implying that they hadn\'t already cornered her a second ago? Immediately thereafter, Tachibana\'s teammate suddenly appears next to her and they have a loud conversation for about two minutes. What happened to their opponents? They were standing right next to her just a moment ago! How could they possibly have lost track of her, let alone be outside hearing range? I mean seriously just what happened here, did the producers accidentally put the scenes in the wrong order or something? These kinds of elementary mistakes should be impossible to make. It\'s so blatantly illogical it feels like it was written by a 12-year-old.2. The charactersAoharu x Kikanjuu is pretty blatant fujoshi bait; that much is obvious from the get-go, but even so the character cast is still a disaster. First of all, we have our main character Tachibana Hotaru. Mother of god is she annoying. About once per minute she has to remind the audience that despite her appearance she\'s actually a girl, she\'s always referring to herself in third-person and her sole personality trait is seemingly that she firmly believes in ""justice"". Yeah justice; hence why she goes completely berserk when playing airsoft and behaves like an uncontrollable animal; sounds just like a knight in shining armor, doesn\'t she? In the first place what does justice have to do with playing games? Are your opponents supposed to be ""evil"" just because they\'re playing or something? In that case Tachibana is obviously equally guilty of that crime. There\'s also the obnoxious truth that despite being a really bad player, Tachibana always ends up spontaneously gaining super powers whenever the plot feels like it, solely for the sake of convenience. The anime never shuts up about her so-called ""bloodlust"" which is the ability she uses to magically paralyze her opponents just by looking at them and make them cower in fear, as well as enable her to run faster than a speeding bullet. But there\'s nothing supernatural about this or anything, it\'s just her ""talent"".As far as the rest of the characters in this show goes (essentially all male), they\'re basically all cardboard cutouts as well. Matsuoka is the typical noble bishounen with a ""dark past"", Yukimura (the third team member) is quiet, depressive and honestly kind of creepy, and then there\'s the overly-generic villain Midori who\'s just an all-round douchebag that enjoys hurting people. They all feel like they\'re solely there for the sake of being there, but without much thought put into it whatsoever. And the way they behave towards each other is completely unnatural. At one moment Matsuoka is almost pissing himself with fear just by looking at Midori, and in the next he\'s being super cocky and confident. Again, consistency please. There are also quite a lot of soft Yaoi vibes every here and there throughout the show, which I guess is to be expected given the fujoshi pandering but it still feels very out of place story-wise.3. The ""survival games""Everything I\'ve stated above is certainly problematic, but without a doubt the nail in the coffin is the execution of the so-called ""survival games"" themselves. Honestly I don\'t think the author has ever played airsoft before, or even studied up on how it works properly. I\'m going to be very direct here: airsoft is primarily a game of tactics, stealth and precision. It\'s a game where you attempt to predict the opposing team\'s moves ahead of time, try to hide and ambush them by sniping them from the shadows, etcetera. I don\'t even think you need to have played the game before to understand that much. So what does Aoharu x Kikanjuu do then? Well... it basically treats airsoft like a battle shounen.Do you know what you do with guns? You shoot each other with them. Yeah right, not in this anime; here you avoid using them, charge straight down the barrel of your opponent\'s rifle, *paralyze* him with fear just by looking at him and thus render him incapable of pulling the trigger, then run into melee range and finally bludgeon the guy by using your submachine gun as a club. Excellent work Tachibana; you were even able to outplay the guy using a freaking minigun by using this incredible strategy! Truly a job well done. While we\'re at it we should start teaching the military that there\'s no need for guerilla warfare any longer; simply running up to your enemies and punching them in the face sounds like a much more humane way of fighting.Of course that\'s far from the only problem when it comes to how these games play out. People refusing to shoot when they have their opponents in their sights for no apparent reason, people having to hold cliché speeches and punchlines before pulling the trigger, people revealing their positions completely needlessly in order to have a ""fair fight"" with their opponent instead of just shooting them from cover, etcetera. The list goes on. Even more disturbing though, these games are seemingly completely unmonitored. Despite playing in a high stakes tournament, there are no cameras or anything inside the woodland battlefield. In other words there\'s barely even any point of having rules for this game; you could basically cheat as much as you\'d like and no one will ever know. But I guess that\'s just another plot hole which we shouldn\'t think too much about and instead just pretend it isn\'t there.So with all that said, is there anything good thing about this show? Well if there\'s one thing it\'d be that despite everything it at least isn\'t boring. Incredibly annoying yes, but twenty minutes of Aoharu x Kikanjuu per week was not really a problem. It\'s kind of like watching a very low level football game; even if the content itself is lackluster, you can still probably find some enjoyment in it just by being a football fan to begin with. In the same way, despite the cringeworthy execution, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is so far the only anime I\'ve ever seen about airsoft, so it gets some plus points for originality and for having a fun concept at least. But even with that taken into account it doesn\'t change the fact that it is still a very sub-par anime at best, and not one I would particularly recommend to very many people. host in the city.

This anime has personally exceeded my original expectations since the first episode. Just a quick warning this is my first review.Story: 9/10The story mainly follows Tachibana Hotaru's point of view. The episodes have a smooth flow in them, it always kept me on my toes(engaged) and loves making me scream at the screen for another episode. As everyone might know this anime is being compared to 'Ouran High School Host Club’ and I have to say I agree. Aoharu x Kikanjuu really does have...that Ouran feel but since there two complete different anime’s don’t expect the same storyline. The storyline is very easy to understand because as the story begins to unravel you can tell where the story will be headed, it was very predictable at times but even so it was still very enjoyable to watch. There is a bit of a rush in some episodes but the story really recovers from those rushes. As you all know this anime is also a comedy anime, this scenes always seemed to make me laugh a lot and it really made my day a whole better.Art: 9/10The animation is very not that realistic but it very good to the extent that you can see everything clearly. The animation is unique because it really achieve certain moods throughout the series. I personally think this is the animation that would be the best for Aoharu x Kikanjuu i wouldn’t ask for a better animator. The character designs are very fitting, for example Matsuoka, Masamune is a host they have deliberity made him really hot and his friend Yukimura a very indoors looking character.Sound: 10/10The voice acting of the characters were really good they all matched up perfectly. Tachibana Hotaru’s voice actor was really amazing personally because her voice really did sound a lot like a boy’s voice at some points and it really made the character fit in to her role perfectly. The opening to Aoharu x Kikanjuu is great especially how the actual characters are actually singing the opening which makes the voice actors and opening in this anime the more better. If this were to be dubbed I think it wouldn’t be to the standard of the original voice actors. During the scenes that unfolded during the anime, OST’s were played and they all absolutely fitted into the scene and mood and the soundtracks was also one the aspects the exceeded my expectations for this anime, I would love to list to the OST’s if they are released soon. I loved both opening and ending because I just liked the songs that played especially the opening because the voice actors actually sang it.Characters: 9/10As every anime has are characters. The characters in Aoharu x Kikanjuu were really well-rounded they all had their strengths and weakness. The characters had the right reaction to every problem that popped up in a realistic way. I can really relate some characters from this anime to other anime’s as well and I have to say they really had some character development, you won’t notice it at first but you will. I would remember all the main characters in this anime because they all had their different personality’s and it was very enjoyable to see them slowly change.Enjoyment: 10/10I’ve already recommended this anime to many of my friends and it’s been positive feedback from them, how can you not enjoy a anime like this? It keeps you engaged, it makes you laugh and even makes you scream at the screen sometimes. Non-anime fans would probably enjoy this anime and as well as manga fans, anyone any age would. In future I am going to re-watch this anime again because it really makes my day watching it I would skip certain parts but not all of it. It was unique I don’t get this engaged with some anime’s most of the time.Overall I give this anime a 9. To summarise the story is very engaging it keeps you on your toes. The animation really fits in with this anime because it pictures the characters with their personalities really well. The voice actors are just perfect they even sang the opening theme to the anime and you don’t see that much with most anime. The characters really develop during the series at first its not clear but at the end you can see they definitely changed a bit. I enjoyed this very much my friends did too so I think everyone in the whole world basically would too. that Ouran feel but since there two complete different anime’s don’t expect the same storyline.

For example her sense of justice would be enjoyable if there would be a reason behind it, a story to tell us why this character think that way, but, as the story progress, it tell us...that her sense of justice is not what we all think of, hence the lack of explanation. But, Tachibana is also someone who stick to her ideals, values friendship and inspires others to go on; which makes her someone to admire, in some kind of way.But, not every character lack a past of some kind, Yukimura is an example, you can watch him grow as a person and actually be fond of him as he helps each of the main characters to do what is right for the team, he has a background that explains his insecurities. Though sometimes his character might be annoying because of the unnecessary ero-anime love he has.As for the story, it needs a second season, definitely. There\'s some parts of it left open that needed explanations. But, for twelve episodes, there\'s a rush in the story that kills it a bit, Tachibana\'s love for survival game is an example of it, since it grows from ""I hate this, I just want to pay my debt"" to ""I need to play this game forever, I\'m never going to stop"" from one episode to another; also, there\'s quite the plot hole going on with the antagonists, since there\'s no reason behind their behaviour. However it also has points to love, for example the friendship between the protagonists that grows with every episode and, also, it kind of surprise that some characters are not what they seem, there\'s more than meet the eye!The art is great, the colors from certain scenes left me breathless! there\'s nothing to complain there; also the OST is quite nice, I\'m loving the opening song!Overall, I recommend watching it because you may enjoy it, is not an anime for everyone, that\'s for sure, but you need to be patient with it, also the whole idea of survival game is really refreshing and unique, the art is well done, and the story is not so bad, so why not give it a try?(ps. sorry for my english) that her sense of justice is not what we all think of, hence the lack of explanation.

I had no idea what it was about at all.And thus, I can easily say that the art is one of the best points of the series (in my opinion), along with the soundtrack.After the first (few) episodes, I was surprised to see that I actually enjoy a series with 'survival games' as its theme/plot/however to call it.Story 8/10In my opinion, the story itself could be much better if the pace were slower. If the actions, games and such were more detailed, with more depth.Still, I liked the...general idea of the survival games and tournaments and such.Art 10/10Like I've mentioned above, the art is the reason I actually started the series and of course, there are many animes with outstanding art, but in my opinion, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of them.There were a few scenes where I just sit there, stare at the screen and think 'wow, that's drawn so beautifully'.Sound 10/10I liked the soundtrack - whether we talk about the opening/ending or in-between. It matched whatever was happening and yeah, I simply enjoyed the music.Character 9/10It would have easily gotten a '10/10' from me if one actually got to know more about all the protagonist (and of course, the other characters as well). I am pretty sure that the characters could have an interesting past, relationship to each other and who-knows-what, but apparently, it's not shown.There are many interesting ones and, in my opinion, also quite a few really likable/lovely ones.Some might turn out weird or the 'development' is kind of... unnatural/too fast, but overall if I thought about 'why did they do that?' the answer/reasoning usually comes to me rather quickly.Although I am sure if one doesn't give much thought about the 'why', the characters might just appear as 'ridiculous'.Enjoyment 10/10I'm pretty sure that I would have marathoned the series if all episodes were out already when I started watching the anime.There were still times where it was kind of 'normal'/'slow' compared to the usual pace of the series and some episodes were full of excitement.It was funny, sometimes you might even get goosebumps or just excited/anticipating to see what would happen next.Most of the time, I thought that it was amusing and enjoyable.Overall 9/10The part which I'm disappointed about is the fact that there was not enough 'character development' and 'story depth'.Also, if the series had a few more episodes to spare, I think it would have gotten a lot better (more time for the events, games, characters etc.).But apart from that, I still adore most of the characters shown, even the antagonist(s) are fascinating and the mixture of different personalities is interesting. general idea of the survival games and tournaments and such.Art 10/10Like I've mentioned above, the art is the reason I actually started the series and of course, there are many animes with outstanding art, but in my opinion, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of them.There were a few scenes where I just sit there, stare at the screen and think 'wow, that's drawn so beautifully'.Sound 10/10I liked the soundtrack - whether we talk about the opening/ending or in-between. It matched whatever was happening and yeah, I simply enjoyed the music.Character 9/10It would have easily gotten a '10/10' from me if one actually got to know more about all the protagonist (and of course, the other characters as well).

I haven\'t even seen that one, so I don\'t care and went in expecting nothing. That aside, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is one of the worst anime I\'ve seen in a long time. I cannot say anything good about this one.The story follows main character Hotaru Tachibana, a reverse trap with a strong sense of justice. Hotaru is put under the impression that her friend Kanae was treated badly at this host club she visited. She goes to investigate and gets into a survival game (airsoft gun fight) with the place\'s owner, Masamune Matsuoka. The place gets...damaged in the process, and Hotaru is forced to join his survival games team, Toy Gun Gun (a really dumb name that they even point out as being dumb), in order to pay off the damages. This ends up just being an excuse to bring Hotaru into survival games as the paying off the damages part is hand waved pretty shortly afterward. Hotaru soon meets Toy Gun Gun\'s other member Tooru Yukimura. He initially hates her for no reason other than the fact that she\'s getting between him and ""Mattsun"" (his nickname for Matsuoka). However, he gets over it really quickly, within the course of one episode. After the team is together, they make it their goal to be the best in Japan. At this point, everything is relatively inoffensive, but the one-dimensional cast of characters and relatively unintersting story aren\'t earning it any points.The anime goes downhill very quickly. There are two main conflicts in the show, one of them is incredibly pointless, and the other doesn\'t really go anywhere. First is the issue of Hotaru\'s gender. Her teammates (and pretty much everyone who doesn\'t know her) are under the impression that she\'s a guy. Not too much of an issue at first glance, but it turns out the Matsuoka doesn\'t allow girls on his team for reasons that you eventually find out, but it ends up not being something you can more or less figure out way before they actually tell it to you near the end of the series. Ultimately, this does nothing but stir up pointless drama. My issue with this is that they could have easily made Hotaru a boy, and the series would have been exactly the same. The issue of her gender is rarely addressed in a meaningful way. They almost came close in one particularly annoying episode somewhat centered around Kanae in which Hotaru is urged to be more feminine and avoid survival games, but what could have been something to address gender stereotypes in a thought provoking way ends up being nothing more than an episode where Hotaru strengthens her resolve through her friend. It\'s annoying enough that the point of the episode could have gotten across in a much better way if this was done through Hotaru interacting with her teammates, but it\'s even more infuriating that Kanae\'s character was clearly written just so this episode could happen. Her only character trait is that she\'s a girl with pink hair, and she acts as somewhat of a foil to Hotaru\'s masculine side. But a foils aren\'t nearly as effective if you almost never have the two of them interact. Without spoiling anything, the issue of Hotaru\'s gender never goes anywhere. She says she\'s going to tell her teammates, then you never see her tell them, so it feels like an annoying tease. To make things more insulting, there\'s even a scene near the end where Hotaru is grabbing Matsuoka\'s hand and he starts blushing (after doing no such thing the entire series). The groan I let out at the moment was beyond comprehension. It\'s almost like they\'re insulting you. Feels like somekind of really lame yaoi fanfiction.The other conflict in the story revolves around Matsuoka and another survival game player named Midori. There\'s apparently some sort of history between the two of them. But ultimately it boils down to Matsuoka really wants to beat his team in a survival game. Outside of the games, when Midori interacts with Hotaru, he\'s almost creepily friendly. But during the games he\'s a terrifying sadist, or at least that\'s what they make him out to be. There\'s pretty much nothing interesting about Midori\'s character other than the fact that the story needed some sort of antagonist, so it\'s really hard to care about him. He\'s extremely one dimensional. There\'s not much else to say about this part of the story without spoiling it, but it ends up involving Matsuoka being tormented by his inferiority to Midori and the results of every big tournament his team lost. This doesn\'t go anywhere particularly interesting, but it ends up making for some really lame drama.So, the story\'s pretty bad. The characters are pretty awful as well. On top of being a reverse trap for no reason other than to create some really stupid drama, Hotaru is an extremely frustrating character to have as the main character. She\'s one of the most annoying leads I\'ve seen in a long time. She has that aforementioned sense of justice, but it\'s only brought up every once in a while when convenient. She grows to love survival games very quickly, and that almost becomes a point of contention and room for deeper characterization, but they do almost nothing with it. For whatever reason, she has some sort of intense bloodlust when she gets really into a game, but it ends up being nothing other than her eyes are drawn differently and she sort of moves faster. She\'s actually really bad with a gun, as you find out very quickly. Other than that, I want to slap her every time she opens her mouth. Just imagine an obnoxiously gung ho shounen protagonist with the emotional maturity of a 12 year old girl that gets really excited over everything.Matsuoka is the closest thing to an intersting character as part of the story revolves around him getting over his issues, but it\'s extremely hard to care about him when he has so little screen time. It\'s almost like dedicating the plot to a side character.Yukimura is extremely forgettable. He\'s a creepy shut-in, pervert that has no friends except Mattsun (and now Hotaru). He was bullied a lot back in the day, and Matsuoka was the one who stood up for him. So now he just has a creepy attachment to him. You could say he\'s the pervert who\'s incredibly clingly to Matsuoka and that\'d be about the entirety of his character.Every other character is garbage. I already talked about Midori, so I should mention the side characters... there\'s like three and I\'d be lying if I said they were even fleshed out enough to be one-dimensional.So, the two components that matter most, story and characters, are absolute garbage. There\'s nothing to be said about the music since I can\'t even recall a single track from the soundtrack, shows how memorable it is, and the art style is kinda bland. The animation is kind of acceptable, but nothing to write home about. So I can\'t even give it a point or two for that.Finally, I need to talk about the action scenes. This could have been the anime\'s saving grace, but it was a total let down. All of the choreography of the surival games is out of whack. It\'s pretty clear that there was little to no spatial awareness in the planning of the action scenes. The best example I could cite: Hotaru is facing down an enemy. The shot implies that there\'s about 20-30 feet between them. Then when she runs at him, it looks like she\'s running the distance of a football field. Given that they were in a forest at the time, it\'s even worse since you could use trees as markers. There were only a few trees near them, yet Hotaru runs by a bunch of them. This sounds nitpicky, but it\'s really infuriating and totally immersion breaking when given that there\'s tons of room for realism in the game they\'re playing. Even stuff like that aside, none of these survival game scenes are particularly fancy. In fact, it often feels like they go out of their way not to show them to you. The first couple of episodes involved Hotaru getting totally hyped to get out and shoot people up, but instead of the viewer getting to see her try, it cuts to her instantly failing and leaving the battlefield. Even when we do see her in action, it\'s either totally lame or something stupid and immersion breaking like what I described earlier. And at this point I haven\'t even mentioned how everyone plays this game like they don\'t even want to win. They\'re not using real guns, it\'s not a life or death situation, yet everyone seems to rather talk menacingly to each other instead of just shooting each other. The number of times where someone totally would have gotten shot if the person holding the gun to them just shut up and pulled the trigger is way higher than it should be. How is anyone expected to feel any tension in this already incredibly low stakes (in the grandest scheme of things) game when people are practically refusing to do the only thing you do in it? It\'s like watching a really bad stereotypical shounen where a fight that could have taken ten minutes last three episodes because no one would shut up and do what they\'re supposed to be doing. So, the entire show falls apart even on a conceptual level. You\'re given a realistic game, why not let everyone play it realistically instead of like a really bad fighting shounen?This anime is bottom of the barrel. It\'s certainly not the worst I\'ve seen, but it\'s pretty close, and I wouldn\'t feel bad about lumping it together with the only other title I\'ve given a 1 to. The characters are mindnumbingly bad, the story surrounding them gives you no real reason to care about it, and everything else is flat out unimpressive. Also, did I mention that it even manages to have an infuriating flashback filter? It even messes up in that department.1/10 - I\'d have more fun pounding my head against a wall damaged in the process, and Hotaru is forced to join his survival games team, Toy Gun Gun (a really dumb name that they even point out as being dumb), in order to pay off the damages.

She is easily mistaken for a boy, because of her broad shoulders, short hair, and confrontational attitude. She has an altercation with a host named Masamune Matsuoka, who mistakes her for a boy. In order to pay for the damage she caused, she joins his survival game group, Toy Gun Gun. The only problem? Girls aren't allowed!I believe the best way to describe Aoharu's issues in a word is: disorganized. There's comedy, but this isn't a comedy anime. There's some drama, but this isn't drama or tragedy anime. There's a cross-dressing female, but this...isn't a gender bender. And there's some action, but this is by no means an action anime. Like anime such as Kekkai Sensen, Aoharu x Kikanjuu spreads itself too thin over too many genres, and that is what leads to its downfall.While Aoharu has survival games in it, it doesn't have enough action scenes, nor is the animation good enough to distinguish Aoharu as a good action anime. The art isn't amazing enough to be spellbound by it.*SPOILERS in this paragraph*Likewise, the anime's plot is weak. What is the goal of the anime? Is it for Hotaru to improve her skills? Considering she doesn't improve much, no. Is it for her to admit she's a girl? Considering that doesn't happen, no. Is it for Toy Gun Gun to win TGC or beat Hoshishiro? Neither of those happens, so no. Is it for Masamune to overcome his vendetta against Midori? While this does happen, it only surfaces as a huge repetitive issue in episode 11 and is solved in episode 12. So no.*END SPOILERS*Without strong action or plot, characters need to fill that void. Let's look at the characters--are they complex? Hotaru as a black and white view of the world; she sees everything in terms of justice. Masamune has an abandonment complex, but it literally only surfaces in the last two episodes. Yukimura, despite being the most entertaining character of the show, is flat. All we know about him is he is extremely attached to Masamune and is a perv. Midori is a sadist, which is fine, but we don't ever see why he wants to torment Masamune so. Fujimon is cute, but that's about it. And so on, and so forth. The characters, while entertaining enough at a superficial level, aren't three-dimensional. They're shallow, so they're hard to relate to. And I'm saying this despite my attraction to Masamune and Midori.Make no mistake; this anime is not bad. I dragged my feet almost every week, but I was mildly entertained by every episode. Having two eye candy characters helped. But the flat characters, lack of depth, and disorganized storyline really detracted from my experience. (And yes, the fujobait bothered me, but not as much as those other issues.) I don't feel like this anime has changed me or taught me anything. Not to mention, the only thing I looked forward to all season--Hotaru confessing she's a girl--never happened.

It is an awesome gender bender, an awesome sports anime, and an awesome friendship story. I feel like a lot of people ended up not liking this anime because they based their opinions off of the first two episodes and then were shocked with the turn it made once it really started in the 3rd ep. I want to clarify-- this is not Ouran High School Host Club with machine guns. There IS a host club in the beginning, there IS a girl who wears pants instead of a skirt, she DOES break something and initially is forced...to play on a team to repay her debts, and yes they mistake her as a dude. But this doesn\'t matter. After the 3rd ep, none of that matters because the beginning was just a quick means to introduce the main character to survival games (aka paintball with beebee guns). I\'m not happy with how they did this or how they rushed it, but couldn\'t be bothered to care too much about it after I got to the amazing main plot.Story:If you enjoy dramatic sports animes with a slightly darker overtone, hilarious moments, and an emphasis on friendship, then this is for you. I was surprisingly entertained and excited about an anime about survival games. If you like paintball like I do, you\'ll probably be pretty thrilled since you never thought there\'d be a paintball anime. But like any sports anime, it\'s dramatic. Sometimes it\'s hilariously dramatic, sometimes it\'s seriously, heart-string pulling dramatic, either way it\'s dramatic in a good way. What I really enjoyed about this story is that it progresses basically like it would if it were a male protagonist. She trains to get better, she sucks at first, but has great potential, and is determined to get better for herself and for her team. I really enjoyed this aspect of it.Art:It\'s nice, it\'s new style, it\'s smooth. Nothing really stood out to me regarding the animation, besides an occasional really sweet angle.Sound:The opening is fantastic. The song gets you pumped up, the animation really suits the song and gives it a darker feel, and it\'s sung by the voice actors of the three main characters which is always a good +1. I thought the soundtrack of the whole anime was pretty good. They\'re really good at pumping you up during battle scenes and at important moments, but I felt that their weakest link here was during the softer moments in the anime. They\'re really good at battle sequences, but during downtimes and more heart-felt moments, the music was either a little bland or just plain forgettable. I felt like they could have done better during these moments.Character:The best thing about this anime is the characters. Without trying to spoil anything:Matsuoka is a host in all the best ways. He\'s attentive, a good listener, and also caring to a fault. As a captain of the survival team Toy Gun Gun, he successfully utilizes these skills to bring out the potential of his teammates. As a character, he\'s very well-done. The more you watch, the more layers you see of him, the more you find out why he acts the way he does, and the more you find out just how much they thought about his underlying personality. He\'s a great example of a well-developed and well-written character that can be both strong and sensitive.Yukimura is hilarious. Yukimura is a hentai mangaka with racy tastes, and isn\'t afraid to show it. He\'s the type who would creepily sit in a corner reading porn magazines. He\'s also a first class survival gamer. Pretty early on you find out that he has a dark past that\'s led him to only trusting and relying on Matsuoka (Matsuoka also has a dark past that\'s been touched on in the anime but hasn\'t fully been disclosed yet). He brings this obsession with Matsuoka into the survival games, playing as a sniper who always has his back. Yukimura undergoes some amazing character development throughout the show. I won\'t go into details, but I\'ll just say it was nice seeing him become more trusting and also more independent as the show went on.I\'d also like to take a moment to say that the side and supporting characters were also interesting and nicely developed. For example, the ""evil"" team Toy Gun Gun is fighting against has striking characters who will quickly become either your favorites or your most hated. And then they\'ll be developed a bit more, and your view will quickly change from black and white to grey. I can\'t wait to see how these side and supporting characters will continue to develop in season 2 (really hoping for a second season).Now for the main character. I could write a whole research paper on why Tachibana, Hotaru is such a good and necessary character. It\'s so refreshing to see a sports anime with a female lead who\'s actually treated like a proper main character. Tachibana is like a classic shounen lead: she\'s all about justice, likes to battle people who go against her sense of justice, and is athletically talented. She\'s also extremely naive at first and a little oblivious. But through a misunderstanding and a journey of self-discovery and friendship, she learns what and who she\'s fighting for. In the end, she matures into an even more amazing, and hilarious, lead who I hope to see develop even more in the future. For a shounen, this is a standard character setup. But for a female protagonist, this is anything but. Like ""Moribito - Guardian of the Spirit"", she is a physically strong protagonist who isn\'t afraid to show both her femininity and masculinity, holds her own against her male teammates, and is proud of being herself in all that that entails. She doesn\'t consider females weak, and she doesn\'t consider males strong. She believes in herself and her strength as Tachibana, Hotaru, just as she believes in Matsuoka and Yukimura\'s strength as her teammates. She is a valuable member of Toy Gun Gun and is, eventually, treated like a valuable member. Knowing both her strengths and her weaknesses, Matsuoka recognizes just how amazing Tachibana is, and just how amazing she could become. It is so exciting to see a female lead like Tachibana in a medium so devoid of well-written female protagonists (without a story solely focused on a love interest).Enjoyment:I absolutely enjoyed the heck out of this anime. It was hilarious, it was thrilling, it was heart-warming, it was refreshing-- I can\'t say enough good things about it.Overall: 8/10While I loved this anime to death, there were some shortcomings regarding the first 2 episodes. Despite that, the anime was still a fantastic watch.I would not recommend this to people expecting Ouran High School Host Club, people who\'re just in it for action and guns, people who want Ouran High School Host Club with machine guns, or people who\'re expecting a weak, moe female lead holding a large gun.I would recommend this anime to people who enjoy sports animes, well-done gender bends, comedies, and heart-felt friendships. to play on a team to repay her debts, and yes they mistake her as a dude. But this doesn\'t matter. After the 3rd ep, none of that matters because the beginning was just a quick means to introduce the main character to survival games (aka paintball with beebee guns). I\'m not happy with how they did this or how they rushed it, but couldn\'t be bothered to care too much about it after I got to the amazing main plot.Story:If you enjoy dramatic sports animes with a slightly darker overtone, hilarious moments, and an emphasis on friendship, then this is for you. I was surprisingly entertained and excited about an anime about survival games. If you like paintball like I do, you\'ll probably be pretty thrilled since you never thought there\'d be a paintball anime. But like any sports anime, it\'s dramatic. Sometimes it\'s hilariously dramatic, sometimes it\'s seriously, heart-string pulling dramatic, either way it\'s dramatic in a good way. What I really enjoyed about this story is that it progresses basically like it would if it were a male protagonist. She trains to get better, she sucks at first, but has great potential, and is determined to get better for herself and for her team. I really enjoyed this aspect of it.Art:It\'s nice, it\'s new style, it\'s smooth. Nothing really stood out to me regarding the animation, besides an occasional really sweet angle.Sound:The opening is fantastic. The song gets you pumped up, the animation really suits the song and gives it a darker feel, and it\'s sung by the voice actors of the three main characters which is always a good +1. I thought the soundtrack of the whole anime was pretty good. They\'re really good at pumping you up during battle scenes and at important moments, but I felt that their weakest link here was during the softer moments in the anime. They\'re really good at battle sequences, but during downtimes and more heart-felt moments, the music was either a little bland or just plain forgettable. I felt like they could have done better during these moments.Character:The best thing about this anime is the characters. Without trying to spoil anything:Matsuoka is a host in all the best ways. He\'s attentive, a good listener, and also caring to a fault. As a captain of the survival team Toy Gun Gun, he successfully utilizes these skills to bring out the potential of his teammates. As a character, he\'s very well-done. The more you watch, the more layers you see of him, the more you find out why he acts the way he does, and the more you find out just how much they thought about his underlying personality. He\'s a great example of a well-developed and well-written character that can be both strong and sensitive.Yukimura is hilarious. Yukimura is a hentai mangaka with racy tastes, and isn\'t afraid to show it. He\'s the type who would creepily sit in a corner reading porn magazines. He\'s also a first class survival gamer.

As compensation he has her join his airsoft team. Other than the strange fact that Tachibana never cares to correct people as to her gender, everything starts out okay. But this later becomes an unnecessarily large conflict when it\'s state the team MC join doesn\'t take girls.Unfortunately the show becomes less about airsoft and more about the ridiculous drama and conflict between...MC\'s team, Toy Gun Gun, and another team Hoshishiro. The airsoft battles are okay, but you\'d expect more in the way of strategy. The show draws little actual interest towards airsoft, which is surprising given that it\'s the main reason most people would pick up the showEveryone takes their games seriously. Way too seriously actually. It\'s stated in episode 1. No training or skill is shown and it actually makes the viewers take it less seriously. As You\'ll find that the characters are simply a fujo\'s wet dream, with a neet homo manga writer, a guy who works at a host club, a sadist, and finally a boy who\'s not really a boy who ties it all together.The strangest thing is Tachibana\'s sense of ""justice"". It\'s never really explained where this comes from though he mentions it frequently, and it\'s outright thrown out the window and turns into simply being her self-admitted selfishness later on. So it\'s just his own little meaningless character trait. The characters aren\'t good, and neither is the story.Art:Brain\'s Base put a lot into this and you can tell. Unfortunately for them it doesn\'t look like they\'ll get much out of it as preorder sales are abysmal. It would be more appropriate if they threw their money at making season 2s for their actual successes, even if they may not sell as well a the first, rather than throwing all their money into such a poor story.Overall: 3/10I actually enjoyed this series for around the first 6 episodes. It was a bit silly but it was fun to watch. But towards the latter half too much dumbly written drama and poorly attempted characterization came into play and it was hardly about the airsoft. I just wanted it to end.It wish I would\'ve been able to end the season saying this is a show I didn\'t regret watching because it seemed that way when I started. It proved that you can\'t pander to multiple crowds at different ends of the spectrum and get positive recognition.Hopefully I never again have to write a review in which I spend more time correcting ""his/he"" to ""her/she"" again.

However, the focus of AoHaru x Kikanjuu is on survival games--not on a host club. Instead, it focus on three characters and how survival games contributes to their progress throughout the series (and beyond): Hotaru Tachibana, Masamune Matsuoka and Tooru Yukimura--the members of a survival game team, Toy Gun Gun. (Yes, I know what you might be thinking: their naming sense can definitely improve...)***Just a warning: What I mention in my review can be considered...as potential spoilers (as I talked about what happened in certain episodes, mostly the beginning, for this section), so please keep that in mind. Of course, I\'ll try to limit the spoilers, when I can. Also, just to note, my review is more or so formatted as such: some explained events mixed with the points that stood out to me.***The story of AoHaru x Kikanjuu starts off with Hotaru, a girl who looks and dresses like a boy, meeting her neighbor, Masamune Matsuoka, while he\'s talking on the phone outside of her apartment. Hotaru couldn\'t think of another way to make him move, so she slammed her fist on the door, causing Matsuoka-san to stop what he\'s doing. Just before Hotaru went into her apartment, there was a gun lying on the ground, and to her surprise, it\'s Matsuoka-san\'s. The next day, after talking to her friend, who was greeted by Matsuoka-san earlier, she found out that he worked at a host club and that the gun that she saw is actually a toy gun. Matsuoka-san then challenged Hotaru to a survival game, and having confidence in hers skills, she accepted. While her physical abilities is something to watch out for, she ended up losing to Matsuoka-san\'s experience and skill in survival game fighting. The condition that Matsuoka-san have for her loss was: to join his survival game team for paying off her debt of the damage she caused in the host club (while playing the game). Matsuoka-san is indeed a sly one...Despite not wanting to play survival games at first, Hotaru grew to really like them--to the point where she was at a loss for having to even consider not playing them at all. It was Yukimura, the other member of Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru joined (who writes a specific genre of manga) made her realize this, by pointing out to her: ""...now you\'ve tasted the air of the battlefield. You can\'t go back to an ordinary life."" What drew Hotaru towards survival games was the sense of fighting that the players engage in. Hotaru have a strong sense of justice, and with that justice, it can turn to having an unyielding (and sometimes, even bloodthirsty) desire to take down whoever she\'s going up against, and it shows in how she plays during survival games. Although Hotaru does not have the best survival game sense, she does withhold a strong fighting spirit; on top of that, she\'s armed with her (almost superhuman-like) strength. During a battle, her opponents could even sense her aura of bloodthirst in the atmosphere surrounding her, and that\'s why she\'s someone to watch out for during a survival game.Hotaru is a character that I found easy to like, and wanting to cheer for. She\'s strong and can fight for herself, but at the same time, since she doesn\'t have as much life experiences as the other two main characters (who have their dark pasts that can weigh them down), she\'s not one that is quick to understand why certain characters act the way they do, and why certain events turn out the way it does. Although, that\'s understandable, because for most instances, if you don\'t know much about something, it\'s difficult for you to comprehend just what is going on. It\'s refreshing, yet awesome to see a female, especially lead character, who can hold her own and is willing to fight on her own--even though she might not do it very well at particular times.Through each experience Hotaru came across, primarily as being involved with survival games and the members of Toy Gun Gun, she came to better understand not only herself, but also those around her. The development between characters occurred mostly through the conversations they have with each other, and what they learn and come to think because of them. First of all: Yukimura. Yukimura, upon first meeting him, seems to be an introverted, distant and unwelcoming person; however, that\'s due to the fact that he knows firsthand just how it\'s like to be betrayed by those he thought were his friends. After getting to know Hotaru, he found it not as difficult to be less closed up, and more willing to adjust how he approaches matters. As the series went on, with the more development Yukimura had, the more likable I found him to be. Yukimura can be serious, when trying to help with the situation at hand--or to just simply trying help out, but at the same time, he can also be undeniably adorable, in what he says, in the way that he talks, and in what he does. Onto Kanae: whenever she sees Hotaru not as herself, she would ask if she\'s okay, and that if anything\'s bothering her. In an instance where Hotaru seemed so obviously unmotivated, Kanae did something to help her pick herself up. She even recalled something that Hotaru told her a while ago, when her team was about to give up before they even play a match during physical education class: ""I never thought about winning making me cool, or losing making me uncool. ... If anything... Giving up before you even try is kind of uncool. That\'s why I want to be someone who\'ll fight as many times as it takes, and never give up. That\'s got to be way cooler."" Remembering such specific words just shows how much she values Hotaru as a friend, how much she cares for her friends\' wellbeing and overall, how great of a friend she truly is.The sound and art of the show certain adds to the intensity of particular scenes, and it\'s what makes the show so exciting to watch. During the fight scenes, to compliment the expressions, a darker shade of color palate would be used to present the characters\' faces and certain music would be played to enhance the tension in the air. As a result, all the fight scenes captured my attention, as somehow, I always found myself wanting to see how the characters engage each other in all different sorts of battle scenarios, whether it\'s: close-range, far-range, near the flag area, one on one, snipping from afar, and so on.  It\'s also very fascinating to watch how others react and act to the vibe that Hotaru gives off, as well as her quick movements that catches them off-guard.The voice actors did an outstanding job in voice acting their characters. I especially like the voice of Hotaru; the voice that Mikako Komatsu (aka Neko from K Project, Ginger from Gangsta, etc) used for Hotaru is boyish, so it helps in convincing the other characters that she\'s a boy. It doesn\'t sound forced, in fact, it comes off as quite natural and clear. The voice that Yoshitsugu Matsuoka (who also voiced many other characters, such as Kirito from SAO, Souma from SnS, Kanemaru from DnA, etc), Yukimura\'s voice actor, used for Yukimura was really fitting for his character. His low and quiet way of speaking represents Yukimura as a character well. The voice actors also did a great job in singing the Opening and Ending songs; I personally like the Ending songs more (both Tic Tac and Gunjou Survival), as I find Mikako Komatsu\'s voice to be very fitting with the songs that she was given to sing.***(This section leads to more major spoilers, so read on only if you\'ve finished watching the series!)***Matsuoka-san said something to Hotaru before they began the first game they played with each other, and that is: ""Let\'s start this deathless death march."" Now looking back and thinking about all of the games that they played, this line definitely held significance all throughout the series. When watching the episodes, where the characters takes the games so seriously, you might be thinking: ...but it\'s just a game. While that\'s true, it does shine light on many aspects in life. Yes, getting shot by a toy gun does not secure your death outside of the survival games, although it\'s possible for you to get injured from participating in them. Here\'s the thing: All the events that took place were, in one way or another, in relation to the survival games. The games reflected the possible outcomes of what can happen in real life-and-death situations, where people\'s lives can actually be at stake. An example of this could be: the opponent\'s got you cornered and the only options are: to 1. be shot, or 2. surrender. The line emphasize just how survival games with toy guns can shine light on real survival fights, with real guns, or even: invisible--not detectable by the eyes--kind of guns. For each person, the gun(s) that can ""shoot"" through them differs. With that said, most of the ""guns"" that leaves wounds and unforgettable scars are ones that are able to ""shoot"" into people\'s minds, and eventually, into their hearts. And with this series, it\'s clear that it\'s the invisible, not easily detected ones--at least not at first glance--that leaves impactful impressions on characters. You could infer so with the unraveling of how each character think and act because of the past experiences (and for some, traumas) that they\'ve endured--especially for Matsuoka-san.""There are two types of people. Those who let go and those who are let go. I\'ve always been the latter."" The ""shot"" that have been fired deep within Matsuoka-san was this: all the people that let go of him so far in his life. He never reached out towards any of them, even though he could\'ve; instead, he just watch them leave, because he thinks that if he tries to reach out, he might really push them away for good. So, before Hotaru could take her leave, Matsuoka-san pushed her away by kicking her off the team, after Toy Gun Gun lost to Midori and his team. He didn\'t want her to hate survival games, and eventually, hate him for making her hate the games in the first place. For once, Yukimura didn\'t agree with what Matsun decided, and chose to not follow him on this decision. So, to help clear up the misunderstandings, he told Hotaru about the members that left Toy Gun Gun because of Matsuoka and his baggage with survival games--which led them to turn their backs on him.As a response to Matsuoka\'s decision, Hotaru challenged him to a survival game, and that if she wins, he\'ll have to say something that she wants him to say. Hotaru kept losing, but her determination propelled her to keep trying. It eventually led him to ask the real question to himself: ""Why won\'t you abandon me?""--as all those that left him did. Seeing Hotaru\'s persistency and earnestness on trying to win, made Matsuoka-san see just how much she is trying to reach out to him--the way that he didn\'t, the way that he was afraid to, the way that he wanted to--for others. It also opened his eyes: that she wants him to take and accept her hand and that Hotaru isn\'t someone that he can shake off that easily. There are people who just can\'t bring themselves to let go, even if they were told to do so and even if they think they should--especially if they see the other person in pain, suffering, unable to move forward; Hotaru is absolutely one of them.Perhaps Hotaru\'s determination and earnestness made Matsun start to see more of how others feel around him too, not just how he feels about them (as he can really get too wrapped inside his own head). To express his thoughts on Yukimura opposing him, he smiled, while telling him: ""Thanks for getting mad at me.""Both Yukimura and Hotaru managed to knock some sense into Matsuoka-san in the end; that\'s what they set out to do--and from the looks of it, they are getting better at doing so too. (Keep it up, because there\'s no others that can keep him in check...)***(Spoilers section over.)***Overall, I enjoyed watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu very much; it\'s one of the shows that got me the most hyped for the next episodes--and during the summers season as a whole. ^.^I would recommend this series to fans of: Bishounens, Friendships, Action, Comedy, Shounen, and a show that have a strong female lead--along with great supporting charactersYou\'re welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.*** as potential spoilers (as I talked about what happened in certain episodes, mostly the beginning, for this section), so please keep that in mind.

When watching the episodes, where the characters takes the games so seriously, you might be thinking: ...but it\'s just a game. While that\'s true, it does shine light on many aspects in life. Yes, getting shot by a toy gun does not secure your death outside of the survival games, although it\'s possible for you to get injured from participating in them. Here\'s the thing: All the events that took place were, in one way or another, in relation to the survival games. The games reflected the possible outcomes of what can happen in real life-and-death situations, where people\'s lives can actually be at stake. An example of this could be: the opponent\'s got you cornered and the only options are: to 1. be shot, or 2. surrender. The line emphasize just how survival games with toy guns can shine light on real survival fights, with real guns, or even: invisible--not detectable by the eyes--kind of guns. For each person, the gun(s) that can ""shoot"" through them differs. With that said, most of the ""guns"" that leaves wounds and unforgettable scars are ones that are able to ""shoot"" into people\'s minds, and eventually, into their hearts. And with this series, it\'s clear that it\'s the invisible, not easily detected ones--at least not at first glance--that leaves impactful impressions on characters. You could infer so with the unraveling of how each character think and act because of the past experiences (and for some, traumas) that they\'ve endured--especially for Matsuoka-san.""There are two types of people. Those who let go and those who are let go. I\'ve always been the latter."" The ""shot"" that have been fired deep within Matsuoka-san was this: all the people that let go of him so far in his life. He never reached out towards any of them, even though he could\'ve; instead, he just watch them leave, because he thinks that if he tries to reach out, he might really push them away for good. So, before Hotaru could take her leave, Matsuoka-san pushed her away by kicking her off the team, after Toy Gun Gun lost to Midori and his team. He didn\'t want her to hate survival games, and eventually, hate him for making her hate the games in the first place. For once, Yukimura didn\'t agree with what Matsun decided, and chose to not follow him on this decision. So, to help clear up the misunderstandings, he told Hotaru about the members that left Toy Gun Gun because of Matsuoka and his baggage with survival games--which led them to turn their backs on him.As a response to Matsuoka\'s decision, Hotaru challenged him to a survival game, and that if she wins, he\'ll have to say something that she wants him to say. Hotaru kept losing, but her determination propelled her to keep trying. It eventually led him to ask the real question to himself: ""Why won\'t you abandon me?""--as all those that left him did. Seeing Hotaru\'s persistency and earnestness on trying to win, made Matsuoka-san see just how much she is trying to reach out to him--the way that he didn\'t, the way that he was afraid to, the way that he wanted to--for others. It also opened his eyes: that she wants him to take and accept her hand and that Hotaru isn\'t someone that he can shake off that easily. There are people who just can\'t bring themselves to let go, even if they were told to do so and even if they think they should--especially if they see the other person in pain, suffering, unable to move forward; Hotaru is absolutely one of them.Perhaps Hotaru\'s determination and earnestness made Matsun start to see more of how others feel around him too, not just how he feels about them (as he can really get too wrapped inside his own head). To express his thoughts on Yukimura opposing him, he smiled, while telling him: ""Thanks for getting mad at me.""Both Yukimura and Hotaru managed to knock some sense into Matsuoka-san in the end; that\'s what they set out to do--and from the looks of it, they are getting better at doing so too. (Keep it up, because there\'s no others that can keep him in check...)***(Spoilers section over.)***Overall, I enjoyed watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu very much; it\'s one of the shows that got me the most hyped for the next episodes--and during the summers season as a whole. ^.^I would recommend this series to fans of: Bishounens, Friendships, Action, Comedy, Shounen, and a show that have a strong female lead--along with great supporting charactersYou\'re welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.***', ""At first, I was like, another weak girl anime? But actually, the girl is a tomboy and as you venture further into the anime, you might even forget that 'he' is a 'she'. It has great action scenes, even though it is fake gun game but it has the atmosphere of a real gun battlefield.It is something like Ouran HighSchool Host Club.It has really great action scenes and heart-warming moments, and of course, heart-breaking moments. But the ending is really happy, FYI.Well, Please do give it a try if you are on the fence about this anime. It has great arts that is...for sure! for sure!"", 'A surprisingly enjoyable series that is less plot driven and more character driven. The story wasn\'t terrible but it also wouldn\'t have been as engaging had it not been for its wonderfully interesting cast of characters. While I found Hotaru extremely off-putting initially, especially her use of illeism, eventually I grew to tolerate her and even found her somewhat endearing by the finale. Others I loved right off the bat: Yukki and Fujimon are hands down my favorites. One I can relate to so well, the other is basically a giant puppy.You pick up early on that AxK thrives on being extreme. At times,...it\'s almost ridiculous how much weight they give the survival games and it teeters at the edge of being overly dramatic. The characters as well, while lovable, are also very predictable in terms of personality-types. What I wasn\'t expecting was how greatly exaggerated the character personalities were going to be.I consider the art a fitting style for AxK. The animation, coloring, lighting, everything looks gorgeous and is definitely one of the best I\'ve seen recently. I\'m especially a fan of the scenes when Hotaru lets out bloodlust - again, an example of how this series takes everything over the top, but I say this with an amused fondness.It had a heartwarming, very emotional season finale that made me go ""d\'awwww"" for several minutes. I\'m definitely keeping my fingers crossed for as season 2 as there were still several plot points that were briefly touched upon but never fully explored. it\'s almost ridiculous how much weight they give the survival games and it teeters at the edge of being overly dramatic.

True there are some similarities between AoharuxKikanjuu and OHSHC so yeah. But really, with out all of the comparisons, I do believe this show has a pretty good plot line. I think people were hoping for a gory ripped limb from limb kind of anime. well they were sad Pandas once they realized that it was AirSoft wars... which were pretty well represented... Like seriously... have you ever been shot at point blank by a  high powered battery operated air soft gun with hard...plastic pellets? No? than you have NO idea how serious these ""death battles"" can be. Trust me you do everything in your power to avoid being shot at point blank.... OUCH!!!! X0 and yes I have participated in Airsoft war games. they are just like that... :) So the story line, although incomplete, people need to see that you can only fit so much into 12 episodes... this is clearly a call back anime.. which means there NEEDS to be a season 2 to close up the quote on quote ""Plot holes"" which I believe are on purpose in order to grip the viewer into wanting to know more. The art was top notch. As expected of Funanmation, and the sound and voice acting was incredible. although a little over the top  with the Air Soft sound effects. the characters were very lovable except for the whole ""all boys are idiots"" theme that seems to be the rage nowadays. overall, I really did enjoy the anime. It was definately satisfying and I\'m looking forward to a second season. So haters, go watch Cowboy Bebop... that seems to be a little more up your alley.. (a.k.a. TOTAL TRASH!!!) plastic pellets?

TOTAL TRASH!!!)', ""SPOILER FREE REVIEW:If you are looking for a short, funny and enjoyable anime, with simple art and nice backgrounds, you should consider watching this anime.Story (6 out of 10): The beginning may seem like Ouran Host Club, but that's really just the first episode. The story revolves about a high school girl Tachibana Hotaru, who got drawn into the world of survival games by her two neighbours to repay a debt - the twist is that her two team-mates don't know that she's a girl (girls are forbidden in their team).If you want an anime with a deep and spectacular story, this might...not be the anime. Don't get me wrong, I loved the story and it's quite simple and enjoyable. It was funny and the ending was great (somehow, the endings in anime always disappoint me, but this wasn't really the case). Although I would have liked to see a few more action scenes.Art (9) and sound (9): The art was great and simple (just as I like it). The characters were nicely drawn and I loved the backgrounds. The sound effects weren't overused, as they are in many anime and the music was also great.Characters (7 out od 10): Each character was different and had it's own personality. They were enjoyable and funny and I can't decide on my favourite one. As the series progresses, you find out more about them. But they didn't really develop, this is where the anime lacks.Enjoyment (10 out of 10): Why did I give it such a score? It's funny, it's simple and perfect for a short casual watching. It certainly didn't dissapoint.Overall: As I said, it's one of my favourites anime. It's simple, short and interesting, with likable characters and great music. You find yourself laughing every episode. I really hope for a second season. While the anime isn't deep, or spectacular, it's really really  enjoyable, so I'm giving it a 9. not be the anime.

It\'s seriously either a hit or miss with it; if you expect something similar to Ouran, walk away, you won\'t get it. Even if it could be, somehow, categorized as a reverse harem (depends how you look at it; at the core it\'s stil about one girl surrounded by bishies that get some kind of liking to her, romantic or just simply interest), the point and story of the show is something else entirely.Story  - 5It\'s plain mediocre. Nothing really happens and nothing really gets concluded, besides Mattsun\'s self-victimizing perception of himself and others, maybe and...Tachibana and Yukimura\'s developed friendship. The sketchy thing going around is the survival game part of it. Half of the show feels like some sort of Kuroko no basket; inventing skills that sound like magical powers and look extraordinarily awesome, but when you come down to it, there\'s nothing magical about it, it\'s just ""talent"" and ""force of will"". That looks awesome, yes, and the atmosphere at some points was unbearable and very tension-directed, but keeping it in context, however, that\'s a different issue entirely. The epic tense atmospheres were a lie; they were tense, but the reasons for the tension are mostly laughable because of how seriously they are taken and too trivial to take seriously overall.The genderbend part is also an issue; while I do appreciate that the main girl doesn\'t just happen to genderbent for some specific trouble she had, but she\'s just simply ""boyish"" and that\'s really fresh, I hoped for that to cause a bit more of an issue and not be a ""detail"" that she was going to forget to mention for the whole show only to make a semi-issue out of it later, which in the end it won\'t matter in the slightest anyway. I do give it points for dragging it so far that some characters might question their sexuality though...XDCharacters - 6There\'s this type of over the top emotional exageration prevailing through the main cast and, differenty from other people, I don\'t feel like completely bashing on it. I found it more than once to be laughable and exagerated, but there are stuff that to some people matter more than to the rest and I feel like that was made obvious when the contrast between Toy Gun Gun and other players was made. This made me believe that it was only Toy Gun Gun and Hoshishiro that took this game so seriously and personal, both of them because of personal reasons and needs that they couldn\'t get in their everyday lives. However, that was portrayed pretty badly. Mattsun\'s connection and relationship with Midori was only scratched down upon, as well as their relationships with the rest of the world too. There\'s not much development going on; it\'s more like ""take it and believe it"" type of situation. While I liked Mattsun\'s internal struggle in the last episode, I didn\'t feel like it completely justified the events before that.In terms of likeability, Yukimura was the one that made me go ""aww"" for the most part of the show. He\'s totally creepy sometimes, but he accepted that creepiness despite not being commonly socially accepted for it. Development-wise, he also overall lacks, but it was sweet how in the end he found something to believe in, even if it was different from what Mattsun believed, putting a stop to his blind loyalty; seriously the most that you can get in terms of development in this show.Art - 7I think that the animation had a very important role when it came to the over the top exageration of the characters\' reactions, and to be able to send shivers on my spine with an overall trivial reason, there\'s some skill to be praised here. Unfortunately, animation got quite bad during the last few episodes which were made of very simplistic backgrounds and flashbacks to which the characters simply spoke ""upon"".Sound -6Nothing deem of worth but I liked the opening song.Enjoyment - 8Despite realizing the laughable exageration of it all, I couldnt help but fairly enjoy it. I don\'t know if it was some sort of guilty pleasure or if I looked for something beyond what I actually got, but it would be a lie if I said I didn\'t wait impatiently for each episode.Overall- 6It could have been way better. After episode 12 I expected there to be an episode 13 to wrap something up, instead I feel like I was left hanging with only half story done. I hope it gets a second season or if it doesn\'t at least some sort OVA finale. Tachibana and Yukimura\'s developed friendship. The sketchy thing going around is the survival game part of it.

About a Girl pretending to be a Boy in order to be on a Shooting Team - Toy Gun Gun.At first I was a bit iffy in the idea that the girl pretends to be a boy, however I watched the first episode together with my friend and I absolutely loved it. I loved the fact that Hotaru (The Main Character) still has her friend and it shows us a bit...of her everyday life before getting straight into the main event.The story was well designed, about a tournament between Gun Shooting (Pretty much BB Pellets) and this team that Hotaru finds herself in. I really got into the story and enjoyed the series a lot, once I had watched a few more episodes I was really finding myself amused. The more the story picks up the more you are wanting to understand what had happened with Team Toy Gun Gun before Hotaru joined. It has it's serious elements but the series also has it's funny elements to keep you awake and not bored.The Art was a favourite of mine, it was well developed and well put together, especially within the fights. The way that they produced the battlegrounds was also a nice sight and it shown a lot of detail that had went in to the story board of the scenes. Sound was also a good element, they had a nice range of instrumental music throughout and the opening was very well played. The sound made more of the battles come to life and gets you really into it and picks your interests up as the fight carries on, puttign you on edge.The character development was very well introduced into this show, for Hotaru being the main character she was introduced straight away as one of these Tom Boys that like to protect the 'Princesses' and this made the main character even more enjoyable to watch. The next two main characters were Masamune and Tooru, these characters to me looked like a very nice pair that worked well together, they were a combined team of specialist tactics and this made them perform together a well developed character point. There is much unknown about these characters but as the story goes on the truth is unraveled and it slowly reveals their past and how it all ties together with the tournament.I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy this as much as I have and I am proud to say that now having completed this it is one of my favourites. It was very enjoyable to watch and it was also at some points emotional. It keeps you hooked into the series in order to find out what happens and what the end outcome is. I actually was quite happy with how the anime turned out and how well it was put together, I loved the idea and concept of a Gun Battle and the character developments made this even more interesting to carry on watching.P.S. This could totally be turned into a Yuri/Yaoi haha!~ Canaan*Spoiler*Was upset that at the end of the series she still never mentioned that she is a she and not actually a he, so hoping for a second season at least for a follow up. of her everyday life before getting straight into the main event.The story was well designed, about a tournament between Gun Shooting (Pretty much BB Pellets) and this team that Hotaru finds herself in.

Either through stunning visuals, or an interesting synopsis, we dive into an anime world knowing full well it might just end up being 'meh.' Right, so here I arrive with this anime, Aoharu x Kikanjuu.Story: It was a 'good' story. The whole premise of them becoming the best in Japan at survival games was interesting, and kept me in it for the long run. What I didn't like is how they kept speeding things up further than they'd need to, they squished a...lot into one 12 episode anime leaving me somewhat unsatisfied.Art: Possibly the strongest point this anime had. The action scenes were what kept me watching this, and the creepy close up shots on many of the characters faces made the show have stunning visuals (like I said above). The designs of characters and more specifically the secondary characters uniforms were really cool. I mean, it wasn't gurren lagann level of fantastic art, but it was really SHINY.Sound: The sound felt out of place to be honest, there was too much elevator music. It's literally what you would of listened to waiting to get to the floor of your hotel room. It seemed too jazzy for the show, as no one really had a jazzy personality. Not even Mattsun had that spunky of a personality. The music didn't match the story. Regarding the intro song, it was fun to listen to. So the whole soundtrack wasn't a whole miss. And it wasn't making my ears fall off or anything. The voices were just okay. I thought midori's voice did a good job highlighting him being very sadistic and Yukki's voice matching him as being pretty dull/interested in perverted things.Character:I kind of wish this was a shounen-ai so instead of deliberately hiding that the main character is a girl most of the show, they'd of just had her as a him. The main 'girl' is pretty unfeminine and looks more like a uke to me.If you like that the main character is a justice freak, well, you'll have a ball, but she falls a little flat in development. Not just physical (budum bum).I liked the dynamics between the secondary character team and the first, but the characters really weren't developed  any further than just being a tool to the action of the story and humor. It was ALL about the survival games and the friendship that made no sense to of been made (besides sharing an interest) and the loss of friendship. If you're okay with characters having no individuality past being 'sadistic' 'masochistic' 'bloodthirsty,' or 'mundane' then I guess you can watch it.Overall:It wasn't a BAD show by any means. It had great action, the art was spectacular, and it COULD be interesting at times. So it's a good action story that doesn't take up much time, and it's about a game that some of us play, and the passion that comes with it.

"", ""Picture the bishounens of Ouran High School Host Club with guns. Toy guns.Yeah, it's about good-looking guys playing in survival games. Although those who have watched Ouran High will primarily notice so many similarities between these two shows that it kinda creeps you out.But don't worry, as the story progresses the similarities will fade out.STORY-6The one thing I noticed about the story is the pacing. The pacing is inconsistent; some things that could be resolved quickly were dragged and things that are supposed to be given more screen time is cut short.For example, Tachibana the MC was almost immediately free of his debt, after...we witnessed them playing like once or twice. The same goes for the biggest event;TGC, after Toy Gun Gun's (the MC'S group) match with Hoshishiro, there wasn't even a glimpse of the other teams' fight! It ended just like that.

I have held my uncle’s small pistol, though. He carries it around for self-defense purposes. He let me hold the weapon during a birthday party for one of my relatives, and I, rather stupidly, raised the gun up instead of aiming it downwards. Everyone was quick to yell at me and for good reason. Guns are dangerous. We watch action flicks, we play first-person shooters, and we read jokes about weapons, desensitizing us to their power. It is not until one is wielded that someone truly understands what it is...that he or she is holding.Before real guns, there are the imitations, usually called BB guns. They shoot pellets, not bullets, but they are still dangerous and, for some, as fun as the real thing. Aoharu x Kikanjuu is filled to the brim with guns of this type and the survival games that incorporate their use. Although the guns are not actually the focus. They are the setting for the anime but not what the anime wants to talk about. Instead, the show concerns itself with heavier dilemmas. Deceit, rejection, and perseverance which, coincidentally enough, each occur in the very games the show shows.My earlier recollection was sort of misleading. I have used a paintball gun before, during a friend’s birthday. I was there with a bunch of other friends. I had on the goggles, the camo gear, and the big boots. Running around the obstacles and pretending as if I was in a real warzone was fun. Then I got hit with a paintball. And it hurt. A lot. I remember the stinging, despite the layers of clothes I had on, and the welt afterwards. Though if I had a choice between getting hit with another paintball and watching Aoharu x Kikanjuu again, I would brace myself for the stinging.STORYWhere to even begin?Aoharu x Kikanjuu is a drama. Ironically, that is one of the anime’s biggest problems. The setting and subject matter, while filled with adrenaline, is not an intense pastime. It is not supposed to be taken extremely seriously. But the anime refuses to follow this sentiment. Instead, the show takes this fun and nonlethal activity and turns it into the most over-the-top and overly dramatized piece. The show always showcases the events, such as the main competition or a duel in the woods, as life-or-death scenarios, contrasting too heavily with the fun hobby that the characters partake in. The anime tries so hard to be dramatic but because the subject matter is not as emotionally-driven as it believes itself to be, the result is the feeling that something is off. That something is just not working.This feeling persists throughout the entire season because Aoharu x Kikanjuu almost exclusively focuses on drama. Said drama permeates everything; whether it is Matsuoka pushing Tachibana out of a door or Yukimura arguing with Matsuoka, the anime always grossly dramatizes whatever happens to exist on screen. Comedic bits exist, but these moments are quick interjections rather than a focal point. The comedy works better than the drama, but since the drama comes off as awkward, the comedy is unable to act as the buffer it was designed to be. Thus, instead of resting alongside the drama, the comedy is jarring, breaking what was already hurting.But the drama being as ineffective as it is does not explain why the drama itself turns out that way. So, what is causing the show to, figuratively speaking, shoot itself in the foot? This leads into the second problem: the monologues. The plurality is slightly misleading; there are more monologues in Aoharu x Kikanjuu than there are guns in the anime. That is a lot of time spent on monologues. Yet, again, monologues on their own are not inherently negative. In fact, monologues are often nice ways of conveying the inner thoughts of a character that might normally be impossible to hear. Aoharu x Kikanjuu, however, does not use monologues of this kind regularly. Instead, the anime opts for the messiest options. Tachibana will commentate on the most obvious of happenings. She might raise questions that the audience is already pondering. Or she may recount, word for word, what she is about to do or what someone else has done or felt. In short, the anime does the complete opposite of the “show; don’t tell” philosophy by constantly telling everything that is going on, at all times. This stream of monologues is not only relegated to Tachibana. Matsuoka, Yukimura, and even some of the unimportant side characters frequently describe exactly what is going on around them, to the point that the audience would not even have to be watching the anime in order to understand what is occurring on-screen.The third problem also explains why the heavy drama never seems to act as intended. Flashbacks are rampant throughout the season. Much like the monologues, flashbacks on their own are not an issue. They are used to reveal the pasts of characters to develop said characters or to present events outside of a chronological order. That is to say, flashbacks, when used correctly, serve a wonderful purpose. Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not use flashbacks correctly. Instead, almost every single flashback is used to recount a specific moment from the season. A character said that one thing? Flashback. Someone is trying to remember what happened during the match? Flashback. Currently in a battle? Flashback. There are some nice uses of flashbacks within the anime – Tachibana’s best friend has a flashback that encourages Tachibana to move forward and Matsuoka’s character is largely developed through flashback. But the vast majority of the flashbacks exist as nothing more than unnecessary interjections that chop up the events portrayed and, subsequently, prevents the drama from being as emotional as it wants to be.Arguably one of the most important plot points – the reason for the disbandment of “Toy Gun Gun” – is based on a flashback. More specifically, it is initially given as a false flashback. Lying is a staple theme in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, evidenced by Tachibana’s gender-hiding ruse. Her lie shapes the way the plot progresses. She is let onto the team because she lied, she is motivated by the original lie, and she loses the main tournament because of her lie. Her lie is a white lie but it permeates the anime from start to finish.Therefore, it is not inconceivable to assume that the show handles this theme appropriately, but the fourth problem is encountered instead. Aoharu x Kikanjuu strangely concludes without Tachibana coming clean. A lot of fuss about her predicament is brought up as the show nears its end. It seems as if the anime is going to reach the type of resolution befitting the show’s own ideas. But no. The anime elects to keep the lying. Despite Yukimura explaining what really went down years ago. Despite the enemy not revealing her secret so that she could tell them herself. Despite the countless opportunities she had to tell her comrades and friends the truth. The anime ends with the group determined and closer than ever, yet Tachibana’s lie still persists, making the whole lying concept more of an aside rather than the important motif it was meant to be.Why is it that Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not bring closure to its theme? The main reason is to leave it up in the air as a possible point of contention in a continuation. This, quite frankly, is cheap. Her lie is a major plot point that is leaned on constantly throughout the season but is ultimately quasi-closed – Tachibana is hopeful that a future chance will arrive for her to finally reveal who she really is, but the audience never sees said chance. This highlights the fifth and final problem of Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s narrative: the inept handling of specific scenes. The ending is only the beginning.Another weird moment is when the anime emphasizes a seemingly important character at the café Tachibana, Midori, and Fujimon visit. His face glowers at the mention of “Toy Gun Gun” because he is, presumably, the second member to have voluntarily left the group (before Tachibana and after the first girl). But nothing ever happens with this man. He does not show up again let alone has a role in the narrative. Another example is the main tournament, TGC. There is a ton of build-up to the tournament, such as its purpose, its meaning, and so on. Furthermore, most shows would have the two rivals square off at or near the end in order to build even more tension. But in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, the battle happens in the very first round. The audience does not get to the see the TGC event at all, reducing the overall amount of gunplay shown and the overall amount of tension. Then, when Tachibana, Matsuoka, and Yukimura lose, the anime skips ahead, ruining the pacing that had already been established. These two examples are the most egregious in terms of breaking the narrative, but there are other examples. The ridiculous gun duel at Matsuoka’s place of work and Tachibana walking into a hospital with a large black bag that contained her (fake) gun are more instances where the anime simply does not make sense.Five major problems in total for Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s narrative. As they say, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me five times…that is just unacceptable.ANIMATIONWithout a doubt, Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s strongest facet is the art and the animation that it contains.The art especially has an elevated amount of quality. Forested areas are rife with detail, as are the apartments of the characters and the city areas they visit – the gun shop, a café, and so on. Contrary to the drama’s execution in the narrative, the drama further boosts the art. Sinister depictions of elite gun wielders, shifted camera placements for demented shots, and fluffy edges for the flashback sequences are varied ways in which the anime diversifies its artistic direction. Other examples, such as special particle effects for pellets hitting targets and the menacing eyes and smiles of the characters, further demonstrate how dedicated Aoharu x Kikanjuu is to making its art as dramatic as possible.Actual animation can be hit or miss, but for the most part the anime manages to, once again, use a lot of tricks that make its animation more involved than it otherwise should be. One of the more intricate scenes is when Midori outs Tachibana to confuse her temporarily. When Tachibana gets shot in the head, the anime goes into slow-motion. While slow-motion animation is common, the environment was currently in a thunderstorm, meaning the rain droplets slowed down as well. The rain helps to accentuate the slow-motion, even more so when this effect is used for only a few seconds – everything is normally animated, the slow-motion is used, then the show snaps back to its normal animation. A sequence like this is rarer, though. Tachibana jumping off of a mini-gun or her flying through the air while shooting her own weapon are nice to see but the anime, due to the constant stream of monologues, has a lot of characters standing around and talking, either to themselves or to the person next to them.Still, the extent of the actual animation is nothing to scoff at. Despite the more animation-intensive moments being the exception, the anime has its cast running around shooting their guns quite a bit. Not every episode has them taking part in a battle, but enough are present to make the anime feel as if it is focusing on the gunplay. Besides the running and the shooting, characters also have hair, limb, eye, and mouth movements during the season that equate to a higher amount of actual animation and subsequently better overall execution.The character designs are the only section of the art and animation that are not as grand. Tachibana, while androgynous in her depiction, is a bit too plain. Beige hair, green eyes, and constant school uniform make her out to have quite the dull design. Matsuoka is handsome, with his spiky blonde hair and pretty face, but this side of him only really comes out when he is on the job. If anyone, though, has an argument for their design, it would be Yukimura. His glasses, black and frazzled hair, and long-sleeved sweater paint him as the recluse that he is. To be fair, when the characters are participating in their survival games, their designs change. Jackets, scarves, and hats replace their regular attire to help the audience understand the transition from normal to game life. These, at the very least, demonstrate that the anime put some thought into the designs of the cast.Of course, this is technically a realistic setting, so having wacky character designs would go against said realism. However, the lack of aesthetic appeal in the designs does little to improve the impact of the cast, consequently reducing the effectiveness of the drama and therefore the execution of the anime.CHARACTERSFor Aoharu x Kikanjuu, the cast once again misses the target so much one would not be mistaken in thinking that this was not an anime about shooting guns.The first oddity is the anime’s fixation on obsession. Not with the guns but with the people. Yukimura, Fujimon, and Ichi each have an unhealthy obsession with the leader of their group, Matsuoka for the former and Midori for the latter two. Fujimon’s is based on a masochistic fetish and Ichi has romantic feelings for Midori. Characterizations, but they are unfounded. Both Fujimon and Ichi never have their backgrounds explored, their infatuation with Midori less a cute connection and more a weird relationship. Yukimura fares slightly better; in the past, he was betrayed by people he thought he could call friends. The only person to stand up for Yukimura was none other than Matsuoka. Yukimura still turns into the loner he is, though. He secludes himself, focusing on his (perverted) work, himself, and, most important to him, Matsuoka, the only friend he could truly call his friend. Thus, his obsession with Matsuoka, while still a bit strange, has some sort of reasoning behind it.But that is the extent of Yukimura’s character. Outside of this beginning revelation, he contributes little else besides the occasional perverted joke or plea for help. This affects all of the characters – nobody seems to have “enough” about them. Matsuoka is known as a swinger of sorts. It is not until the final episode that the audience learns of his fear of rejection. That is why he works as a swinger; surrounding himself with other people compensates for the hole he has in his heart. That is quite the nice character trait in terms of writing. Yet, similar and opposite to Yukimura, this trait is revealed once at the conclusion. Having his last few lines about his person at the end are fine, it is Aoharu x Kikanjuu never hinting at such a deeply troubling issue – at all – throughout the season that comes off as sloppy. As if the anime had forgotten to make his character relevant during the season until it was too little, too late.Midori, unlike both Yukimura and Matsuoka, has a bit more going for him. By day, Midori is a doctor, saving the lives of the people who visit him. By night, Midori reveals his true personality, that of a deranged and psychotic sadist who relishes in the pain of the enemies he “kills” during the survival game matches. He is two-faced, but he understands how to separate his one life from the other. Midori is arrogant, cocky, and manipulative, all of the makings of an evil villain. Though he is not all evil; he guides Tachibana towards fixing her relationship with Matsuoka and, while his crazy actions are in fact insane, his feud with Matsuoka is not entirely his fault. In this way, he is to some degree a complex character.Tachibana is somewhat similar in the sense that she, too, is two-faced. This obviously applies to her gender reversal. She is a girl who acts and looks like a boy, but she is not so much acting as she is just extremely tomboyish. But this also applies to her main characteristic: a passion for justice. Tachibana has an immense sense of duty. She feels it is her responsibility to quell the bad in the world and to let the good rise to the top. Or so it appears. The “justice” she often invokes is a negative force that consumes her completely to the point that she becomes the very evil she seeks to quash. That is, it is revenge, not justice, that she pursues. Her lying about herself is also not the most justice-esque move one can do, meaning no matter how much good she fights for, her hypocritical nature contrasts harshly with her known behavior.For both Midori and Tachibana, there is “more than meets the eye”, but there is simultaneously nothing else for the eye to meet. The development they receive, especially in Tachibana’s case, is nonexistent. Midori remains more or less the same, conniving man as when he is first introduced, and Tachibana, due to the story’s stalling, never goes through her full arc. She stumbles along the way with the guns and her own determination, but those are dips in the growth graph as opposed to recognizable turning points. Matsuoka and Yukimura already have shown their own incompetence as characters. Adding Midori and Tachibana, the main antagonist and the main protagonist, respectively, into the same category only serves to make the whole of the cast an underwhelming offering.Looking at the separate pairings more closely, a pattern of parallelism begins to emerge. The composition of their groups mirror one another – two guys and one girl – as do the personalities of the people that make up said group – someone obsessed with the leader, a situational lunatic, etcetera. And most important of all, they all share the same passion: survival games. The two groups share a lot of similarities, yet there is a clear distinction between them: one is more successful over the other. Midori and his group have continually won the main survival game event for the past few years, indicating the closeness of their group and the power of their collective abilities. Matsuoka and his group, in contrast, have continually lost each year. Worse still, each time they lose they lose a member. It is three-fold: Yukimura’s abrasiveness towards others, Matsuoka’s own insecurities, and Matsuoka’s rivalry with Midori drive the third teammate away. Matsuoka’s group is never cohesive and always broken. The bonds they share with each other are not taut in the slightest. This is why he and his team fail whereas Midori and his team manage to win. Midori, Fujimon, and Ichi trust one another completely. “Toy Gun Gun” does not. Yukimura did not trust Tachibana with their storied past. Tachibana did not trust in Matsuoka’s leadership. And Matsuoka did not trust himself to keep both Yukimura and Tachibana loving the game that he himself had come to love so much.Now, this all sounds nice on paper, but the execution is a different matter. Even disregarding the lack of depth for Fujimon’s and Ichi’s characters, Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not make this comparison explicit. Individually the cast is placed side-by-side at times, but without the anime increasing the scope of its comparisons, the parallelism it was seemingly shooting for is lost. Furthermore, while the exploration of the relationships between Matsuoka, Yukimura, and Tachibana exist, the same cannot be said for Midori and his friends. Despite how much Midori, Fujimon, and Ichi succeed together, the anime rarely shows how close they are to one another. In fact, Midori takes advantage of Fujimon’s kindness and Ichi treats Fujimon with disrespect, as if their “friendship” is anything but. Meaning, the parallelism is not lost because it never existed in the first place.In the end, the cast of Aoharu x Kikanjuu is difficult to justify. Yukimura, Ichi, and Fujimon are clearly lacking strength, Matsuoka’s character is poorly handled, and both Midori and Tachibana, while characterized well, needed more throughout the season. And even though parallelism can be found, it definitely is not working as intended.SOUNDThe opening theme for Aoharu x Kikanjuu is rather upbeat, contrasting harshly with the anime’s dramatic mood. Surprisingly, the song is not overbearing due to the mellowness of the singing, once again going against the show’s usual overbearing drama. Still, the song can instill that feeling of longing, coinciding with Matsuoka’s, Yukimura’s, and Tachibana’s own longing for one another. A nice touch is the combination of vocalists that get all three involved in the piece which works well with the guitar and drum beats. Catchiness does not find a home in the first half but it does find one in the second half, making the OP an overall solid offering.The same cannot be said for the main ending theme. The ED is a smattering of noise, caused by the erratic lyrics, the tonal shifts, and the likeness in instruments to the OP. Vocal-wise, there is not enough power to match the piece’s sense of regret and eventual triumph, resulting in a dissonance between what is heard and what is felt by the audience. At the minimum, the ED at least contrasts nicely with the OP, providing a wider range of feelings – regardless of how expertly they were incorporated – for the audience to experience.Voice acting is by far the best part of the sound-work within Aoharu x Kikanjuu, although not everyone gives a grand performance. Mikako Komatsu as Tachibana uses a voice that walks the line between male and female, a perfect fit for the tomboy. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Yukimura demonstrates his chops once more with a reserved and higher-pitched voice to match the recluse and slightly effeminate dude. Tomoaki Maeno as Matsuoka has his moments, such as when Midori confronts him at TGC or is ashamed of his decision-making skills, but otherwise he provides an average performance. The same can be said for Kazuyuki Okitsu as Midori; he has the “holier than thou” way of speaking but does not particularly stick out from the crowd, lessening his role as the main bad guy. Finally, Ryouhei Kimura as Fujimon also deserves a shout-out for his subservient way of speaking when referring to Midori.As for the remainder of the soundtrack, the OST is another step down. Jazzy ensembles with blaring trumpets are used for the explanatory moments. Acoustic strings for the uplifting ones. Eerie tones that make the sadder scenes that much more painful. Standard fare for many an anime. Aoharu x Kikanjuu also includes an extra ED – played precisely once, at the end of the eighth episode – that is decidedly darker than both the OP and the main ED, fitting snuggly within Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s plotline at that time. And there are, of course, more emotional pieces, such as laidback piano tracks and reminiscing violin ones, all of which aim to achieve the same kind of emotion that the anime sought.Unfortunately, these more emotional pieces follow the show’s execution of its drama, being incapable of invoking the kinds of responses necessary for the scenarios they surround. And no matter which track is listened to, they are highly forgettable. This, combined with the fact that the most important tracks are not as impactful as they need to be, makes the OST lackluster.ENJOYMENTThere was exactly one – one – instance in the anime where I derived satisfaction: the scene following Tachibana and Kanae’s “race.” She acts like an awesome friend, a heartfelt message is given, and, best of all, a romance-oriented joke is had. Before and after this scene, I dreaded watching this show.I hated Tachibana’s persona. I did not much care for her sense of justice and her constant whining. I especially loathed her when she went psycho. It was a combination of the animation, art, and lame way she acted while going berserk. I could not take her seriously when she acted normally, so when she turned into somebody that was even more annoying than she was, I could not stand having or listening to her on-screen.The actual survival game sequences were boring. I did not find it fun to watch Tachibana or anyone else run around walls, a few metal barrels, and a heaping of foliage just so they could shoot a few BBs that sometimes found their target and sometimes not. For me, watching gun duels is just not exciting. It is a lot of sitting, stalking, and waiting, as opposed to sword duels where swiftness and deftness are valued more. Plus, every move in a sword duel counts. Each move has (literally) more weight. With guns, spraying-and-praying is a way to approach the enemy, one that the anime uses more than a handful of times, and in only a select few instances is hand-to-hand combat relied on. If I was the one doing the firing, then the feeling would most certainly change. But as much as the show tried, I simply could not find entertainment in the survival games they showcased.That is not the end of the torment for me, though. Midori’s impeccable behavior – where he does everything right and can never do any wrong, no matter what happens – is a character trait that immediately gets on my nerves. All of the monologues were grating quite early on, mostly because the anime simply could did not have the right type and amount of emotion throughout. The ending, where Matsuoka suddenly has feelings for Tachibana but he (understandably) has no idea why, is such a cheap way to try to inject some romance into the anime where none was previously present. These nuances range from minor to major, but since they all occurred within the same anime, they compounded to the point that I could almost not care any less about this show.Aoharu x Kikanjuu is survival game drama incarnate. Other than the nice animation and art pieces, the story is awful, the characters are a mess, their designs are usually boring, the music is hard on the ears, and the entertainment is nearly nonexistent. On second thought, make that two paintball hits.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, heavy drama feels unnatural, too many nonsensical internal monologues, misused flashbacks, theme on lying is poorly handled, and specific, inept scenes destroy the narrativeAnimation: Good, artistic direction follows the drama, above average actual animation, and a mix of detailed and boring character designsCharacters: Bad, Yukimura, Fujimon, and Ichi are very weak, Matsuoka is handled poorly, Midori and Tachibana are okay, and the parallelism between them all needs more attentionSound: Bad, okay OP, bad ED, bad OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Terrible, annoying characters, boring action, and other nuances quickly added up to a miserable experienceFinal Score: 2/10 that he or she is holding.Before real guns, there are the imitations, usually called BB guns.

The anime ends with the group determined and closer than ever, yet Tachibana’s lie still persists, making the whole lying concept more of an aside rather than the important motif it was meant to be.Why is it that Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not bring closure to its theme? The main reason is to leave it up in the air as a possible point of contention in a continuation. This, quite frankly, is cheap. Her lie is a major plot point that is leaned on constantly throughout the season but is ultimately quasi-closed – Tachibana is hopeful that a future chance will arrive for her to finally reveal who she really is, but the audience never sees said chance. This highlights the fifth and final problem of Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s narrative: the inept handling of specific scenes. The ending is only the beginning.Another weird moment is when the anime emphasizes a seemingly important character at the café Tachibana, Midori, and Fujimon visit. His face glowers at the mention of “Toy Gun Gun” because he is, presumably, the second member to have voluntarily left the group (before Tachibana and after the first girl). But nothing ever happens with this man. He does not show up again let alone has a role in the narrative. Another example is the main tournament, TGC. There is a ton of build-up to the tournament, such as its purpose, its meaning, and so on. Furthermore, most shows would have the two rivals square off at or near the end in order to build even more tension. But in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, the battle happens in the very first round. The audience does not get to the see the TGC event at all, reducing the overall amount of gunplay shown and the overall amount of tension. Then, when Tachibana, Matsuoka, and Yukimura lose, the anime skips ahead, ruining the pacing that had already been established. These two examples are the most egregious in terms of breaking the narrative, but there are other examples. The ridiculous gun duel at Matsuoka’s place of work and Tachibana walking into a hospital with a large black bag that contained her (fake) gun are more instances where the anime simply does not make sense.Five major problems in total for Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s narrative. As they say, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me five times…that is just unacceptable.ANIMATIONWithout a doubt, Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s strongest facet is the art and the animation that it contains.The art especially has an elevated amount of quality. Forested areas are rife with detail, as are the apartments of the characters and the city areas they visit – the gun shop, a café, and so on. Contrary to the drama’s execution in the narrative, the drama further boosts the art. Sinister depictions of elite gun wielders, shifted camera placements for demented shots, and fluffy edges for the flashback sequences are varied ways in which the anime diversifies its artistic direction. Other examples, such as special particle effects for pellets hitting targets and the menacing eyes and smiles of the characters, further demonstrate how dedicated Aoharu x Kikanjuu is to making its art as dramatic as possible.Actual animation can be hit or miss, but for the most part the anime manages to, once again, use a lot of tricks that make its animation more involved than it otherwise should be. One of the more intricate scenes is when Midori outs Tachibana to confuse her temporarily. When Tachibana gets shot in the head, the anime goes into slow-motion. While slow-motion animation is common, the environment was currently in a thunderstorm, meaning the rain droplets slowed down as well. The rain helps to accentuate the slow-motion, even more so when this effect is used for only a few seconds – everything is normally animated, the slow-motion is used, then the show snaps back to its normal animation. A sequence like this is rarer, though. Tachibana jumping off of a mini-gun or her flying through the air while shooting her own weapon are nice to see but the anime, due to the constant stream of monologues, has a lot of characters standing around and talking, either to themselves or to the person next to them.Still, the extent of the actual animation is nothing to scoff at. Despite the more animation-intensive moments being the exception, the anime has its cast running around shooting their guns quite a bit. Not every episode has them taking part in a battle, but enough are present to make the anime feel as if it is focusing on the gunplay. Besides the running and the shooting, characters also have hair, limb, eye, and mouth movements during the season that equate to a higher amount of actual animation and subsequently better overall execution.The character designs are the only section of the art and animation that are not as grand. Tachibana, while androgynous in her depiction, is a bit too plain. Beige hair, green eyes, and constant school uniform make her out to have quite the dull design. Matsuoka is handsome, with his spiky blonde hair and pretty face, but this side of him only really comes out when he is on the job. If anyone, though, has an argument for their design, it would be Yukimura. His glasses, black and frazzled hair, and long-sleeved sweater paint him as the recluse that he is. To be fair, when the characters are participating in their survival games, their designs change. Jackets, scarves, and hats replace their regular attire to help the audience understand the transition from normal to game life. These, at the very least, demonstrate that the anime put some thought into the designs of the cast.Of course, this is technically a realistic setting, so having wacky character designs would go against said realism. However, the lack of aesthetic appeal in the designs does little to improve the impact of the cast, consequently reducing the effectiveness of the drama and therefore the execution of the anime.CHARACTERSFor Aoharu x Kikanjuu, the cast once again misses the target so much one would not be mistaken in thinking that this was not an anime about shooting guns.The first oddity is the anime’s fixation on obsession. Not with the guns but with the people. Yukimura, Fujimon, and Ichi each have an unhealthy obsession with the leader of their group, Matsuoka for the former and Midori for the latter two. Fujimon’s is based on a masochistic fetish and Ichi has romantic feelings for Midori. Characterizations, but they are unfounded. Both Fujimon and Ichi never have their backgrounds explored, their infatuation with Midori less a cute connection and more a weird relationship. Yukimura fares slightly better; in the past, he was betrayed by people he thought he could call friends. The only person to stand up for Yukimura was none other than Matsuoka. Yukimura still turns into the loner he is, though. He secludes himself, focusing on his (perverted) work, himself, and, most important to him, Matsuoka, the only friend he could truly call his friend. Thus, his obsession with Matsuoka, while still a bit strange, has some sort of reasoning behind it.But that is the extent of Yukimura’s character. Outside of this beginning revelation, he contributes little else besides the occasional perverted joke or plea for help. This affects all of the characters – nobody seems to have “enough” about them. Matsuoka is known as a swinger of sorts. It is not until the final episode that the audience learns of his fear of rejection. That is why he works as a swinger; surrounding himself with other people compensates for the hole he has in his heart. That is quite the nice character trait in terms of writing. Yet, similar and opposite to Yukimura, this trait is revealed once at the conclusion. Having his last few lines about his person at the end are fine, it is Aoharu x Kikanjuu never hinting at such a deeply troubling issue – at all – throughout the season that comes off as sloppy. As if the anime had forgotten to make his character relevant during the season until it was too little, too late.Midori, unlike both Yukimura and Matsuoka, has a bit more going for him. By day, Midori is a doctor, saving the lives of the people who visit him. By night, Midori reveals his true personality, that of a deranged and psychotic sadist who relishes in the pain of the enemies he “kills” during the survival game matches. He is two-faced, but he understands how to separate his one life from the other. Midori is arrogant, cocky, and manipulative, all of the makings of an evil villain. Though he is not all evil; he guides Tachibana towards fixing her relationship with Matsuoka and, while his crazy actions are in fact insane, his feud with Matsuoka is not entirely his fault. In this way, he is to some degree a complex character.Tachibana is somewhat similar in the sense that she, too, is two-faced. This obviously applies to her gender reversal. She is a girl who acts and looks like a boy, but she is not so much acting as she is just extremely tomboyish. But this also applies to her main characteristic: a passion for justice. Tachibana has an immense sense of duty. She feels it is her responsibility to quell the bad in the world and to let the good rise to the top. Or so it appears. The “justice” she often invokes is a negative force that consumes her completely to the point that she becomes the very evil she seeks to quash. That is, it is revenge, not justice, that she pursues. Her lying about herself is also not the most justice-esque move one can do, meaning no matter how much good she fights for, her hypocritical nature contrasts harshly with her known behavior.For both Midori and Tachibana, there is “more than meets the eye”, but there is simultaneously nothing else for the eye to meet. The development they receive, especially in Tachibana’s case, is nonexistent. Midori remains more or less the same, conniving man as when he is first introduced, and Tachibana, due to the story’s stalling, never goes through her full arc. She stumbles along the way with the guns and her own determination, but those are dips in the growth graph as opposed to recognizable turning points. Matsuoka and Yukimura already have shown their own incompetence as characters. Adding Midori and Tachibana, the main antagonist and the main protagonist, respectively, into the same category only serves to make the whole of the cast an underwhelming offering.Looking at the separate pairings more closely, a pattern of parallelism begins to emerge. The composition of their groups mirror one another – two guys and one girl – as do the personalities of the people that make up said group – someone obsessed with the leader, a situational lunatic, etcetera. And most important of all, they all share the same passion: survival games. The two groups share a lot of similarities, yet there is a clear distinction between them: one is more successful over the other. Midori and his group have continually won the main survival game event for the past few years, indicating the closeness of their group and the power of their collective abilities. Matsuoka and his group, in contrast, have continually lost each year. Worse still, each time they lose they lose a member. It is three-fold: Yukimura’s abrasiveness towards others, Matsuoka’s own insecurities, and Matsuoka’s rivalry with Midori drive the third teammate away. Matsuoka’s group is never cohesive and always broken. The bonds they share with each other are not taut in the slightest. This is why he and his team fail whereas Midori and his team manage to win. Midori, Fujimon, and Ichi trust one another completely. “Toy Gun Gun” does not. Yukimura did not trust Tachibana with their storied past. Tachibana did not trust in Matsuoka’s leadership. And Matsuoka did not trust himself to keep both Yukimura and Tachibana loving the game that he himself had come to love so much.Now, this all sounds nice on paper, but the execution is a different matter. Even disregarding the lack of depth for Fujimon’s and Ichi’s characters, Aoharu x Kikanjuu does not make this comparison explicit. Individually the cast is placed side-by-side at times, but without the anime increasing the scope of its comparisons, the parallelism it was seemingly shooting for is lost. Furthermore, while the exploration of the relationships between Matsuoka, Yukimura, and Tachibana exist, the same cannot be said for Midori and his friends. Despite how much Midori, Fujimon, and Ichi succeed together, the anime rarely shows how close they are to one another. In fact, Midori takes advantage of Fujimon’s kindness and Ichi treats Fujimon with disrespect, as if their “friendship” is anything but. Meaning, the parallelism is not lost because it never existed in the first place.In the end, the cast of Aoharu x Kikanjuu is difficult to justify. Yukimura, Ichi, and Fujimon are clearly lacking strength, Matsuoka’s character is poorly handled, and both Midori and Tachibana, while characterized well, needed more throughout the season. And even though parallelism can be found, it definitely is not working as intended.SOUNDThe opening theme for Aoharu x Kikanjuu is rather upbeat, contrasting harshly with the anime’s dramatic mood. Surprisingly, the song is not overbearing due to the mellowness of the singing, once again going against the show’s usual overbearing drama. Still, the song can instill that feeling of longing, coinciding with Matsuoka’s, Yukimura’s, and Tachibana’s own longing for one another. A nice touch is the combination of vocalists that get all three involved in the piece which works well with the guitar and drum beats. Catchiness does not find a home in the first half but it does find one in the second half, making the OP an overall solid offering.The same cannot be said for the main ending theme. The ED is a smattering of noise, caused by the erratic lyrics, the tonal shifts, and the likeness in instruments to the OP. Vocal-wise, there is not enough power to match the piece’s sense of regret and eventual triumph, resulting in a dissonance between what is heard and what is felt by the audience. At the minimum, the ED at least contrasts nicely with the OP, providing a wider range of feelings – regardless of how expertly they were incorporated – for the audience to experience.Voice acting is by far the best part of the sound-work within Aoharu x Kikanjuu, although not everyone gives a grand performance. Mikako Komatsu as Tachibana uses a voice that walks the line between male and female, a perfect fit for the tomboy. Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Yukimura demonstrates his chops once more with a reserved and higher-pitched voice to match the recluse and slightly effeminate dude. Tomoaki Maeno as Matsuoka has his moments, such as when Midori confronts him at TGC or is ashamed of his decision-making skills, but otherwise he provides an average performance. The same can be said for Kazuyuki Okitsu as Midori; he has the “holier than thou” way of speaking but does not particularly stick out from the crowd, lessening his role as the main bad guy. Finally, Ryouhei Kimura as Fujimon also deserves a shout-out for his subservient way of speaking when referring to Midori.As for the remainder of the soundtrack, the OST is another step down. Jazzy ensembles with blaring trumpets are used for the explanatory moments. Acoustic strings for the uplifting ones. Eerie tones that make the sadder scenes that much more painful. Standard fare for many an anime. Aoharu x Kikanjuu also includes an extra ED – played precisely once, at the end of the eighth episode – that is decidedly darker than both the OP and the main ED, fitting snuggly within Aoharu x Kikanjuu’s plotline at that time. And there are, of course, more emotional pieces, such as laidback piano tracks and reminiscing violin ones, all of which aim to achieve the same kind of emotion that the anime sought.Unfortunately, these more emotional pieces follow the show’s execution of its drama, being incapable of invoking the kinds of responses necessary for the scenarios they surround. And no matter which track is listened to, they are highly forgettable. This, combined with the fact that the most important tracks are not as impactful as they need to be, makes the OST lackluster.ENJOYMENTThere was exactly one – one – instance in the anime where I derived satisfaction: the scene following Tachibana and Kanae’s “race.” She acts like an awesome friend, a heartfelt message is given, and, best of all, a romance-oriented joke is had. Before and after this scene, I dreaded watching this show.I hated Tachibana’s persona. I did not much care for her sense of justice and her constant whining. I especially loathed her when she went psycho. It was a combination of the animation, art, and lame way she acted while going berserk. I could not take her seriously when she acted normally, so when she turned into somebody that was even more annoying than she was, I could not stand having or listening to her on-screen.The actual survival game sequences were boring. I did not find it fun to watch Tachibana or anyone else run around walls, a few metal barrels, and a heaping of foliage just so they could shoot a few BBs that sometimes found their target and sometimes not. For me, watching gun duels is just not exciting. It is a lot of sitting, stalking, and waiting, as opposed to sword duels where swiftness and deftness are valued more. Plus, every move in a sword duel counts. Each move has (literally) more weight. With guns, spraying-and-praying is a way to approach the enemy, one that the anime uses more than a handful of times, and in only a select few instances is hand-to-hand combat relied on. If I was the one doing the firing, then the feeling would most certainly change. But as much as the show tried, I simply could not find entertainment in the survival games they showcased.That is not the end of the torment for me, though. Midori’s impeccable behavior – where he does everything right and can never do any wrong, no matter what happens – is a character trait that immediately gets on my nerves. All of the monologues were grating quite early on, mostly because the anime simply could did not have the right type and amount of emotion throughout. The ending, where Matsuoka suddenly has feelings for Tachibana but he (understandably) has no idea why, is such a cheap way to try to inject some romance into the anime where none was previously present. These nuances range from minor to major, but since they all occurred within the same anime, they compounded to the point that I could almost not care any less about this show.Aoharu x Kikanjuu is survival game drama incarnate. Other than the nice animation and art pieces, the story is awful, the characters are a mess, their designs are usually boring, the music is hard on the ears, and the entertainment is nearly nonexistent. On second thought, make that two paintball hits.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, heavy drama feels unnatural, too many nonsensical internal monologues, misused flashbacks, theme on lying is poorly handled, and specific, inept scenes destroy the narrativeAnimation: Good, artistic direction follows the drama, above average actual animation, and a mix of detailed and boring character designsCharacters: Bad, Yukimura, Fujimon, and Ichi are very weak, Matsuoka is handled poorly, Midori and Tachibana are okay, and the parallelism between them all needs more attentionSound: Bad, okay OP, bad ED, bad OST, okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Terrible, annoying characters, boring action, and other nuances quickly added up to a miserable experienceFinal Score: 2/10', ""Well then....

This is the case with Hotaru and her sense of justice (Pretty much Seryu from Akame ga Kill)It's not a bad series to watch, I enjoyed watching it and I can see that there will be a second season (Thank god). one gets super dark later on and the other is just comedy based.This on the other hand is like a mixture of both; just slightly.The story follows the world of survival games and how it came into Hotaru's life.The characters kind of annoy me in the sense that they are not really honest with themselves...It's interesting to see how the meaning of a word changes depending on a person and how different it can be from it's original meaning.

Some viewers may find the whole plot not very interesting and annoying, although others may be captivated.The story follows main character Hotaru Tachibana, a girl with strong sense of justice. After a misleading turn of evens, Hotaru ends up joining Toy Gun Gun, a survial games team.From there, the anime goes downhill very quickly. The weakest point of the anime is defiantly its lack of plot. There really is no main goal to be achieved, and the TGC isn't even mentioned until practically halfway through the anime. The...main issue of the anime is Hotaru's gender since TGG doesn't allow female members, which is very stupid. There are several ways that the anime defiantly could have been better, for example, by focusing more on the relationship and rivalry with Midori's team. We were barely introduced to their team and we had no background information on them until the last few episodes of the anime.The main saving grace of the anime for me was probablyy the characters. Toy Gun Gun definitely has one of the most diverse teams I have seen, and the interactions with them are hilarious. Yukimura is defiantly one of the most prominent characters in the anime, and he does a lot for the show. Each character has a unique motive (no matter how stupid or irrelevant, each protagonist still does have or obtain one throughout the series) and personality. The diverse characteristics of each protagonist make the interactions between them very interesting and humorous. The anime does a good job of blending in humor with action, even if it isn't the main focus of the show.The art was surprisingly good in my opinion, and made up for the lack of action and suspense during the fighting scenes. The anime was very clean, and the colors blended in nicely depending on the situation. The animation is nothing unique, or has no special features, but it is defiantly smooth in comparison to some action anime where the art is very choppy and poorly done.The music and sounds were also very promising, and did not disappoint unlike the lack of a plotline. For me, sound comprises of three main elements: Very good sound effects, voice acting, and soundtrack. When it comes to these scenarios I will say they hit these right on, especially with the sound effects. They really captured elements to add suspense and action to scenes even if it was previously nonexistent. The sound effects weren't overused either, but done just well enough so that it really enhanced the anime, and it made things exciting to watch. The voice actors were carefully selected, and I think each did an outstanding job portraying their own character.For overall enjoyment, I would say it is not bad, but not outstanding either. I found myself wanting to continue watching in order to see if there was any major character development throughout the season, and for some reason I was captivated by the interesting charisma of each individual character. Although very reluctant at first, I ended up getting into the anime, and I thought it was well done. However there are several flaws that could be fixed that could make the anime be around a 7 or 8. To conclude, I did enjoy the anime, as I got hyped to watch the next episodes, although I felt as if I could have watched another anime that would be more engaging instead. main issue of the anime is Hotaru's gender since TGG doesn't allow female members, which is very stupid.

You can't be relaying a story and the audience don't get it. Up to now am not sure what they trying to tell me or show me. I was basically lost. No conclusion, no thesis nothing. it was just stuff happening. You just know stuff happening but what is the stuff , can't say.In the end it was blank.

I would say that this show is kind of like Ouran High School Host Club with survival games, but not really. That feeling is only there in the first two episodes and then quickly goes away because it's a show about survival games. Also, it's not as well-written as Ouran.With that said, I really did enjoy watching it. It's more of a candy show than anything. The art style is amazing and the fight scenes are exceptionally fluid. Sure, the storyline is nothing to shout about and the characters...could have been written better, but the progression of the plot and the characters' interactions are interesting enough to not really care that there isn't much depth to this series. could have been written better, but the progression of the plot and the characters' interactions are interesting enough to not really care that there isn't much depth to this series."", ""This review will be short and have very little to no spoilers, but if there's any, you'll be warned ahead. If you haven't read the plot or watched the anime, here's a summary:(you can skip this)After moving, Tachibana Hotaru finds herself playing a new kind of survival games with Matsuoka Masamune and Yukimura Tooru. This anime follows her life as she matures, learns about life, her friends and begins to fall in love with the game.Story: 9It's surprisingly unpleasant how we don't see more anime like this. It's funny, fast paced and straightforward, so if that's not your thing, I wouldn't recommend this. The makers...did a great job skipping the unnecessary details whilst allowing you to watch the characters, especially the main evolve and grow. It definitely kept me always coming back for more, and now that this is over, I might want to check out the manga. So, job well done.Art: 9They did a very good job at this, keeping it as similar to the manga as it could get. The fighting scenes and character designs were absolutely well done. You can't even tell that Hotaru is a girl which is a good thing because that keeps you on the same pace as the rest of the characters.Sounds: 8Although the Opening and the Ending weren't the best in my opinion, I liked the BGM a lot, especially in the fighting scenes. Plus, they brought some great voice actors; I mean Mikako Komatsu is the best at playing both gendered trap characters. (google that if you don't know what it means.)Characters: 10I have 0 complains. Amazing. Absolutely outstanding. You don't usually see such a great main female lead- no, it's almost impossible to find more than 3, and Tachibana was one of them. Not only does she mature quite a lot throughout the show but she shows everybody how bad-ass she is! I was very pleased with everything about her. Her bloodlust is amazing, and she's very strong. On point.The rest were all good to me. Matsuoka reminded me of Tamaki from OHSHC and Ichi reminded me of Nobume Imai from Gintama.Enjoyment: 8Very enjoyable.  It excited me when Hotaru and her team were fighting yet never bored me when they were doing other things. Because this is spoiler-free, you might wonder why I have given this an 8 score, but if you watch it, you'd know.Overall: 9- GreatI would've given it an 8 if it wasn't for Hotaru really. She makes everything better. I hope there's a second season. did a great job skipping the unnecessary details whilst allowing you to watch the characters, especially the main evolve and grow.

The enemy is preserved as  a douchebag but in reality there is no story whatsoever or scenes that relate to him being a bad person but in reality scenes that show his honest truth.  In the end its al about a girl who is secretly shown as a man to...her teem mates so that she could play with them in matches that are hardly shown.

In general, it has a normal art with no depth.Sound: 3Again the sound is normal with not much exiting soundtrack but soundly matches the visual effects.Character: 3The characters have no unique appearance as they mostly nearly look the same with below normal character visual. All characters are skinny and look the same weight with no depth to how their skin differs.Enjoyment:3I sit watching it with a plank face, no emotion is shown in 95% of the time as when there's exciting scenes that you get really exited about but they instantly turn it 360& to turn you completely off and make you angry.Overall: 4As it  revolves around many secrets it has not given answers to many of the questions an audience would ask.  the story is below normal, art is average, sound is poor, characters are poor and the enjoyment is a turn off making it impossible to enjoy as all hope an audience wishes is sadly turned down.Would i recommend a friend to watch this?If the friend is in to gender bender girl dressed as a boy and wants to only see everyday life without any action or mystery being revealed then yes otherwise i'd never look at this again or give it the slightest recommendation whatsoever. her teem mates so that she could play with them in matches that are hardly shown.

Even the antagonists have their own meaningful backstories and justifications on their actions.The comedy is also really well done, the whole anime managed to make me sad and happy at the same time.As someone who likes airsoft, the anime does a good job at capturing the mood of an airsoft game, a lot of it is dramatized, but I don't mind because it adds action and excitement to the show.Overall, I love this anime/manga, after watching the...anime I read through all chapters of the manga and it gets even better.

When the people out there are expecting generic action stories, this turned out to be more fun because of the humor element. I really like how the serious and tense atmosphere can be so funny because I imagined there'll be a plot twist in the end.

It\'s actually called Seishunn X Kikanjuu, Say-Shun. Seishunn (青春）means adolescence. The direct/Khun Yomi pronunciation of seishunn (青春) is Ao Haru because ao--> 青 means blue and 春ー＞ means spring as in the season. BTW aoHaru don\'t make sense in Japanese and it\'s not a word. So the translators did a bad job subbing the title. Makes sense right? because Tachibana(the MC) is still like around 16~17 meaning She\'s still in her adolescent age. And throughout the story she is introduced with...the survival games which involves machine guns and all that stuff, which directly connects to a part of the title of this anime which is ""Kikanjuu"" (machine gun).  The plot was decent 8/10, characters were fine7/10, the cliffhanger in the end was disappointing but you\'re gonna get over it if you read the rest of it in the manga. Where at one point she reveals her secret. (trust me, it\'s the most satisfying thing ever) I typically fine anime that involves guns fun to watch so this one\'s in my good list. But I can\'t say that it\'s in one of my favorites list. At one point in the anime the MC showed some personality that doesn\'t belong to her. Like as if she has 2 personalities. But I guess thats what makes the anime a bit spicy. the survival games which involves machine guns and all that stuff, which directly connects to a part of the title of this anime which is ""Kikanjuu"" (machine gun).

Now, if you're an anime apologist who can't critique things outside of a little box you've constructed for yourself, then please leave. Now for the rest of us, we all honestly can say this show suuuuuuucccckkkkkkks.The story is simple, Tachibana is mistaken as a guy and now she has to go through her survival games and 'drama' with the guy friends, Matsuoka and Yukimura as....a guy. That's it. It never trails off into anything original....We're never given any insight to a richer story or at least interesting history between the characters that would elaborate the simplicity of the premise into something far deeper than we'd expect.The artwork in the show is quite average and serviceable at best. Visuals never push your heart strings nor does it flood your eyes with spectacular animation that'll have you grasp onto your seat. It's no Fate Stay Night, that's for sure. Onto sound, you'll never notice it, maybe only when they fight but it won't make much of an impact to the scenes themselves. I'd have to say the opening was the only enjoyable music in the entire series.Characters in this show are as 1-2 dimensional as you can get. It fails horribly, horribly, and I'll explain why. Tachibana is the your typical and generic heroine who never actually takes the wheel of the series and steers it into Valhalla. And don't even get me started on Tachibana's blood lust BS in SURVIVAL GAMES, as if she was in ACTUAL WAR and about to kill some people. That shit is more whacked then when Goku gave Cell a senzu bean, and that made more sense and had substance. But Matsuoka has it worse, for someone whom supposedly had a dark past, it's not even impacting nor will you care. The development and reveals we see throughout the show is laughable. The very reason for Toy Gun Gun's 'no girls allowed' rule is a joke because when everything is told to us by Yukimura it's a huge disappointment and underwhelms the series to a blackening shallow void. Yukimura is the only decent character who has some bit of....nah, he's just a tad better than the other two. Before, I said Matsuoka was bad, OH no, I'm just barely getting started, the main antagonists of the series have no fucking purpose or any reason to be in the show. They are assholes, simply, for being assholes. Sure, we see bits of flashbacks of Matsuoka's relationship with Midori, but it doesn't tell us anything. There's no main conflict (please, don't even count the BS TGC moments because that's just BS drama), there's no reason to care at all for anything or anyone. We're given exposition here and there but never anything solid as to what's going on. Why does Matsuoka fear Midori? Show us so that we will care and it will strive us to wanting to see the next episode. Yet it never happens. The flashbacks of the two other Toy Gun Gun members who left basically tell us nothing but that the main cast was in the wrong. No higher cause, or gritty moments, it's just poorly executed melodrama.Even for all the BS moments in Aoharu x Machinegun, I can honestly say I did enjoy a few scenes in some of the episodes. However, that alone, won't redeem anything this show has done. My overall opinion of this show is it's completely below average, mediocre and it surprises me that so many people like this show, and I cannot see why.

After several dark and depressing shows including guns this seemed like a breath of fresh air, as it is based around people playing survival games that means shooting each other with toy guns.The story tells us the tale of Hotaru Tachibana a girl with a serious sense for justice and possibly mild super-strength, who just happens to look like a boy. One day while trying to help out a friend she makes a complete mess in a club and as compensation has to join the club host’s survival game team. He thinks she is a boy as his team does not allow...girls to participate and so she has to pretend to be a boy. Later on she finds out that he has some deep emotional scaring regarding another team and Hotaru is determined to make him get over it, by helping him win a tournament against that team.Well the premise seemed fun especially as in the beginning it really looked as the characters are taking this whole survival game thing way to serious. Later on the story really evolved but at the same time became much more boring and not nearly as fun as in the beginning. The more serious the show tries to be the lousier it gets, but when it tries to be funny it can make lough out loud.The biggest problem with the anime is the main character as she is really annoying and not interesting at all. As I had said before she has this extreme sense for justice and when she thinks some injustice is going on she gets this almost superpowers to try to stop the injustice from happening or to punish the ones that caused it. This makes her annoying as she freaks out over practically everything. The final nail in the coffin is that she has this obnoxious voice so that I felt the urge to punch her every time she opened her mouth. To balance her out the other characters are all a lot of fun, especially the third team member Tooru Yukimura who is this creepy adult manga artist, who is always being called a pervert. The ”villain” is interesting as he looks like this nice guy but when he enters the battlefield he becomes this extremely cruel sadist and he even has his henchman/admirer.The sound is adequate, but at no point was I actually impressed by the soundtrack. The opening was awesome but as a counterweight I really disliked the ending so all in all it evens out. The art is much better especially the action scenes which can easily be compared to the best in class. The background are detailed and the people are well designed and recognisable, which is great for keeping track of the characters.All in all Aoharu x Kikanjuu is an all-round pleasing anime but it is nothing to be really excited about so it deserves the rating of a high 6 out of 10. It started out very promising but the way they tried to make everything so serious made the show more of a chore to watch then not. Still it is not all bad and you might not regret checking it out.

I really REALLY don't know how to go about this show. I initially watched the show weekly when it aired in 2015 but it gets harder and harder to keep up coz it just gets pretty boring and cliche to the point that I just thought 'why am I doing this again'. It's honestly a pain. I dropped it and finally picked it up 3 years later coz I just realized that 'wth there's only 3 episodes left so why not' so I tried to watch it again coz I wanna REMEMBER why I dropped it. And I guess I kinda...found out why. Yea sure some stuff made me doki doki and the notion about friendship and their love for the survival game are cool but... the only word that came up to mind after finishing everything was: pointless. Which I think is a REALLY harsh word to describe the show but idk what else to say coz even the good stuff doesn't made me feel better about the show.[Sound: 7] I like Hotaru's voice-acting. The opening & credit scene were alright. But again, just like many other animes I've watched, I can't seem to be blown away by the OST or SFX. Nothing really stood out for the sound except for Hotaru's voice and (sometimes) Yukimura's cute voice.[Characters: 4] I have a REALLY mixed feeling about this part. I like the characters. But I think I like them because they're MEANT to be likened by someone like me: a young-adult bisexual fujoshi. And honestly IMO these characters might not only appeal bisexuals or fujoshi. Probably women, in general, will find it easy to fangirl to them so I'm REALLY surprised that MAL would tag this as shounen as opposed to shoujo. I mean, we have a cool female MC who disguised herself as a guy and have this dangerous alter ego that's actually useful for her team in the survival game; one ikemen who's sociable & cool & popular; one ikemen who's a bit weird, quiet, and sometimes interact with the other ikemen in a way that'll make woman squeal; one yandere ikemen who's (despite being an enemy) is taking an 'interest' in the MC; and said enemy's ikemen male teammate who's absolutely devoted to said enemy even after getting harsh responses. I mean... I really don't know what to say. It seems like I SHOULD like them but they came off pretty shallow to me as if their only purpose is to serve as material to fangirl to and it's pretty sad. I DO, however, like some of the moments where they kinda develop a bond and build trust... then there's also the drama, pushing the other away, getting rid of trauma, etc etc... my heart pounds most of the time because yea I dig that shit but I cringed SO hard at the same time because goddamit HELLO CAN YOU BE MORE PREDICTABLE! Idk, I completely lost it at this point, really.[Plot: 4] I don't learn much about the sport but I guess that's my own fault because I thought it's gonna be more sports-heavy but it seems like the softgun is only an excuse for the show to throw in some cool action scenes and have something else at stake. The main concept was pretty unique but idk, just like how the characters are predictable, the story is predictable too.[Animation & art: 7] At least I can't deny that the art is really pretty. The character designs, the overall visual, the art in OP & ED. The animation was... okay if not better than average BUT the animation during the fighting scene is so so. There's no problem with it but there's DEFINITELY nothing special or groundbreaking in it. So I can't give it more than 8.[Average: 5] rounded from 5.2 found out why. Yea sure some stuff made me doki doki and the notion about friendship and their love for the survival game are cool but... the only word that came up to mind after finishing everything was: pointless. Which I think is a REALLY harsh word to describe the show but idk what else to say coz even the good stuff doesn't made me feel better about the show.[Sound: 7] I like Hotaru's voice-acting. The opening & credit scene were alright. But again, just like many other animes I've watched, I can't seem to be blown away by the OST or SFX. Nothing really stood out for the sound except for Hotaru's voice and (sometimes) Yukimura's cute voice.[Characters: 4] I have a REALLY mixed feeling about this part. I like the characters. But I think I like them because they're MEANT to be likened by someone like me: a young-adult bisexual fujoshi. And honestly IMO these characters might not only appeal bisexuals or fujoshi. Probably women, in general, will find it easy to fangirl to them so I'm REALLY surprised that MAL would tag this as shounen as opposed to shoujo. I mean, we have a cool female MC who disguised herself as a guy and have this dangerous alter ego that's actually useful for her team in the survival game; one ikemen who's sociable & cool & popular; one ikemen who's a bit weird, quiet, and sometimes interact with the other ikemen in a way that'll make woman squeal; one yandere ikemen who's (despite being an enemy) is taking an 'interest' in the MC; and said enemy's ikemen male teammate who's absolutely devoted to said enemy even after getting harsh responses. I mean... I really don't know what to say. It seems like I SHOULD like them but they came off pretty shallow to me as if their only purpose is to serve as material to fangirl to and it's pretty sad. I DO, however, like some of the moments where they kinda develop a bond and build trust... then there's also the drama, pushing the other away, getting rid of trauma, etc etc... my heart pounds most of the time because yea I dig that shit but I cringed SO hard at the same time because goddamit HELLO CAN YOU BE MORE PREDICTABLE! Idk, I completely lost it at this point, really.[Plot: 4] I don't learn much about the sport but I guess that's my own fault because I thought it's gonna be more sports-heavy but it seems like the softgun is only an excuse for the show to throw in some cool action scenes and have something else at stake. The main concept was pretty unique but idk, just like how the characters are predictable, the story is predictable too.[Animation & art: 7] At least I can't deny that the art is really pretty. The character designs, the overall visual, the art in OP & ED. The animation was... okay if not better than average BUT the animation during the fighting scene is so so. There's no problem with it but there's DEFINITELY nothing special or groundbreaking in it. So I can't give it more than 8.[Average: 5] rounded from 5.2"", ""Initially, I picked up Aoharu x Kikanjuu due to the interesting idea of a girl trying to pretend being a guy to play what is essentially paintball or otherwise known as 'survival games' in the anime. It seemed like it could potentially be interesting, but it did fall flat, due to various reasons which I will explain below.THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW. THIS REVIEW IS NOT SPOILER FREE. There are minor spoilers for the first 3 episodes, so do not read the review if you haven't watched that far.The anime Aoharu x Kikaniuu can be a hit-or-miss. However, I do believe that the anime does...get better in the latter half.Story: 3The basic premises of Aoharu x Kikaniuu is that Hotaru Tachibana is forced to join team Toy GunGun to play survival games with Yukimura and Masamune after she (disguised as a 'he') wrecks the host club that the latter works at, after mistakenly believing that Tachibana's best friend was tricked to spend money. Tachibana is forced to join team Toy GunGun to pay off the massive debt she has acquired. While the idea seems relatively decent but yet, nothing novel, it held potential to be relatively good.The first problem I immediately came across, was the pacing. The pacing of Aoharu was very bad. For example, in episode 2, Tachibana is forced into playing her first survival game and she finds herself not liking it, only playing it so she can pay her debt off. However, in episode 3, there seems to be an invisible time skip of a sort and all of a sudden, Tachibana loves playing survival games. There was no explanation given for the sudden change in her heart; it just happened and it was jarring to watch.The second problem I had, was the nature of the 'survival games' in itself. These 'survival games' are basically paintball, minus the paint and the main objective of the games are to 'kill' off the other players on the other team or in some cases, capture the flag of the opposing team by pressing a button where the opposing team is set. The survival games are often compared to war, the only difference being that the players cannot actually die. I cannot count the number of times I was mentally screaming, 'it's not an actual war, it's just a game' in my head while watching the anime.In this version of paintball (minus the paint), one would expect tactics to be used and for there to be displays in teamwork. Although the anime attempts to emphasise the importance of teamwork, none of the tactics are actually shown and brief introductions of 'positions' players can take are given.Furthermore, when players are 'hit', they are meant to say 'hit' and leave the playing field on their own will. There are many ways that this system can be abused, and while this issue is briefly explored in episode 2 where the opposing team of Toy GunGun plays dirty and doesn't say 'hit' when they are shot, this shouldn't be an issue in the first place as this rule makes the game rather fundamentally flawed in my opinion.The third problem that I have with the story are the plot holes. Many things are left unresolved or brushed off as unimportant.Characters: 4Aoharu x Kikanjuu revolves around 3 characters, namely, the 3 members of team Toy GunGun.The protagonist of Aoharu is Tachibana, a girl who for some reason, dresses as a boy in school and is often mistaken as a boy, which is a mistake team Toy GunGun also makes. She is a straight-forward character who has a strong sense of 'justice' (although, one may wonder where does this sense of justice actually come from) and she stands up for those who are unable to stand up for themselves or help those who are in need of help. She doesn't receive much character development in the anime and some may view her as annoying.The leader of the team is Masamune, a host who forces Tachibana to join his team. He does have a backstory to explain why he acts the way he does, as does Yukimura, the third member.Sound: 7The opening and ending are fitting for the anime. The ost also fits the anime and it mostly, pleasant to listen to.Art: 6The art is relatively decent, although nothing outstanding when compared to anime nowadays.All in all, I surprisingly enjoyed the anime (enjoyment: 7/10) and while the anime was jarring and the comedic moments can be a little over-the-top, it was relatively decent. There were many things in the anime that had questionable reasoning, but all in all, it was an average anime. get better in the latter half.Story: 3The basic premises of Aoharu x Kikaniuu is that Hotaru Tachibana is forced to join team Toy GunGun to play survival games with Yukimura and Masamune after she (disguised as a 'he') wrecks the host club that the latter works at, after mistakenly believing that Tachibana's best friend was tricked to spend money.

They could\'ve done much more with the series. Such as, extending the series since there is still a lot more story content. There are plot holes that leave some topics left slightly touched, but not delved into. It\'s these things that irk me the most.Although, this series talks a lot about airsoft, there was also a lot of emphasis on character relationships. I don\'t mind it since I do think that it adds on to why these characters act a certain way and why they\'re here....It definitely helps contribute to character development despite being boring sometimes.There was some character development with Matsuoka. It was kinda touching, but I\'m kinda a softy towards anime dudes. Hotaru\'s sense of justice are usually her motives for doing things, which I don\'t particularly mind. Although, I wish she would speak up more. She gets interrupted wayyy too much, lol. But I think that comes with the gender bender part.I personally enjoyed most of the characters, at least. I liked Yukimura\'s attitude regarding Matsuoka. It was kind of fascinating to see how much he cared for him. Also, Yukimura\'s blushing face dominated any other character\'s blush face.The animation was not bad at all. A lot of hair movement swaying in the wind. I loved the little pupil eye scenes, when they get mad or something. It\'s kinda hot. I enjoyed the animation, it didn\'t bother me.Anyways, this show had more potential but I think that one should read the manga for a more fulfilling meal of this series.

HahahaThe problem is the content of the story wasn't grasp well. Hope they fix that in S2So all in all It was cute and fluffy but when it comes to survival games genre a good plot twist would be...best!!Anyway if you prefer anime that somehow relates with Ouran High~~~ you should watch this!!First ever review I made.. best!!Anyway if you prefer anime that somehow relates with Ouran High~~~ you should watch this!!First ever review I made.."", ""This is my first review I've done on an anime series.This was a very enjoyable series and I wasn't expecting it to have so much action in it. I love that the story focuses on a female protagonist, who despite not wanting her friends and others to find out her gender, she is a person who loves justice. There are a few funny moments in the series that help break the tension throughout the series and it has a lot of awesome battle moments. I wish the anime hadn't left plot gaps but I still loved both the anime and the manga series. "", '---------------This Review Contains Spoilers.For your own good READ IT---*Generic Shounen based show till the end!Cringe!Cringe!Cringe!*For this one i will start from the characters.The characters are well made with their unique personalities and back stories to explain how the got the way they are.The MC tho...We hardly know anything about him.All in all, the characters are well made,explained,thought and fitting to the main story.The story is a pretty simple.After losing a bet our MC is obligated to attain to some games that he soon gets addicted.There is particularly no serious plot or twists. Whatsoever there is a logical development as the story unravels.The animation is...really good,beautiful and detailed. You can notice small things like lack of sleep,desperation,frustration and other things that might be trivial, but there are still there and thats something praiseworthy!!The comedy is controversial.Someone can easily enjoy it (i personal did) or just get frustrated and loath it.That\'s why i think its 50-50 and neither good or too bad.The music is casual one can say. Nothing interesting or special tho there was actually some effort put in it, its not something worth the attention.However, its one of the few anime that while something big is happening there is a soundtrack playing behind.--------------------------Personal opinions and flaws------------------------------On the other hand, this anime is a generic shounen overload that tries desperately to create a serious atmosphere around some ""harmless"" games.It demonstrate blood-lust,killing intent,superhuman strength and other interesting stuff OVER A GAME. Even if you want to make it serious,no logical person will say ""I will kill you on the field with my beloved toy gun"".My point is that while it tries to be serious everything is completely unrealistic and out of place.Forgot to mention that it does not easy to associate with its Characters and their problems and really hard to approach it even tho its beautifully made(animation wise)...Lastly its not a ""satisfying/enjoyable"" one.Which means it will most likely leave a bad taste in your mouth when you finish it...Personally i would only recomment it for its beautiful animation,good fighting scenes (even tho are completely illogical) and semi-good comedy.You will most likely get frustrated right away and try to find a reason not to quit it.I absolutely regret spending 4 hours watching it since it literally offers you nothing.Reasons to watch it:-Beautiful animation-Good characters-<s&m jokes artist over everything else on that showWhy did you rated it 3/10 even tho your saying good stuff about it?!!?Because ladies and gents no matter how you look at it its a very bad show.Even tho I recommend it ,its solely due to the fact that a casual viewer can find it very interesting and enjoyable.A high demanding viewer will most likely find this disgusting and a waste of his personal time.This was my Shameless critic.I am leaving without remorse! really good,beautiful and detailed.

I didn\'t really like how whenever there was a conflict between the team they would make up like 5 minutes later...Or that the MC wouldn\'t listen to their team at times and would do whatever they wanted.Art: I really liked the art, especially when the...MC has a look of ""bloodlust"" I think that was really cool during those action scenes where they would go all out. I like that they put a lot of detail into their outfits and weapons as well, and didn\'t just do really simple outfits or something. I also like how at the end of the intro it shows a scope.Sound: I love the intro I don\'t think I ever skipped it. I can\'t really remember but I\'m pretty sure they put a lot of sound into the action scenes, of course with the weapons, but footsteps and everything as well.Character: I think all the characters were pretty enjoyable, I like how the MC is actually a girl and can be tough, and the rest of the characters on the team say they won\'t allow girls on their team, but since they don\'t know that the MC is a girl they actually find them to be strong at some points and proves them wrong. I also like some of the characters have a split personality from when they\'re playing the game compared to their daily lives.Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime, I think it was pretty good, besides a few minor things I think that all the action scenes made up for it, although I do kind of wish the action scenes were real not just some kind of game, it would be a lot more interesting then, but it\'s also interesting to see them climb to the top as well.Overall: Pretty much everything was fine, the only things I didn\'t like was that the MC sometimes didn\'t work with the team well and would go off on their own, and I wish that I could\'ve seen what would\'ve happened when the MC told the rest of her teammates that she was a girl, it just kept stalling the whole season and wasn\'t even mentioned in the last episode, which was kind of disappointing. Other than that, because I enjoyed it so much, I still think that it deserves a 10. MC has a look of ""bloodlust"" I think that was really cool during those action scenes where they would go all out.

There’s a hot guy, a girl who dresses more or less like a guy, and a cute female friend that the main character is content with protecting. It’s all nice and dandy and the plot gets set up in a way that’s eerily like Ouran High School Host Club.However, by the second episode, the show already takes a downturn. Some behavior just doesn’t make sense, a game is dramaticized, the ‘being alone with three enemies during a...game and they all have fake guns’ scenario is described as somehow ‘traumatizing’ (come guys, if you’ve ever played even lazer tag y’all know that it’s not scarring in any way, shape, or form). On top of this, characters stop in the middle of fights to have long conversations and the common cliche of trusting people for no reason is overused. And this is only by the second episode!The characters are also very inconsistent and sporadic. By the beginning of the first episode, all of the character development is skipped to make it easy for the writers to not slowly change characters and personalities. Without even showing anything, Hotaru is suddenly obsessed with survival games though we’d only seen her play one. In addition to this, she has a ‘flashback’ of her teammates congratulating her for her first shot when she already shot the redhead at the end of her first game, after which there was certainly no celebration.There’s also some weird fetishs going on that seem to distract from the ‘plot’ (whatever sorry ‘plot’ the writer was trying to make here), not to mention the fact that the main character acts like she’s really close with the other boys but still wants them to know she’s a girl, which doesn’t really seem to connect. Just a few minutes after these revelations, Yuki goes bipolar again, Hotaru is trying to hide her gender, and she claims she doesn’t know anything about guns though she just admitted she was obsessed with them. By the end of the third episode, the introduction of the newest character saved the show slightly, but the main character develops new and frankly annoying character traits where she decides that the others are being overpowering and dictators though she is, in truth, the untalented one who has been screwing up the game for them. At this point in the series, I could barely remember anyone’s names, the plot was drab and didn’t make me want to keep watching, and everything was way too overdramaticized.I understand others are comparing this to Ouran, but I would like to point out that at this point, they were nothing alike. To begin with, I saw someone mention that Tamaki’s dramatic obsession with his club and these characters obsession with the game is similar. However, I beg to differ. While they are both obsessions, Tamaki obsesses over the club because of the fact that he never had a proper family and these friends became so close to him that they were like another family. He never learned how to love someone who he wasn’t related to, so he needs to but some kind of labels on these relationships so that they can’t leave him. However, in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, instead of obsessing over it for a good reason, at this point, all the characters are simply just overreacting for no reason and depending on the game with a creepy need that honestly doesn’t make any sense to me.Perhaps I would understand it if I was a hardcore gamer or into a competitive team sport like in the series, but as a competitive figure skater and martial artist, I haven’t ever been faced with this environment where there’s a war-like environment and all the mental instability blatantly floating around. This is only exemplified when the story about the female teammate comes up. Hotaru acts like she never even knew about this detail and is totally surprised by it. She engages in a two minute story-telling saga on the field (that is highly dramaticized and makes no sense… would you be that traumatized over getting ‘killed’ in a game? What’s sadistic about that?) and the ‘killing’ in the watergun field is all too over the top for my taste.Literally this entire series feels like it was written by a five year old. A five year old that was too scared to write a death-heavy show and was a little perverted. So they just greatly dramaticized everything. The sizes of the characters also keep changing. The heights in relationship to eachother fluctuate rapidly, along with the side of some characters shoulders, hands, etc.I did enjoy episode 8, however, and the introduction of our antagonists greatly highered my rating for this show. There was a lot of fan service for people who enjoy angst and seeing our favorite characters in pain: so basically people who are a little sick and twisted like I am.There’s also a lot of “you have to conform to your gender” shit going on that I really don’t appreciate. In all honesty, I ship Hotaru and Kanai more than any other ship in the show.Midori is honestly my favorite character. Fujimon is pretty adorable. This could’ve easily just been a fetish show for people who like the whole dom-sub stuff or the sadist-maschoshit stuff. I appreciate the fact that Yuki mentioned that he overdramatcized some details; otherwise it would have been much too weird.The opening theme and closing themes are alright, however.All in all, this became a very unorganized rant and I apologize for that.I recommend this show if: you really like guns, you like perverted characters, you like sadistic characters, you like the whole dom-sub pain thing, you like survival games but can't stand to see any of your favorite characters dieI would NOT recommend this if: you were expecting something like Ouran, if you wanted to see something original, if you expected something heartbreaking or heartfelt, if you want emotional drama, if you wanted romance, if you wanted pretty much any logical ships that weren't basically abusive game and they all have fake guns’ scenario is described as somehow ‘traumatizing’ (come guys, if you’ve ever played even lazer tag y’all know that it’s not scarring in any way, shape, or form).

Without even showing anything, Hotaru is suddenly obsessed with survival games though we’d only seen her play one. In addition to this, she has a ‘flashback’ of her teammates congratulating her for her first shot when she already shot the redhead at the end of her first game, after which there was certainly no celebration.There’s also some weird fetishs going on that seem to distract from the ‘plot’ (whatever sorry ‘plot’ the writer was trying to make here), not to mention the fact that the main character acts like she’s really close with the other boys but still wants them to know she’s a girl, which doesn’t really seem to connect. Just a few minutes after these revelations, Yuki goes bipolar again, Hotaru is trying to hide her gender, and she claims she doesn’t know anything about guns though she just admitted she was obsessed with them. By the end of the third episode, the introduction of the newest character saved the show slightly, but the main character develops new and frankly annoying character traits where she decides that the others are being overpowering and dictators though she is, in truth, the untalented one who has been screwing up the game for them. At this point in the series, I could barely remember anyone’s names, the plot was drab and didn’t make me want to keep watching, and everything was way too overdramaticized.I understand others are comparing this to Ouran, but I would like to point out that at this point, they were nothing alike. To begin with, I saw someone mention that Tamaki’s dramatic obsession with his club and these characters obsession with the game is similar. However, I beg to differ. While they are both obsessions, Tamaki obsesses over the club because of the fact that he never had a proper family and these friends became so close to him that they were like another family. He never learned how to love someone who he wasn’t related to, so he needs to but some kind of labels on these relationships so that they can’t leave him. However, in Aoharu x Kikanjuu, instead of obsessing over it for a good reason, at this point, all the characters are simply just overreacting for no reason and depending on the game with a creepy need that honestly doesn’t make any sense to me.Perhaps I would understand it if I was a hardcore gamer or into a competitive team sport like in the series, but as a competitive figure skater and martial artist, I haven’t ever been faced with this environment where there’s a war-like environment and all the mental instability blatantly floating around. This is only exemplified when the story about the female teammate comes up. Hotaru acts like she never even knew about this detail and is totally surprised by it. She engages in a two minute story-telling saga on the field (that is highly dramaticized and makes no sense… would you be that traumatized over getting ‘killed’ in a game? What’s sadistic about that?) and the ‘killing’ in the watergun field is all too over the top for my taste.Literally this entire series feels like it was written by a five year old. A five year old that was too scared to write a death-heavy show and was a little perverted. So they just greatly dramaticized everything. The sizes of the characters also keep changing. The heights in relationship to eachother fluctuate rapidly, along with the side of some characters shoulders, hands, etc.I did enjoy episode 8, however, and the introduction of our antagonists greatly highered my rating for this show. There was a lot of fan service for people who enjoy angst and seeing our favorite characters in pain: so basically people who are a little sick and twisted like I am.There’s also a lot of “you have to conform to your gender” shit going on that I really don’t appreciate. In all honesty, I ship Hotaru and Kanai more than any other ship in the show.Midori is honestly my favorite character. Fujimon is pretty adorable. This could’ve easily just been a fetish show for people who like the whole dom-sub stuff or the sadist-maschoshit stuff. I appreciate the fact that Yuki mentioned that he overdramatcized some details; otherwise it would have been much too weird.The opening theme and closing themes are alright, however.All in all, this became a very unorganized rant and I apologize for that.I recommend this show if: you really like guns, you like perverted characters, you like sadistic characters, you like the whole dom-sub pain thing, you like survival games but can't stand to see any of your favorite characters dieI would NOT recommend this if: you were expecting something like Ouran, if you wanted to see something original, if you expected something heartbreaking or heartfelt, if you want emotional drama, if you wanted romance, if you wanted pretty much any logical ships that weren't basically abusive"", 'ok. Excuse me for my extreme bias but for some reason I really liked this anime.Its like Interhigh, but with guns.Story: 7So, we have this main character who is a girl and looks like a dude who joins this survival team.Pretty average, ok. But like Tachibana is pretty hilarious and the idea that she\'s hiding everthing makes it above average. I cannot bring myself to give it a 5 because it was well knit into the whole theme of survival games, but I felt 10 was too high, therefore ""why not settle with 7""...Art: 10OK. LIKE THE ART IS AMAZING. Even in the manga it is amazing. The characters are well designed, and the animations are not choppy (unlike some animes I know). And the art really brings out the power that Tachibana has stored in her body and soul. And definitely fits the story and seriousness of the plot.Sound: 5To be honest, I do not remember any OST i have heard from this series, but the Opening and Ending were quite memorable , or they just stuck in your head. Also the character voices fit, Tachibana wasnt a squealing female character either and stuff.Character: 10 (biased)Tachibana is hilarious, Matsuoka is just like ""here I\'ll undress you"" and the audience is screaming somewhere out there. Yuki is cute and like that introverted reliable backstabbing character. (Irony I know). And as for the antagonists.... I mean unless you read the manga the antagonists are really mean, but there was one dude (sorry i dont remember names) in Midori\'s team (not midori) who was really funny. Most of the characters will end up making you laugh at some point. So why not a 10.Enjoyment: 10It\'s hilarious, it mixes some idea of Ouran Host, and the art was amazing. All i would complain about is the OST, but sometimes OST aren\'t needed for somethings and do forgive me as I watched this anime long ago. The story is well knit into everything and there are close to no holes in the plot since everything is mostly explained if my memory serves me.Recommendation: Watch it and please enjoy, unless you find Tachibana to be stupid then... idk what to say.

I hadn’t heard anything about it and the art caught my eye, so I decided to give it a try.Aoharu x Kikanjuu follows Hotaru Tachibana, a girl who gets mistaken for a boy almost continuously, as she ends up getting drawn into the world of survival games.  What I enjoyed is that these aren’t your average survival games where their actual lives are on the line for some reason or another.  These survival games are fought with airsoft guns.  I thought it...was innovative; it had all the action and suspense of an actual gun wielding anime without the numerous causalities.  So, I thought this anime did well.  It caught and maintained my interest throughout.  It had its flaws of course, but I still enjoyed it.Story: 8/10What I loved the most was the different twist on the “survival game.”  Instead of actual death, it’s all an airsoft game.  Of course, some people criticize that this anime depicts airsoft poorly (I do not know anything about airsoft), but of course anime over-exaggerates.  All those sport anime don’t actually portray what those sports are like in real-life, but we still love the anime.  I felt that way about this airsoft-survival world we were given.Another big aspect of this anime was the “gender bender,” which can get a little dull and ridiculous in my sole opinion, but this one handled it well.  The main character, Tachibana, does not dress like a boy, yes she wears slacks, and has short hair, a long with a small chest, but she is not trying to be a boy.  She just happens to prefer that style and everyone mistakes her for a boy.  That’s a huge difference to me than normal gender benders.  Also, with gender benders, it usually leads to awkward romance stories.  This did not have that.  This story focused on friendship, not romance.The story does feel very fast paced and even though it’s a survival game anime, you don’t get much of the games.  This anime had 12 episodes and instead of giving you more of the airsoft games you have more character interactions and the general world of airsoft.  I, for one, wish they had given just a bit more of the games because they were awesome.Characters: 7/10There are only 12 episodes so character-development didn't really happen in this anime.  It’s a shame, because I feel like they could have done a lot, but they didn’t fit it in.  However, the characters themselves are interesting.  You have a bunch of characters with twisted personalities, some more sinister and others more perverted.  Either way I loved the sudden shifts in personalities, especially with main characters.The backstories for some characters were given in brief tidbits, but a lot was left unexplained.  That’s one of my biggest problems with the anime.  They give you bits of backstory that could be really interesting, but they skim over it or bury it like it doesn’t really matter.  Again, only so much you can do with 12 episodes, but the lack of explanation really irked me.Art: 9/10The art was gorgeous.  Just awesome.  The action scenes were so cool and I loved how they depicted airsoft war play.  I wish they had more of it since it was so good.Overall: 8/10Overall, this anime was fast-paced, but I enjoyed it and easily binge watched the season.  It’s the type of anime that pulls you in, shows you something new, and entertains.  I personally enjoyed it very much.  It’s the type of anime I want to see get a second season, and if not, I’ll gladly go find the manga to see where the story goes from here. was innovative; it had all the action and suspense of an actual gun wielding anime without the numerous causalities.

This is especially so when it comes to shows that take place within the real world, or modern day Japan like this particular show takes place. If the suspension of disbelief is pushed too far, the story can become too overblown making the story difficult to take seriously. This can be seen in poorly executed melodramas. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if suspension of disbelief is not pushed at all, then the writer is at risk of boring the readers. Aoharu x Kikanju is one of those shows that pushes...things too far.The basic premise of the show is quite refreshing when it comes to recent shows involving a high school student as a main protagonist. Instead of focusing on school life and clubs our main character, Hotaru Tachibana, finds herself forced into playing survival games after causing major damage to a host club where Hotaru’s now partner, Masamune Matsuoka, works. At first Hotaru is reluctant to take part but over time finds herself enjoying the thrill of the game just as much as Masamune. This in of itself is a fine setup. It is clichéd and cheesy but it is something but people can relate to and is an entertaining watch.After this point Aoharu x Kikanju takes a drastic turn as the main conflict of the show gets introduced. This plot line goes into explaining why Masamune’s survival game team, Toy Gun Gun, refuses to allow girls in. And this plot line is really out there. The character that is depicted as the main antagonist of the show is psychotic. I am not using hyperbole. He goes out to these survival game events not so much as to enjoy the game but rather to see how much pain and fear he can instill into his opponents.In a fantasy or a sci-fi setting I could see this working as the rules of the society are difficult to pinpoint. Aoharu x Kikanju, however, does have these rules and even more so than usual considering the horrific displays of mutilation occur within an organized event. There comes a point where our antagonist has Masamune pinned down on the ground and repeatedly shoots BB pellets into his abdomen while simultaneously stifling his screams of pain with his hand. Surely this is a major breach of ethics within the sport. Surely if Masamune brought this up the tournament organizers could not just brush this under the table.To the show’s credit, these scenes of insanity are the most interesting and best looking parts. However, it really just seems like a case of trying to make a show more than what it should have been. What starts off as a fun show about discovering something new and exciting turns into a show about betrayal and seeking revenge jam packed with existential crises about whether or not they should keep playing.If there was only one thing that I can really take out of this show it was that Hotaru, Masamune, and everyone else involved really take these survival games way too seriously. Having a strong competitive side is one thing. Boldly exclaiming that you are going to kill someone for what they did while playing a game with nothing but seriousness in tone is another. things too far.The basic premise of the show is quite refreshing when it comes to recent shows involving a high school student as a main protagonist.

The characters looked interesting.  The main character, Tachibana Hotaru, especially caught my eye because she looked so cute and sporty.  The premise also seemed promising since I don\'t know anything about survival games but I love learning about sports and combat.  With all these interesting components lined up, it seemed it would be impossible for the anime to lose my interest.However, be warned, Aoharu x Kikanjuu is not the action/gender-bender/sports anime it promises to be.  Knowing that the series only had...12 episodes, I expected a fast-paced action series about Hotaru\'s predicaments and the sport of survival games.  It is in reality, a slow-moving, sappy drama about friendship with absolutely no central plot to propel the action forward.  For that reason, the series stagnates around episode 7 and becomes unwatchable by the time it ends.  Nothing is resolved.  Even the most important aspects of the ""plot"" are left unresolved.The plot is mostly the premise.  Our heroine Tachibana Hotaru becomes indebted to her neighbor and pays him back by joining his survival game team, Toy Gun Gun.  Her two team members have no idea she is a girl.  She becomes addicted to the sport and enters a tournament with her team.  She goes up against the team\'s main rivals and this is the climax of the show which is actually very well-executed.  There isn\'t really anything in the plot besides that.  The show tries to throw in a few dark, dramatic turns later in the series, but none are of great consequence. Surprisingly, unlike most gender-benders, this anime had almost zero romance.  I actually enjoyed the first half of the series, but the second half was one of the most puzzling and disappointing I have ever seen in an anime.The main character, Hotaru, is motivated by a sense of justice.  I liked her character overall, but got annoyed by her black-and-white sense of morality.  The other characters are interesting but nonetheless flat.  The leader of the team, Matsuoka works as a host and the other, Yukimura, is an adult manga artist.   Midori is the leader of an opposing team.  He has a messy history with Matsuoka and Yukimura which is never clearly explained.I gave this anime three stars for the three positive things I found in the anime.  The first one is the character Yukimura.  He was the only bright spot in the anime.  His character could have been rounded out more but overall, his character was original and charming.  Some might find his character offensive and I totally get that, but he was refreshing.The second was learning about the survival game.  I was excited for this anime because none other that I know of are about survival games.  The first few episodes focus on techniques and strategy, and I found that very interesting.  It made me want to get into the sport myself.Third, the climax where the team competes in the tournament  is easily the best part of the show.  If there was more of that, the show would have been rated much higher.

Despite it being poorly made, despite it being handled...lousily, despite it having bland ingredients it was still enjoyable.

Well then about story and sound I can\'t say anything good or bad. It was casual, nothing special, but also I don\'t think it was bad in some way.Story is... bad. Of course there is that TGC (teoretically not so popular topic) but it\'s a trick (just like time travel in ""Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo"" shoujo as well). They focus mostly on main character emotions and relations with hunk and hunk\'s friend so it\'s getting some mishmash with little of romance.About characters we have some mad chick...who\'s acting boy, some hunk with dark past, retarded wierdo and really, really bad guy (is he bad?). His evilness is forced. They wanted tangle Midori and Matsuoka past and make some depth into the plot. When story doesn\'t tange by itself I think it\'s bad idea to force it.Enjoyment: IT\'S SHOUJO anime. We have a girl and dark past hunk. She must lead him to the right path. I was suspicious from the beginning but at first I trusted MAL and later I decided to finish it just to close the story.Shortly I don\'t recommend it for men weak, forgetable story, dull characters and most important it\'s addressed to girls eventually to young women (or if I\'m wrong it\'s addressed to anyone). who\'s acting boy, some hunk with dark past, retarded wierdo and really, really bad guy (is he bad?).

I also liked it because I'm a fan of team-oriented battles, especially ones where the members must be eliminated. Content-wise, I felt the show was very much lacking. But I do hope that this show inspires more authors to make BB gun anime. In that sense, this show was a step in the...right direction.I would recommend this show to people who like team-oriented battles and BB guns.

The entirety of this episode/s is a battle scene. I don\'t find this necessary to watch for the continuation of the story and it doesn\'t add up to the plot. Rather, it introduces new characters which may appear in future of Hajime\'s journey.The quality is similar to the 2nd season of Arifureta, CGI dominating battle scenes and bright art. Don\'t...have any complains with this aspect. The studios (asread. and MOTHER) are doing a good job with consistency in the quality. Referring to the 1st season (which does not exist :d), the fans are blessed with potential sequels.The dialogues are mainly Hajime\'s harem quarreling among themselves, making it no different than a generic special episode. The conversation follows Myu treating Hajime as a father and monopolizing him with her mom. XD. I\'m no fan of a harem dominating plot either, and this special contains fanservice (not in terms of visuals).I don\'t really have much to say about this, but I suggest watching since it wouldn\'t consume a great deal of time. have any complains with this aspect.

Referring to the 1st season (which does not exist :d), the fans are blessed with potential sequels.The dialogues are mainly Hajime\'s harem quarreling among themselves, making it no different than a generic special episode. The conversation follows Myu treating Hajime as a father and monopolizing him with her mom. XD.

Black Jack: Futari no Kuroi Isha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1983/Black_Jack__Futari_no_Kuroi_Isha,"[""The Two Doctors of Darkness focuses on Black Jack competing medically with his arch nemesis Dr. Kiriko (from the older original Black Jack OVAS) while also trying to find a cure for a disease that could end the world.  Rock, a character from many other Tezuka works, such as Metropolis, brings gun fights and action to the movie to make the plot a mix of medical mystery, evils of corporations, and the meanings of life and death.Compared to the parent story (Black Jack (TV) series), the plot seems a little out of place since it is focuses heavily on the aftermath of war and...military experiments along with Black Jack struggling with hopelessness of being unable to help his patients. The tone better matches the original older OVAS than the lighthearted TV series.Overall, this movie is decent and certainly entertaining if you like Black Jack, but don't expect a masterpiece going into it.  I think this movie is more for those who enjoy the ethical dilemmas and darker tone of the older series than those watching this as a sequel to Black Jack (TV). military experiments along with Black Jack struggling with hopelessness of being unable to help his patients.

Cyborg 009 (1979),https://myanimelist.net/anime/4690/Cyborg_009_1979,"[""Let me tell you the strange tale of one of the most obscure cult-anime ever created. Back in the 80’s, when countless critically acclaimed classics were born, and movies like Akira created the first stepping-stones for anime to be recognized in the west, some countries were introduced to anime in a different way. This is not just a review, but also the story of Cyborg 009, the Swedish dub.The year is 1979. The cold war is fresh on people’s mind, the regime of Pol Pot just got thwarted, relations with China and the west are shaky, any opponent of the Bolsheviks gets funding from the...US, and mistreated chemical weapons leak from soviet factories. Cyborg 009 was revolutionary for its time, for being an anime that took on more mature subjects like politics, religion, and war. It was no doubt a moral compass for children to grow up with, inspiring a new generation to work for peace and be more skeptical. Today, in 2016, the show’s messages would probably be ripe for censoring, particularly for portraying religion as a tool to instigate conflict several times.Regarding the artwork, the animation is not impressive by today’s standards, yet has that old retro style that is hard to hate. Some of the cartoony designs however stand out like sore thumbs. One of the African main characters is designed in a straight-up dated and offensive fashion. At the same time, the fact that the show included such an international cast was probably regarded as a step forward back then.Despite its mature sides, it can’t be denied that Cyborg 009 also contains a lot of 80’s cheese, with corny inventions and cackling cartoon-villains. Already in the second episode for example, we see a fisherman try to stop an iceberg with a measly harpoon, which comically clinks off the icy surface, and the man acts genuinely shocked that it wasn’t effective. The series also doesn't hold back on the use of swear-words, dropping f-bombs and insults wherever it likes. If that doesn't convince you, one episode involves a man in a killer-wheelchair trying to resurrect Hitler, and that is only a small part of the weirdness contained in this show.This is where the Swedish dub comes in, making the flaws even more apparent. What truly happened is a mystery. Very little info is available about the production. What we do know is that the dub was made by a one-man-army. The translation of the Japanese script to Swedish was all done by a single man, a Danish man to be more precise. Worse yet, he clearly did not fully grasp either the Japanese or Swedish language. One episode for example is titled ‘Giant Lizards’, despite being about gene-manipulated plants. Amateur-hour didn’t stop there though, because the same man did all the voice-work, which would include the voices for all women and children in the story. The end result, bad acting coupled with such illiterate sentences that you’d think the characters just had a stroke, and females that sound more like shemales.While this is only speculation, it is also rumored that the video-tapes of Cyborg 009 were distributed through a porno-company, handed out along with other sleazy titles for free.This is all a great example of something being so bad that it becomes good, starting out innocent with a glimmer in its eye, yet turning out unintentionally abysmal. Being 50 episodes long though, it’s a very lengthy show to watch for the sake of comedy alone, so the action and political messages thankfully does bring more to the table. Cyborg 009 manages to entertain both with its good and bad sides. Whether it’s the Swedish dub or another version, the show gets by on its charm despite its flaws.

These four episodes were amongst the WORST WRITTEN stuff I\'ve seen in months: the action is completely nonsensical, the religious overtones are hamfistedly bashed in your head with no subtetly whatsoever (the classic of Tokusatsus Ultraseven, which I finished watching a week ago, was FAR MORE subtle...in its handling of religious imagery and subtext than this thing here even if it was made by an actual christian), there is always an ending deus-ex machina (the intervention of a god...?) making completely irrelevant the presence of the Cyborg(s) in the title, the identity of said cyborgs is unclear (they\'re humans or they\'re cyborgs? it doesn\'t make any sense whatsoever), the only thing this series has going for it is the chara and the mostly clear animation. Other than that, the rest is completely non-existant and I sincerely don\'t get how anyone could see this as a classic of sorts if such an awful start is of any indication. Avoid with no remorse whatsoever. in its handling of religious imagery and subtext than this thing here even if it was made by an actual christian), there is always an ending deus-ex machina (the intervention of a god...?) making completely irrelevant the presence of the Cyborg(s) in the title, the identity of said cyborgs is unclear (they\'re humans or they\'re cyborgs? it doesn\'t make any sense whatsoever), the only thing this series has going for it is the chara and the mostly clear animation.

A sequel to the 1968 series (and the 2001 series aired on Cartoon Network, a remake of the \'68 series), the 1979 series deserves to be recognized as a memorable series of its time, similar to Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato. However, its limited online availibility (had to watch the last 15 episodes in Italian without English subtitles, for crying out loud), could be the reason for this lack of knowledge of its existence. Someone should change that availability problem, but without further ado,...here\'s why I think it\'s so damn great:Story: With 50 episodes, there\'s a lot to choose from, and the creators really used them well. There are many different types of episodes, ranging from dealing with various villains (along with villains working for THOSE villains), backstories, and those centered on individual characters. Overall, they are enjoyable, but sometimes the frequency of similar plots across the episodes can be repetitive, and the episodes don\'t flow together as well as they should. Many INDIVIDUAL episodes, however, are wrapped up very well or end on a suspenseful twist, and seeing it all come together will warm your heart and leave you shocked, respectfully. All of it is balanced with action, romance, drama, and a dash of comic relief and horror, making it a blend of everything one could hope for from an episode.Its originality is also worth noting. I\'ve gotta admit that it feels good to see a great anime story that relies off of something like a team of cyborg superheroes rather than clichés like mecha, vampire/demon hunters, card playing/dueling, and/or high school slice of life comedies. Those genres aren\'t bad per se, I, in fact, like some of them myself, but a combination of originality and the quality of a work is what people remember as time goes on and as fads die out.Characters: The main strength of the show lies within the main characters, all of whom have apt, talented voice actors.Professor Gilmore is the glue that holds the team together. He\'s a strong mentor figure, similar to Gandalf from ""Lord of the Rings,"" and is always around to make sure that everything\'s going well and that planned actions follow through. His strong presence makes him hard to forget.009, our main character, is one that really struck a chord with me. He\'s a compassionate leader that tells the team what to do, and is an underdog with arguably the toughest past out of the whole team that just wants the best for everyone, from other cyborgs to random strangers he bumps into on the street. In terms of characters I remember from my early childhood, his overall demeanor reminds me of Arnold from the 90s Nickelodeon series, ""Hey Arnold,"" but 009 tends to be more serious in comparison.001, although a baby, holds the wisdom and knowledge of what to do, and is always willing to help out with his telepathic powers that many may underestimate. The shock value from one\'s underestimation of him makes him stand out.002 and 004 are similar characters. They\'re short-tempered, stoic, and can quite simply be dicks, but their style, realism, and hard work during tough battles make up for that.003, the subtle love interest of 009, is always looking out for the mental well-being of the team, and is the peaceful one always looking for alternative solutions for many things.006 and 007 are the comedic relief that can be found even in the toughest of times, and are practical with their superpowers, making them easy favorites.005 and 008, while admittingly the characters I found the most bland in comparison to all the rest, are members of the 00 Cyborgs that do contribute a very important role. 005, for example, represents both strong physical abilities and a strong mental ability, as his calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, together with his super power, can help out in any situation. 008, similarly, uses both his super power and his willingness to achieve victory by any means necessary to set everything in motion.The main villains of the show, from the Neo-Black Ghost\'s Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu, to the Norse mythology-inspired characters, have everything one could hope for from a villain: mysterious, creepy, dignified, elusive, cruel, power-hungry, and ingenious. The smaller villains, however, had less of these qualities, and because of that, they were hard to take seriously, and felt more like simple plot devices rather than pure evil that would make the audience shake in fear.Aesthetics: This show has a lot going for it in terms of the music, animation, and style. For starters, the theme song is relatively simple, but, unexpectedly, I eventually found it playing in my mind. Its ending song and background music are also very beautiful, embodying a peaceful, slow, nostalgic sound that I find less of nowadays.The animation generally flows well and looks pleasing for a dated show that didn\'t have the largest budget in the world; my only complaints are that low frame rate movements are rather common, and certain character motions look awkward and/or unrealistic. The settings in the show based off of real places are adequately designed as a whole, even though certain buildings aren’t very detailed. Fictional places, on the other hand, are drawn with great imagination and feel as if they could be tangible places.Its greatest aesthetic strength, though, is within the variety and overall style. The 00 Cyborgs will take you on their journey from Japan to the deserts of the southwestern US, the savannah plains of Africa, and everywhere in between. Due to the sci-fi element of the show, it also has that unique, late Cold War, retro-futurist feel that I really like, shown in everything from the fashion of the characters to the architecture and the technology.Conclusion: The \'79 series, compared to the \'01 series, has stronger, more in-depth characters, more immersive settings, and episodes that each individually have a good mixture of emotions and situations that end in a satisfying manner, leaving you wanting to marathon the episodes ASAP. Although the overall plot flow and purpose of the characters felt better in the \'01 series, the \'79 series is still worth checking out, especially if you can look past its age. So, whether you\'ve watched one of the other series or have seen one of the movies, give this one a go and watch the various cyborgs with differing abilities save the day by putting their strengths all together. here\'s why I think it\'s so damn great:Story: With 50 episodes, there\'s a lot to choose from, and the creators really used them well.

Doraemon Movie 01: Nobita no Kyouryuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3727/Doraemon_Movie_01__Nobita_no_Kyouryuu,"[""Doraemon as a series is nothing but pure, childish joy. Every bit of Doraemon which I have so far seen (which admittedly is not a ton) has filled me with a youthful sense of happiness which I think we can all relate to in some manner. Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur is no exception to this feeling, delivering a positive, educational and exciting film which perfectly caters to everyone.STORY - (6)Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur unsurprisingly follows the three act structure to a tee. The first act introduces Piisuke, Nobita's pet dinosaur and shows their time growing up together before taking him back to his time; the second act...sees Nobita, Doraemon and friends going on adventures in the age of the dinosaurs attempting to both rescue Piisuke and return home; the third act concludes with an action-packed fight against the evil dinosaur hunters. Through this structure, the film mixes in both some moments of slice-of-life comedy which the series is often known for, as well as some more action focused moments too. Additionally, the film deals with a variety of relevant topics and acts as an excellent educational piece for children, exploring and showcasing the world of the dinosaurs in an interesting and engaging way on top of demonstrating the evil and cruel nature of animal hunters. While the story was obviously nothing groundbreaking - anyone over the age of six will surely have seen the same plot a thousand times before - it still does a good job of keeping viewers interested and entertained throughout.ART - (7)The art of this film is overall well done for the first theatrical release in the series. The world is portrayed in a bright and colourful manner, lending well to the youthful and joyous nature of the film. The animation is also very well done, with the surprisingly large number of action sequences all being smoothly and well animated. As a whole there is little to complain about with the animation; its just there is little to praise it for either.SOUND - (6)The sound and music of Doraemon is another pleasant aspect of the film. As with the art and story, there is not anything overly mind-blowing about it - the soundtrack generally follows the typical, jovial orchestral style common to 80s animated films - but again, it does its job in adding to the ambience of the scenes. The film features three songs too: one in the opening credits, one insert song around the midpoint and one sung by Doraemon for the closing credits. Of the three, the first was my personal favourite; the tune was quite catchy, remaining stuck in my head for much of the film's runtime. The second song was much less upbeat, but still suited the situation well. Unfortunately the closing credits theme was much less catchy and wound up being a bit of an ear-bleeding song, albeit one which was intentionally done that way to remain in character. Luckily as it was the closing credits I was at least able to skip that section with ease.CHARACTER - (5)There is little to say about the characters of this movie, as the main cast is all there as usual at the front and center. If you have ever seen any other Doraemon episode or movie before you will know what to expect, which certainly is not a bad thing for a theatrical spinoff. Of the new characters to the film, Piisuke (despite being the focus of the movie) has very little personality of his own, largely due to him being unable to speak because he is, well, a dinosaur. The bittersweet ending with him is a little sad to see and does speak to there being some connection developing between him, Nobita and the audience throughout the film, but in the end this bond is really nothing more than a rudimentary level one created through his simple yet cute actions, rather than a deeper or interesting personality of some kind. The villains of the movie are also strikingly one-note; there goal is simply to capture Piisuke and not much more. Of course, these critiques do come across as a little nitpicky for a children's film, though it still would have been nice to get to know the villains just a little bit more.ENJOYMENT - (6)All in all, I did have a good time watching Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur. Though there was nothing particularly unique or different about it, I just couldn't help myself from coming to love the simplistic and youthfulness of the film. I'm sure a child would have an even greater time with the film than me, and I would suggest that it would likely be best enjoyed being watched with a child (if only there was a dubbed version), but alas it can still be a fun time being even at an older age.OVERALL - (6)Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur is a great first entry in what would go on to be an incredibly long and successful film franchise. As a children's film, it can easily be watched and enjoyed by people of all ages, with it's fun yet simple plot making for a good time for all. You don't even need to have any real knowledge of the Doraemon series to enjoy it; as long as you have heard the basic premise of the series you are good to go and watch. So, for all Doraemon fans, people looking to enter the world of Doraemon for the first time, or even for those who are just looking for a short, fun movie to watch - this film comes as a strong recommendation for me.Thanks for reading! sees Nobita, Doraemon and friends going on adventures in the age of the dinosaurs attempting to both rescue Piisuke and return home; the third act concludes with an action-packed fight against the evil dinosaur hunters.

Additionally, the film deals with a variety of relevant topics and acts as an excellent educational piece for children, exploring and showcasing the world of the dinosaurs in an interesting and engaging way on top of demonstrating the evil and cruel nature of animal hunters. While the story was obviously nothing groundbreaking - anyone over the age of six will surely have seen the same plot a thousand times before - it still does a good job of keeping viewers interested and entertained throughout.ART - (7)The art of this film is overall well done for the first theatrical release in the series. The world is portrayed in a bright and colourful manner, lending well to the youthful and joyous nature of the film. The animation is also very well done, with the surprisingly large number of action sequences all being smoothly and well animated. As a whole there is little to complain about with the animation; its just there is little to praise it for either.SOUND - (6)The sound and music of Doraemon is another pleasant aspect of the film. As with the art and story, there is not anything overly mind-blowing about it - the soundtrack generally follows the typical, jovial orchestral style common to 80s animated films - but again, it does its job in adding to the ambience of the scenes. The film features three songs too: one in the opening credits, one insert song around the midpoint and one sung by Doraemon for the closing credits. Of the three, the first was my personal favourite; the tune was quite catchy, remaining stuck in my head for much of the film's runtime. The second song was much less upbeat, but still suited the situation well. Unfortunately the closing credits theme was much less catchy and wound up being a bit of an ear-bleeding song, albeit one which was intentionally done that way to remain in character. Luckily as it was the closing credits I was at least able to skip that section with ease.CHARACTER - (5)There is little to say about the characters of this movie, as the main cast is all there as usual at the front and center. If you have ever seen any other Doraemon episode or movie before you will know what to expect, which certainly is not a bad thing for a theatrical spinoff. Of the new characters to the film, Piisuke (despite being the focus of the movie) has very little personality of his own, largely due to him being unable to speak because he is, well, a dinosaur. The bittersweet ending with him is a little sad to see and does speak to there being some connection developing between him, Nobita and the audience throughout the film, but in the end this bond is really nothing more than a rudimentary level one created through his simple yet cute actions, rather than a deeper or interesting personality of some kind. The villains of the movie are also strikingly one-note; there goal is simply to capture Piisuke and not much more. Of course, these critiques do come across as a little nitpicky for a children's film, though it still would have been nice to get to know the villains just a little bit more.ENJOYMENT - (6)All in all, I did have a good time watching Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur. Though there was nothing particularly unique or different about it, I just couldn't help myself from coming to love the simplistic and youthfulness of the film. I'm sure a child would have an even greater time with the film than me, and I would suggest that it would likely be best enjoyed being watched with a child (if only there was a dubbed version), but alas it can still be a fun time being even at an older age.OVERALL - (6)Doraemon: Nobita's Dinosaur is a great first entry in what would go on to be an incredibly long and successful film franchise. As a children's film, it can easily be watched and enjoyed by people of all ages, with it's fun yet simple plot making for a good time for all. You don't even need to have any real knowledge of the Doraemon series to enjoy it; as long as you have heard the basic premise of the series you are good to go and watch. So, for all Doraemon fans, people looking to enter the world of Doraemon for the first time, or even for those who are just looking for a short, fun movie to watch - this film comes as a strong recommendation for me.Thanks for reading!"", 'My overall take: A fine first entry in the Doraemon film series, but not the best of the franchise.Here we go, the one that started this impressively long-running film series. The premise of this movie is that the main character Nobita uses one of Doraemon\'s gadgets to revive the fossilized egg of an extinct marine reptile, a plesiosaur, and keeps the hatchling as a pet. Much could be said about the scientific elements of the movie (as a paleontologist, I\'m obligated to point out that Piisuke is not actually a dinosaur), but this is not the website to go on at length about that.Leaving aside...the time travel component and the fact that the pet is an extinct animal, this is a fairly typical ""child and their pet"" story in many ways. It\'s a popular narrative for a reason, and Nobita\'s relationship with Piisuke is certainly compelling. As for the other main characters, Nobita\'s friends—Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo—don\'t drive the story substantially once the adventure is underway, though they do get enough characterization that they don\'t feel absent. All in all, this is a decent take on a classic storyline, but it also reads as a relatively ""safe"" first attempt at a movie for the franchise. The highest of highs in the Doraemon film series are yet to come. the time travel component and the fact that the pet is an extinct animal, this is a fairly typical ""child and their pet"" story in many ways.

"", ""since I watched the remake before it kinda ruined this movie. I didn't think it was absolutely horrible I just thought the remake was better in many different ways.There were some unnecessary scenes that made it a bit hard to watch.Medusa's character design was scary but horrible.

This time around, Doraemon and Nobita have entered in to a parallel world similar to our own but with the existence of science being replaced by magic. All is not well in this new world as demons have come and it is up to the gang to save the world, with a new character called Miyoko Mangetsu helping lead them to the demon world to fight back. The premise was a...real strong point of the movie, enabling the establishment of an interesting alternative reality. The early scenes showcasing the differences in society were to me the main highlight of the film. Unfortunately, the film quickly devolves in to the standard romp for these films. Nothing throughout the majority of the movie really does anything to make it stand out from any other Doraemon film, with Miyoko being a bland expository character (as every new supporting character in these films are), the villains being completely paper thin without any real motives and the plot amounting to nothing but another basic battle. Really the only other aspects of this movie that I enjoyed were the time travel elements which were decently trippy for Doraemon and the appearance of Dorami (even if it was rather brief). Overall, this film may not have been the worst of Doraemon so far, but it was exceedingly standard for Doraemon and arguably sub-par as a standalone movie.

It\'s certainly one of the most thrilling adventures in the series, with an eerie mystery set up at the beginning of the story and a couple of potentially surprising twists and turns in the plot.There are still quibbles...one can raise with the story, but I don\'t think they severely detract from the enjoyment of watching this movie.

Doraemon Movie 13: Nobita to Kumo no Oukoku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2661/Doraemon_Movie_13__Nobita_to_Kumo_no_Oukoku,"['My overall take: An interesting Doraemon movie with a lot of novelty, though most rewarding to longtime Doraemon fans.In this movie, Nobita and his friends build a kingdom in the clouds, only to find an actual civilization hidden in the clouds. I quite like this one. At its core, it\'s another 90s environmentalist movie, but the central conflict is more nuanced than the one in the similarly-themed Nobita and the Animal Planet (1990). The main characters actually spend time reflecting on humanity\'s actions here, instead of simply facing off against ""bad humans from a different planet"". (Although Nobita and the Animal Planet did reference environmental...issues on Earth proper, they did not form a central part of the plot.) At the same time, the cloud people with their sustainable civilization are not portrayed as being entirely virtuous either.In addition to the conflict being morally grayer than usual, this film does quite a few new things for the Doraemon cinematic lineup. For example, it is the first movie in which Doraemon is rendered out of commission for an extended period of time, forcing the kids to get by without him for a while. This story also establishes that Doraemon has a rock-solid head (a lore addition that future films will regularly make use of), introduces a timer setting on the Anywhere Door allowing users to travel to a preset time, and shows Nobita and Doraemon soliciting funds from their friends to complete their latest project. Speaking of which, it\'s a lot of fun to watch them construct their Kingdom of Clouds.Furthermore, this may be the only Doraemon movie that contains multiple explicit, plot-relevant references to the mainline series. Reappearing in this film are the moa and the dodo from ""Moa and Dodos Forever"" (1978 manga chapter, 1981 anime episode), the Lilliputians from ""Hui of Donjara Village"" (1984 manga chapter and anime episode) and Kibo the walking tree from ""Goodbye, Kibo!"" (1984 manga chapter and anime episode), now an adult tree. (Although that does raise the question of how Kibo was able to grow to adulthood when Nobita and his friends haven\'t aged at all...)My main criticism of this film is that it\'s so jam-packed, some plot points show up with little to no chance for explanation. (And seriously, we did not need that five-second scene of Shizuka showering, barely censored...) For example, what is that healing energy Kibo uses to revive an unconscious Doraemon at the end? However, a more noticeable case might be the backstory of the cloud people: apparently the founders of the cloud civilization discovered that the clouds had become solid after a comet had passed by near the Earth, but how the comet was able to affect the clouds in this way is never revealed. Given that Doraemon tends to ascribe scientific or technological explanations to such phenomena, it\'s strange to see an origin story like this left with no clearly stated ""rational"" explanation.Funnily, early in the movie, Nobita asks Doraemon how his Cloud-solidifying Gas gadget works, but Doraemon essentially replies, ""That is a good question, but it would take too long to explain, so I won\'t.""

I just noticed there was an abnormally large amount of overly positive reviews for this show and thought it would be best if there was a second opinion readily available.Haganai was not an enjoyable anime for me. I did not find it funny past a certain point. For the first three episodes the show revolves around the mistaken delinquent and the two ""heroines"" of the series - Yozora and Sena.

The underlying complexion of such a minute situation in the premise of today’s society and its impact on people nowadays may seem like trivial matter, but that may not always work out for all of us. Generalizing, many of us laugh/disregard those who are disabled or lack some sort of trait or ability that hinders them from their true potential. Those people, who do make fun of others, are none less than a prick. We fail as humans to understand the feelings of others, and must take into...deep moderation to understand and to contemplate the situation of before we establish a viewpoint. It makes us see the world in an entirely new perspective, and allows us to be refreshed. As an exemplary, the anime, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, is underhandedly one of the benchmark for this improper demeanor bestowed on the less fortunate.To many of us, making friends, socializing, and talking are an innate ability that most of us possess.

I think that this is a new kind of anime in relation  to animation ....for me is the anime master piece of the 2011.1. Each character has an special ""humor"" (and personality) and the mix of everyone is really cool and funny.2. The drawings and landscapes are amazing... a master piece of art.3. The story is creative and interesting, has few bored moments but the mix of ""ecchi"" and ""funny"" moments is fantastic.I was thinking that would be a big mistake add more characters but honestly was a good bet.. Maria, ""The maid"" and the ""Ero Scientific Girl"" are great...characters that gives to this series another sense with their comments.This anime should be in your list of ""great animes""!! :D niku characters that gives to this series another sense with their comments.This anime should be in your list of ""great animes""!! :D niku', 'So once again we have a popular light novel adaptation that tries to defy most senses of competent writing and interesting stories, if you want to fascinated by real plots and unusual set ups, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is not for you, but if want the same ole, same ole, then anything would work out, even stuff as boring and singular as this works too.STORY: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN... Here we have a good example of what uninspired and perverted novel writers can come up with by using the official ""Same Old Shit"" guidebook that many others used for years on end. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai...(Which literally translates to ""I Don\'t Have Many Friends""), is that guidebook\'s best example for the first chapter, ""One Boy, Lotsa Girls, Wackiness Insures,"" because, if it isn\'t apparent yet, this anime has all the harem trappings you can push into one episode. Our harem bait this time around, Mr. Hasegawa Kodaka, the transfer student, who has no friends (the entire premise of this anime) because of a misunderstanding on his first day at his new school (Which chapter Two of the guidebook, ""Misunderstandings Is A Bitch""  is covered, which can also be viewed in anime comedy 101) and now, a month later, he is still alone and feared by the student body (I\'ll leave out the reason because it\'s just too lazy to even mention).But fortunately for Kodaka (And unfortunately for everybody else) Haru- I mean Ms. Mikazuki Yozora has no friends as well (Because, well the first episode skipped over that but she drops hints from time to time that has something to do with being betrayed by previous friends or something along those lines, you know, a reason for people to try to get people interested in her character), and it is evident because Kodaka witnesses Yozora talking to thin air, or her air friend choose your pick (And of course in over-dramatic fashion).And what do these similar friendless outcasts do? They form the SOS- I meant the neighbors club, a club with the sole purpose of making friends (I mean joining other clubs would be a waste of time because people in other clubs are friends by now, as both Yozora and Kodaka spent at least five minutes explaining how pointless it would be, you know, stupid reasons). And only those who can decipher the stupid-but-cute-because-Yozora-make-it poster can join this friends for friendless people club.But of course a new member joins on up to the club by the end of the episode, and she is the popular, big breasted blonde student, Sena Kashiwazaki (You\'ll see her earlier in the episode that she has a gaggle of boys drooling at her, an important key point about her). Her reasons for joining? She has no ""real"" friends. Her actual reason for joining? To get into fights with Yozora about breast sizes (Which comes from a major lesson from both the guidebook and almost all how to do anime comedy books, ""The Breasts Feud,"" when the main female character in a series has about average bodily proportions, the girl that arrives next has to have more than twice the boobage of the other girl, so that they can get into an argument about breast sizes. I mean it\'s supposed to be funny right? I\'ve never seen that actually happen in real life, but it\'s got to be funny, so funny that almost every harem anime does this joke to death).As first impressions go, this one leaves with a feeling of nostalgia, in a bad way, the nostalgic feeling of overused tropes and overused jokes. And with the opening theme song animation suggests, there\'s going to plenty of girls to try to keep things fresh and to appeal to the many needs and fetishes of the anime community.And don\'t worry, the fetishes are quite diverse, a boy who is a maid for no good reason (Only one stupid one), a loli nun, the little sister character, and a perverted girl who spends her days in a science room. If this show really wanted to be a show about outcasts, don\'t make them all into ecchi tropes, there are plenty of shows with these characters in that genre that are not even shunned by the background characters, there shouldn\'t be any reason to over-serve that genre other than to pay your bills, and maybe use that otaku money make something, I don\'t know, better or at least not make another rehash of every ecchi show over and over again.The show is called, I don\'t have many friends, but that obviously changes in no time, because all the otaku will be great ""friends"", they even squander away every bit of money they have for the show, and only ""true friends"" will do that.ANIMATION: Usually shows like this have decent animation, but this one looks a bit cheap looking, but the actual purpose of this anime is to sell, sell, sell character goods and other creepy merchandise.The characters are borderline bland, yet distinctive (The original character designer is the guy who did the character designs for Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko), but are still just moe enough to sell on their own without a story about them (Their titties will bonce, and the otaku will throw money at them, it\'s like a more expensive strip tease bar).However, the ending theme animation is pretty cool though.SOUND: Just about everything typical harem stockpile music would sound like, with an upbeat opening theme and good enough voice acting to go along with that, you know, good enough to sell more merch.Opening theme song makes me want to rip my ears off, but is almost forgivable for a pretty cool ending theme songOVERALL:The Good:+ Cool ending theme song.The Bad:- Another ""Beat off to the girl and fetish you like in this show"" kind of anime.- Pretends to meaningful, but is nothing more than fanservice.- One of the most thin plots I\'ve ever seen, probably doesn\'t even count as a plot.- Unrealistic outcasts and generic stereotypes.There is one thing this anime has taught me so far: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver and the other\'s gold, but when it comes to anime like this, the old is copper, but copper has it\'s uses too, ever heard of pennies? Because anime like this are as common as pennies. And of course, it\'s easy enough to make anime like this to simply stay afloat in the industry, but just how long do companies think they can milk the same thing over and over again before anime fans finally become bored and want something new, or (Disappointingly) maybe they won\'t?

This is my first non-critical review. This show is mainly for humor so I review it as such. So my scores are based more on how much laughter I got out of it and less on critical appeal. See the rest of my body of work for something more critical. If you don\'t agree with my score, please don\'t downgrade it just because you think the show is stupid or what not.Summary: Haganai is another average slice of life anime. It\'s humorous, kinda realistic, and in a club school setting. I didn\'t expect much...and I pretty much got what was predicted. I\'ll just get right down to the specifics. I don\'t include the sequel although a lot of what I say in this review applies to the sequel.Story (5/10): For a slice of life anime, I would say this anime had little story compared to some others i\'ve seen. Basically just play out the strange club scenario with every awkward student in school in one club. They have fun, do weird things, and have a ""school"" life. Sort of. In any event, it lacked any real substance. The only noteworthy piece of storyline was the revelation between Kodoka and Yozura (I didn\'t name it to avoid a spoiler). Even that was relatively downplayed seeing as romance in this story takes a back seat to comedy. There isn\'t anything special about this story and there isn\'t anything to hate. I wrote a shorter story review because story isn\'t the main draw for Haganai.Art (10/10): Girls are very curvy, cute, and Kodoka has weird hair. Alright being serious this art style isn\'t special but it sure is great to look at. No complaints. The color schemes are vibrant and bright. So everything is right in the world.Sound (8/10): The opening theme is one of those multi-little girl songs that are really hit or miss. Think Toradora opening theme. I personally find those amusing, but after about 6 episodes the opening wears on my nerves. Other songs generally mirror this style. Dubbed version had little fault in voice quality.Character (10/10): Before i get down to the nitty gritty, i just want to say one thing... MEAT! Yes if there is one thing I got from this anime, it is Yozora picking on Sena MEAT with lots of MEATy insults. But lets start off with Kodoka. He is the supposed boy delinquent who in reality is a good kid. He takes good care of his sister, he cooks well, and he is courteous. His only poor qualities are his a-hole looks and dirty blonde/brown hair. i really liked Kodoka for really simple reasons: he plays his part really well. He is the only guy in the Neighbors Club and he takes a lot of flak and dishes out a lot of humor without meaning to.He also has that little history with Yozora while his dad has history with the school prez. He had some development, but you have to love him more for his comical antics. Yozura is... an a-hole and a darn good one at that. I\'m sorry but she is just on a whole nother level from Kodoka. She is so witty with Sena it\'s not even fair. I don\'t remember any of the humor from her being too forced. Sena literally walks in to so many of Yozora\'s pitfalls. She probably made me laugh the most and she was a great character. Oh and her romance/past with Kodoka is probably her only weak spot. Enjoy the mean Yozora because she is the bomb. Now on to Sena MEAT! Ok I\'ll stop with the meat but Sena really does have meat for brains. She is perhaps the antithesis of everything a talented girl is supposed to be. Sena is smart, athletic, hot, and... unpopular. Yes she is is the daughter of the most powerful figure in the school and she goes herself to the Neighbors Club to find friends. Now this might just be me, but I find this hilarious. More so is her fighting with Yozora. As I said with Yozora except in complete opposition, Sena is an absolute moron if it isn\'t school related. Oh, and what isn\'t hilarious about sex jokes with Sena. I literally died over Sena\'s embarassment when it came to those dating games. Sena is in my opinion the funniest character here because she is so stupid. Moving on to Kobato. Not much to say. She is an anime freak (haha like us all). She can be funny but mostly is just another character. She plays the little sister role perfectly. Next. Yukimura. Ok I found Yuki to be really frickin weird and before you ask, it has everything to do with his gender identity crisis. Thank god he is anime boy and so his looks don\'t look as awkward in a maid costume. Again sometimes funny, plays the confidence lacking cross-dresser to the letter. Next. Maria. Ok Maria is a nun... and a brat.I\'ve loved many of these opposite social roles but Maria is second best behind Sena. LOL the 10 year old nun who is advisor of the club and gets smacked around by Yozora. I didn\'t get many laughs but looking back now this role Maria plays is hilarious. Finally Rika. OMG those comics were hilarious. I never would have thought porn and mecha could be so funny. And Rika makes it so much more funny. She is definitely the least realistic character of all (who heard of albert einstein living in a school lab unbeknownst to the public?). But her sex jokes make her one of the funniest characters here. Also the fact that Rika talks third person actually adds to the amusement (whereas the sisters in Railgun made me want to shoot myself after 2 episodes). There we go, all the main characters. The other side characters added to the amusement, especially the school prez.Enjoyment (10/10): Meat, sex jokes, awkward characters. A diabolical mixture that made this show hilarious. Personally I found this show way better than Baka and Test (which in my opinion was stupid and not funny at all but thats just me). I think my first line kinda sums up how I felt about the enjoyment. It was a hilarious show. I\'ll leave it at that.Overall (8/10): Yes you may be wondering why it stands at an 8. First off, the story was a little too mediocre in my view and while I did say I would grade off humor, story still factors in. Frankly I can\'t think of how to make the story any better because there was little solid premise besides the Neighbors Club. Second, I did factor sound more because I felt a review like this take into account more of art and sound. And the opening theme wore me down towards the end. But besides that, it was well worth watching these awkward characters get together and do hilarious things. As usual I am always up for debate but I have to leave one parting gift for this review. MEAT FOR ALL!!!PS: If you enjoyed this version of critique please message me.

MEAT FOR ALL!!!PS: If you enjoyed this version of critique please message me. I like to choose what anime I review and if my audience prefers this form a review, I will base my pieces as such.', ""A long time ago, I had the idea to write a novel with every otaku trope in it, figuring I could capture the entire otaku market spectrum. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (Haganai) beat me to it. Goth loli, fujoshi, tsundere, forgotten childhood friends, natural-blonde-haired male lead ... it's all there in one jumbled mess.What really got me was the number of face-palm, cringe-worthy moments in this show. After all, Haganai is about awkward kids trying to make friends. If you think watching someone with Asperger's try to hit on chicks would be hilarious, go for it. For me, there were quite a few times...when I felt like just hitting stop and leaving to do laundry or clean the house.The character interactions are just reused repeatedly throughout the series and they mostly just interact with the male lead, so you get the feeling that some characters are just there to provide fan service. Haganai copies tropes extensively but not to the point of parody, so it feels like a cheap shot compared to Ore no Imouto (which I enjoyed).Haganai was animated by the same studio that did Ore no Imouto, so the production was well done. There were some endearing moments and a decent yet entirely predictable ending, so it wasn't a total bust. All in all, it's a short series that has some good parts buried underneath the stereotypes and fan service, and while it's certainly not something I would recommend to most, it might be right for you. when I felt like just hitting stop and leaving to do laundry or clean the house.The character interactions are just reused repeatedly throughout the series and they mostly just interact with the male lead, so you get the feeling that some characters are just there to provide fan service.

If you were asked that question right now, what would your response be? For many, there is no true answer to this question as it all comes down to how one determines who or who doesn\'t become their friend. In Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (or Haganai as some will call it), the main protagonist, and practically all the other side characters, attempt to find one of the many answers to this mystifying question. Surrounding this premise is a countless number of comedic moments, delicious fanservice and a tad bit of romance. All this makes for a surprisingly successful series....Art (8/10)Coming from the same studio that brought us Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, it\'s no surprise that the art style is similar. For me, I really liked how the characters were drawn. They didn\'t look to be too complex and yet, also seemed sufficiently detailed. The other designs were also easy on the eyes and were enjoyable to watch. Solid animation overall.Characters (8/10)Compared to characters from another genre of anime, there wasn\'t that much character development in Haganai. However, this doesn\'t mean there wasn\'t any. On the contrary, there was more than I expected from a series that is classified as a romantic comedy. In general, the characters from a romantic comedy are developed poorly with lots of random comedy and a rushed romantic ending. But in Haganai, almost all the characters, most notably the male protagonist and the two main heroines, developed from being socially awkward people to being able to communicate and interact smoothly with one another. True, this is generally not too big of a deal but considering the whole story is focused on ""making friends"", I\'d say this is kind of development is noteworthy.Sound (7/10)This is the weakest category of the four given that sound aspects in this series were above average at best. A upbeat OP and ED does fit the atmosphere of the show but, musically, they didn\'t appeal to me. The only bright spot in terms of songs was the insert song in the last episode. The BGM was barely noticeable and for the most part unmemorable. The voice acting was decent with names like Itou Kanae (Sena, Ohana [Hanasaku Iroha], Elsie [The World God Only Knows]), Inoue Marina (Yozora, Laura [Infinite Stratos], Yoko [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagen]) and Hanazawa Kana (Kobato, Kanade [Angel Beats!], Kuroneko [Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai]) catching my attention.Story (8/10)What got me interested in this series was the idea of a story revolving around loners making friends. It\'s a new concept for me and, to be honest, I had no idea what to expect. Now that I\'ve finished watching it, I can say that the story was executed decently (I don\'t really have anything to compare it to). I loved how the backstory of two of the main characters was integrated into the series alongside the main story. Even though the cliché ""childhood friend"" card was used, the result did not follow the same route. With the series left open-ended, a continuation of what was shown in these 12 episodes is possible. If I were to assume this possibility to be true, then I must say that the episodes so far have definitely set up the story quite well.Overall (8/10)I think that Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai has exceeded my expectations. Upon starting the series, I was hoping for a romantic comedy to satisfy my cravings for both those genres. Despite the fanservice in some episodes being slightly more extreme than I prefer, the show as a whole - from the story to the characters - was well done. I would honestly recommend Haganai to anyone who wants something entertaining to watch, as long as they can handle the fanservice. It has been a great ride and I\'m really hoping for an announcement regarding a second season sometime soon. Art (8/10)Coming from the same studio that brought us Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai, it\'s no surprise that the art style is similar. For me, I really liked how the characters were drawn. They didn\'t look to be too complex and yet, also seemed sufficiently detailed. The other designs were also easy on the eyes and were enjoyable to watch. Solid animation overall.Characters (8/10)Compared to characters from another genre of anime, there wasn\'t that much character development in Haganai. However, this doesn\'t mean there wasn\'t any. On the contrary, there was more than I expected from a series that is classified as a romantic comedy. In general, the characters from a romantic comedy are developed poorly with lots of random comedy and a rushed romantic ending. But in Haganai, almost all the characters, most notably the male protagonist and the two main heroines, developed from being socially awkward people to being able to communicate and interact smoothly with one another. True, this is generally not too big of a deal but considering the whole story is focused on ""making friends"", I\'d say this is kind of development is noteworthy.Sound (7/10)This is the weakest category of the four given that sound aspects in this series were above average at best. A upbeat OP and ED does fit the atmosphere of the show but, musically, they didn\'t appeal to me. The only bright spot in terms of songs was the insert song in the last episode. The BGM was barely noticeable and for the most part unmemorable. The voice acting was decent with names like Itou Kanae (Sena, Ohana [Hanasaku Iroha], Elsie [The World God Only Knows]), Inoue Marina (Yozora, Laura [Infinite Stratos], Yoko [Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagen]) and Hanazawa Kana (Kobato, Kanade [Angel Beats!], Kuroneko [Ore no Imōto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai]) catching my attention.Story (8/10)What got me interested in this series was the idea of a story revolving around loners making friends.

From the basic premise, over the characters, the setting and most likely the whole conclusion, mostly everything has been done before. This is one of the reasons I don\'t usually get my eyes on such anime. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is an exception though because a very good friend of mine recommended it. ""Might as well give it a try"", I thought, ""It only has 12 episodes, it\'s something different from the previous stuff I watched and it\'s on my HDD...already"".So I managed to sit through the whole thing in two days even if I had huge prejudices against the show - most of them turned out to be justified.Let\'s split up this review into the five categories as usual:Story (4/10):Boku wa Tomodachi is what seems to be a basic harem anime. You have the more or less dense main character, in this case an outcast who is seemingly ""bullied"" because of his foreign appearance. This is most likely referring to his hairstyle because he has blond hair while basically looking like everyone else in this show.From this point on everything is pretty straight to say the least. Kodaka meets a new member for his ""No Friends""-club, everything gets quite ecchi-y and in the end he has a whole harem surrounding him. Oh, while we are at it, how come that attractive young girls have no friends whatsoever? I know it\'s a harem but hey, every guy is popular now at school? It\'s mostly the male students having trouble finding friends from my experience.The only thing notable and standing out was the background Kodaka had with his former best friend who he never got to say goodbye to before switching school as well as the little plot twist in the end which was rather predictable because they more or less gave it away a few episodes beforehand.Art (6/10):While the art does not offer lots of variety in terms of character design with everyone looking quite plain, also revealing lots of similarities in their design which is most noticable at the girl’s character designs. Pretty mediocre is also the animation as well as the backgrounds. What I did like a lot were the bright colors. They really gave a comfortable mood and fitted the comedy-ish approaches the show had to offer.Sound (5/10):The voice actors did a good job on acting the characters and also the opening and ending theme were quite enjoyable. During the watch I didn\'t really catch any outstanding pieces of music. Most of the time the ambient music was pretty standard.Character (3/10):The main issue I had with the show leaving the story aside was the rather dull characters. Again, I know it\'s a harem but what\'s wrong with having some standards? The characters were unpopular for quite no reason. The whole ""talking to an imaginary friend""-thing seemed more like a plot device to get Kodaka and Yozora into bumping into each other than a real barrier on trying to establish social ties with class mates.In general the cast was as generic as it could get with Maria being one of the most annoying characters I got to meet in anime.Enjoyment (5/10):Despite the shows obvious flaws in major categories I did enjoy it as a flat-humor ridden anime. I watched it in two days so I\'d be lying to myself if I said I didn\'t enjoy it the least.For fans of comedy shows and the harem genre there is no way they could not like this.Verdict (4/10*):I didn\'t start Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai with lots of expectations. I didn\'t expect the new messiah of anime itself but it still had some obvious issues in my two most important categories for me, which would be the story and the characters. It\'s not like it wasn\'t enjoyable - as said, I have been through it in two days watching five episodes after each other. Maybe I\'m just not made for this kind of genre.A recommendation to harem-fans everyone else should rethink twice if they are looking for a good story and characters. I personally didn\'t get lot out of it besides the revelation I don\'t like harem shows.---------------------------------*) Score is not an average already"".So I managed to sit through the whole thing in two days even if I had huge prejudices against the show - most of them turned out to be justified.Let\'s split up this review into the five categories as usual:Story (4/10):Boku wa Tomodachi is what seems to be a basic harem anime.

However, despite the serious topic of making friends, the plot line is not at all serious. No, the show is flat out comedy from beginning to end, and some of the humor will not appeal to everyone, even if some of the humor does appeal.  I am also going to admit, that some of the humor is going to be the type that the viewer may question if it is really a good thing to be laughing at.I mean, you wonder how the characters can be so stupid at times, yet the...series makes it very clear that the characters within the show, despite having their dumb moments are for the most part rather intelligent. They are, however, horribly awkward when it comes to social issues and this becomes quickly apparent from their lack of realization that they are making friends with each other.I found myself coming to like all of the characters. They blend and clash in just all the right places to make the entire series interesting, but you also have characterization that is rather off the wall. However, I can also see the characterization grating on some of the viewers nerves. Not to mention some of the jokes may end up being to much for some people.

Well, all I can say is that there's nothing really spectacular about this new series as it uses the same old jokes and themes. The plot is obviously heading to a love triangle or possibly a harem and it's slowly deteriorating in terms of comedy. As for the characters, I've not seen any developments or whatsoever, they are basically a bunch of static stereotypes. I've also noticed that their faces are very similar (with the exception of Kodaka), they only seem to differ according to their hairstyles. The fanservice is also noticable in this one.For me, that pretty much...sums it up and I don't mind watching these kinds of series from time to time lol. sums it up and I don't mind watching these kinds of series from time to time lol."", 'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai deals with a group of introverted friendless pupils who aim to make friends. This anime is your average dosage of ecchi which does not focus on story but on fanservice and laughter. I have to admit that I really enjoyed watching it. But, there are some points that disappointed me and influenced me to give it a lower rating and I’m going to present you these:Story (5):As mentioned above, this anime has just a whiff of a story. The main character Kodaka transferred to a new school. Due to his unusual blonde hair and unintended aggressive behavior his classmates avoid...him and leave him friendless. One afternoon after class, he goes to his classroom and sees Yozora, his classmate, talking to herself (or rather to say her “air friend”). After discussing this issue, Yozora founds the Neighbors Club in order to make friends. Kodaka is forced to join the club. Shortly after the foundation, another girl named Sena joins the club. She and Yozora often fight and see the other as rival. Furthermore, the club is joined by other girls who I’m going to describe in the character section.This story seems quite interesting but after seeing the first two episodes one quickly realizes that it just forms the shell of the anime while fanservice and comic elements form the core. Therefore, I cannot give the story a higher rating than a five.Character (8):Kodaka is your average reserved boy in every ecchi/harem anime, nothing to add. Okay, he has a small background story which is not worth mentioning. Actually, the two interesting characters are the following: Yozora and Sena. Yozora is the leader of the Neighbors Club. She is a witty and barbed girl who always teases Sena. In addition, she has a background story which this review does not cover due to the fact that it would spoiler (even if it is not a stunning spoiler). Sena is our fanservice. Her big boobs are bouncing in almost every scene. She is popular amongst the boys in her school but she does not have any real friends and loves to play VNs. Her rivalry with Yozora refreshes this anime and makes it enjoyable and worth watching. It is very amusing as they are actually similar in their character traits but do nothing except teasing the other.The supporting characters are simply disappointing me. Kodaka’s sister Kobato and Maria are annoying (just like their voices). Maria’s affection to Kodaka enrages Kobato which results in a fight between them. Yukimura and Rika are just weird to watch.Art(7):The animation is okay, nothing innovative or “epoch making” but seriously, what do you expect of an ecchi anime?Sound (7):The opening and ending themes are enjoyable and catchy. I like them although they are somewhat strange and exaggerated.What I really loved while watching the anime were the piano themes. They fit the situation well and are rememberable. But the problem is: they are overused. The themes are repeated in every episode and although I like them they start to annoy you due to the fact that they have a funny character. Though I have to admit I did not notice it until the last two episodes.Enjoyment (8):If you are interested in a serious and intertwining plot, this anime is definitely nothing for you. But if you like humorous scenes and you are interested in a not so exaggerated ecchi anime, then give it a try. The “conflict” between Yozora and Sena is enjoyable and funny. I liked this anime and completed it in two days.Overall (7):Summing up one can say that this anime is refreshing and funny to watch though the story does barely develop. The story and the weird supporting characters force me to downrate this anime although I would have given it an eight or maybe even a nine. So now I am going to watch the second season and I am excited to see it.PS: This is my first review. Contact me for criticism.

( The Neighbour\'s club). A club specifically designed just to make friends or so i thought..., while this club contains some very unique characters from attractive galge gamers, to perverted scientists that has very -cough- ""special imaginations/fantasies"". They are all very nice people and have amazing relationships between each other, wait scrap that... unique is a better word.Story 7The story of Haganai (Short for Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai) is a typical high school comedy, joining a club, going out and having...fun in their own very special way, whether its rubbing sun scream on your friend with your feet, or playing some really realistic fantasy game. While this is a rather normal story line, there is another one that involves Yozora and Kodaka past, I won\'t say anymore but if you watched the anime its pretty much obvious what\'s going on after the 2nd episode basically. But the story is simply a backbone of all the comedy that is to follow, what makes Hannagi great is the comedy not the story.Art 8The art in Haganai is quite well done, each character design is very well drawn/animated but i guess thats expected of an anime released in 2011. You can\'t not love Sena and her ""Meat"" or Kobato\'s very epic cosplay, that makes her very kawaii! shes just so god damn adorable. The art plays a big part in the comical scenes, examples include very obscure swim suits or unique natural hair colour plus cross dressers . But one thing i can say is that, its very hard to forget about some of the characters appearances once you have watched it.Sound 6The sound is so-so, not the strongest point in this anime, but its not exactly important. The opening of Haganai is one of those weird super high pitched ones, i\'m personally not a big fan of those. To be honest even at those point i dont even really remember the OST of Haganai =/Character 8Each character personality is the thing that defines this anime and makes it amazing. Yozora, innocent yet rude, sarcastic and quite weird acts as the president leader of Rinjinbu club, she provides plenty of funny and rude comments against the chairman\'s daughter Sena, who has ridiculously big ""meat"" and is a female galge gamer that is obsessed with each of the in game characters, their personality are practically the direct opposite of each other, but with 1 thing in common they both feel something for Kodaka. But what i will probably never forgot, is Rika\'s crazy perverted imagination, it can turn an innocent mecha manga into an ecchi scene, ahhh \'UNIVERSEEEE!!"" One of my favourite characters is Kobato, i love her cosplay and her jealously when Maria calls kodaka onii chan, jeez ""An chan"" just realise just how kawaii your sister is =P.Enjoyment 9Ths is one of the few anime where i was basically laughing my head off at literally every episode, with funny nicknames, rude comments, crazy imaginations, it truly is an unforgettable anime with scenes that I can watch over and over again on youtube without getting bored of it. If only I can forget about it and watch it again.. -sigh-Overall 8This anime has its good and bad points, bad points being quite average sound, and not much of a story, but the good points heavily out weigh the bad ones. I personally found this anime pretty good overall, and is definitely something everyone should watch as you are pretty much guaranteed to laugh out loud at one point during this anime. Also some of the parodies are quite well made, plus it has characters that you can\'t help but love in the end. I am looking forward to season 2 in Jan 2013 and hopefully it\'ll jut be as funny! fun in their own very special way, whether its rubbing sun scream on your friend with your feet, or playing some really realistic fantasy game.

The first episode is kinda introduction to the character,of course the main one.How they behave,what kind of guy/girl is she/he , and the root of the story is started from the first episode.But the first episode does not deliver all the information ,what is going to happens next.

I will give 8/10 for it.Character:Every main character of the story has diffrent abilities,realationship,appearance and behavior. Not much supporting character atm,but soon it will. I\'m sure you will like the character.Overall:This anime is not just let you learn something,but explain the true meaning of friendship value and bond with your friends.

Unfortunately, I fail to see why Haganai was regarded as a popular anime series, as the 12 episodes were rough to tough my way through.Story - 4/10Usually I find animes based off of light novels are pretty good and I end up liking them a lot, but this was not the case with Haganai. Your basic outcast main characters is of course faced with the...""trying task"" of being surrounded by beautiful girls all head over heels with him for some reason, the reason at this point being all of them are weird and desperate for friends. The two main girls, those with the least wrong with them, I suppose, are both seriously in love and they set it up so that the anime might turn into one of those \'Who\'s he gonna pick\', except he doesn\'t pick. Disappointingly, they blow it off in favor of an \'everything\'s back to normal\' ending, therefore offering no good resolution to what seemed like a serious romantic plot. As well, the whole thing can\'t decide if it wants to be a romantic comedy or a slice of life or straight, suffocating fanservice. I have to wonder if the light novel was any better.Art - 6/10The animation is just fine, not the best I\'ve seen, but tolerable. I\'m not a fan of when their shirt is sculpted unnaturally to their boobs, and I\'m also not a fan of ecchi involving seven year old girls, but I get that some people are so I don\'t count it as a big deal.Sound - 6/10Not a very noticeable soundtrack, and the title sequence was very loud and in-your-face. Just remember to keep your volume down so it doesn\'t blow any speakers.Character - 6/10The characters are made up of your basic tropes for a harem--the sister figure (there are actually like 3), the cold chick, the bubbly, big boobed girl, the pervy one...etc. etc. The main two girls your MC has to pick from are the cold, standoffish Yozora and the bubbly, loud cry-baby Sena. However, Rather than being cold and standoffish, Yozora spends the entire series bullying Sena, and comes off as nothing short of, for lack of a better word, a bitch. Yet, for some reason, our useless MC prefers her to the girl that is actually nice to him, just for the sole purpose of falling in love with the childhood friend. All in all, the endless trope make it tiring, and there is little to no character development anyway.Enjoyment - 5/10As for overall enjoyment, the series bored me. As a romantic comedy, it was lack luster and unsatisfying. As a slice of life, it was easily thrown off the deep end by all of the over-the-top character types. As a straight comedy, the jokes were all relationship or sexually based. I was bored. If anything, my enjoyment comes from it being over.Haganai is not the worst anime I have ever seen, but it certainly doesn\'t scale very high. If you\'ve been seeing the big-boobed blonde girl around the internet or her weird hair colored guy friend, that\'s basically all there is to the anime; 12 episodes of girls screaming and fawning over weird hair color guy, and there isn\'t a very satisfying ending as a reward for braving the series. Good luck. ""trying task"" of being surrounded by beautiful girls all head over heels with him for some reason, the reason at this point being all of them are weird and desperate for friends. The two main girls, those with the least wrong with them, I suppose, are both seriously in love and they set it up so that the anime might turn into one of those \'Who\'s he gonna pick\', except he doesn\'t pick. Disappointingly, they blow it off in favor of an \'everything\'s back to normal\' ending, therefore offering no good resolution to what seemed like a serious romantic plot. As well, the whole thing can\'t decide if it wants to be a romantic comedy or a slice of life or straight, suffocating fanservice. I have to wonder if the light novel was any better.Art - 6/10The animation is just fine, not the best I\'ve seen, but tolerable. I\'m not a fan of when their shirt is sculpted unnaturally to their boobs, and I\'m also not a fan of ecchi involving seven year old girls, but I get that some people are so I don\'t count it as a big deal.Sound - 6/10Not a very noticeable soundtrack, and the title sequence was very loud and in-your-face. Just remember to keep your volume down so it doesn\'t blow any speakers.Character - 6/10The characters are made up of your basic tropes for a harem--the sister figure (there are actually like 3), the cold chick, the bubbly, big boobed girl, the pervy one...etc. etc. The main two girls your MC has to pick from are the cold, standoffish Yozora and the bubbly, loud cry-baby Sena. However, Rather than being cold and standoffish, Yozora spends the entire series bullying Sena, and comes off as nothing short of, for lack of a better word, a bitch. Yet, for some reason, our useless MC prefers her to the girl that is actually nice to him, just for the sole purpose of falling in love with the childhood friend. All in all, the endless trope make it tiring, and there is little to no character development anyway.Enjoyment - 5/10As for overall enjoyment, the series bored me. As a romantic comedy, it was lack luster and unsatisfying. As a slice of life, it was easily thrown off the deep end by all of the over-the-top character types. As a straight comedy, the jokes were all relationship or sexually based. I was bored. If anything, my enjoyment comes from it being over.Haganai is not the worst anime I have ever seen, but it certainly doesn\'t scale very high. If you\'ve been seeing the big-boobed blonde girl around the internet or her weird hair colored guy friend, that\'s basically all there is to the anime; 12 episodes of girls screaming and fawning over weird hair color guy, and there isn\'t a very satisfying ending as a reward for braving the series. Good luck.', ""Friendship comes in many flavors. One type includes gigantic lazer beams from an orange-haired girl in a white dress; another involves interpersonal attraction, the one that involves physical and personality attraction. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai asks questions based on the latter: “What is a friend? Do good friends exist? If they do, will they add me on Facebook?”The answer, of course, is, “It’s someone who you ask for money. Yes, they are also known as rich people. And yes, they will.”Without a doubt, Boku not Pico refuses to acknowledge the true definition of friendship. It is romanticist in its ideals, believing that friends are...people whom you trust in and can talk to. This is what Boku not Pico is all about: making friends.And money.Boku not Pico is made for the sake of fans and money. Even before reading any of the reviews, you should know what you’re getting into. If not, then there is a good chance you will not like this work. Consider this to be one of those animes made for otakus; it takes a special breed of people to enjoy this work to its full potential.Anyone watching this work who invest a whole lot of emotions on characters will definitely get disappointed. Everyone is unappealing at its core.The work deliberately uses other archetypes from other works with no manipulation whatsoever: Hasegawa Kodaka has the same personality traits (criminal-looking, antisocial, forgettable) as that male character in Toradora! and the girls are clones of Oreimo’s Kirino and Kuroneko characters. Kobato is a nod to Kuroneko (same seiyuu) as well. There is no interesting twist to the archetypes whatsoever, except for Yozora.Note the unnaturalness of the cast: Kodaka is stiff and boring; Yozora reminds me of annoying grandmas (and mothers); Sena should be casted for a leading role in 90210. Everyone else in the supporting cast is okay, but they are only used to throw lame jokes into the audience. Shiguma Rika, who has an uncanny resemblance to Ace Attorney’s Ema Skye, can only make perverted jokes. Her distinctive quality melts into the hell known as the obnoxious zone. Kusunoki makes trap jokes; Maria makes kids’ jokes; the list goes on. All of the characters’ art design look displeasing visually; they feel like flattened versions of visual novel character art.That said, the pandering to Oreimo fans is entertaining. It is no mistake to consider this an Oreimo clone; it’s done by the same studio for Lain’s sake! In Oreimo, the episodes featuring the two rival otakus always had them fighting to prove they have the better taste in anime. Here, it’s almost the same. Yozora and Sena instead fights for pride (and bigger breasts). The studio has finally attained enlightenment: “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Good money comes in; the Oreimo fans and casual viewers are happy. Why stray from the formula of being mindless entertainment?Because all animes need drama! Right, people?A romantic love triangle is almost a must-have in romance works, in general. Some of them can be masterful, almost touching my cold and bloodless heart. Other times, it gives me heartburn. People should run up and scream to the screen, “That girl’s in love with you, you nincompoop! Stop dating other girls!” This is no School Days, but it is. Kodaka is even stupider than Itou Makoto of School Days fame. There is a subplot involving both Kodaka and another female character and the studio did a bad job at hiding the mystery. This subplot becomes grueling to the mind. Add in a love triangle subplot that's as romantic and relatable as Mitt Romney and you get yourself a winner!There is no uniqueness in the soundtrack. Mediocre at best. Nothing is spectacular and some of the tracks are grating to the ears. Boku not Pico’s OP requires listeners to have paid health insurance for auditory damages; it is painful to listen or watch a second of it. Oh, the fanservice! The ED is more interesting to listen, but not too memorable.With all these ramblings about how much I disliked the work, there is one question that must have popped up into your mind:Did I enjoy it?Kinda.As I said, the Oreimo formula is fun and the way the writers write it can be somewhat creative and unexpected. No one can replace Kirino and Kuroneko in my mind, but Yozora and Sena still has a fun relationship dynamic that bounces up and down like a stock market. Kobato is just plain cute -- Kana Hanazawa, you win this round. The supporting characters can be a blast and the references, if you get it, are clever and witty.It is obvious who will like this work and who doesn’t. If you enjoyed Oreimo, Toradora!, and slice-of-life works that achieve no sense of cultural purpose, then this is a safe bet to watch. Everyone else will have a hard time watching. I suggest you to turn off your post-Eva brain, insert antidepressants into your nervous system, and have a good laugh.If you cannot, then give it a 6. Which is what I did. It is hard for me to give this work above a 6. There is a degree of likability, but it is engulfed by the overpowering flaws that will forever haunt this work. What a pity.

The atmosphere created from the first couple episodes mislead me to think that the series was going delve deeply into the concept of friendship but rather it quickly began to take the slice of life/comedy/harem route and made use of some cliche themes and characters. For the most part ""Haganai"" didn\'t turn out too bad, it offered a great quality of humor and entertainment via parodies, references, sexual innuendos, hilarious conflicts between characters and of...course for certain viewers, fan service like the usual emphasis on breasts, swimsuits and there are also a couple of episodes where it goes just a bit too far in my opinion but it typically came in fair doses almost every episode.""Haganai"" contains a small and rather eye catching set of characters, most of which are rather cliche and some with exaggerated personalities, but even so, watching characters such as Rika and Kobato and the conflicts between Yozora and Sena provided loads of comedy and kept the show entertaining enough to keep me laughing and tune in every week. The supporting characters were still successful in capturing my attention throughout series because of all the random humor but still remained rather static in terms of character development. Aside from their abilities to entertain me, they didn\'t really have much else to offer, in fact some of these characters did not really feel like a character at all, they felt like they were there for the sole purpose to tell jokes or acted as eye candy. Moving onto our leads, I felt that Sena never really changed at all and sadly stays as the typical tsundere, and as for the other two, I could only witness a slight bit of growth between Yozora and Kodaka but alas it was mostly during their confrontation at the end of the series meaning there wasn\'t enough time to conclude whether the two really changed from that at all.I\'m sure no one expected the background artwork in ""Haganai"" to be anything amazing but there is definitely one thing the animators did exceptionally well on, and that was the detail and coloring on the characters, mostly the facial features. I was able to quickly notice that there was definitely more effort in detailing the redness on the cheeks and they also focused on the lips when the characters are in a bit more focus just like the style used in ""Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko"" (and go figure, it\'s the same character designer). The eyes were also done with great detail on most of the characters, I really enjoyed how they put some thought into the color scheme like how a couple of character\'s eye color matches their hair nicely, or how Sena\'s blue eyes matches her blue hair clip, and even Kobato\'s red and blue contacts made her stand out. I really felt that all of the attention put into detailing the characters really pays off as the end result really makes the characters look much more appealing, in fact some more than the main characters.Moving right along to the audio, the OP ""Zannenkei Rinjinbu (Hoshi Futatsu Han)"" and ED ""Watashi no Kimochi"" were both composed by professional musician/guitarist Tom-H@ck, who also composed all of the opening themes for the popular K-ON! series. Both singles are somewhat fast paced j-pop/rock songs which hold lyrics relevant to the theme of making friends and the songs themselves were fairly decent and not too hard on the ears although I personally enjoyed the ED much more with the low voice of Marina Inoue accompanied by a strong guitar presence. As for the voice acting, the most notable performance in my opinion was from Hanazawa Kana\'s role as Kobato as she did a splendid job on juggling between speaking in a goth/aristocratic fashion (that\'s how I like to describe it anyways) and her cute childish voice, nevertheless the rest of the VAs still provided a great a voice for their respective roles, definitely no complaints here.Finally coming to the story of ""Haganai"", it carried the simple theme of making friends but soon developed into a bit of an episodic series after all the characters in the club were introduced about a third of the way in, which. For me, it became one of those shows where I just sit back, enjoy and not have to pay too much attention to specifics, but that was also the problem, the amount of random humor in every episode was sadly what the show was mostly comprised of. Although I can\'t say the show completely strayed away from the theme of making friends after all, the characters in the club did become more acquainted and friendly with one another, but I couldn\'t help but realize the end felt rather ironic seeing them be together like friends would but yet they deny or don\'t acknowledge the fact that they are. It was just a shame though, the series could have had more room for a richer story had the focus not been so much on comedy and cliche ideas.""Haganai"" was a bit misdirecting right at the start because of the intriguing insight made into the concept of friendship in episode one but it immediately developed into something less intelligent. I was rather disappointed with this quick change in atmosphere as the show became more of a slice of life/comedy/romance series, but regardless the show contained some effective chemistry between the characters that made it fairly entertaining, hilarious and full of life despite them being cliche or unrealistic. Despite a story really lacking depth, slow progression, and subpar characters, ""Haganai"" still turned out to provide a decent watching experience for me and is definitely a show for anyone that is looking for some uplifting entertainment with loads of random humor and doesn\'t mind the typical fan service or cliche themes being tossed around a bit, but don\'t expect much else. course for certain viewers, fan service like the usual emphasis on breasts, swimsuits and there are also a couple of episodes where it goes just a bit too far in my opinion but it typically came in fair doses almost every episode.""Haganai"" contains a small and rather eye catching set of characters, most of which are rather cliche and some with exaggerated personalities, but even so, watching characters such as Rika and Kobato and the conflicts between Yozora and Sena provided loads of comedy and kept the show entertaining enough to keep me laughing and tune in every week.

I didn\'t expect a spectacular story, nor deep character growth, nor captivating elements, and its a good thing, too. But whats wrong with watching an anime with no depth, and no serious plot, if you\'re just looking for entertainment and a few laughs? Nothing, right?Right..?I didn\'t, and you shouldn\'t either... Because honestly, in my 5 episodes of watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, thats pretty much all it is so far.Boku wa starts us off with ....badabada-bing, our scary-eyed, delinquent protagonist, Kodaka. Then, we meet...lonely, hyperactive Yozora, who forms a club, dragging Kodaka with her. The story is basically Haruhi Suzumiya meets Toradora with a lot of innuendo thrown in. Not that that\'s not entertaining, right?Okay. Next, we\'ve got some pretty okay artwork. Honestly, so far, this element has got to be my favorite. I\'m a fan of the way Kodaka is drawn. Everyone else is okay, too.For character depth, none so far. All the characters are proving to be a little cliche with no originality so far, but we\'re only on episode 4, so maybe that will change. Wasn\'t expecting anything better, right? So, here we go.  Kodaka, our protagonist, is the delinquent who really just wants to make friends. Aside him, we\'ve got the feisty, dark-haired commander, the big-breasted blonde who\'s obsessed with dating sims (which, honestly, I find to be kinda funny), the nun (...which I\'m still trying to figure out?), the clingy scientist, the obsessed little sister, and the boy who looks like a girl who reminds me so much of Hideyoshi from Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu that I refer to him as Hideyoshi. Notice that Kodaka is the only boy (other than the boy-girl) that I\'ve listed. Harem much? Just a little.Sound? Eeehh. The opening theme is downright horrid. The ending theme is not much better. The voice acting is alright, though. I find each character\'s voice to be pretty suiting, especially Yozora\'s voice. I like the way they used a girl with a slightly lower voice, instead of another lolita with a squeaky high voice; and trust me, there are some of those present in Boku wa.Enjoyment? Its alright.

While I was originally hesitant to watch the anime, I quickly discovered the beauty of it.Overall: 8Haganai follows the simple, yet effective, harem rom-com format. Nothing particularly excels in the anime. Pretty much everything is simply decent. With that in mind, I still enjoyed the anime quite a lot. Haganai is a fun, easy-going, hilarious and enjoyable anime. I would certainly recommend it to mostly anyone who enjoys lighthearted,...fun, slice of life anime.Story: 6The story followed a format that would naturally follow any harem rom-com. A seemingly oblivious boy stumbles upon a goldmine of beautiful women who are so very enamored by him. It sticks to the formula, although with a slight variation, saving it from a lower score. There is also very small amounts of plot, and where there was, it was fairly predictable. All in all, though, the formula works and the anime made an interesting show out of a simple idea.Art: 7Nothing too special, but there was never any drops in quality. Not much to say.Sound: 6Again, not much to say. Sound was average. Not a big fan of the opening and ending themes, but not saying they were bad.Character: 7The characters are again, fairly normal. A tsundere, a rich girl, a nerd, a quiet one, a loud one, and the little sister. While each character did have her quirk, there wasn\'t much development, save for the main characters. The protagonist, Kodaka isn\'t quite the normal harem hero, though. He clearly tries hard not to be too much of a pervert, and is shown to be fairly worthy of the girls\' trust. He\'s also not as oblivious as most, he just has ""bad hearing.""Enjoyment: 10With all of these low points in the categories, what really saved it was how involved I got into it. Haganai was fun and very enjoyable. I would watch multiple episodes at a time, even having to stop myself from watching too many, so I wouldn\'t finish it too fast.

Basically, delinquent guy, and two tsunderes, and a plot about making friends. In terms of plot, it\'s fairly cliche\', no doubt about it. Although fairly predictable, you\'ll still have a blast viewing it though. The classic ""melting"" of the tsunderes, and the cute animation and soundtrack give a familiar, and lovable experience that many anime fans have come to love. This isn\'t going to change the way you look at anime, provoke any news ideas, or really improve on anything that has been done before. But you\'ll have a fun time, smile...to yourself, and have that sort of comforting feel that ""fluff"" anime like this give to viewers.I would compare to something like Ore No Imouto, or another anime of similar caliber, all high production, and all very lovable, with same humor, animation style, and characterization. That being said, many people dislike anime like this, as they find it fairly stupid, and cliche\', and if that\'s the kind of viewer you are, THIS ISN\'T FOR YOU. There are people that will inevitably dislike this anime from the moment they see it, and that\'s fine. I just hope that those with different perspectives can realize that this isn\'t a ""one size fits all"" kind of show, and move on to something else they find with more meaning.Well, that sums up my opinion, I hope you guys enjoy this as much I have so far, and I hope the rest of the season can continue the same way it has been going so far.Thanks :] to yourself, and have that sort of comforting feel that ""fluff"" anime like this give to viewers.I would compare to something like Ore No Imouto, or another anime of similar caliber, all high production, and all very lovable, with same humor, animation style, and characterization. That being said, many people dislike anime like this, as they find it fairly stupid, and cliche\', and if that\'s the kind of viewer you are, THIS ISN\'T FOR YOU.

When he first walks into his high school class, he gives the immediate impression to everyone that he's dangerous and a delinquent, mostly because of the color of his blond hair. Kodaka doesn't make any friends after this happens. But, soon after, he meets Yozora Mikazuki, another student in his class who is also antisocial and friendless. Both of them form the Neighbors Club, a place for people with no friends to help each other try to make friends. I will not go much...deeper into the plot line because I don't want to spoil the story.Art - 8/10I don't know very much about art, but the art in Haganai seemed good to me. What made me raise my rating from a 6/7 to an 8 was that I thought the op had cute art.Sound - 9/10I really enjoyed the op and never skipped it. The song was super cute. I did like the ending but I started skipping it after around episode 2 or 3.Character - 8/10The characters were all similar in the way that they had nobody to talk to, but had very different and enjoyable personalities. Kodaka is pretty much a normal boy but his little sister Kobato pretends she is a vampire which can be very amusing at times. Yozora picks and choses who she likes and doesn't like and gets annoyed very easily. Sena is a shy rich girl. All the boys flock around her but she doesn't have any true friends. She also gets embarrassed very easily and is often picked on by Yozora. She has a soft spot for Kobato, which is pretty funny as the story progresses. Rika... she's a complete pervert but very smart and helps the group get into video games. Yukimura is a boy who dresses like a girl in order to bring out his inner manliness... explaining may mean light spoilers, so I won't go into it. Lastly is Maria, the ten year old club advisor who likes naps and fighting with Kobato. She's very gullible.Many of the character's traits are used for comedy but during the story, these characters do grow.Enjoyment - 8/10I found myself addicted to this and I finished it in 3 days. I didn't enjoy it as much as other anime I've watched, but it was still worth it. My favorite character was Yukimura, he's a beautiful boy.Overall - 8/10This is an anime that I would recommend to comedy, ecchi, and slice of life anime fans.

Then going through the following episode I can tell that it is fairly the same except maybe for the art being much better in the anime and some event not happening in the same orders.

Without spoiling anything a basic summary would be""A male transfer student who has no friends meets a female who has no friends,...so they together start a club to find friends. They make some friends.""Characters - 5 - Are baseline characters with shallow progression.The characters in the show are again fantastic starting points, but they barely progress.

The rest of the character get even less.Sound and Art - 5 - Nothing stand out, in a bad nor a good way.The sound and art of the show are fine, there is nothing good nor bad to say about them.

Which is probably why it actually has decent reviews. I guess if you included as many fetishes as you can to your garbage anime, it will attract more people....This anime is a pile of trash.

This slice of life and a half anime is one of the most memorable I have watched in a long time. Not that this is saying much as slice of life is not really my bag, as  it were.

All that is about to be said is my pov so feel free to bitch about it but don\'t take offense as I don\'t mean any....I will also do what I can to avoid spoilers but I make no promises. Que theme music!The story is a simple one. A bunch of school outcasts want to make friends so they start a club to do it. The reality being they are so awkward that they don\'t realize they have become friends in the proses. To go along with it is a strong helping of fan service and comedy but they are secondary at times and always surprisingly organic. I repeat this is very well written and aside from the mid episode break screen thing\'s that all anime seem to do there is no needles panty shots or tits in your face for the hell of it.The sound is also something I noticed in this one, witch again is not something I am normally big on noticing. Everything just had the right sounds. Nothing seemed generic, just realistic. There is a heap of character development as you would expect from this genera and all the characters there are interesting in there own right. I honestly cant say that I hated anyone in the show or was more interested in one over the other.This is starting to get long... again, man I have to get better at short reviews haha. So on the hole I would say this is a great show. It is honestly making me rethinking my stance on the slice of life anime I had that much fun with it. I will say though, and I would like to remind you of the disclaimer now, that it got big points for being some what relate-able. I know I am a social orc with most of the world, and I know that is true for most of my friends. I can also say having been in the need community for so long that it is generally true for all of us. It\'s a bit of the ""if you cant laugh at your self who can you laugh at"" sort of thing.So that\'s more or less what I thought about this one. Hope it helps you make a decision on it.

It\'s something that you\'d like to enjoy on your free time. Though it\'s not the type that leaves you ""what\'s coming up next???"" and eagerly waits for the next episode.Still, it\'s a very enjoyable anime that is worth watching.I read the manga too, and I don\'t think this is something \'educational\' or anything like that. I\'m not sure if it\'s being promoted that way (i.e. educational anime) but it\'s not and it should not be treated as an anime aiming to be educational. It\'s purely...an enjoyable light story with some twists (which clue is given at earlier episodes) and how they present this twist later on should be interesting to look forward to.If you\'d like some light anime with comedy and moe characters, watch this! an enjoyable light story with some twists (which clue is given at earlier episodes) and how they present this twist later on should be interesting to look forward to.If you\'d like some light anime with comedy and moe characters, watch this!', 'I really enjoyed boku wa tomodacha ga sukunai I thought it had amazing art with great voice acting and charecters, also I really liked the concept of the ""neighbours club"" and I thought that some of their ideas on what it\'s like to have friends was really funny. I thought this anime had a wide variety of charecters along with having a wide variety of charecters I felt that somehow these charecters were different to other anime and were not the usual common type of charecters that you may have expected.i really liked how the charecters yozura and cena argued over petty things, I thought...this was funny I also like how kodakas relationship with the girls build up over time,I really liked the charecters of kodaka because he wasn\'t as annoying as characters from other anime.The one thing I think that could have been improved was the story at the beginning (the first few episodes) asi think if it was more exciting and interesting it would have hooked more people into watching the rest of the story which is great.Overall I rate this anime as a 9 because it was one of the first animes I watched and is still to this day one of my favourites if you do end up enjoying this anime I seriously reccomend that you watch boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai NEXT (the sequel).

Either one element is done too much or it is a complete disaster.  This anime honestly a bit harder to describe, it isn’t a disaster but the anime didn’t know how to present their material.  It pulls it off well enough to where it has the right amount of comedy and drama but it just wasn’t shown well enough.Story 6/10: They did give off a good plot at the start of the anime and I was drawn into it at first.  However, as the show went on...it moved away from the main plot and towards something else.  I didn\'t mind it as much but it just gave me mixed flags as to what it wanted to show. This happened to me when they showed the first plot twist I just couldn\'t understand their message behind it.  It was a good plot but it was just executed wrong.Art 8/10: It isn\'t that over the top but does make references towards other anime elements and I actually did enjoy that.  They don\'t overdo it but just enough to get a good chuckle out of it.  It was nice and well done.Sound 8/10: For the most part I didn\'t really find the sound to be there; for the most part it was focusing on the dialogue.  The VOs do put a good effort into their work, original Japanese cast anyways it has been announced that there will be an English cast.  Background music I found to be non-existing.Character 7/10: Every character does put something unique to the show.  The only one I had a really problem with is one of the main characters, Yozora Mikazuki.  I just couldn\'t understand her reasoning and motives were even after the big reveal at the end of the first season.  I won\'t say what it is for spoiler reasons but my reaction towards it was ""Okay, why couldn\'t you just do this instead what you been doing for the past first season?""  The other characters are good and they do offer something good to the show but again story reference they don\'t know how to present it well enough.Enjoyment 5/10: It did get me a couple of good laughs but for the most part I was like ""I can\'t believe they went there.""  Also nothing really stood out to well for me throughout the first season for me.Overall 6/10: I can see why people would enjoy this anime, it just seems like a meh anime to me.  If they knew how to present its material better I would of enjoyed it a lot more and if they pulled the plot twist a bit better to keep me in better, or actual, suspense. it moved away from the main plot and towards something else.

Woot.Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai is the story of the endeavors of the Neighbors Club, a Highschool club dedicated to the purpose of making friends for those who have none. ... That's really all you can say without throwing a spoiler in there.The plot itself throws a whole cast of characters together, slowly but surely, and makes it so that they all become friends with each other, indirectly achieving the objective of the club in the first place.It might sound like I'm tearing this apart, but.. I loved this anime....It was humorous quite often, sad at times, and certainly makes you feel different emotions towards this group of club members. They do all sorts of things that make you laugh, at the randomness that this anime throws at you.The characters are... Unique? Half of them are. There's the few you see immediately as typical high school anime characters, but then there are a few that stick out as oddball, and seeing them interact is really something to behold.The animation style isn't the worst I've seen. That kinda downplays it, it was really good. There are a lot of small details filled in that shouldn't, but the writers do it anyway. The soundtrack doesn't have much going for it except the opening songs, which are catchy and happy. They'll make you feel happiness.I'm not really sure if you can say the plot progresses, because the club members are always doing something different and still never really make any outside friends besides each other. It's kind of a given that this would happen, as they all just pay attention to each other, but they still bond closer, so it's sort of a win.The one downside is that it's a typical guy surrounded by an abnormal number of girls type of Highschool anime. There seriously are about 3 male characters throughout the entirety of the show. Nevertheless, it's still funny to watch them all interact with each other as I said before.So if you like to laugh, be happy, then end up being hit with feels at random points anyway, I'd definitely suggest watching this. I hope this helped you in even the slightest, because this one is definitely worth taking the time for.

If you\'re looking for that kind of thing, this anime has quite a bit for you. However, if you look past the harem anime staples, it\'s pretty humorous, and the characters will become endearing to the viewer. The story follows Kodaka Hasegawa, self-proclaimed ""no-lifer"" as he searches for friendship, love, and belonging. He and Yozora Mikazuki create the ""Neighbor\'s Club"" a club where a lovable bunch of misfits band together to create friendships. This series has quite a bit of crude humor (and...a little bit of nudity), so viewer discretion is advised. It\'s a harem anime, but the protagonist won\'t do anything about it because he\'s afraid of hurting anybody. This anime deals a lot with high school drama, but is full of laughs and hijinks that\'ll keep you coming back for more. I love this show, and the fan service isn\'t the reason why.

Give it a chance.', 'Okay, so today I will be reviewing the 2011 anime ‘Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai’. It’s okay, you don’t need to memorize all of that. Just call it Haganai. Anyway, this review will basically cover the overall plot, presentation, characters, and entertainment the title brings to the table. Whether said qualities are positive or negative will be answered quite shortly.I was originally planning on trying to make this funny, but as you all probably know, I’m an awful comedian. But that won’t stop me to try. Painfully.So, what got me to reviewing this show? I don’t really know myself. It’s got a decent following. There...are, and most likely will be, reviews that outshine this one. I mean, hell, I’m just some 14 year old white kid who decided to open up Microsoft Word and ramble on about nothing.I think what drew my attention to this particular show was its concept. See, in the world of modern anime, there are three main types:1.\tThe SUPER serious, epic, dark and angsty shows that take themselves way too seriously2.\tThe generic cutesy high school show that’s filled to the brim with moeblobs and ear-shatteringly high pitched voices3.\tMindless fanservice with no real substance to speak of.Well, actually, I lied. There are four. I forgot to mention Hentai. But that’s a rant for another day.Haganai, however, brings in a fairly original concept.[[Originally had a summary here, but the guidelines discourage you from doing that, so I just cut it out.]]Okay, so, earlier I said that Haganai had a fairly original concept, and it does. But that’s not to say it doesn’t have its own fair share of fanservice, romance and serious moments. But for some reason, they all seem to blend in perfectly with the show, and it all seems…well, natural. Other shows with gratuitous amounts of panty shots, ass shots, boob shots, and, god forbid, dick shots seem to feel out of place. It sort of deters the overall experience and frankly just distracts the viewer, in a bad way. Now don’t get me wrong, I would’ve loved to tone down the fanservice a bit at times, but I’m not uncomfortable with the amount that’s given.I guess this is where I should introduce the main cast.Like I said, we have Kodaka Hasegawa, who is surprisingly a likable guy in an otherwise bland cast of male harem leads. You can kind of relate to the guy, well, at least I feel like I can. And, best of all, he doesn’t think with his dick and do the stupid ‘Let me fall into your tits TOTALLY BY ACCIDENT and get the shit beat out of me.’ shtick. He’s a pretty unique character in that regard. Well, not really actually, he’s just a sensible human being.Next up is Yozora Mikazuki, which is the lead female protagonist. Well, it starts that way at least, but I’ll get to that later. She’s cold, sarcastic, in-your-face, cruel, and quite frankly, my favorite character in this show. Now those who are familiar may be asking, “WHY HER AND NOT, YOU KNOW, THAT OTHER CHICK WHICH I HAVEN’T INTRODUCED YET?” Well, okay, I guess I forgot to mention she can be a bitch. Quite often, in fact. And I can generally see why people wouldn’t like her.  But for me, other than that attitude, she’s a good person at heart. She’s the only one that truly does feel like she NEEDS friends to better herself in the long run. She’s a nice girl, but has trouble expressing herself, and so everything just comes out wrong. Now, this doesn’t mean I condone everything she does, but most of her bitchiness is directed towards one character anyway. She arguably receives the most development as a character over the show and just ends up being a well-rounded, relatable and pleasant character. Oh yeah, and her voice is just….Ah.Next on the list of harem bait is the ever-so-popular Sena Kashiwazaki. Odds are if you’ve heard of this show, it was either through her or another character. She’s the typical arrogant rich girl with great looks, tits, good grades, tits, and an elegant demeanor. Did I mention she has tits? Yeah, if you’re coming into this show expecting fanservice, you won’t be disappointed. This chick’s tits are by far the most popular character. She receives so many unnecessary embarrassing situations and camera angles just for the sake of making our dicks hard. Which is perfectly fine. But most, if not all of the fanservice stems from her and her chest. This makes me question her validity as an actual character and not just a walking sex toy. But that’s what’s weird. She’s an actual character with an interesting personality and situation. See, boys fawn all over her for…obvious reasons, and she steps all over them. Literally. But in reality she hates that sort of treatment, and just wants to live a normal life. She doesn’t have any real friends, you could say. She loves video games, especially Eroge, and can be quite adorable once you get to know her.But this isn’t what anyone really likes her for. Admit it, the main reason you like Sena so much, and I’m saying this in general because she OVERSHADOWS EVERY OTHER FUCKING CHARACTER, is because she has a nice rack, likes to play games, and has a nice rack. Granted, I’m not saying that EVERYONE likes her for this, but the vast majority, from what I’ve seen, seem to. And as a result, she receives the most attention, praise, fanart, you name it, just for having a nice rack along with some other shit that doesn’t matter. Kinda makes you think of the current state of things, huh?Obviously I can’t mention Sena without also mentioning her never-ending feud with Yozora. Dear God, where do I begin? Most of the hate on Yozora stems from this. “OH NO, SHE HURT MY PRECIOUS TITS! HOW DARE SHE?” Pretty much sums up all of the Sena fanboys’ reactions. But I will admit, it does kind of bug me too and take away from my liking of Yozora. But it DOES also help establish that she’s messed up and is in need of a good hug or two once in a while. Which is pretty much the show’s point, no?I’m not gonna go into much more detail about this, as it really won’t get me anywhere. You’ll see what I mean if you decide to watch this, though.Okay, where were we? Oh yeah, characters.Honestly, the rest of the cast doesn’t really do anything for me. There’s Yukimura, the maid girl who’s actually a boy who’s actually a girl, Rika, the bespectacled pervert of a scientist, Maria, the fucking BANE OF MY EXISTENCE, and Kobato, Kodaka’s sister who’s just a generic loli with a vampire fetish. For some reason, everyone gets their fucking dicks wet about this girl, which is pretty annoying. She’s arguably more recognized than Yozora, the MAIN HEROINE, and is the show’s second most popular character.While I don’t DISLIKE any of the characters, with the exception of Maria….god, I hate her…The remainder of the cast doesn’t seem to do anything. They’re not properly developed, not properly established as actual characters and not just comedic relief. They sort of just seem like cardboard cutouts of what’s practically REQUIRED in an anime; The token maid, pervert, loli…two of them, actually, and annoying cunt. The show makes pretty clear that your main focus should be on the main three; Kodaka, Yozora and Sena. And they do a damn good job of that, may I add.Okay, now with the characters out of the way, I can get into the meat of this show. Pun intended.The animation is absolutely gorgeous. It’s colorful, character designs are distinct and those eyes….god I love them. Everything just looks so crisp and clean, and it really helps you become immersed in the show.The soundtrack is, I will admit, forgettable. It’s your classic run-of-the-mill anime soundtrack. Nothing in particular stands out within the show itself. However, I’d be lying if I said the opening and ending wasn’t catchy. They’re well done and the instrumentals along with the singing are fun. Especially the ending theme, where Yozora is singing. God, that voice, I can’t even put it in words. That’s all I can really say about the sound design. It’s really that forgettable, which is a shame. I enjoy a nice soundtrack every once in a while.If you noticed, during this review I’ve been mentioning it being a harem occasionally. Which is sort of true. Practically every girl in the club has some sort of an attachment or crush on Kodaka. Poor guy, all of these attractive girls fawning over him and he’s just plopped right in the middle. Throughout it’s obvious he develops some minor feelings for certain girls (who I will not mention specifically) and as a result, is stuck in a pretty awkward love triangle. While this concept sounds generic, it’s not played about so much that it becomes the show’s main purpose. The main purpose, really, is just the misadventures of the Neighbors’ Club and what crazy shit they can get themselves into next. Oh yeah, the show is pretty silly. It’s filled with slapstick, awkward moments, fanservice, jokes and just overall entertaining content. The romance and drama, while well executed, don’t really seem to be an overly important factor. Not to mention, the show ends on this dumb cliffhanger that disappoints me as a Yozora fan….Shit, I probably said too much, didn’t I?But, since there’s a second season already, I’m sure all of this will be resolved. So, no biggie.With a multitude of entertaining characters, laugh-out-loud and quirky writing, beautiful visuals and well executed romance, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is definitely a must-watch anime for anybody who enjoys a nice slice-of-life comedy and/or harem. I enjoyed it, and I eagerly await to watch the three (currently) episodes of season two. If you watched the show, please tell me what you thought about it.8.5/10 are, and most likely will be, reviews that outshine this one. I mean, hell, I’m just some 14 year old white kid who decided to open up Microsoft Word and ramble on about nothing.I think what drew my attention to this particular show was its concept. See, in the world of modern anime, there are three main types:1.\tThe SUPER serious, epic, dark and angsty shows that take themselves way too seriously2.\tThe generic cutesy high school show that’s filled to the brim with moeblobs and ear-shatteringly high pitched voices3.\tMindless fanservice with no real substance to speak of.Well, actually, I lied. There are four. I forgot to mention Hentai. But that’s a rant for another day.Haganai, however, brings in a fairly original concept.[[Originally had a summary here, but the guidelines discourage you from doing that, so I just cut it out.]]Okay, so, earlier I said that Haganai had a fairly original concept, and it does. But that’s not to say it doesn’t have its own fair share of fanservice, romance and serious moments. But for some reason, they all seem to blend in perfectly with the show, and it all seems…well, natural. Other shows with gratuitous amounts of panty shots, ass shots, boob shots, and, god forbid, dick shots seem to feel out of place. It sort of deters the overall experience and frankly just distracts the viewer, in a bad way. Now don’t get me wrong, I would’ve loved to tone down the fanservice a bit at times, but I’m not uncomfortable with the amount that’s given.I guess this is where I should introduce the main cast.Like I said, we have Kodaka Hasegawa, who is surprisingly a likable guy in an otherwise bland cast of male harem leads. You can kind of relate to the guy, well, at least I feel like I can. And, best of all, he doesn’t think with his dick and do the stupid ‘Let me fall into your tits TOTALLY BY ACCIDENT and get the shit beat out of me.’ shtick. He’s a pretty unique character in that regard. Well, not really actually, he’s just a sensible human being.Next up is Yozora Mikazuki, which is the lead female protagonist. Well, it starts that way at least, but I’ll get to that later. She’s cold, sarcastic, in-your-face, cruel, and quite frankly, my favorite character in this show. Now those who are familiar may be asking, “WHY HER AND NOT, YOU KNOW, THAT OTHER CHICK WHICH I HAVEN’T INTRODUCED YET?” Well, okay, I guess I forgot to mention she can be a bitch. Quite often, in fact. And I can generally see why people wouldn’t like her.  But for me, other than that attitude, she’s a good person at heart. She’s the only one that truly does feel like she NEEDS friends to better herself in the long run. She’s a nice girl, but has trouble expressing herself, and so everything just comes out wrong. Now, this doesn’t mean I condone everything she does, but most of her bitchiness is directed towards one character anyway.

If you watched the show, please tell me what you thought about it.8.5/10', 'No matter what stage you are in life, you will always have friends. Even if you don\'t realize it. But when your idea to make friends involves making a club revolved around making friends, that\'s when you need those friends to step in to tell them to wake up and smell the roses. Unless those friends are just as thick as the one who made the club, then you have a problem.The story of this anime is not that really leads anywhere. with a small 13 episode series, at least 5 or 6 of them can be ruled out as fillers which is rather disappointing....The episodes that do seem to build on the lives of the club members is either so different from the other episodes its as if the doings of the previous episodes are irrelevant to the followings or they mix in to the point where you could mistake them as fillers until the events are recalled upon in a later relevant episode.When watching Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai in comparison to most other anime\'s, the art style is something that can be off putting at first. Some characters seem to fit the style really well and others seem like the artists tried to hard to try and make the ""perfect anime girl"" but the way in which they\'re presented just puts them off. However, regardless of the odd art style, the use of tones, shades and gradients mixed in with the standard cell shading blends quite nicely to the point where you sometimes forget its there or if you do notice it, it isn\'t so strong that it stands out from the rest of the scene.Lack of proper sound and music at most times would be a downfall but somehow this anime manages to make it through quite well with minimal use of music, saving it for the larger character development scenes. As for ambient sounds, your standard anime cicadas and basic effects for objects isn\'t anything new to anime and certainly isn\'t a highlight here either.When it comes to character development, it\'s all this anime really seems to be. With no real story to it, just a bunch a ""acquaintances"" trying to make friends and a one sided foggy past between two of them. Even with almost pure character dev\', things barely get anywhere with the characters relationships with each other, as in all of 13 episodes only 4 or 5 are a step forward in their social activity with one another.The enjoyment factor is what seems to make this anime worth the watch. The humor that put in it is a large verity of almost every kind, from blatant insults and cringe worth bad taste, to well timed come backs and suggestive subtleties. Some humor will leave you in pain for a minute or two, while others make you want to turn it off. A few times the teasing and insults get to a point where it gets on your nerves and the aftermath no one does can agitate some which can be a real buzz kill after a good joke was played.

A club based around socially inept people trying to make friends.This show weakest point is probably it's story, because it has almost no major plot development's, or even real arks until the end of season 1, and the end of season 2. Despite that it does have many redeeming qualitie's in other aspects; specifically characters.Haganai is often compared to Oregairu because of the theme of social outcasts, and loners. However Haganai's character's can probably hold their own against Oregairu's. Since Haganai's main focus is characters. Even...character's who are more side character's also are well developed such as Rika, and Maria. Even Kodaka our protaginist is a great character's though I can't go into him without spoilering.Since I wasn't always Mr. Popular in school I managed to connect with quite a few characters. I related to character's when they mentioned being left out during group projects, and how being arrogant causes you to be left out, and how if your really good at something to the point of being better than everyone else people who also like that thing will dislike you, even if your not arrogant about it. (That last one I saw happen it didn't happen to me personally.) This cast was really relatable makes up for the lack in plot.The art is unique since it shows lips. Something I rarely see in anime. (except those girls with the make up and huge lips.) This show also has service shots. Not like HOTD fan service with Boob Bullet Dodge, more like here and there. I personally find it (some) nice. One major question I have, which could even be a good reason to watch the show: Do the girls wear panties? Sometimes it looks like they do while other's it makes me wonder...The openings, and endings for both seasons didn't really stand out enough for me to put them on my phone, though I do feel they were fitting for the show. BGM was also based around character's since almost every time Yukimura comes in they play traditional Japanese stuff. However I did like the Sena and Yozora conflict theme.Overall this show was pretty good. Not for everyone, but if you were in similar situations in school, or are sympathetic you'll probably like it. Even if your just into school life, romance, or even harem. It's probably one of the better harems out their since the protaginist is good.(Not the best, though it does come close. Ichigo 100% is the best. If your coming here for harem watch that then come back!) Even if you just have nothing better to do I'd say watch it. It makes good points on friendship and the likes. character's who are more side character's also are well developed such as Rika, and Maria.

Yeah the art never really gave me any excitement and it was the most boring art style that i\'ve seen.  I am definitely not trying to be a sour patch kid about it but I really wasn\'t impressed at all.  That being said, I really appreciate the effort that is put into art by all the artist and animators and I...have immense respect for that.  Unfortunately the art style is the definition of average.  I give art a 6.2.Sound - The same kind of goes for the soundtrack.  It never really enhanced the story or provoked any emotion in me besides a few exceptions.  One of those exceptions was the opining title.  It wasn\'t really the best but it had a lot of effort put into it and I appreciate that.  There was also another piano piece that really spoke to my heart and I believe it should be on every otaku\'s i pod....... wait a second, do people even still use i pods..... well whatever.  The rest of the soundtrack wasn\'t really that good so I can only give sound a 6.3.Character - Let me say that I really enjoyed how different the characters in this anime were.  They all had unique personalities and it added a lot of humor to this anime and there was a lot of very entertaining and emotional relationships in this show.  On the topic of romance I would like to sat that the romance between the characters is just beautiful.  The characters were very unique and very relatable to and because of that I will give character a 9.  All I gotta say is that I wanna bury my face in some of dat meat TwT.4.Story - I can without a doubt say that this anime is an awesome romance story but on the other hand it left me kind of feeling like it was lacking.  It\'s not that it was a bad anime, it\'s just that at times a felt like the story was lacking depth and the ending didn\'t really kill it for me.  It just wasn\'t enough to make me cry or be satisfied.  That being said, the story was definitely not a bad one.  The story was good but it just didn\'t have enough depth for my liking.  I\'ll give it an 8.5.Enjoyment - I think that I without a doubt say that I enjoyed this anime but at some points it failed to convey emotion to me.  This show was one of those ""breath of fresh air"" anime.  It was a very light and delicate anime that had a bit of sweet romance on the side.  I wouldn\'t say that this is an anime that you should go out and watch right now but it is definitely a show that is worth putting your time in.  I very much enjoyed this show and I will give it an 8 for enjoyment.This anime is an overall 7.*I would recommend this anime to a person of any age. have immense respect for that.

I love reverse harems but I have a bit of a problem with harems. I've seen some awful ones such as Yumeira and Girls Bravo  But luckily Haganai is different from those shows and  puts my fate in the genre .Today I'll explain why it's a great harem and show in general.Story 7.5It has a great premise and it knows what it's doing. I also enjoyed the comedy ,it reminds me of Baka and Test cranked up a few notches. There is a story as a side element and I heard in season 2 they...give it justice because those were some nice elements.  Also while they may he on steroids and have cliches in them there in a way realistic. We see they aren't bad (minus Yozora but I'll get to her in a moment ) there misunderstood,judged,and confused as to what friends are. They also showed that they live in a society like ours where relationship ,rumors,and judging is a factor and it helps connecting with them and makes it believable despite the fact they possibly all have a screw lose.  I would give the story a higher score but the sub plot is not fully done I feel and I hope it gets more coverage in Next.Characters 8I love almost all if these characters. They all have something I think people can see in them. For example a character cross dresses as a girl (and even looks like one )but is actually a boy and gets judged alot because of his looks.Another example is a little girl is in love with a character so much she dresses up and acts like her and she gets picked on because of it even though she is a nice character. They are quirky and strange when you step back they are all misunderstood individuals who have good intentions minus Yozora. Yozora is different from the rest of the cast ,she is avoided because of her attitude and treatment not because of being misunderstood. She is so harsh she flat out bullies them. But we see  she wants friends and in the final episode see her differently. Though in all honesty I'm mixed on this character mainly because of her actions but who knows maybe season 2 fixes this. There are hardly sides because it mainly focused on the mains , but the few there were there were fun. Bonds here are strong and great. Devolpment is given to some but not others. But despite that there a strong cast.Art and animation 7Weakest part of the anime by far. The art is fine and it looks nice plus the color pallet fits. The problem is at times when in motion it looks sort of sloppy. Though at times it looked great.Sound 7.5That op is very catchy. The Ed is great too. Some parts of the sound track stood out nicely others were forgettable. I didn't see the sub yet but the dub is great so I do recommend it.Enjoyment 9I enjoyed it. It was funny and quirky plus a bit of a social commentary. However one that bugged me was Yozora being a bully and while I'll admit it was a bit funny ,she at times go so far I'm just speechless that . It is my biggest gripe with it but other then that I enjoyed it.Overall 8I can see why some might not like it. It has fan service,it's a harem ,and the comedy may bug people. But if you look like that stuff you'll see one of the better entries of the harem genre overall. give it justice because those were some nice elements.  Also while they may he on steroids and have cliches in them there in a way realistic. We see they aren't bad (minus Yozora but I'll get to her in a moment ) there misunderstood,judged,and confused as to what friends are. They also showed that they live in a society like ours where relationship ,rumors,and judging is a factor and it helps connecting with them and makes it believable despite the fact they possibly all have a screw lose.

We\'ve ALL been there especially in highschool. I remember when I was in highschool and I\'ve been made fun of/spread rumours that I was, ""pimping"" on 2 girls when in fact, those 2 girls were both of my closest friends. To the popular kids in highschool, they perceived me as the shy one who was, ""afraid to talk AT ALL!"" Now, I can totally relate to Kodaka, the main protagonist in that sense cause not only did the, ""popular ones"" spread rumours about me, BUT most of my friends are all female lol!Now, aside that, I really felt like the anime was absolutely hilarious without going over the top and the hilarious parts come at the RIGHT MOMENT! Also, I find it cute/entertaining that whenever the club tries to go in a, ""social area/event,"" they try so damn hard to do what they can (e.g. Sena, Yozora, and Kodaka finally understanding what cellphones were meant to be used for, going into a karaoke box, you name it, anything a group of good friends would do). Another point is that in terms of character development, I think the entire club, did take a step forward in terms of FINALLY doing something shut-ins/outsiders wouldn\'t be able to do alone and the fact that the club itself, became a posse of good friendship. Now, it may not be a dramatic turning point for all of the important characters (except maybe Kodaka and Yozora since ____ happens and it\'ll be predictable what actually happens to the 2 of them as you watch the anime), BUT that step forward was quite significant and that definitely translated to this anime\'s optimistic ending that this club will always continue and improve on their social skills.Now, there are some questions still in my head that the anime didn\'t fully go into detail, BUT that\'s why there\'s a SEASON 2, right? I just hope Season 2 immediately picks up on Season 1 so I\'m crossing my fingers that the Season 2 doesn\'t suck.My actual rating (including decimal numbers): 8.7/10.0 1st year, Rika mentions, Sena\'s boobs, and oh, some convenient censoring XD!Now, the plot, I did say was potentially good, but it is generic as it\'s about outsiders/shut-ins forming a club, which aims to make friends.

Sexual tension, childhood memories, emotional pain, hunger for success and the unbreakable will to change.The premise is very simple. We have the protagonist, Kodaka Hasegawa, a blond high school boy who has a hard time building any sort of rapport with people due to his hair colour (being blond in Japan is bad ass apparently) and his inability to smile. Everyone sees him as a delinquent...punk and stays the fuck away from him. Enter Yozora Mikazuki, a stone cold girl in a similar situation. A chance meeting of her going full retard and the boy bonds the two outcasts who then set out to form a club with the aim of making friends.This anime is almost poetic in its portrayal of teenage life which is filled with comedy and tragedy. Kodaka is actually a decent hard working dude but his outward shell created as a result of his past just pushes people away. Life constantly gives him chances to redeem and smile but he\'s trapped so far down in his own head Freddy is feeling claustrophobic. Yozora has the potential to be the most reliable friend but her high horse and arrogance prevents her from touching people\'s hearts.The whole cast is filled with contradictory tragedies. Horny celibates, dumb-bass cute girls who talk about poop all day, drop dead gorgeous redheads who dream of being a dude...  what the fuck am I watching? However that\'s teenage life in a tangential nutshell and that\'s what makes this anime so god damn good. I missed a chance at a threesome in high school because I couldn\'t read moods for shit. The kind of guy that would say "" uh... I dunno"" if  a girl flat out asked him to have sex with her. This is what this anime is.The visual aspect of \'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\' is something to truly marvel at. Every episode is filled with top notch animation and... plenty of ecchi. Don\'t let that dissuade you however, the story is still a lot more solid than you\'ll ever be while watching this. I give the studio props for being able to morph just the right amount of ecchi for... entertainment purposes with the overall feel of the anime.Likewise the VA and OST do a good job at completing this near masterpiece. Hentai grade moan acting, drama class shouting and titanic one liners delivered to you straight from the land of the rising sun. Pepper thy angus, squire.All in all, \'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai\' is an entertaining clusterfuck of teenage angst, gravity defying tits, comedy made tragedy and... teenage angst.

From the people who brought us OreImo comes Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sakunai, or I Don\'t Have Many Friends.Kodaka comes to a new school and immediately is typecast as the delinquent by his classmates thanks to his hair. He shortly thereafter has a run-in with the other outcast of the class, Yozora, who is talking to her ""air friend."" They end up starting a club to make friends, and so Sena immediately joins. Sena and Yozora clearly are meant to be foils of each other, although Yozora...tries to be a foil to pretty much every character besides Kodaka throughout the series. Add in some very odd characters otherwise and it becomes a full harem cast. The perverted scientist, the loli nun club supervisor, the super feminine boy whom everyone mistakes as a girl and Kodaka\'s goth-loli little sister, who clearly has a thing for her brother. Not exactly generic at first, but don\'t worry, the characters all become one stereotype or another very quickly.The story is not too horrible. It is clearly meant to be about the three main characters as Kodaka finds out about his long lost friend from the past. Unfortunately, just as OreImo did, this one suffers from some brain damage thanks to a studio that would rather drag the story out to a second season and pour in a crap load of fanservice rather than accomplish anything that might turn into a good series.Having not read the manga, I don\'t know if the characters are meant to be so over the top or not. But as it is, this studio has taken an otherwise decent romantic plot and turned it into fanservice in the extreme. I really just don\'t know what to say. Story...7 I guess, since I think it would be decent without the studio\'s ""help.""The art here is pretty decent. Of course again it is fanservice/ecchi a lot of times so you pretty much know how that goes. Can\'t say much good or bad so I\'ll just give it a 7 and walk away.The sound is largely forgotten I think. Standard J-Pop OP and ED but I\'ve already forgotten both so I\'m handing out a 6 for that.The characters. Oh where to begin. Kodaka makes for a decent straight man early on. Other than his hair, he is actually quite normal and wants to get along with people, and seems to be the standard ""great guy"" in harem anime. Really, I enjoy this guy, and I think there is plenty more depth to him than this series is letting on, but unlike the others in this series, I don\'t think he\'s as brain-damaged and unserviceable. Yozora pretty much makes this series hard to watch at times. She has no friends, and it\'s easy to see why. She looks gloomy, and treats everyone whose name isn\'t Kodaka like trash. She actually has some depth to her as well, as they finally ""reveal"" in the last episode, but of course there is no real time for them to do anything and it just makes for a cliffhanger for -hopefully- another season.Sena is the big-boobed daughter of the school chairman. She has boys following her around for her looks and her status but apparently has no friends as well so she joins. Straight away when the club starts playing games she finds herself being addicted to eroge, and spends the rest of the series acting like a perverted otaku. Really though, this is so much like other characters it isn\'t funny.And enter rest of cast. Maria, ten year old nun that is easily fooled by Yozora into doing all kinds of stupid things. Yukimura, a boy (supposedly) that looks like a girl and follows Kodaka around everywhere like he\'s the leader of a gang. He follows Yozora\'s advice and wears maid uniforms and girl\'s swimsuits because that will ""help"" his femininity problem. Rika, a genius scientist and inventor who is allowed to not be in any class so she can experiment at school. She quickly shows that she\'s nothing if not a gigantic, and I mean humogoloid, pervert. She continually tries to get Kodaka to sleep with her (whether playfully or not), and brings up perverted ideas for all the club members. And lastly, Kobato, Kodaka\'s sister. She dresses in a goth-loli manner after her favorite character on her favorite show about vampires. She tries to act exactly like this character, speaking in an old fashioned manner and avoiding sunlight (like the rest of the characters here don\'t?). She clearly has a brother complex and doesn\'t like Maria calling Kodaka ""onii-san.""Like I said, not -exactly- the stereotypical harem cast, but they all end up filling in some kind of stereotypical character role. Really the three main characters may have some depth to them, but eventually it doesn\'t matter because the studio has put much effort into making this more about fanservice than story. So, I give the characters a 5, even if I do like the main character.Well, I actually enjoyed the show a lot for the most part. If there was a decent ending there I would score this better than OreImo, however there really was no ending at all. In fact the last episode was pretty much the opposite of and ending. It\'s something you would expect to happen in episode 5 or 6 in a normal 12 episode series. There really isn\'t a lot that I found funny in this show. I know it is billed as a comedy mostly, but I thought most of it was too over the top or otherwise just stupid to be really funny. I\'m giving an 8 for enjoyment, but I really don\'t know why I enjoyed it that much.Overall, this series has some serious flaws. I probably enjoyed most of it more than OreImo, but they at least tried to cap it off with a ""Good Ending"" in case there is no season 2. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no real end here which I feel takes too much away from the show. Honestly I feel like this show is a love child of Haruhi Suzumiya, Genshiken, and....well just pick a good harem show. People sitting around not having friends, standard harem characters, and they follow a crazy chick who does nothing but insult everyone. I hope there will be another season because I really did enjoy most of it, but trying to be objective, I can\'t score this above a 7 overall.

If its brand of comedy appeals to you, you\'ll end up having a fun time with it. If not, it\'ll end up being a disappointingly empty experience for you.First off, if you\'re thinking of giving this one a go, you have to be ready to expect these:• Ecchi content (well, duh)• Vulgar Jokes• Slapstick Comedy• Lack of any meaningful character development• A very bare-bones storyThis anime follows the shenanigans of the members from the \'Neighbours Club\' that is composed of social outcasts - loners who can\'t make friends due to one reason or...the other. So they all get together to learn how to make friends and engage in activities that ""popular people"" (read regular people) probably do with their friends. The setting is basically an excuse to bring together a bunch of colorful characters based on different character archetypes and come up with gags based on their personalities. Follows a very Slice of Life-like episodic comedy routine that doesn\'t vary in episode structure from one episode to another.The characters themselves are one-dimensional but they\'re characterized fairly well. I don\'t quite think they\'re as well realized and likeable as some of the reviews on the internet make them out to be but they\'re okay and serve their purpose well in entertaining you through most of its runtime. There\'s the awkward MC who scares regular people away but is awfully popular with some really beautiful but equally socially awkward females, the headstrong  tsundere female MC, the busty blonde who is dumb but still the most intelligent girl in her class, MC\'s imouto who likes to role-play a character from an anime, the 10 year old church nun cum club advisor (uhh, yeah) and the perverted sex-obsessed genius scientist girl. Oh, and a trap. With a cast as colorful as this one assembled under one roof, their daily lives definitely do make for an entertaining ride. There\'s no overarching story at play here apart from the MC\'s realtionship with his childhood friend - but that definitely isn\'t the focus of the series since it is rarely mentioned.The comedy itself is fairly standard for your run-of-the-mill harem comedy series. I personally ended up laughing a few times during some of the episodes but, owing to the nature of \'comedy\' as a genre, your mileage may definitely vary. If the comedy on display in this series doesn\'t end up appealing to you in the first four episodes or so, you can safely drop it and move on to greener pastures since things stay more or less the same from then onwards with an odd character introduction or two.Production values in general are above average. Art is good and you probably won\'t notice moments of off-model art. It doesn\'t possess any sequence of standout animation and, looking at the kind of anime it is, it doesn\'t really need to. OST is fairly generic but fits the series and complements scenes well. The OP and the ED both deserve a special mention here - former is a very fitting track for the series due to the fact that it emphaises the silly nature of the show very well while the latter is a catchy track that managed to stay long with me after I had finished the anime and I found myself humming it from time to time.All in all, definitely worth a single watch if you\'re looking for a fun show with a decent amount of ecchi moments thrown in.

Whatever you want, you got: big boobs? check. tsundere? check. hentai/ecchi? check. lolicon? check. moe/incest? check. The funny thing is, despite all of its shallowness and cliche situations, I found most of the series to be extremely entertaining due to the group dynamic all of the characters share. The premise of the story lies mostly in the vein of a pack of lost sheep who are all deficient in friendships with varying extenuating...circumstances. What often loses me in these harem/group fanservice animes is that there never really any attempt at characterization or depth in the roles. What sets Boku wa tomodachi apart is the development of characters (at least for me) through comedic moments and the linking of the main character Kodaka\'s past with the current situation he is in. While on the whole, the ending tailed off into a somewhat ambiguous and vague finale, the journey of the story and the promise for future development left me satisfied in that I didn\'t waste 6 hours of my life investing in this anime.Story: 7This story is based off the light novel version pretty faithfully, and like I\'ve already said, the events of the episodes have a direction in fulfilling the main role\'s (Kodaka) character development. I may be a bit biased since I\'ve read and knows what happens in the light novel, but the anime is a pretty faithful interpretation. In between the filler episodes, the story is quite predictable and cliche, the memory of kodaka\'s past childhood friend and current situation is linked up, albeit rushed, left me with a satisfied sense of unity in the plot. The vague, off the mark conclusion, however, left me with the sense that the studio is peddling to customers for a profit before they churn out a second season, or just bad writing.Art: 8Art took some getting used to for me. It\'s not what I would call ""pretty"", but at least stayed consistent throughout the series. As you move on in the anime, the episodes get more vivid and crisp in color.Sound: 7Nothing memorable. I always skipped the OP and the ED, it wasn\'t really my cup of tea. Throughout the series, nothing really left an impression on me, but nothing felt out of place.Character: 8I really took to a lot of the characters in this series. Each character has their quirk or quality that makes them distinctive, but relatable, to a degree. While a lot of the characters introduced seem to have ancillary roles, they all contribute to the group dynamic that makes it oh-so-cute and enjoyable.Enjoyment: 9Here\'s where I probably took the most subjective POV on. Despite the fact, that the story seems unresolved and the characters seem terribly cliche, I thoroughly enjoyed the hi jinx and the comedic play that they have off each other and the promise that each burdgeoning storyline held for future character development. With the ending that fell a bit flat, I wasn\'t expecting a huge revelation of any kind, but I wasn\'t disappointed in the way they handled it by resolving all of the questions. circumstances.

The comedic scenes are laugh out loud funny and the story moved at a reasonable pace.The main character Kodaka is an extremely likable guy. He is kind and attentive to his friends (even though they're very weird and trying at times) and puts other peoples feelings first. His little sister Kobato is also adorable.The only problem is the two main heroines of the story are not so likable. In the beginning we're introduced to Sena as a blonde popular girl with male followers and a rich background. Although we later found out she's...lonely and wants real friends, so we can grow to feel some sympathy for her, there's no getting around the fact she is rather spoiled.Yozora starts off more likable since she has no friends, comes from an ordinary background and even resorts to having an imaginary friend. But her rivalry with Sena is so severe that she basically bullies her, and can on occasion bully the other characters. Her personality came off as so dislikable that I lost all sympathy with her by the end.The supporting characters are rather cliche for this sort of genre. There' the perverted girl who has an obsession with yaoi, the lolita girl who curses a lot, and the character who's gender is questionable. I watched the entire series and still have no idea whether Yukimura is a boy or a girl.The series is a light-hearted feel good anime that's enjoyable if you're looking for a laugh. The characters are somewhat cliche but can still entertain. But if you're after a more serious plot, this is probably the wrong anime for you. And also...don't get hung up on whether Yukimura is a boy or a girl because that's never clearly answered. lonely and wants real friends, so we can grow to feel some sympathy for her, there's no getting around the fact she is rather spoiled.Yozora starts off more likable since she has no friends, comes from an ordinary background and even resorts to having an imaginary friend.

Boy was I wrong. The characters in this one are awkward and stupid. I know that just using the word \'stupid\' seems weird but they don\'t ""do"" anything. They make a club then go around and the same people get into the same fights and don\'t learn anything from their mistakes. It was just irritating, for a...while I thought ""YES finally the romance is coming!"" that just left you with the character walking away because of some ""funny"" or rediculous moment that completely ruins the mood.Sigh, for what I was looking for this was definatley not my kind of anime, although if you are in need of a good laugh and no ""heavy"" scenes you will enjoy this one :) while I thought ""YES finally the romance is coming!"" that just left you with the character walking away because of some ""funny"" or rediculous moment that completely ruins the mood.Sigh, for what I was looking for this was definatley not my kind of anime, although if you are in need of a good laugh and no ""heavy"" scenes you will enjoy this one :)', 'I\'ll keep this review short and simple and discuss the things I liked/disliked about this anime.Characters: Most characters in this anime is typical (cliche) but likable and fun to watch. However, unfortunately, the main heroine Yozora acts like a total b**** and gets annoying which made it difficult to pleasantly enjoy this lighthearted anime.Story: There isn\'t much twists and the plot is pretty straight forward. I liked the episode where they showed the view of Yozora (heroine) - it made me hate her a little less.Overall: The anime was good. It gives the viewers what they expect. Nothing spectacular but not super disappointing...either. The anime could have been better if they decreased the annoying scenes where Yozora and Sena (another heroine) fight each other over and over.I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a lighthearted anime that involves your typical ""moe"" girls. Do not watch this if you expect deep insight about ""social relationships"". I recommend ""Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru"" for that. either.

I think that idea is cool, but in the beginning it\'s a bit boring in my opinion. I think the writters could do it much better. But in the end it was good.If you\'re looking for a Romance anime, I think this anime doesn\'t has enough Romance to have the ""Romance"" tag. It is slightly harem as well.The ending was not bad at all 7/10. I enjoyed it.The Art in this anime it\'s good, as well as the sound. You\'ll enjoy it.The characters are...pretty cool, they all have different personalities and they\'re funny in their own way.I enjoyed it at the end, but you\'ll not enjoy it if you\'re searching for a Romance anime in my opinion!This review is based on my personal opinion, you may not agree with this.

Thanks for reading.', ""This probably won't be a very in-depth review.I am a simple person, I generally enjoy these types of shows, but this one is nothing too spectacular. All of the characters are very one dimensional. You have one who is just rude, one with a superiority complex due to men worshiping her for her looks, another who is a pervert, and so no, that is all that there is to their characters, their one identifying character trait.I dropped this show because I got tired of the constant immature fights between two of the characters. I generally don't drop shows, but when you have something...annoying like that as a constant theme in the show, I lose interest quickly.If you want to watch shows in the same genre that I enjoyed, I recommend Masamune-kun's Revenge, Oreshura, or Oresuki. annoying like that as a constant theme in the show, I lose interest quickly.If you want to watch shows in the same genre that I enjoyed, I recommend Masamune-kun's Revenge, Oreshura, or Oresuki."", 'Not even gonna cap dude, this show is pretty Meaty, and the characters have a lot of Meat to them.This show has a bunch of cool characters and good stories I can get behind, But season 2 in the 2nd to last episode it gets pretty tough to wanna keep watching, other then that I love it and its my 3rd fave anime oat. If you wanna quick laugh with no big looming threat, some hot girls, a bit of harem/ecci thats not too much, and just a fun time, i genuinely cant recommend a better show.Characters were pretty well rounded, and fun to...watch, plus art still looks good after all this time. Not a very realistic show tho lol watch, plus art still looks good after all this time. Not a very realistic show tho lol', 'It\'s best to go into a new show without any preconceived idea of what to expect. Well most of the time. For little hole in the wall type shows its a good method because it allows for you to embrace the experience as your own so you don\'t feel the need to be overcritical because of hype, or try to find positive qualities or like it ironically to try and achieve so sort of hip outlook. That being said i had no idea what to expect with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai when i randomly started viewing it. Let me ruin the experience for you...then, shall i?I\'m well acquainted with the harem style approach, and enjoy it to most extents, so i was on familiar territory there. So as i watched the first couple of episodes I had fairly high hopes for the long game romantic aspect of this show. A foolish idea to say the least. That is unless they actually remedy this in the second season but after having seen shows similar in scope to this i get the feeling they just want the harem to keep thriving and cockteasing the hell out of possible ships and the main love interest to keep you watching, all the while blueballing the hell out of you. That being said i will still venture to watch the second season just for shits and giggles i suppose.I\'m not entirely sure which episode it was... 4.. 5, maybe? Idk it doesn\'t really matter i guess. Anyway around that time I get a thick slap in the face of ""she\'s totally a teenage girl""s prepubescent as hell breasts thrown in my face, in a scene that can only be described as completely unnecessary. I mean.. thinking back it didnt bring anything to the story or fucking nothing like that. No character relation development or anything. It was just shamless creepy lolicon fan service. After this shell shock wore off a thought teemed in the back of my mind. It went something like, ""maybe this show... now stay with me here. But just maybe, Its trash."" Now i\'ve seen and enjoyed my fair share of anime nudity, but that has only been when it was used in a non phonographic or pedophilia manner. So i lowered my standards of what i expected of the show right there just so i could enjoy the ride a bit more. The profanity probably should have been a tip off of the shameless nudity but i figured it would just be raunchy comedy and thick fan service covered by rays of light and steam or some shit. However i didnt take into count the authors personal fetish i suppose. Which i have to assume includes but is probably not limited too, young (too young) girls and loli type females. Possibly also sisters. What tips me off hard to that was there was one distinctive scene i remember of the Hero\'s younger sister putting on her shoes and for some odd reason the animation quality on that scene was noticeably better. It was just a 7 second shot of her feet being jammed into her shoes but it was obvious that the frames were smoother, along with the lightning and shading quality being heighten.So i manage to swallow that down no big deal. The next few episodes are without shameless nudity so i figure it was a one time thing to attract some creeps for money or some shit, idk. But again, without warning, the 10 year old,(Yes, thats right. 10 Year old.) proceeds to run around without a shirt on and it shows her full frontal chest. I mean, naturally. Who the hell cares about integrity anymore, lol. Also i dont know if you\'ve seen a 10 year old girls bare chest before (obviously the author has not) but there is no form of physical maturity there! Like, at all! Good Christ. For some reason they drew actual formed breasts, the kind you would seen on someone who has gone threw puberty. Needless to say this just threw my hole expectation of the show into garbage city.Anyway the rest of the show is about as cliche and nonredeemable trash as you could imagine. I could have eased up a bit if they actually fulfilled the main love intrest with grace but the just threw that to the way side on the last episode to keep the harem alive. How wonderful is that shit, eh?Other things to note are the soundtrack was probably just average or less, unrememberable compared to 10 year old fully developed breasts anyway. Cant unseen that shit. Also the art is nothing special. Just generic harem style stuff you would expect from a average show.Its hard for me to rate something less than a 5 because if its worse than that i probably would have dropped it at some point. So that being said this mess gets to hit the bottom of my watchable rankings with a solid 5 outa 10. If to young girl baps are your thing then give this one a go. If you can look past that and enjoy swears and raunch comedy you might also find a average amount of enjoyment in this. But for the regular crowd i would say throw this in the heap with the other trash. Sorry if i got to angry with this one because its not a terrible show by any means, but that shit with the little sister and 10 year old girl just really pissed me off.Final thoughts: You do get to see the stacked girls tits a couple of times so maybe worth? then, shall i?I\'m well acquainted with the harem style approach, and enjoy it to most extents, so i was on familiar territory there.

Dude has no friends because of his appearance (thug like appearance), he enters a club just to find friends OR HOW TO FIND FRIENDS (this is really important cause it the main point he joined the club in the first place). The whole process of the series...we will learn that alot more about main characters how they interact between each other. The characters and how they interact are the whole premise of this series.9/10Art & Animation: Nothing special, typical Harem, Slice of life style. Brings nothing impressive to the table.6/10Sound: Op is good, but nothings stands out of whole soundtrack.6/10Characters: I\'l try to say this, this is no typical harem again...Main character -Kodaka, has no friends had a friend once in his life. His past is tied with the second and third character.The second friend is -Yozora, but he doesnt recognize her as her friend too. Pretty much most indecisive character in the whole series which never doesn\'t make up her mind.Third one is -Sena . Intelligent, Athletic, Popular. But... shes a bitch is sort of way doesnt get along with Yozora, (has some mental problem ?)Fourth one is typical Genius Lustfull girl. She is a genius doesnt go to any classes as well doesnt have any friends because of it. Lively character somewhat in between of 2 and 3 not good not bad good in conversations makes huge impact in second season where she comes more to live as a person.Fith ones is a Girl or a Guy -Yukimura, il leave you to guess. Joined the club because of main character how he is facinated by him and thats it. Makes stupidly interesting series with him.Six and seventh is lolis, a Sister and wannabe sister. Kids nothing serious i hope.So the main thing why this series has strongest plot line of this series is because of they\'re interaction between each other, how they evolve as people but not in huge gaps, the ending of the s1 and s2 are good to enjoy every episode how they are getting theyre empty phone list a 2 or 3 person more and that are making them feel cool or hip. Just whole series are tied in middle of them. How they are training to find friends. That the whole idea, they don\'t  admit they are fiends but in truth they are you can see it they are. Romantic Comedyyyyyy9/10Enjoyment: Man i watched 2 season in 5 days, its super rare that i do it nowdays. Basically really fun really enjoyfull series anime speaking (s1 or s2), would hope for s3 if i wouldn\'t found out about the Light novel ending, thats the problem. Also Manga ends after season 2 ep 4 or 5. The Light novel ending, i simply discourage you to watch the whole series if you are easily attached to series, sadly it is but its true. The Light novel leaves the OPEN ending and the main character fucked it up every romantic relationship is fucked it up everything was seen and explored with every character that tied with the. In fact the ending is sooo so bad that you can\'t just look at them and smile in the end, just after watching this joyfull series it leaves a hearth torn appart. When you watch a good series you will feel happiness but you will feel sadness that it ended (exmpl. Clannad). But this series is straight out bad ending/open ending. Where you speculate what can happen, but it somewhat obvious that this is bad out ending. they will never look at each other the same way the did at the beggining, just smiling and hoping the good days will never end. FeelsBadMan.Jpg. The whole series could have been something Amazing, Unique and Legendery the anime industry but in the ned they rushed it revealed some major plot points too early and ended up being and Amazing start but a horrible ending.7/10Rating this is tought after knowing the true ending. If the light novel wasnt so shitty i would rate it 8 but it so painful to say that everyone who read it were hugely dissapointed. we will learn that alot more about main characters how they interact between each other. The characters and how they interact are the whole premise of this series.9/10Art & Animation: Nothing special, typical Harem, Slice of life style.

Just whole series are tied in middle of them. How they are training to find friends. That the whole idea, they don\'t  admit they are fiends but in truth they are you can see it they are. Romantic Comedyyyyyy9/10Enjoyment: Man i watched 2 season in 5 days, its super rare that i do it nowdays. Basically really fun really enjoyfull series anime speaking (s1 or s2), would hope for s3 if i wouldn\'t found out about the Light novel ending, thats the problem. Also Manga ends after season 2 ep 4 or 5. The Light novel ending, i simply discourage you to watch the whole series if you are easily attached to series, sadly it is but its true. The Light novel leaves the OPEN ending and the main character fucked it up every romantic relationship is fucked it up everything was seen and explored with every character that tied with the. In fact the ending is sooo so bad that you can\'t just look at them and smile in the end, just after watching this joyfull series it leaves a hearth torn appart. When you watch a good series you will feel happiness but you will feel sadness that it ended (exmpl. Clannad). But this series is straight out bad ending/open ending. Where you speculate what can happen, but it somewhat obvious that this is bad out ending. they will never look at each other the same way the did at the beggining, just smiling and hoping the good days will never end. FeelsBadMan.Jpg. The whole series could have been something Amazing, Unique and Legendery the anime industry but in the ned they rushed it revealed some major plot points too early and ended up being and Amazing start but a horrible ending.7/10Rating this is tought after knowing the true ending. If the light novel wasnt so shitty i would rate it 8 but it so painful to say that everyone who read it were hugely dissapointed.', ""Haganai managed to stand out to me because in a sea of harem shows, this one managed to be quite self-aware. The first season mainly focuses on comedy, which the show certainly excels at. A simple premise of 'people wanting to make friends' is turned into quite a fun concept due to the wacky cast of characters. Rika in particular drives home the comedy and is the most forward of the cast.My overall complaint of the show comes from the unneeded fanservice. I greatly enjoyed this series but the amount of forced fanservice not only interrupted the flow of the show, but my viewing...experience as well. At it's heart this series is a heartwarming tale of the joys of friendship and the struggle to make true friends, yet it seems misguided in what it actually wants to present. The only time I felt the fanservice was appropriate was in any scene with Rika, because it suited her perverse character. The opening in particular is a huge misrepresentation of what the show is actually about, which is a shame because it could turn potential viewers away with the belief that the show is just another generic ecchi harem.If you can get past the fanservice Haganai is a hilarious show, with an admirable concept behind it. experience as well.

May look easy, but it takes time getting to know someone you never saw before.

Maintaining and improving that relationship depends on both parts.

I think we can draw certain obvious parallels between Seinfield and BwTgS.One of the biggest differences, imo, is that BwTgS actually made me laugh.BwTgS is about two losers who have no frens, one loser has an imaginary fren, who she is caught talking to like a lunatic.  B/c these weirdos click on anethereal level,...they decide to start a club for other losers who don\'t have any frens.  Thus the club is formed, and throughout the show more and more weirdos show up, and yep, you guessed it, by the sheer proximity these weridos slowly become something like frens.  The end.The strength of this show is certainly the comedy, but i would say its moreso the slice of life.  The setting is nice and relaxed, the colors are bright, lines are nice and clean, animation is smooth, nothing assaults your eyes or ears, no birds are flying out of anyone\'s eyes.  The reason i say SoL over comedy, is that i wouldn\'t tell anyone, ""BwTgS is an hilarious comedy, watch it.""  There is more meandering in between school life, inter-club relationships, and a little bit of a mysterious past.The big downside to this show, imho, is the ruthlessness of the girl with the imaginary fren.  She basically treats this dumb, rich girl like trash the entire show.  I\'m not sure if that\'s a fetish type thing in Japan, but it gets tired, alot faster than the time it takes to reach the last episode.  Substantial time is spent watching these bitches argue, cry and run away from each other.  The arguments are a little too realistic for my taste, i think there is a fine line to cross in dialogue; i\'m sure some people will appreciate the realism in the arguments, but for me it was a little awkward, although to be fair i\'m probably not the typical target audience and i don\'t really enjoy listening to women argue.The romance is a fairly strong thread that gets pulled on during the course, but *****Mild Spoiler Alert********08998098809839084103940283149083-4981823481-028349018309841083the way they handle it was about 90 degrees from anything i expected.

If you like the chill, dialogue heavy, self conscious cliche\'s and SoL, you will probably find more than enough to enjoy.Ultimately i think it failed to follow through on the premise, it didn\'t lean enough on comedy to call it a comedy show, there wasn\'t enough story to make it a ""must-watch-next-episode type of show.

A typical harem anime, but one of the better out there. One guy surrounded by several girls in different states on craziness, some harmless fan service, a big, cute portion of humour and there you have it. Don\'t expect too much and you\'ll like it.AnimationLooking better than most stuff I\'ve seen, but since I haven\'t really seen much contemporary anime, my view may be flawed. Neat character design and decent animation.SoundBackground music is catchy, but intro and outro is nothing to write home about. Voice acting is a fair bit above average.StoryPretty episodic, but thankfully the ""girl of the week"" syndrome is...avoided. A couple of story threads run in the background through the whole anime and even though they don\'t really get to any conclusion, they keep the interest up and make the story believable. An actual conclusion would have been nice, though.I often find anime comedy not-particularly-funny, but this one actually made me smile almost all through it. Good thing, that!CharacterEnjoyable characters with diverse but not too extreme personalities (ok, maybe a bit extreme from time to time...). Not really any groundbreakingly unique personalities, you\'ll recognize them all from other anime. But still.The whole idea of a club for misfits trying to make friends makes the party plausible. The characters drive the story, but the story doesn\'t really take the characters anywhere. Depth is hinted at, but never really developed.ValueNot really anything to watch several times, if you\'re not a harem fan. Still, absolutely worth watching once.

With nothing that we haven't seen before. Does that make it a bad anime? No. This anime was for the most part fairly enjoyable. It had Some likable characters and a comedic aspect that is undeniable. Having a slight taste of High-School Crushes balanced out with a bit of Hinted Yaoi and Yuri. It has the potential to be someones favorite.Is it Mine? No.For Me this series was a constant state of waiting for something to happen. A few of the characters I actually grew to dislike. It...being categorized under romance is an overstatement, which is only being filled with sexual implications (Despite one or to seen the ecchi eement isntdominant in the series.). Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this series. However now I'm faced with whether or not I am going to continue on to the second season.

And if your just looking for a comedy to get some laughs this anime is PERFECT for you. Despite a few harsh jokes which is usually comes from our main female characters Yozora and Sena. Main male character Kodaka is a good character that brings a bit of spice to the Harem Genre.At the end of the Day I cant tell you whether or not you will like an anime, but I can tell you if it is worth at least checking out....and Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is definitely worth it. being categorized under romance is an overstatement, which is only being filled with sexual implications (Despite one or to seen the ecchi eement isntdominant in the series.).

But no and yes, sure the story is simple but there is true enjoyment in this anime. Let\'s delve into this anime and see why i gave this anime high praise.Story-7/10The story opens up with this dude coming to a new school with an...intimidating appearance. Then a girl appears and drags the guy into a club room saying that she is starting a club and your in it... and no we are not watching The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya. Than an ""average                  plot"" follows and there are some twists and turns and wacky harem/ecchi moments. Without a doubt it\'s an average story.Art and Sound-10/10Truly to an art standpoint this anime is stupendous. Even for a 2011 anime. As for sound i took the liberty of watching the English dub and i almost never have a problem with English voice actors. There was even some singing in a episode which caught me off guard of the characters that sounded so damn great.Characters-9/10I really like the character of Kodaka he\'s sort of a laid back type but also showed loyalty to his club members on many occasions. But im in love with this girl name Sena or ""Meat"" on this show. I don\'t really know what it is about her personality but everything else is *shades on* ""picture perfect"". I guess Hozora i mean Yozara is a exceptional character. Than a surrounding cast in the Harem adds more comedy to an already funny anime.Enjoyment-10/10As far as i am concerned i would not even write a review when I did not enjoy an anime. Truly i enjoyed this anime. I laughed, I enjoyed some eye candy!, but most importantly I laughed.Overall-8.6/10This is the first season and second season I have yet to see but if your looking for an anime to past time and to have fun with look no further it won\'t touch your heart like a Clannad or have any action scenes like Shakugan No Shana but it\'s a rom-com with a little bit of fan service.    -Dennis intimidating appearance.

Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is one of them. Just twelve episodes of relax and spontaneous laughter. There\'s one really outstanding thing in this series: there\'s no shitty romance thread even at the end. No crying, no love problems, nothing like this. Zero. This is actually why I rated the story and overall as ""very good"". Oh, and perverted gags sometimes that are at least at Nisemonogatari level. Fanservice exists of course, but it\'s not really annoying. And... this\'ll be it.

Hope I helped!', 'I made a video review of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIZZH_qZFJc but for those who want to read the script, here goes nothing:*Japanese accent* BOKU WA TOMODACHI GA SUKUNAI!!!! GOD DAMN THIS SHOW HAS A LONG TITLE. This show also goes by haganai and has the english title ""I don\'t have many friends"". Okay I\'m sorry but TITLES ARE SUPPOSE TO BE CATCHY!!! I don\'t get why animes have such a fetish FOR TITLES LONGER THAN MY COLLEGE ADMISSION ESSAY!  watashi ga motenai no wa dou kangaetemo omaera ga waruiFUCK IT I DON\'T SPEAK WEEABOO! SO recently I learned why light novels have long ass titles....It\'s is because PEOPLE BE TOO DAMN LAZY TO READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE SUMMARY! To counter that, authors make the title the synopsis. CLEVER MARKETING STRATEGY!!! So what exactly does the title ""I don\'t have many friends"" even mean?Basically, this show follows around some dopey blonde ""delinquet"" kid. Who goes to this club called the neihbors club. A club for people with no friends.... FINALLY A CLUB MEANT FOR M- ANYWAYS. Thing is, this premise REALLY BOTHERS ME. YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE CLUB HANG OUT AND BOND OVER HENTAI GAMES AND SHIT! Listen, you KNOW you\'re friends with someone if you play porn games together! But in all seriousness, these guys CONSTANTLY hang out with each other. Even on the WEEKENDS!  But ALL of them talk about how they don\'t have any friends. Uh WHAT!? ALSO, Remember this is a harem show. So, they are more than just friends, if you get what I\'m laying down. cuz\' ya know,  all the girls want to hop on this deadheads dick! *horse noises* These characters get pretty close with K-pop wannabe but NOPE. He apparently has no friends.This anime doesn\'t seem to be that well revived as it\'s not even ranked in the top 1000s. So do I like it? YES, ACTUALLY! Despite all the complaints I have for this show, I would say that I not only like it BUT LOVE IT! This show made it on my top 25 favorite anime! Take school rumble a fairly well revived romcom that fans of the genre tend to love. I legitimately love that show DESPITE THE DICK TEASING (nisekoi, I\'m also looking at you!) However with this show. It honestly seems more like a guilty pleasure. Honestly this show was so fucking dumb and retarded at times it was laughable! From the excessive loli fanservice.To the ironically funny main characer whos so generic it\'s laughable. To the weird and somewhat unlikable girls in a freaking harem. And the LAUGHABLY terrible romance. This anime is so stupid it\'s fucking genius! And the weird thing is, At first I almost thought this anime\'s stupidity was intentional. Because the show was so obviously terrible that it was hilarious. However PROTOTWISTU!!!! The show tried to pass off itself as being  fucking retarded. But it turns out it\'s actually a deconstruction anime! The show HIDES the fact that it\'s a deconstruction show. You see the deconstruction element of this anime foreshadowed from the very beginning. I was naive to call this show a guilty pleasure. Because the deconstruction elements TOTALLY SLIPPED PAST ME! The first 22 episodes of this anime play out like a shitty romcom but foreshadow the deconstruction elementsBUT BAM the last 3 episodes where genius! FACKIN\' GENIUS! The last 3 episodes is when this show becomes a deconstruction anime! The show pretty much points out it\'s own stupid flaws and breaks down why the show itself is stupid.To give you the most primary example of this anime being a deconstruction.Take the main character, kotoka. This guy\'s defining personality trait is his lack of one! I\'m not joking this guy is FUCKING BLAND BORING AND STOIC! He just has the typical cliche ""Oblivious nice guy that likes helping people"". AND YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF CHARACTER IN EVERY ROMCOM ANIME! *crying voice* Why can\'t all romcom characters be as cool as harima! He sees yozora be a sadistic bitch, he sees see rika be a HUGE creepy perv, and he sees loli\'s get freaking naked. And this guy NEVER HAS A REACTION! He\'s so apathetic I find it almost amusing, kind of similar to how yu narukami from persona 4 the animation is. However. PROTOTWITERU the main character actually does have a personality! You see this with the last three episodes as you learn he just PRETENDS to be a generic main character. It\'s all just an act! *gilgamesh* faker. But really the reason he acts so apathetic is because he\'s SELF AWARE that he\'s in a harem. He doesn\'t want to show favoritism towards one girl because he doesn\'t want to hurt any of there feelings. YEA HOLY FLIPPIN\' PIZZAS! That\'s pretty interesting! So this guy just PRETENDS to be your generic romcom character when deep down, he actually does have a personality! Inside that lifeless shell of a generic main character THERE IS A PERSONALITY!!!! If that\'s not deconstruction slapping you across the face with a wet noodle I don\'t know what is.This isn\'t the only character that would be considered a ""deconstruction character"". So you think of a harem anime. You expect two things. NUMBER 1 CHICKS WITH HUGE TITIES and also chicks with cute and likable personalities. In contrast yozora, the main girl of this show is FLAT A BOARD! Also she\'s a fucking sadistic cunt and I can\'t see how anyone could call this BITCH a waifu! However that\'s the point. I mean the cast consists of a the most loyal chick ever, two girls with a big brother fetish, a girl who wants to ride your dick, and MEAT! *Insert mooing sound* Honestly even IF yozora was a half decent person she couldn\'t even compare to these other chicks. And that\'s what makes it so interesting! The main girl was childhood friends with the main charachter and CREATED the neighbors club just as an excuse to spend time with him. But as more chicks came into the club, ALL MORE APPEALING THAN HER really makes yozora not even a competitor for ""best girl"". Due to her sadism and pessimistic nature she is in almost every way ""the worst girl"". In most shows having the ""worst girl"" be the MAIN GIRL would suck massive giraffe dick *wisper* and we all know giraffe have big dicks...actually only I know that.ANYWAYS. as interesting as yozouras dilemma is, do I like it. eh!? I mean it\'s interesting and unique but the problem is. The writers did such a good job at making yozora dislikable THAT I FUCKING HATE HER! She\'s a bitch, she\'s a cunt, she\'s a bully, she\'s literally cancer embodied as an anime girl! Thing is, she\'s so dislikable that I can\'t even sympathize with her.In the 25 episodes we\'ve watched we\'ve never seen her show any likable or sympathetic traits. Her character concept is great but the execution was done poorly! At least give her a sympathizing backstory or give her, you know, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! She\'s a bitch from episode 1 to episode 25 and isn\'t willing to change. Like maybe if we saw her have the willingness to change and TRY to be nice I\'d be like, OH, I feel bad and want to route for you to be a better person. So maybe we could see her work her way up to being the ""best girl""BUT NO, SHE\'S A MEENIE WEENIE THE ENTIRE SHOW.Honestly, these aren\'t the only two characters in this anime that are interesting and unique. You got Senna who basically is what created the ""kamidere"" architype. Senna, is in my opinion the best girl, as you see she\'s happy go lucky, pretty chill, like\'s hentai games and also TITIES!!! She also has a whole god complex as in, she\'s arrogant as fuck. But to be honest, when you\'re about as perfect in every way as she is her arrogance might be justified. I mean, Being rich, being the top in her classes, being overly attractive and on top of all that having a likable personality, everything about this girl, screams ""best girl"". And what makes me hate yozora even more is because you constantly see her bully senna throughout the show. All due to her being a jealous ass bitch. And this is the BIGGEST reason as to why I FUCKING HATE yozora! While some of the yozora bulling senna moments where funny. ALL OF THEM MADE ME WANT TO KILL YOZORA! How can I sympathize with someone as cruel as her. I might sympathize with flowey before I sympathize with yozora!Next off, you got rika, not much to say other than SHE REALLY LIKES SEX. I\'m not joking this is the whole joke her character is based off of...AND IT\'S HILARIOUS. Unfortunately she looks kinda creepy but when she takes off those glasses DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYMMMN GURL! Honestly, this show despite being a romcom doesn\'t have good romance. Because I don\'t care for the main character so I don\'t care for his romance. HOWEVER, in the last 3 episodes, Rika was the one that pointed out the fact that kotoka is a faker. Rika has the desire to learn who kotoka REALLY is deep down. Her relationship and romance is by far more interesting than the main two girls. As she really brings out the best in our boring main guy. I easily ship these two. Unfortunate that she\'s not one of the two main girls of this show. So I highly doubt we\'ll see these two end up together.Next off. You got two loli\'s. One of them is the main characters little sister. Ok first off, the legal age in japan is 13 and she\'s 11 SO EVEN BY JAPANS STANDARDS THIS IS CREEPY! Not to mention the whole incest thing. Yea I don\'t need to get into that. Next off you got the nun girl. Take index from a certain magical index and imagine her being a 10 year old and KABAM. you get what is THE WORST GIRL. I might have said yozora was the worst girl, but I\'m not including loli\'s into the mix. Because, I kinda don\'t want to picture kotoka as a incestuous pedofile. Nun girl is an obnoxious spoiled little brat! It\'s creepy to think that this KID is a part of the harem. What\'s even more creeps is that there is FANSERVICE OF THESE CHARACTERS! WHY! THEY AREN\'T EVEN IN HIGHSCHOOL YET! AND ONE OF THEM ISN\'T EVEN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL!!!Then you got some trans guy. He\'s biologically a female but in spite of that want\'s to be a SUPER MANLY MAN! The whole trans thing is played off for laughs and created alot of amzing cringe humor. We don\'t even learn he has a fucking VAGINA till season 2!When the main character found out he biologically wasn\'t a dude. I died of laughter man. Also, does anyone else think he looks alot like mikoto misaka?Honestly, overall I would say that the BIGGEST strength of this show is it\'s character interactions. All the characters have a  unique personality. Seeing these characters interact with one another was hilarous. I found alot of yozora\'s sadism to be funny. (but also painful to watch at times), Then you got all the weird trans jokes that came with the dude who looks like misaka, and with rika you got a bunch of weird gundam sex innuendos. The comedy in this show due to the amazing chemistry the cast has is great as all of them play off each other very well.A Lot of people say that this show needs a season 3. AND I AGREE. The last 3 episodes where SO interesting as we learned that this show was secretly a deconstruction anime! The show forshaddows the fact that it\'s a deconstruction really well. But now we finally get to see the show\'s deconstruction in FULL FORCE.So yea everyone should contact AIC BUILD STUDIO TO MAKE A SEASON 3! Also, what is it with animes never getting a season 3. You got a certain magical index, Baka and test, school rumble, a certain scientific railgun, HARUHI! Seriously, WHY CAN\'T WE GET SEASON 3\'S!!!Overall despite this anime being both REALLY FUCKING STUPID and oddly intellectual at the end. I give this show a 7/10. To anyone who is a fan of the romcom genre I would HIGHLY recommend this show as it might be a different watch. As it deconstructs popular trends in the very cliched romantic comedy genre. This has been your host mightypie, Subscribe for more SEXY reviews. And as always, good night good bye and big balls. It\'s is because PEOPLE BE TOO DAMN LAZY TO READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK FOR THE SUMMARY! To counter that, authors make the title the synopsis. CLEVER MARKETING STRATEGY!!! So what exactly does the title ""I don\'t have many friends"" even mean?Basically, this show follows around some dopey blonde ""delinquet"" kid. Who goes to this club called the neihbors club. A club for people with no friends.... FINALLY A CLUB MEANT FOR M- ANYWAYS. Thing is, this premise REALLY BOTHERS ME. YOU CONSTANTLY SEE THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE CLUB HANG OUT AND BOND OVER HENTAI GAMES AND SHIT! Listen, you KNOW you\'re friends with someone if you play porn games together! But in all seriousness, these guys CONSTANTLY hang out with each other. Even on the WEEKENDS!  But ALL of them talk about how they don\'t have any friends. Uh WHAT!? ALSO, Remember this is a harem show. So, they are more than just friends, if you get what I\'m laying down. cuz\' ya know,  all the girls want to hop on this deadheads dick! *horse noises* These characters get pretty close with K-pop wannabe but NOPE. He apparently has no friends.This anime doesn\'t seem to be that well revived as it\'s not even ranked in the top 1000s. So do I like it? YES, ACTUALLY! Despite all the complaints I have for this show, I would say that I not only like it BUT LOVE IT! This show made it on my top 25 favorite anime! Take school rumble a fairly well revived romcom that fans of the genre tend to love. I legitimately love that show DESPITE THE DICK TEASING (nisekoi, I\'m also looking at you!) However with this show. It honestly seems more like a guilty pleasure. Honestly this show was so fucking dumb and retarded at times it was laughable! From the excessive loli fanservice.To the ironically funny main characer whos so generic it\'s laughable. To the weird and somewhat unlikable girls in a freaking harem. And the LAUGHABLY terrible romance. This anime is so stupid it\'s fucking genius! And the weird thing is, At first I almost thought this anime\'s stupidity was intentional. Because the show was so obviously terrible that it was hilarious. However PROTOTWISTU!!!! The show tried to pass off itself as being  fucking retarded. But it turns out it\'s actually a deconstruction anime! The show HIDES the fact that it\'s a deconstruction show. You see the deconstruction element of this anime foreshadowed from the very beginning. I was naive to call this show a guilty pleasure. Because the deconstruction elements TOTALLY SLIPPED PAST ME! The first 22 episodes of this anime play out like a shitty romcom but foreshadow the deconstruction elementsBUT BAM the last 3 episodes where genius! FACKIN\' GENIUS! The last 3 episodes is when this show becomes a deconstruction anime! The show pretty much points out it\'s own stupid flaws and breaks down why the show itself is stupid.To give you the most primary example of this anime being a deconstruction.Take the main character, kotoka. This guy\'s defining personality trait is his lack of one! I\'m not joking this guy is FUCKING BLAND BORING AND STOIC! He just has the typical cliche ""Oblivious nice guy that likes helping people"". AND YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF CHARACTER IN EVERY ROMCOM ANIME! *crying voice* Why can\'t all romcom characters be as cool as harima! He sees yozora be a sadistic bitch, he sees see rika be a HUGE creepy perv, and he sees loli\'s get freaking naked. And this guy NEVER HAS A REACTION! He\'s so apathetic I find it almost amusing, kind of similar to how yu narukami from persona 4 the animation is. However. PROTOTWITERU the main character actually does have a personality! You see this with the last three episodes as you learn he just PRETENDS to be a generic main character. It\'s all just an act! *gilgamesh* faker. But really the reason he acts so apathetic is because he\'s SELF AWARE that he\'s in a harem. He doesn\'t want to show favoritism towards one girl because he doesn\'t want to hurt any of there feelings. YEA HOLY FLIPPIN\' PIZZAS! That\'s pretty interesting! So this guy just PRETENDS to be your generic romcom character when deep down, he actually does have a personality! Inside that lifeless shell of a generic main character THERE IS A PERSONALITY!!!! If that\'s not deconstruction slapping you across the face with a wet noodle I don\'t know what is.This isn\'t the only character that would be considered a ""deconstruction character"". So you think of a harem anime. You expect two things. NUMBER 1 CHICKS WITH HUGE TITIES and also chicks with cute and likable personalities. In contrast yozora, the main girl of this show is FLAT A BOARD! Also she\'s a fucking sadistic cunt and I can\'t see how anyone could call this BITCH a waifu! However that\'s the point. I mean the cast consists of a the most loyal chick ever, two girls with a big brother fetish, a girl who wants to ride your dick, and MEAT! *Insert mooing sound* Honestly even IF yozora was a half decent person she couldn\'t even compare to these other chicks. And that\'s what makes it so interesting! The main girl was childhood friends with the main charachter and CREATED the neighbors club just as an excuse to spend time with him. But as more chicks came into the club, ALL MORE APPEALING THAN HER really makes yozora not even a competitor for ""best girl"". Due to her sadism and pessimistic nature she is in almost every way ""the worst girl"". In most shows having the ""worst girl"" be the MAIN GIRL would suck massive giraffe dick *wisper* and we all know giraffe have big dicks...actually only I know that.ANYWAYS. as interesting as yozouras dilemma is, do I like it. eh!? I mean it\'s interesting and unique but the problem is. The writers did such a good job at making yozora dislikable THAT I FUCKING HATE HER! She\'s a bitch, she\'s a cunt, she\'s a bully, she\'s literally cancer embodied as an anime girl! Thing is, she\'s so dislikable that I can\'t even sympathize with her.In the 25 episodes we\'ve watched we\'ve never seen her show any likable or sympathetic traits. Her character concept is great but the execution was done poorly! At least give her a sympathizing backstory or give her, you know, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! She\'s a bitch from episode 1 to episode 25 and isn\'t willing to change. Like maybe if we saw her have the willingness to change and TRY to be nice I\'d be like, OH, I feel bad and want to route for you to be a better person. So maybe we could see her work her way up to being the ""best girl""BUT NO, SHE\'S A MEENIE WEENIE THE ENTIRE SHOW.Honestly, these aren\'t the only two characters in this anime that are interesting and unique. You got Senna who basically is what created the ""kamidere"" architype. Senna, is in my opinion the best girl, as you see she\'s happy go lucky, pretty chill, like\'s hentai games and also TITIES!!! She also has a whole god complex as in, she\'s arrogant as fuck. But to be honest, when you\'re about as perfect in every way as she is her arrogance might be justified. I mean, Being rich, being the top in her classes, being overly attractive and on top of all that having a likable personality, everything about this girl, screams ""best girl"". And what makes me hate yozora even more is because you constantly see her bully senna throughout the show. All due to her being a jealous ass bitch. And this is the BIGGEST reason as to why I FUCKING HATE yozora! While some of the yozora bulling senna moments where funny. ALL OF THEM MADE ME WANT TO KILL YOZORA! How can I sympathize with someone as cruel as her. I might sympathize with flowey before I sympathize with yozora!Next off, you got rika, not much to say other than SHE REALLY LIKES SEX. I\'m not joking this is the whole joke her character is based off of...AND IT\'S HILARIOUS. Unfortunately she looks kinda creepy but when she takes off those glasses DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYMMMN GURL! Honestly, this show despite being a romcom doesn\'t have good romance. Because I don\'t care for the main character so I don\'t care for his romance. HOWEVER, in the last 3 episodes, Rika was the one that pointed out the fact that kotoka is a faker. Rika has the desire to learn who kotoka REALLY is deep down.

Like, you just can't seem to get out there and communicate with other people the way you want to, without them thinking you're weird or scary? Well join the club. The Neighbors Club that is. In this ecchi, harem, romance-comedy, come along with our ambitious friends here, as they try to improve your people skills.Pretty much everything about this anime in my personal opinion is outstanding. The artwork is rather impressive and has a lot of detail and bright elaborate colors. The soundtrack is also rather enjoyable and I love singing along to the opening theme. The...story is pretty much like you typical romance-comedy and harem, but still rather entertaining. Finally the characters are phenomenal. I wish they could be my real life best friends, not saying that I don't have many friends.First you have Kodaka, the main male protagonist. Kodaka was born to a Japanese father and an English mother. Inheriting her blonde hair people tend to assume he's a bully, so he has a hard time making friends. In truth though, he's a pretty nice guy and the only reasonable one out of the group.Next is Yozora one of the several heroines in the story. Yozora is the founder and coordinator of the club. She's kind of your typical tsundere type, but she can be a caring friend.Last is Sena, cause although there are more characters I wanna give this review a wrap. So Sena is another one of the story's heroines and the rival of Yozora. Sena is probably one of the most beautiful and well-known girls in the school. Long Blonde hair, aqua blue eyes, and a curvaceous quite well-endowed body for a girl her age. I know what you're thinking, this girl should have plenty of friends, however the dudes that admire her aren't truly into what's inside and the girls are jealous of her.So these three and several others join the club in hopes of learning how to make friends. Ironically enough though they don't realize that they've had friends all along. This is definitely an anime I recommend.On terms of subs vs dubs, are personally prefer dubs, but will go both ways. Pause. Either way the original Japanese audio is excellent and the dub is just as good, fitting the characters personalities. story is pretty much like you typical romance-comedy and harem, but still rather entertaining.

There were enough only-positive reviews so you can read those if you want to hear the praise.Why i gave ""only"" 7 points:The harem is too big. There are just too many characters in there. Apart from the 2 heroins the other characters that all have an affection for Kodaka come in way too fast. Also every one of them falls for him immediately. There is no development, they were just thrown in to enlarge the harem pool. The crazier they are, the slower they should have been put in. And they...are insanely freaky. However despite having so many girls you don\'t see much background stories or get insights in them, its kept very shallowSecondly, you can\'t side with one of the heroins because they are both so unreasonable. You feel pity for Yozora? BAM, she acts like a totally unlikeable jerk in the next scene. Also the arguments beteween Yozora and Sena are way too one sided. Yozora is just a mean bully and Sena ends up running away crying 99% of the time. At one point I was just tired of those scenes. ""There, another Sora bullies Sena until she cries scene.""#cowtitts *mooooo*  Sena barely has any counters unlike the Kobata vs Maria.Also to mention the ecchiness, when I\'m already at Kobata and Maria, is just too hefty. I\'m ok with the older ones, but really? Maria and Kobato, Maria is 10 years olds? I\'ll just leave it there.Surrounded by so much perviness, flat boobs, big boobs, etc. it seems like Kodaka gives absolutely zero fucks about girls. He gets embarrassed when he sees Senas udders but other than that you see absolute no reaction.Like he\'s dead inside. Other harem anime show the affection growing towards one or both the heroins but the pulse here is dead.All the negativity aside it\'s enjoyable imo.Worth to watch? Yes. Rewatch? No.And now SPOILER ALERT; DONT READ ANY FURTHER IF U HAVENT WATCHED IT COMPLETELY.This is just for season 1 + OVA and maybe the beginnings of season 2.So Taka and Sora are finally united but they act like nothing has happened?It was explained in the last episode that Sora and Taka were friends but not Yazora and Kodaka but they just went on like that. No hidden thoughts, no held back feelings. I\'m just at the start of season 2 but the wound is fresh, if there should be more emotions then right now, from Yozoras perspective at least. We already concluded that Kodaka is nothing but a decoration with no feelings towards girls.The atmosphere in the scene when Kodaka realizes that Yozora is his long lost friend, then she turns around with tears dripping form her eyes. It needs more of that. It was way too short and the creators weren\'t developing that deep enough. It will be a topic in season 2 but also notthat  much.my 1st review, no hate pls, just my view, enjoy the comedy are insanely freaky.

Actually yeah, an indecisive moron + a dick as a protagonist (thank you Isshukan Friends), but even without the last addition you can only handle so much indecisiveness before snapping. And when your protagonist\'s catchphrase is ""eh?"" then you know you\'re gonna start snapping soon.To be honest I like the anime. Most of the characters minor the protagonist aren\'t blunt, generic and forgettable and they are drawn out pretty well. (In fact the art style reminds me of oree no immouto for some reason). The anime basically revolves around a school club of...people wanting to socialize. In other words it\'s the protagonist and his personal harem wanting to bang him. You have the childhood friend, the busty blonde (and personal favourite) rich airhead, the science weirdo chick, the trap-in-the-trap, the protagonist\'s little sister, the... kid nun (heh..., guess it was there to satisfy the pedos who had moral issues about incest, go figure).Without getting into too much detail all of them have the hots for Kodaka, the number one forgettable character and also the protagonist. He is the so common stereotype that if he was playing in Himegoto he would be trying to  sexually harass Hime... In other words UNSTANDING AS F$%£! As the girls keep confessing one after the other Kodaka keeps pretending he doesn\'t hear anything and while this keeps the episodes going it\'s frustrating as hell. The fact that the protagonist can\'t make up his mind or take the hints they\'re throwing ever so subtly will make you headbang on your desk more than once. Dude it\'s easy! If you have so many cuties after you always go for the loli! If you don\'t want that go for the white-haired one! (It\'s a trick, get it? They\'re always the same).To be fair the anime does have it\'s fair amount of humor... No it doesn\'t really. With the exception of the wonderful bullying of Yozora to Sena (in other words the 2 female leads) the humor is way too cliched. In fact at some point I had the impression that the writers were just ticking off the stereotypical jokes to make. And going by the stereotypical list... The anime also follows the stereotypical episodes high-school comedy romancies should have. There is the beach episode, there is the Luna Park version, there is the Japanese summer festival episode and so on...To sum it up the anime is somehow way too stereotypical for an anime that tries to show ""unsociable, non stereotypical people"". Not only that but the protagonist is so frustrating AND forgettable at the same time that he\'s making it a pain to watch. On the other hand the interractions between the girls themselves are a lot of fun, especially the bitter rivarly between the 2 female leads. Personally I favour Sena (thank you  Maidoll (Fei), I was wondering how to get depressed this week) and am actually satisfied with the cliffhanger season 2 left us with. I hope the series aren\'t continued so I don\'t have to put up with that retard of a protagonist any longer. people wanting to socialize.

One day he sees his equally outcast classmate Yozora talking to her imaginary friend and together they decide to form the Neighbours Club to help themselves and others learn to make friends and fit in. New members join the club who are Sena, Kodaka's sister Kobato, Mad Scientist Rika, androgenous Yukimura and Maria a 10 year old nun.This is essentially a harem comedy but its not the misunderstandings that...get the laughs. It is the complete clueless in social situations of the characters. The best episode is where they learn that mobile phones are not just for calling home.Each character has their own problems which cause them to be social outcasts:Kodaka - Has trouble relating to people made worse by people thinking he is a dilinquent even though he follows all the rules. He has only ever had one real friend who he lost touch with 10 years ago.Yozora - a former tomboy who feels she was betrayed by the only friend she ever had 10 years ago and has turned into a tsundere and manipulative bully. She is afraid of making friends in case they betray her too.Sena - is intelligent, goodlooking, has large breasts, from a wealthy family, all the boys are in love with her and all the girls are jealous of her. Basically means she doesn't have the female friends she is desperate for. To make herself feel better she manipulates the boys and on the outside has a high opinion of herself to hide the loneliness she feels inside. Doesn't mind arguing with Yozora as she feels she connecting with a girl for once. Has trouble with seeing the difference between dating sims and real life.Kobato - is Kodaka's sister and doesn't seem to any friends either. She spends her time watching her favourite anime dressed as and pretending to be her favourite anime character, a vampire.Rika - is a perverted mad scientist who because of her genius doesn't go to classes so has made no friends.Yukimura - is a boy who looks like a girl who thinks he is being bullied because whenever he changes for gym the other boys get embarrassed and run away. His made to wear female cosplay and bikini's by Yozora. What am I saying Yukimura is a girl who thinks she is a boy.Maria - is a genius 10 year old nun who is very gullible, is bullied by Yozora, despite being the club moderator, and sees Kodaka as her big brother much of the chagrin of Kobato.It is hard not to sympathise and sometimes empathise with the characters. As they genuinely tried hard. Most of them are very intelligent but are clueless about making friends. They genuinely can't see that by just being in the club and learning how to make friends together that they actually have made friends with each other by doing activities together like going to the pool, going to the beach, karaoke and the general chaos of the club.Normally in these types of animes you will see character development as they improve but the characters are so clueless that there is none which makes it funnier.The plot is very predictable and the characters are of every ecchi character in anime and there is a fair bit of fan service which is really there to provide padding to each episode.I would call this an average anime but with strong characters. If you want an easy anime to watch I would recommended it.I've given it a 7 but it could be an 8. get the laughs. It is the complete clueless in social situations of the characters.

To make herself feel better she manipulates the boys and on the outside has a high opinion of herself to hide the loneliness she feels inside. Doesn't mind arguing with Yozora as she feels she connecting with a girl for once. Has trouble with seeing the difference between dating sims and real life.Kobato - is Kodaka's sister and doesn't seem to any friends either. She spends her time watching her favourite anime dressed as and pretending to be her favourite anime character, a vampire.Rika - is a perverted mad scientist who because of her genius doesn't go to classes so has made no friends.Yukimura - is a boy who looks like a girl who thinks he is being bullied because whenever he changes for gym the other boys get embarrassed and run away. His made to wear female cosplay and bikini's by Yozora. What am I saying Yukimura is a girl who thinks she is a boy.Maria - is a genius 10 year old nun who is very gullible, is bullied by Yozora, despite being the club moderator, and sees Kodaka as her big brother much of the chagrin of Kobato.It is hard not to sympathise and sometimes empathise with the characters. As they genuinely tried hard. Most of them are very intelligent but are clueless about making friends. They genuinely can't see that by just being in the club and learning how to make friends together that they actually have made friends with each other by doing activities together like going to the pool, going to the beach, karaoke and the general chaos of the club.Normally in these types of animes you will see character development as they improve but the characters are so clueless that there is none which makes it funnier.The plot is very predictable and the characters are of every ecchi character in anime and there is a fair bit of fan service which is really there to provide padding to each episode.I would call this an average anime but with strong characters. If you want an easy anime to watch I would recommended it.I've given it a 7 but it could be an 8."", 'Haganai is an interesting tale about a group of misfits who share one trait: an inability to make ""friends"". While wildly popular in the visual novel form, how does the anime adaptation hold up?On the surface, haganai is just about a group of people hanging out, reminiscent in multiple ways of Haruhi. Underneath, however, it\'s a story about relationships and fitting in your own way. It really isn\'t a series about how to make friends, the most blatant ""how to"" example being 30-sai. It\'s more about finding and accepting one\'s own place, quite similar in theme to Denpa Onna (as well as animation style). In...this case, they were able to present all this without having to resort to magic, espers, or aliens.If you want a character-driven slice of life comedy with a vary lively and varied set of characters, this is an entertaining bunch. However, due note that while the characters are quite developed, you won\'t find any real conclusions in this season.Animation:Haganai is well drawn with a lush, colorful styling. They visit all the ""required"" slice of life destinations (festival, beach house, pool, karaoke) so you get a nice variety of scenery. They do occasionally use CGI though it\'s not too bothersome. The characters also spend a lot of time playing games so there\'s some fantasy-ish scenes (think Tears to Tiara/Shukufuku no Campanella styling). Character design is sure to please with a wide variety of characters. For some reason, I find the general character styling very similar to Denpa Onna (perhaps it\'s the lips?). Maid, loli nun, busty blonde, heterochromia... they\'ve got you covered. The one thing I don\'t buy is how scary the main character appears.There\'s a lot more direct ecchi than AIC\'s previous work Oreimo, as well as implied ecchi through Rika, though in general it\'s still fairly toned down compared to shows such as Yosuga no Sora. Expect a few topless scenes and a lot of other implied scenes and namings (a company named LargeHard...). There\'s some vague action sequences but nothing worth tagging as action or bloody.Sound:From the moment you hear the OP, you get the sense that this is a very light series, which for the most part is true. The ED is for some reason a rock piece- I guess going off of Yozora\'s ""air friend"" she plays an ""air guitar"". The BGM is light and generic, but fitting.As this is highly character based, expect a strong VA performance. At first I found it odd that Marina Inoue gave Yozora such a low voice but it makes sense later on. It\'s also nice to see Kana Hanazawa playing something outside her quiet/shy background girl norm. But in the end, best performance goes to Kanae Itou as Sena for just the right mix of Tsundere (esp. ep 9).Story:The story starts out in an identical fashion to Haruhi- a disinterested boy meets an odd girl who then decides to start a new club after just a few lines of dialogue. At that point, most similarities end as basically more people join the club and we just watch people having fun. There really isn\'t a strong central plot line other than the passage of time. There is a childhood friend subplot but it really isn\'t very important in the grand scheme of things. Plan on watching the second season if you want any sense of closure.However, each individual episode is well developed, though it shouldn\'t be too hard considering that the story follows many well-established paths. The real value though is more on the character interaction side.Character:The wide variety of lively characters creates a fun atmosphere where comedy is bound to show up. You have not one but two lolis, you have not one but two tsunderes - though in both cases the pair members hate each other. It\'s a fun dynamic that works well wherever the group travels. There are also multiple girls developing feelings for the main character, though by no means is this a harem.My primary complaint is how cutting one\'s hair defines who a person is. It\'s a bit of a leap, almost as big as how having gradient-colored hair makes one a fearful gang member. Another more minor complaint is how some of the supporting club members are only briefly developed (Rika and Yukimura), I feel that they were significantly underdeveloped considering the amount of screen time allotted. Otherwise the characters are a fun group that are enjoyable to watch, perhaps a bit annoying with the little girls fighting at times.Value:Overall, this is a fun, light watch that just happens to lack an ending and has some major character development plot holes. Despite the fun aspect, there isn\'t any further value to the series- there\'s no overall message or philosophical depth. A fair watch overall but nothing exciting to chain over. this case, they were able to present all this without having to resort to magic, espers, or aliens.If you want a character-driven slice of life comedy with a vary lively and varied set of characters, this is an entertaining bunch.

I don\'t write reviews, but this show made me switch to the desktop MAL site on mobile just so I can dig through the UX deficient MAL UI to figure out how to write a review that nobody will ever read anyways.This show isn\'t funny.  At all.  Unless you\'re the type to laugh at assholes in cringey, predictable situations.  The writing is laughable and has the structure of wet cardboard.  Apparently their idea of a good show is to stage predictably cringe-worthy situations in hopes of juicing out a small giggle...from their viewer base.  The problem with that is that their show just isn\'t funny, so it accomplishes nothing.The only remarkable thing is the constant flashbacks to a mysterious childhood friend, except but not only is it entirely obvious who it is from the beginning, it\'s also presented in such a way that it\'s somehow still actively uninteresting.  Maybe because the flashbacks are inserted into random moments and serve absolutely no purpose within the plot that barely exists in the first place.If anything, this show is actively uncomfortable.  I\'m not talking about characters ruthlessly throwing the same insults at each other over and over with no apparent purpose.  No, I\'m talking more in the ballpark of 10 year old nudity.  Even writing that makes me feel uneasy.  Maybe that\'s your thing.  If so, go talk to a psychiatrist, because there\'s something horribly wrong with you.The characters are awful.The MC is completely unremarkable.  He\'s like Kuroko, except to real life viewers, and there\'s no actual purpose.  The entire harem individually trumps the least likeable characters in every anime I\'ve ever watched.Then the bitchy, mean one.  Obviously the ice queen archetype.  Those are usually best girl to me.  But they managed to make her so dislikeable that I detest her.  She\'s not your usual cold and uncaring girl.  Nope, she\'s actively malicious. Her entire purpose is to hover around constantly being a prick. That\'s all she does. Hey writers, believe it or not, ice melts. It doesn\'t just sit there hard as a rock. But maybe having a character develop at all is too much to ask.And then there\'s the usual surface level perfect, hot, rich, spoiled one that has no friends because of that. Her shtick is that she\'s into dating games (which means nothing more than that she occasionally references characters like they\'re real and compares situations to her games, which is probably intended to be funny) and is consistently called ""meat"" by the bitchy one. That\'s her contribution to the show and its ""humor."" That\'s all you get from one of the most prominent main characters.And then there\'s the trap that\'s trying to learn how to be masculine, who the bitchy one convinces immediately to put on a maid outfit and act like a maid. For the rest of the show, he hangs around the background looking like a maid and serving the members of the club like a maid. That\'s his entire purpose. He does nothing else. Haha.Of course, there\'s the stupid, gullible 10 year old nun that the bitchy one manipulates all the time into doing stupid things that hurt herself, because I guess she\'s just really dumb or something. She sleeps on the couch in the club room a lot and says ""poop"" constantly, which is apparently the writers\' best effort at humor. Doesn\'t do a whole lot else except for treat the main character like an older brother.Which of course means that the main character\'s actual younger sister is also in the picture. She just showed up at the club one day, and even though she doesn\'t go to the school and she\'s not old enough to be relevant in a club like this, nobody questioned it, because the writers just wanted to insert her for some reason and couldn\'t be bothered even trying to come up with a plausible way for her to fit into the story.Said younger sister is also delusional and think she\'s a demon or something. The main character, as the only older figure in her life, is responsible for her, so what he does about this is treat it like it\'s entirely normal. So I guess it\'s purely for comic relief or something, except it doesn\'t belong in any particular context and is very, very repetitive. It wasn\'t very funny the first time, and it only gets worse. The dichotomy between nun and devil isn\'t clever, especially since it serves no purpose in the show. Two 10-year-olds squabbling over nothing isn\'t funny in real life or anime. Oh yeah, and she has heterochromia, which is neither explained nor utilized and apply in any way. Maybe it\'s an attempt to make your character interesting? Doesn\'t work. Probably a cheap merch move.And then there\'s the isolated scientific genius inventor girl that\'s also a massive pervert. Once she\'s introduced, the genius side of her is basically unused. That doesn\'t contribute anything at all. All she does is hang around to make aggressively sexual comments toward the main character. Her character does nothing else and serves no other purpose.That\'s it. That\'s all you get. They get thrown together in a club intended for them to learn how to make friends. You think loners meeting a bunch of other people in the context intended to change them would result in some interesting developments, but no, the characters are static and there\'s basically no development. You can see more dynamic progression by watching paint dry. Given the context of the club\'s purpose, that\'s actually impressive. I would have thought that you\'d have to actively try to pull that off.Near the end, the writers have the opportunity to provide a resolution to some hanging character threads.  For a bit, it seems like they\'re about to do just that, and finally provide some sort of character progression.  But then they throw it all away, and the character dynamics revert to how it always was.  That almost feels like intentional sabotage.  Which is worse - not writing in any character development, or intentionally stunting any growth or changes that might occur organically?Maaaaybe the story and characters would be less abysmal if you view the show as some extreme absurdist satire of your average high school romcom, but not only is that not the case, it only makes sense if your idea of satirizing a pleasant show is to create an unpleasant show around the same premise.  There are good shows with satirical meta-jokes about the genre.  This isn\'t one of them.But surely the art or animation must justify the shockingly high average score? Nope. The animation is choppy, the art isn\'t detailed yet somehow is cluttered, the character designs are generic, the environments are unremarkable. I don\'t inherently hate ecchi stuff, but in this show, it\'s just unpleasant and inserted in arbitrary places.Sound gets a higher than average score at 2 out of 10, because the voice actors do try. But the rest of the sound effects are unremarkable to bad, and the themes are somehow exceedingly generic and grating at the same time.The show sucks, and I wish I wasn\'t stubborn about not dropping shows mid-season, because I wouldn\'t have to force myself through an entire season of this. But even so, it gets a 2 out of 10. That\'s partially because it earned a cheap giggle or two out of a hundred jokes it tries to make, and partially because I\'m saving 1 for something closer to the level of badly animated Nazi propaganda.  I specify badly animated, because Triumph of the Will honestly has more redeeming factors than this show purely based on its contributions to cinematography.  You know a show is genuinely abysmal when it has less redeeming factors than actual Nazi propaganda.This review probably seems cringey and trying too hard (and failing) to be funny. So just like the show, except the difference is that this isn\'t actually trying to be a comedy, and I\'m not being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce this. Which is too bad, because it would be money better spent. from their viewer base.  The problem with that is that their show just isn\'t funny, so it accomplishes nothing.The only remarkable thing is the constant flashbacks to a mysterious childhood friend, except but not only is it entirely obvious who it is from the beginning, it\'s also presented in such a way that it\'s somehow still actively uninteresting.

Yozora is extremely sadistic ... I\'m not so sure I\'d call her a tsundere, except for maybe a couple instances where she is actually nice.  It...doesn\'t happen that often.  At the very least, she\'s not a normal tsundere...Sena is a strange combo - very naive and borderline retarded at times, but also a genius as far as school work and athletics.  Popular, with no friends.  Might not make sense at a glance, until you watch.Yukimura entertains me when ""he"" suddenly shows enthusiasm over something other than Kodaka.    His seemingly gay interactions with Kodaka are pretty funny too... definitely one to create an awkward atmosphere.Rika is ... well, damn.  She\'s a huge pervert and has some mental problems, but makes me smile, and even laugh hysterically at certain points.  (wait until the roller coaster... that\'s all I\'ll say)  An actual genius, inventor, programmer, etc ... evidently she can do anything.  She is also possibly the only one in the group who acknowledges that they\'re all friends.Kobato has the whole Chuunibyou thing going on to the point that almost everything she says is ""in character"" ... it\'s cute, for some reason.  Her hatred for Sena is great.  I\'d be scared of Sena too - not what you would call a ""safe"" person...Maria ... well, she\'s annoying but still, cute.  Also a genius, supposedly - but like most little kids, easy to trick and naive as can be.  Also loud and impulsive - but she does add a necessary contrast to the rest of the group.   Her little rivalry with Kobato makes me smile.And well, Kodaka ... he\'s ok.  He\'s definitely the weak link and so not worthy of a harem, he\'s a very standard and ""safe"" character.  A very typical and boring pudding-head.  I wouldn\'t really call him naive, but he\'s definitely scared by commitment and afraid to admit that he has friends.  I found that aspect to be annoying, because unlike the other characters he doesn\'t have some extreme quirk keeping him from a social life or connecting the dots.The art style is top notch.  The characters look good, the backgrounds look good.  It\'s all very full and detailed.  Animation is about what you\'d expect from a slice of life.  Aside from the art style itself, there\'s nothing particularly eye popping - but the art style is very, very nice.It\'s worth watching - especially if you want some non-standard humor and don\'t mind a little sadism.  Full of insults and inappropriate comments ... it\'s a feel good anime, even if it\'s also one of the most mean-spirited you\'ll find.   Maybe I\'ve got that impression solely because of Yozora.

As it's the worst anime in history (from what I have seen until now) to be watched.I am judging this anime with the first and second season together. Tied in with the ending from the novel.If you're a fan of pathetic plot progrssion, huge character regression, and lolis well then you're in luck, this is the anime for you.Now thinking back to when I was watching it for the first time, it was one of the first anime i watched by the way. Yes it was pretty enjoyable and a light hearted rom com to watch. But now...looking back at it. Damn it was horrible.Characters (1/10)Lets start with the characters. Honestly I don't remember any development in their ideaologies or behaviours at all. At the end of the show we are left with a generic ending (talking about season two here) but with a twist. The two main females still didn't become friends (trying to leave spoilers out). Their bickering was honestly annoying. By the end of the second season the main female (Yozara) protagonist hasn't made any friends. No character development she is still the same selfish horrible person.And the blonde girl would always bring down and regress the show. Just for no good reason she would hate on the others. All the characters except the main would regress. Until the end of the second season where he would confess to the blonde.(*Spoiler* This part is not in the anime nevertheless I believe that it is worth mentioning as it is in the novel which comes after and is part of the story and development)He confesses to her about her breasts and how much he likes them and he uses this as a means of an excuse to say he loves her. This is stupid. He progressed so far until the writer couldn't be bothered to write a proper confession.Secondly. Loli. Why. Just why. I loved the protagonist's sister so much as she was so cute. Then they had to remove her innocence. Showing her naked. Honestly for no reason at all.The two kid girls in the show have no use what so ever to contribute to the story. And have no character development or regression. The are purely fan service for lolis.Art (5/10)Was nothing special. And is average.Sound (5/10)Was ok. The voice acting was nothing special and was not bad. Also the OST was average.Enjoyment (5/10)Despite what i have said and what I'm about to write. At the time I did slightly enjoy the show. Somehow. It was mainly the aspects where i would be rooting for someone and shipping two characters. It was an easy anime to watch and light hearted. But people. All the shipping you do just goes to waste in a terrible ending.Story (1/10)This is the juicy part. Its a story about two childhood friends who are terrible socially with others and they decide to start a club centered around making other friends. Not bad. But the execution was terrible. It ended up being a place a few people would sit around doing nothing. This is supposed to be a romance show. You're expecting the protaganist to end up with someone worthy. At the end of the second season. Fine. He ends up with the blonde. I was fine with that.But *spoiler* later in the novel he finally confesses his feelings to the only other male (transgender) in the club. And says his feelings for everyone else was fake. He ends up dating the transgender. Then it ends.What. The. Hell.The writer obviously had no care about the story what so ever.Overall (1/10)A smashing 1 out of 10 anime that I highly reccommend for anyone to watch as it can be something to kill time. But I promise it will surely let you down wirh the most pathetic ending of all time (not the first season. The whole story) so hard you will feel like you hate everything about the anime.Honestly the plot that continues from the anime in the light novel ruined it for me. It is litterally the worst ending in the history of pathetic endings.Despite this. It honestly is not a waste of time to watch it. As us veiwers need to see how a story and anime should NOT be. looking back at it. Damn it was horrible.Characters (1/10)Lets start with the characters. Honestly I don't remember any development in their ideaologies or behaviours at all. At the end of the show we are left with a generic ending (talking about season two here) but with a twist. The two main females still didn't become friends (trying to leave spoilers out). Their bickering was honestly annoying. By the end of the second season the main female (Yozara) protagonist hasn't made any friends. No character development she is still the same selfish horrible person.And the blonde girl would always bring down and regress the show. Just for no good reason she would hate on the others. All the characters except the main would regress. Until the end of the second season where he would confess to the blonde.(*Spoiler* This part is not in the anime nevertheless I believe that it is worth mentioning as it is in the novel which comes after and is part of the story and development)He confesses to her about her breasts and how much he likes them and he uses this as a means of an excuse to say he loves her. This is stupid. He progressed so far until the writer couldn't be bothered to write a proper confession.Secondly. Loli. Why. Just why. I loved the protagonist's sister so much as she was so cute. Then they had to remove her innocence. Showing her naked. Honestly for no reason at all.The two kid girls in the show have no use what so ever to contribute to the story. And have no character development or regression. The are purely fan service for lolis.Art (5/10)Was nothing special. And is average.Sound (5/10)Was ok. The voice acting was nothing special and was not bad. Also the OST was average.Enjoyment (5/10)Despite what i have said and what I'm about to write. At the time I did slightly enjoy the show.

And to be honest, I can't help but to agree with them. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai's story and characters aren't the best you'll ever see, but they are enjoyable enough to have a fun ride nonetheless. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a story about friendship and secret love.Story 7 / 10The story of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is nothing special. It's about a couple of friends, 1...guy and his 6 female friends (of which one is his little sister and one is a boy. You'll get that one after watching a couple of episodes) just hanging out and doing fun things like karaoke or going to the pool. There is nothing wrong with a simple plot line as this one. Good writers can make a plot line as this one into a masterpiece. Unfortunately, that's not the case with Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. The story is good, but far from being a masterpiece. The characters nor the plot line develop quite well enough to make you fall in love with the anime. The story itself is too heavily focused on the haram and ecchi part, which is unfortunate. The characters could have been more interesting, making the story more interesting, if only they had focused more on the story line and character development.The characters and the story are good enough for a 7 out of 10, but lack anything special for it to be an 8 or more.Art 9 / 10I absolutely love the art! It's colorful yet mature and it captures the theme of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai very well!Sound 6 / 10The sound on the other hand is nothing special. Then again, what music could've been used to really make a difference? The people who made this anime made a good choice just sticking to what was necessary.Characters 8 / 10The characters, although not developing throughout the story, were in fact very good. Every character was interesting in his or her own way and none of them were neglected or less important throughout the show. All characters had their own quirks which made for hilarious situations. There were conflicts between characters, love triangles and much more.Overall the characters, although I wished for them to develop more overtime to show progression, were very nicely done and definately deserve an 8 out of 10.Enjoyment 8 / 10I have enjoyed this anime very much. The story is great (lacking a bit, but not too much) and the characters were very interesting. The show had only one or two dull moments but overall was very interesting and funny.Overall 8 / 10Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a very average anime, heavily focused on harem and ecchi, which I find unfortunate, as the story could've been much more than it already is.The characters are interesting and hilarious.

Instead, make real friends who are as important to you as 100 is to them. It doesn't matter if you have one, as long as it's a friend that you care about.”What can one expect from an anime focused around the concept of making friends, it could lead us to some funny moments, it could be deeper and focus more on the psychological aspect, or it could, as it happened in this case, just turn into a regular run of the mill harem anime. Not all is bad as you are to find out in...the coming review.Hasegawa Kodaka has transferred to a new school, but there he couldn't make any friends as he managed to make a horrid first impression and is now feared by his fellow classmates who think he is a delinquent. One day after school he stumbles across his solitary classmate Yozora who is having a conversation with her “air friend”. Both realising that they have no real friends come to the conclusion that the best way to make some friends is to form a club for people without friends, to try and make friends. New members slowly drip into this club, all united by their lack of social skills and consequentially friends, but even so friendships begin forming within the club.The whole idea of the anime is great as, as stated in the introduction, friends are important but crafting real friendships is sometimes a chore, especially if you lack the social skills to do so. The first few episodes are great as well, but later on as more people start making their way into the club things start getting much worse. The concept while great veers off-course and the show slowly transforms into this strange harem anime. Normally I am not one who hates this kinds of anime as you can see by looking through my other reviews, but I hate to see wasted potential. Later on they also bring in some flashbacks to some childhood memories of our main characters and in my honest opinion they felt greatly out of place and the resulting story arc felt forced, especially because the direction the rest of the anime has taken by that point. The ending is not a particularly satisfying one, but there is a second season I haven't watched yet so that ending there is the important one.The best part of this anime have to be the main characters and they are solely responsible for the overall relatively high score it got from me in the end. Our main character Hasegawa Kodaka is a really nice guy, but he always manages to make a horrible first impression and that coupled with his looks made his whole class afraid of him. He is by far the sanest character in the whole club and is the one the harem forms around, but surprisingly he is not completely dense and is actually able to figure out that they actually like him, but does practically nothing about it. Next we have Yozora, the mastermind behind the whole club. It is not weird she lacks friends as for most of the anime she comes off as a cranky manipulative bitch, but as we find out she is actually a good person. The next person to join the club is Sena, a beautiful, rich girl who fails to make friend because guys are either with her only because of her looks or are too afraid to approach her, while girls are jealous of her good looks and avoid her. Her being a major snob is also not doing her any favours in her friend making endeavours. These three are the series’ core characters and pretty much all of the memorable moments are based around them and not around the other characters introduced later down the line. We have a genius girl who is completely obsessed with erotic manga, Kodaka’s little sister who is suffering from a serious case of eight-class syndrome and believes she is a vampire, a ten year old nun that is a teacher at the school and Yozora managed to bully into being the club supervisor and last but not least we have a  lowerclassman that is bullied for looking like a girl and wants Kodaka to teach him how to become more manly, but gets tricked by Yozora into crossdressing. The problem with these characters is that they serve no clear propose and are used more or less to serve as a distraction from the meaningful interactions between our main trio.The animation itself is decent as all the characters look good and the background are detailed. The problem arises in form of fan-service. Normally I am not one to complain over fan-service, but when ten year old girls are shown running around topless I just find it tasteless. The soundtrack is decent as well as the voice acting, but I found the opening unbelievably annoying as it was played way too fast and I also found the singing to be just appalling.All in all Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai was decent, but it wasted so much potential so it gets a really low 7 from me, but it is possible I am going to reevaluate the score after getting through the second season as some of the events here might be given some meaning. I have to say in never actually had to force myself watching this, as it was quite funny and so I have no problem recommending it to anyone, but do not get your hopes up to soon as you are going to be disappointed later on.If urge you to leave some feedback so I can improve my future reviews and feel free to check out my constantly growing collection of reviews. the coming review.Hasegawa Kodaka has transferred to a new school, but there he couldn't make any friends as he managed to make a horrid first impression and is now feared by his fellow classmates who think he is a delinquent.

After the 5th episode I totally abandoned it.The art is good but there story is not catchy enough to keep me out of stamina.

I\'m not going to beat around the bush.  It was awful.  I watched the first season, and I won\'t be watching the second.The reason it\'s terrible is entirely around the characters.  They\'re awful.  There\'s not a sympathetic one in the bunch.  But far and away the worst is Yozora.  Every harem/ecchi anime like this seems to have a character that meets the tsundere trope.  She\'s not a tsundere.  She\'s a tsun tsun tsun.. tsuntsuntsuntsun.  Forget the ""dere"", there\'s none of that.  Half the comedic gags are based around her pulling a...mean prank on someone, calling them awful names (like ""meat"" or ""cow udders""), and I couldn\'t bring myself to even have the slightest bit of feeling about her except revulsion.  Sometimes a character will grow on you, or you see a softer side, or that they\'re misunderstood.  Yozora\'s not misunderstood.  She\'s just that awful.The male main character was the epitome of a useless harem protagonist, without the harem.  He\'s spineless and lets the girls bully him all they want.  Even in the very first episode, Yozora does something to him that he should never have put up with, and always seems to just want to placate them to get along.  I guess that\'s a Japanese thing, but it made him very unlikable, and calling him a ""protagonist"" was a stretch.  Calling him a *man* was a stretch.Speaking of which, there\'s a character that\'s supposed to be gender confused.  But, well... Yozora is just *that* awful.  I won\'t say more because that\'s leaning towards being a spoiler, but take my word for it.

He is like a monster and destroys everyone on his way - that\'s how his classmates talk about him. To be honest, protagonist is kind young man...who wants to make friend.

I believe that this title will enjoy everyone!Want to make friends with othersWatashizashi', 'Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is a show in the slice of life school genre which is focused on a gaming club of people that for whatever reason or another, have some trouble making friends.  Hence the name of the show.  It\'s also a rather thinly veiled excuse at a harem romance comedy as well.With regards to the technical aspects of the show, they are for the most part rather good.  This is a well drawn anime with good music and sound effects.  The voice actors do a good job with the characters and have a decent range of...emotions so that this feels like a pretty good production.  The fact that it was a light novel adaptation and ended up with a second season says something about the show\'s success and quality, as many of those do not get reupped.The show stands slightly above many others in the genre due to the strong personality of the characters.  Most of the main characters in the club have difficult personalities that make them hard to get along with.  A lot of the fun of this show is watching the characters interact, overreact, and maliciously and jealously push each other\'s buttons repeatedly.  Two seasons is also enough time for there to be some development of the personalities and back story for many of the main cast as well.  As much as the main characters have trouble getting along, they do eventually end up becoming if not ""friends"" at least comrades and their opinions of each other evolve quite a bit.  One could make the argument that most of the characters do lean heavily on character tropes, but as the series goes on, there is enough hints of development that it can be overlooked and you begin to enjoy the characters more.The show doesn\'t quite make it into the greatness tier because it is held back by taking an interesting concept of a club of misfits and turning it into a harem fantasy comedy as the show goes along.  While there isn\'t anything necessarily wrong about this, the show could have been even better had it stayed a bit more on the topic of terrible personalities trying to navigate social issues and making friends.At the risk of some spoilers (hint, spoiler alert) While many people discussing the show tend to have a strong opinion on who should win the MC bowl here, I sort of ended up wishing that the main character would ignore all of them indefinitely.  Unfortunately, that becomes very hard for him to do.Beyond my personal opinions of how the romance angle is handled, this show is one of the better entries in the genre.  It is genuinely entertaining to watch and is silly enough to make for a nice guilty pleasure or easy to watch show.  There is quite a bit of fan service thrown in, so if you\'re looking for that, you\'ll find it.  Some of it is a little too blatant I think, especially with Sena, the busty blonde, but hey, it\'s nice eye candy for what it is.The second season is also a bit stronger than the first season and I found myself really enjoying the show more by making the full investment, even if the ending was a bit abrupt as they didn\'t catch up to the light novel (which is typical for a show of this type).Beyond that, there is some value in a show like this in understanding that even people who have trouble getting along with others still seek companionship and relationships, even if forming and maintaining them becomes hard.  It\'s hard to get too philosophical about a fanservicey school rom com through, so your mileage will definitely vary.Personally, I think that if you\'re looking for a somewhat better show in the genre and like the misfit friends angle, Toradora is a stronger entry.  However, Boku wa Tomodachi Sukunai is entertaining if you can look past its shortcomings.  You could certainly do a lot worse.It\'s worth a watch. emotions so that this feels like a pretty good production.

A lot of the fun of this show is watching the characters interact, overreact, and maliciously and jealously push each other\'s buttons repeatedly.  Two seasons is also enough time for there to be some development of the personalities and back story for many of the main cast as well.  As much as the main characters have trouble getting along, they do eventually end up becoming if not ""friends"" at least comrades and their opinions of each other evolve quite a bit.  One could make the argument that most of the characters do lean heavily on character tropes, but as the series goes on, there is enough hints of development that it can be overlooked and you begin to enjoy the characters more.The show doesn\'t quite make it into the greatness tier because it is held back by taking an interesting concept of a club of misfits and turning it into a harem fantasy comedy as the show goes along.  While there isn\'t anything necessarily wrong about this, the show could have been even better had it stayed a bit more on the topic of terrible personalities trying to navigate social issues and making friends.At the risk of some spoilers (hint, spoiler alert) While many people discussing the show tend to have a strong opinion on who should win the MC bowl here, I sort of ended up wishing that the main character would ignore all of them indefinitely.  Unfortunately, that becomes very hard for him to do.Beyond my personal opinions of how the romance angle is handled, this show is one of the better entries in the genre.  It is genuinely entertaining to watch and is silly enough to make for a nice guilty pleasure or easy to watch show.  There is quite a bit of fan service thrown in, so if you\'re looking for that, you\'ll find it.  Some of it is a little too blatant I think, especially with Sena, the busty blonde, but hey, it\'s nice eye candy for what it is.The second season is also a bit stronger than the first season and I found myself really enjoying the show more by making the full investment, even if the ending was a bit abrupt as they didn\'t catch up to the light novel (which is typical for a show of this type).Beyond that, there is some value in a show like this in understanding that even people who have trouble getting along with others still seek companionship and relationships, even if forming and maintaining them becomes hard.  It\'s hard to get too philosophical about a fanservicey school rom com through, so your mileage will definitely vary.Personally, I think that if you\'re looking for a somewhat better show in the genre and like the misfit friends angle, Toradora is a stronger entry.  However, Boku wa Tomodachi Sukunai is entertaining if you can look past its shortcomings.  You could certainly do a lot worse.It\'s worth a watch.', ""Good: The characters are really likable. great animation, funny with an interesting story, and I enjoyed emery single episode!Bad: There were a few characters I wish got a little more love/a bit more screen time, and the ending is one those endings.

They almost ruined 24 episodes worth of content with just the last minute...I can't even explain my anger after finishing the last episode. It made me regret watching the entire show for a minute. I still love the anime and can recommend it. But...again be warned, because this ending is so awful and after some research I highly doubt the show will get a season 3 and if it does, the manga ending (I've heard) is also really bad. So the only way i'd be interested in a new season, is if there will be a new anime only ending.This anime would have been a 10/10 but the ending drops it to an 8.5 rounded up to a 9 again be warned, because this ending is so awful and after some research I highly doubt the show will get a season 3 and if it does, the manga ending (I've heard) is also really bad.

After encountering a girl named Yozora whose only friend is imaginary, the two of them create a club to allow other social misfits to make friends,...the first of whom to join is Sena, the large-breasted, academically successful blonde-haired blue-eyed lass that everyone seems to idolise, but as it turns out, she has no actual friends, and despite Yozora\'s objections, she does join, alongside a few other side characters, and the show from here on involves the cast making efforts to get friends, and doing ""normal high school friend activities"" like karaoke but failing miserably, and also every person being short-sighted enough to not realise that they have each other as friends. And there\'s not a whole lot else that goes on, it contains plentiful fanservice but not an excessive amount, and at the end of the day, it\'s not a bad show, not a great one either, just rather average, albeit the production quality did seem to take a very drastic dive in the finales of both seasons - the 1st one was comprised almost entirely of footage from episode 1, and was a buildup to a rather obvious revelation that they really could have sped up, Kodaka never was established to be mentally handicapped. And the second one just ends suddenly, on a cliffhanger, and a bad one at that, in a high school ecchi comedy, which is less than appropriate.

It's like an old friend that you meet after a long time away(similar to some of the relationships in the story). You chat up and realize that, even though you've both changed, talking and playing together is still fun, even if it'll never be the same.From here on the review will have more of a system...Story: Boku Wa Tomodachi Ga Sukunai is first and foremost a comedy show. The jokes are many and varied (and at least make me chuckle from time to...time), but at the same time there's something more to it. Despite the the show being comedy based, it has a deep underlying subject which can be seen if you look at the information objectively, disregarding the skits and jokes. The story revolves around the subject of struggling to make friends, with different situations that make that hard, whether it's because you have difficulties talking to others, because of your looks, or because of you social/economical standing. The show, IMO, is about the struggles of being yourself and still finding friends which the main characters all have a problem with. In my mind this is a great story subject, and an important one.Art: The art is crispy and nice. There's tons of details into every single thing, ranging from the background to what the characters are wearing. I haven't seen a single lazy, or little detailed, background in the show at all.Sound: In the sound department, as well, this show is good. The voice acting is nice, the sound is clean and they make good use of background sounds when possible.Characters: The characters are all interesting, with different quirks and reasons for doing what they do, though they all share a common goal... To make good friends..Overall: I think this is seriously good show which engages the audience and gives a lot to be loved for a lot of different tastes. It's a definitive recommendation to watch it, from me, and I hope everyone who do enjoys it a lot time), but at the same time there's something more to it.

Protagonist has a harem but the main focus is the love triangle between him and the other 2 main characters.In general I would say this anime is more romance/drama than comedy. It has its funny moments but i'd say the main reason for watching this is the drama stuff, lewdness and love plot, if you're into those kinds of things.The character writing is decent for the most part. I personally find that Sena's character is a bit poorly written. Yozora is constantly calling her derogatory names and belittling her and she never stands up for herself...(and Kodaka never really stands up for her, either). It can get a bit tiresome having such one-sided interactions where it's just Yozora verbally assaulting a completely defenseless Sena. I'm also a bit disappointed that Kodaka's character is so lifeless. He ignores everything around him and acts dumb (or in some cases, is just dumb). It's okay in small doses but it does get tiring when it's what he does in virtually every single episode. I get it, it's a love triangle so he has to continually ignore/reject advances, but the way it's lazily written is what annoys me.On the topic of love triangles, this anime doesn't ever resolve anything. The love triangle exists throughout the entire anime to titillate the viewer, and nothing more. If you're looking for huge plot progression then you won't find it here.I liked the art and sound. It's nothing special but it looks good nonetheless, there's nothing that stood out to me as unpleasant.If you're looking for a dramatic episodic love triangle anime with some fairly heavy use of tropes and lewd humor then you'll enjoy Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. There's not a huge amount of plot progression and the character writing could have been done better. I give it a strong 6. (and Kodaka never really stands up for her, either).

I am not of the sort.The only reason I actually started this anime was because of that one video that went around last year from the second season\'s dub, where Sena had to say something funnily incestuous.The first episode seemed a little boring, but the opening song was too catchy so I couldn\'t resist. It began to flow as more characters were introduced, each with their own unique personality:The quiet but snarky girl, the princess, the fujoshi, the younger sister with the brother...complex, the loli nun (people may get angry at me for saying this but come on. they sexualize her so subtly yet so noticeable), the trap maid who wants to be a samurai, and the MC. The rumored yankee-delinquent.Even though there were so many tropes, and some lines said gave me second-hand embarrassment or were cringy, I still was able to laugh at the stupidness of some of the characters or the witty jokes or even Sena running out of the room (or wherever they were) yelling: ""Stupid Yozora!!""For some reason I would smile while watching it. Each episode was a new club activity where they would go to a new place and do some fun things, and most of the time the two main female protagonists bickering with each other. It was easy to find a favorite character- mine was the nun girl lmao. I always laugh because her mannerisms are so funny and she just tells everyone they\'re poop. Not a redeeming quality on her part or on mine but her voice just adds to it.The art was mediocre, but the eyes are very well drawn.

Please.', ""There are so many things that I want to say about this and NEXT, so read both. Summary for S1: bland, non-expansive, spontaneous, and pretty plain and spineless. Despite how it made me laugh at times and how great the VAs are for this series, it's one of the most 5/10 anime's I've seen in a while.NOTE: I'm trying to keep this ambiguous to keep it relatively spoiler-free, but maybe I'll post the full thing somewhere else.So, I've heard about this anime for the longest time in regards to the harem/ecchi genres. I finally gave it a go along with season 2, despite season 1...ending on a bad note. While the show itself definitely has potential, they seemingly drug their feet and used the show as an episodic scenario tester with very basic progression towards the end of the season, where said progression came out of nowhere and didn't even matter at that point. The worst part is that the main bombshell for season 1 leads to nothing at all. It was leaked in episode 4, given no real substance over the remaining 2/3's of the season, and when it's finally revealed, the main character's entire persona is just 'eh, cool'. No substance added, nothing came from it, just a deflated ending.The technical bits are pretty solid. The art and animation is good, the VA work is surprisingly great, and the one-liners and dialogue are all good. However, having watched both seasons, I can say that people's rating for the ecchi content is wrong. Season 1 contains mainly lolicon as far as ecchi, with maybe one or two actual instances of general nudity that don't revolve around the *ahem* younger members of the cast, and said instances are pretty brief and stylishly hidden or suppressed to the point of being throw-ins. Season 2's ecchi content is a bit more dialed down, but still as prevalent as the first season. Point is, both seasons have roughly the same level of ecchi content.Overall, while this has some great dialogue and voice acting, it's also incredibly isolated and holds very little expansion or backing, with the final reveal leading to a deflated neutrality and nothing else. It barely added any worth to the notion of a season 2. But boy oh boy, does season 2 go off the rails. ending on a bad note.

Well, I got an anime for you: Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai.  This anime is quite the wish fulfillment to be honest, but it manages to become a good anime from some decent fundamentals, like characters and comedy.Story (6/10):Slice of life, school anime are normally pretty weak in terms of story content.  Haganai is no exception.  We have a male protagonist with no friends, joining a club where its members just do whatever they want.  This sparse outline gives the creators plenty...of leeway to take the plot in a variety of directions.  The cast can pretty much go anywhere with this narrative baseline.  There is not that much to talk about for Haganai’s story.  The premise of a male high schooler attending daily/weekly club meetings and simply hang out with friends is a pretty standard anime storyline.Other than its solid humor, Haganai offers some light themes about friends and social interactions in high school.  This is lightly touched upon by the main characters in one on one conversations.  The life circumstances that lead up to why each individual is a loner are quite intriguing to perhaps apply to my own sad life.  :(Art (6/10):Prior to watching this anime, I did not even recognize the name of the studio even though I have watched an anime of theirs.  AIC Build made this anime and Oreimo, which both have pretty average to above average animation.  I don’t remember any moment of horrible artwork throughout any of this anime’s episodes.  Haganai has super consistent animation that doesn’t really stick out from the rest of the anime industry, but it doesn’t have to. Being a mainly comedic anime, superb animation isn’t even a requirement.Sound (5/10):This is one of the few anime, where I haven’t downloaded a single full version of an opening or ending song.  The OP and ED are both pretty unremarkable and I skipped them most of the time.  The signature first few notes of the ED may stick in your head for a bit, but the rest of the song does not hold much interest.  The soundtrack is not very noticeable as well, but Haganai’s sound does not manage to go any lower because there are not any moments of badly timed or horrible songs played during the anime.Characters (7/10):The main character, Kodaka Hasegawa, is a mediocre character.  He doesn’t have a lot of strong traits in his design.  His type of character can be seen in plenty of other anime, but Haganai gives him a bit of social awareness to differentiate him.  Kodaka is nice, has housework skills, and has a sense of justice for those he cares about.  This set of qualities is present in plenty of male protagonists in anime.  This male teenager is the weakest part of the cast because there is not a lot of likeability about him other than his social status of being a loner.  He is quite generic and the goofy gimmicks with his brute appearance get old.The supporting cast is where Haganai’s comedic strength comes from.  I have a huge bias towards characters who tend to banter or insult others.  Yozora Mikazuki is one of those characters.  She’s also a loner because of her introverted nature and how harsh she can be towards others.  She isn’t very well-regarded in the anime community, but she is probably my favourite girl in Haganai.  Her character development is explored briefly, but even more time directed towards her past would greatly benefit the enjoyment of Yozora.Sena Kashiwazaki is the other main girl and although everyone seems to like her, I found her character mildly annoying due to how she is literally perfect and she shoves it down everyone’s throat.  That abrasive aspect of her personality rubs me in the wrong way.Another two characters that I find enjoyable are Kodaka’s little sister, Kobato Hasegawa, and the genius girl, Rika Shiguma.  Both of these characters provide a plethora of comedic value with Kobato being a cute chuuni and Rika saying perverted jokes.  Overall, the cast is pretty good in Haganai.  The 3 main characters have room to grow and the supporting cast are very humorous.Enjoyment (8/10):So far, this review has been quite negative.  I have been constantly claiming Haganai as having average production value and story, but for an anime like Haganai, all it needs is fun comedy that works with the viewer to be worthwhile.  This is where Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai excels.  Throughout each episode, there are times where I chuckle or laugh pretty hard at the comedy.  The humor is not anything new, but Haganai executes it in a very enjoyable fashion that does not become too stale throughout its runtime.  Because of its solid humor, Haganai can accomplish its goal of being a fun, slice of life, school anime without many complaints.Overall (7/10):Haganai is not that unique of an anime, but it manages to be a pretty funny slice of life anime that one can enjoy after a hard day at work/school for a few laughs.  This show also has a few light themes about friends that can appeal to introverted viewers or people without many friends such as myself.  I would recommend to watch this anime for at least 2-3 episodes to figure out if the humor appeals to you because that is the main selling point of Haganai.  You will certainly not enjoy this anime if you do not like the humor. Regardless, Haganai can be a very fun anime. of leeway to take the plot in a variety of directions.

Whether or not that's good or bad, you'll have to judge for yourself.The whole anime is basically pretty bland, but it is fairly enjoyable. I suppose it's the point of a harem to not really have the main character make a choice, but in this particular anime, they don't really go anywhere with the story at all.It is a fairly good watch for the comedy, and yes, it can certainly be enjoyable overall.

The anime didn't really do anything wrong (yet, looking at you season two), but it didn't exactly do anything special either.If you like harem, this is your playground, otherwise I'd just watch it for comedy, it can be funny and enjoyable at times, which might interest some of you. alright.

I have rewatched this atleast 3 times and still do occasionally. It stands no.2 in my all time favourite anime . So i really hope this review does it justiceThe title literally means ""I dont have many friends"".The MC is Kodaka who has a Japanese dad and an American mother. His mom passed away when he was young. His family moves abroad when he is 10 or 11.The story starts a few years later when a 16yr...old Kodaka returns to Japan with his sister , while his dad still works abroad. He joins a school owned by his dad\'s best friend Mr.Kashiwasaki . But Kodaka is a socially inept guy who despite the best of intentions always ends up scaring anyone who he tries to befriend .  Plus, his blonde hair (inherited from his mother) made him stand out and treated as a delinquent.He soon meets with a girl , Yozora who also lacks any friends. And together they form "" The Neighbour\'s Club "" and attempt to find other people who are like them. They do a lot of activities like video games to karaoke all in an effort to train the members to be able to make friends in real life.The cast of characters are all so diverse and very interesting.1. Sena -    the stereotypical perfect student and daughter to the academy owner , whose main role is FANSERVICE.2. Yozora -    the yandere to Sena\'s tsundere. She clearly has feelings for Kodaka but , ofcourse , shuts up about it ( why? PLOT ! thats why!)3. Rika  -  a middle schooler who is a tech genius and a big time perv. But is one of the most real characters in this show4. Kobato - Kodaka\'s younger sister who believes that she is a vampire ( you know just like you and i fantasized about being Super Saiyans )One of the more notable and commendable features of Haganai is its music . They have a great BGM , op and end songs. They are very enjoyable and memorable . My favourite was the one in the 6th epsode , whose ENGLISH TRANSLATED version always leaves a tear running despite being under 40secondsI watched the dub and sub and  I highly recommend that you watch this in the dub. The voice acting is flawless. And i never felt as though the dub felt out of place as is the case with most dubs ( The reason why most people prefer subs ).   I enjoyed the dub way more than the usual standard we get from the sub.Despite being primarily an echhi harem series, the anime in its crux carries key Slice of Life components , which is the true reason why so many people love this anime. I cant put it into words , but it is much better for you to watch it and experience  it . I still cry when i read the english translation of the songs as they play at the end of an episode... which carry a wonderful message.And thats why i beleive the reason for Haganai\'s success is more down to its  slice of life component rather than the echhi. old Kodaka returns to Japan with his sister , while his dad still works abroad. He joins a school owned by his dad\'s best friend Mr.Kashiwasaki . But Kodaka is a socially inept guy who despite the best of intentions always ends up scaring anyone who he tries to befriend .  Plus, his blonde hair (inherited from his mother) made him stand out and treated as a delinquent.He soon meets with a girl , Yozora who also lacks any friends. And together they form "" The Neighbour\'s Club "" and attempt to find other people who are like them. They do a lot of activities like video games to karaoke all in an effort to train the members to be able to make friends in real life.The cast of characters are all so diverse and very interesting.1. Sena -    the stereotypical perfect student and daughter to the academy owner , whose main role is FANSERVICE.2. Yozora -    the yandere to Sena\'s tsundere. She clearly has feelings for Kodaka but , ofcourse , shuts up about it ( why? PLOT ! thats why!)3. Rika  -  a middle schooler who is a tech genius and a big time perv. But is one of the most real characters in this show4.

I am a huge fan of ToraDora so I was hoping for something along those lines. I can honestly say this show does not hold up with that comparison but it is by no means a terrible show. If you go in with the expectation of just watching a and enjoying a carefree show then you will be pleased with...Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai. If you are going in expecting deep characters and story development then you will be very disappointed. So here is my breakdown of the show.Story:There is a bit of a story involved with this show. Guy meets Girl (ask kids) and the guy moves away before he can tell her. Fast forward to high school and the guy joins a new school and meets a mysterious awkward girl and they decided to start a club together for kids who can not find friends. As time goes on new members join the club and they all just so happen to be ""cute"" girls. They all work together to figure out how to make new friends and of course, you can\'t have one guy in a club with a bunch of girls without love being a factor...right! So the girls all flirt with the male lead and he is of course, oblivious to all of it. This is a broad summary of the story but you should be able to get a good idea of what is going on from this. The problem I had with the story was that it really didn\'t go anywhere. I won\'t ruin the ending but know that you could be just as confused at the end as you were when it all started and that is a little frustrating.Art:The art for this show was very nice. The characters were drawn well and it was very easy to watch and follow. There were no crazy over exaggeration scenes, for the most part, this was a fairly tame show and fun to watch. One thing that you should know is there is a lot of ""fan service"" in this show. So if you are not a fan of this style of anime I would suggest your find another show. The whole thing was based on fan service from the intro scenes to the midpoint pauses. (sorry I can\'t think of a better name for those at the moment.) There is also a decent amount of nudity in this show, especially in the first 12 episodes. So again if you are not prepared for that I would find another show.Characters:There is a lot to say about the characters on this show. In some ways, they are all very cute and fun. In other ways, they are very over the top and could be seen as annoying and ridiculous. I have seen a number of complaints about how the characters on this show were portrayed and honestly I can understand where those criticisms were coming from. There is not a lot of character development in this show. The characters are pretty much the same at the end as they were when you started. The whole point of the show was that these kids don\'t have friends and they want to work together find friends. When I heard that I assumed they would grow and develop throughout the course of the show. I figured they would learn how to get along with others and how to be friends both with other people and with each other. That really doesn\'t happen here and apparently, it is even worse in the book. In my opinion, nothing ever changes you are given these characters and they are what they are. So that being said, they are a very goofy cast of characters and in a lot of ways they are very entertaining to watch and follow. You have a sex-crazed scientist, a girl who thinks she is a guy, a quiet rebel who is actually very sweet, an over the top loud and self-absorbed rich girl who is also actually very sweet, a cosplaying kid who always makes the most adorable noise when she talks (because she is copying the character from her favorite show) and finally a little girl who thinks she is a nun and teacher. I almost forgot you have the classic tough looking guy who is actually very kind once you get to know him. All these crazy character types actually made the show very enjoyable but you do have to suspend your belief a little to actually enjoy them.Enjoyment: I know it may seem like I have been very negative toward this show in this review but the overall show was rather enjoyable. I had fun watching the show once I came to the realization that the show was just going to be a fun thing to watch. Like I said before if you go in just wanting to laugh you will enjoy this anime. If you want deep character development and plot lines then this may not be the show for you. The ending also left a little to be desired but based on what I have heard about the ending to the manga I am fine with how this one ended because the other option would have really ticked me off. So if you want a good laugh and something to do check this one out it is certainly worth a watch.Own it or Watch it: Like movies, I have a simple system for judging anime, it\'s the ""Own it"" or ""Watch it"" scale. In my opinion, this show would fall in the ""Watch it"" category. It\'s fun for one time through and thats about it. Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai.

The story is nothing new, and doesn\'t retain focus throughout the show. This means that the greatest enjoyment you\'ll get out of this show is the situations that occur with the characters in the show. How they relate to each other, interact and play off each other. Unfortunately for Haganai, the characters are quite stereotypical.The main protagonist is the misunderstood guy that everyone thinks is a delinquent, his main love interests are a popular yet friendless stunning beauty and another...stunning beauty who is more of a loner/eccentric. He has a sister who is a chuunibyou (8-grade syndrome) with a penchant for talking a certain way, a ten-year old sexualised nun, a pervert crazed genius scientist girl, and a girl who thinks she\'s a guy (or is s/he?).These are all stereotypes, and while that in itself is not necessarily a bad thing, not even their individual traits hold up for long in the 12 episodes that the show runs. The chuuninbyou sister behaves more and more like a petulant sister vying for the attention of her brother, and drops her speech patterns somewhere in the middle of the show for no reason other than that the writers seem to forget she should act that way. Certainly it could be argued that she develops and therefore becomes more ""normal"" as the show goes on, but she doesn\'t actually receive any characterization as the show goes on, and has no real development.This is also the case for the other characters, the central focus of the show gradually moves into more and more trope-infested ecchi territory and the story, while there certainly is one hidden beneath the daily interactions, is left on a slow burn. More importantly, the interactions between the characters of the show depends on whether or not you find enjoyment with them. The first episode of the show somewhat decently sets up the main premise, yet fails to capitalize on this. Every subsequent episode becomes more and more of a convoluted mess, and at the end I felt a resounding ""meh"". The conclusion leaves more to desire, and while there is a second season, I have no inclination of watching it.In short, I found the show boring. An ecchi comedy hinges upon whether or not you can find enjoyment with the series, and I found it lackluster. There\'s nothing here that hasn\'t been done better in another show. And if you\'re looking for lewd scenes, while there are some boobies on display, mainly from the blonde bomb-shell Sena, there are far better shows out there if you\'re looking for that kind of ecchi. I suggest you watch Shinmai Maou no Testament. If you\'re looking for more love comedy, Oregairu delivers on a far more interesting and solid premise and characters. If you do want to give it a try, don\'t expect anything more than an average love comedy with some splashes of ecchi.A very meh 5/10. stunning beauty who is more of a loner/eccentric.

Well, this is basically the entire show. The whole series is like 1 big OVA. Each episode a new situation occurs but most of the time it is just the characters sitting inside a club room saying how bored they are. The comedy is enjoyable as well as the relationships between characters but if you are looking for an anime with plot, DO NOT watch this. Character development is minimal and stays...mostly the same throughout the series. Some people think this show is good, and it can be enjoyable to watch, but in my opinion you're better off with High School DxD or To Love-Ru. This show puts next to nothing towards a good storyline. mostly the same throughout the series. Some people think this show is good, and it can be enjoyable to watch, but in my opinion you're better off with High School DxD or To Love-Ru. This show puts next to nothing towards a good storyline."", 'This anime is certainly something else. Not in a good way, though. This time around, my thoughts won\'t include spoilers, though to be honest, I wouldn\'t be spoiling much even if I did. Some sentences may come across as such if you genuinely don\'t want to know character personalities before watching, but that\'s up to you. If you have not seen a harem before, however, then I would recommend reading on.Haganai follows your typical harem plot. Well, after the introduction. Like all harems, the most unique part seems to be how the harem starts in the first place. This time around, we have the male...lead, Kodaka, serve as the character the viewer is supposed to pity throughout. He is a perceived delinquent and everyone is frightened by him because of his ""scowl"" and hair color. What is even worse is that nobody, and I mean nobody, takes the time to even attempt to talk to poor Kodaka. He is forever perceived as a delinquent, but only for the sake of keeping the plot ""interesting"" for the anime.Later on, we are introduced to Yozora, another person in the school that has no friends at all. She has an imaginary friend and you see this when Yozora is introduced. It is rather disturbing, really, considering how big of a head this character has. For many, many viewers, Yozora may very well be the character they dislike the most. She is very bossy, shows sympathy in the most tsundere way possible and begins one of the most annoying running gags of talking quietly, not being heard and then shrugging it off, usually with a ""nothing"" or other variations. This is, unarguably, the most stereotypical trait of any tsundere, so it will leave many to believe she is a boring character throughout. Together with Kodaka, she forms the ""Neighbors Club"" to recruit friends.The last character that is pretty important to go over in a whole paragraph is Sena, who is the generic popular girl of the anime and the first to join the club. She, sadly, has tsundere moments at times herself. But thankfully, they are far rarer to come by due to her energetic nature overshadowing them. Sena has a rather, um, fruitful personality. She loves pornographic video games, falls under the trickery of Yozora every single time she persuades Sena into doing something ridiculous for her own amusement and is very pitiful overall. She actually starts an immediate rivalry with Yozora and the two hate each other with a burning passion. Later on in the anime, this gets very dark, with Yozora saying things that makes Sena run out crying most of the time. Despite this, Sena always returns to the club room, eager for the next adventure they have.Other characters are introduced throughout, but are essentially for the sole purpose of spicing up the anime into a harem. Too lazy to remember all of the names, so I will try my best here with descriptions. You get one that you think is a trap, but is actually not. Then you have one that is a scientist, but somehow an even bigger pervert than Sena. And lastly, you have a young girl who is a nun. Have to give them credit, though, for making her act her age. She mutters the most childish insults, gets very excited whenever she sees Kodaka (as he does care about her a little) and brings a lot of life into the anime. Not enough to really save it, but to make it more tolerable I suppose. Oh, and Kodaka also has a little sister named Kobato.Strangely, the children of this anime are far more tolerable than the actual teenagers. I always look forward to any scene with Kobato or Maria. Huh, I did know the nun\'s name. But yeah, these two also form a rivalry, but not nearly as dark as the likes of Yozora and Sena. It\'s a childish one, so their interactions always fall under kiddish insults. Oh, and the fact that Kobato always cosplays as her favorite anime character, who is a vampire. And, being a nun, as well as quite innocent for her age, she considers Kobato evil and always tries to ""purify"" her if at all possible. I almost want to write more about her, but there\'s not too much to cover. My favorite quote from her would be ""It\'s an Onii-chan!"" (referring to Kodaka) due to how adorable it sounds whenever she runs up to hug him or well she\'s hugging him. That\'s also why Kobato dislikes her so much is because she wants Kodaka to herself. Now that I think about it, there were some characters from the next season that I wanted to discuss here, but since this season does not mention them, there\'s no point in bringing it up here.I dislike this anime for the primary reason that one of their favorite running gags is to make Kodaka feel horrible. You know, the typical harem trait that is present in nearly every single harem you will ever watch. Due to how good of a person Kodaka really is in this anime, I can\'t help but feel a bit overwhelmed by the hatred he receives at times and, for those unfamiliar with harems, I feel bringing this up every time I review a harem is mandatory and not at all spoiling it since, well, you probably know that the genre does this a lot. And if you are brand new to it and this is your first that you are considering, then that\'s all the more reason for you to read on.Particularly, the instances that make me mad are where all of the girls are in full agreement that Kodaka is a ""bad"" person. And it\'s even more unforgivable when you take into account how many nice things Kodaka does for all of them. It just makes me feel one of the reasons I still watch harems from time to time is that I hope one of them eventually acknowledges the male character as a respectable person. I feel after I see that happen, I can put them down for good.Keep in mind that, as I said earlier, the children are more tolerable, but for a lot of reasons. Another being that they don\'t bash Kodaka nearly as much as everyone else does. Kobato actually respects Kodaka very much and the interactions these two have make for the warmest moments in the anime. If you want a reason to dislike Kobato, it would be due to her obsession with cosplaying and acting like her favorite anime character all of the time. Likewise, Maria brings a lot of lighthearted humor to the anime as well.This review is half-assed since I really did not want to write about it until someone asked me if it was good and so I would feel bad if they were mislead. One thing I will say is that since, again, typical harem traits are that the male is mistreated by everyone, I would feel bad for saying this anime is really a ""bad"" one to watch since it happens so often in the genre already. I guess if you are familiar with it, you should watch this anyway since I will admit it has some shining moments with its writing if you can tolerate the tropes. For the genre it is in, Haganai delivers well enough where you won\'t be disappointed.

That is really all I can say about it.', 'For a spoken review, click the link to the video review on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB7ZD7jHR_gIt seems like, in the anime industry, the major problem people have with these School Comedy type shows is they are all the same. It just seems like the more of these shows are made, the more generic they get. Repeated scenarios, character archetypes, and so on. There are a number of things shows like these can do to separate themselves, but the question I pose today is what does Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai, otherwise known as Haganai, do to make it worth your time to watch this show...as opposed to any other shows of its genre? Let’s find out in the second review of ecchi month, where I review an ecchi show every Saturday in the month of February. So without further adeu, let’s continue ecchi month with my review of Haganai.Story:Every teenager has undergone the awkwardness of high school. Making new friends and trying to fit in. It\'s hard enough doing so under normal circumstances. Try doing so with blonde hair and a bad boy outward appearance in Japan. After transferring to a new school, Kodaka Hasegawa was instantaneously labelled a ""delinquent"" due to his eccentric appearance. Having classmates shiver in your presence is not a good way to start the school year. One day, Kodaka has a surprise encounter with a female classmate, Yozora, who just might be more of an outcast than him - she has both a bad temper and an imaginary friend. However, even outcasts desire companionship. The two decide to form the ""Neighbors\' Club,"" specifically designed for people who don\'t have many friends. Kodaka, a lone wolf in the wild terrains of high school, had finally found his pack. But will this dysfunctional bunch be able to form normal relationships with each other? Or will their unique personalities collide? To answer my question from before, “What does Haganai do to give itself an original identity?” is very simple. Nothing. There really is no outliers in the story construction, the show sets up nothing new in its genre, and it really follows all the archetypes and scenarios shows of this caliber have set up. The story is a simple construction, with nothing new coming into play. A group of friends form a club revolved around making friends, somehow not realizing that, by making this club, they are all friends. Even once the whole gang is assembled, their goal is still to find friends, even though they all have their fellow club members. Not sure if that’s a fantastic use of irony or I should be tearing my hair out in frustration because they never come to that realization. Anyway, it’s a sad thing to say that this show offers nothing new. There are a number of things shows can do to make themselves stand out, such as in Saekano, Kato’s character took the show from good to great, but this show really doesn’t do anything of the sort. But that’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it. As average as this show was, the scenarios that took place, and the antics of the characters were enough to put a smile on my face. As I said last week, shows like these cannot be judged in the same way as other shows and you have to have a different mindset when reviewing. But at the same time, as enjoyable as this show was, I could find this amount of enjoyment in almost any ecchi harem. Very little progression is made through the first season, and it really seemed like they started from square one at the end point of the show aside from adding new members. This show also thought it would be a good idea to add a conclusion at the end relating to the two main character’s backstory, alluring at it throughout the entire series with flashbacks and subtle hints. But, to me, this just seemed out of place. The show chose to go an ecchi harem comedy route throughout 95% of its runtime, but then decided to take a turn towards a compelling backstory dealing with past friendships. With the comedic structure of the show, this seemed to me like a way to force the ending, and shove some character backstory in our faces just to show the main characters weren’t always friendless. This more serious moment really took away more than it added to me, feeling forced and out of place in a show that revolved almost entirely around comedic scenarios. So for the story of Haganai, it really doesn’t bring anything new to the table. An average setup, stereotypical scenarios, and nothing new to give this show its own identity. That’s not to say this show wasn’t enjoyable, because I did have a good time watching, but you could find almost the same amount of fun and enjoyment in 90% of the anime in the same genres. Also, the ending felt forced with story devices that were predictable, out of place, and just plain not needed. Lastly, in terms of ecchi (because that’s what we’re all here for) the show was much lighter than I expected. There is very little nudity amongst characters who aren’t 10, and the ecchi is mostly just a lot of fanservice, with swimsuits, boob jiggles and the like. To be honest, even in terms of ecchi, this show isn’t even that different.Characters:The characters for this show are incredibly weak, to say the least. The one thing I did like about these characters is that, despite them all being harem stereotypes, they were on the lesser seen side of archetypes. Like a Himidere, a perverted scientist, and a chuunibyou loli. But at the same time, these characters do not go beyond these archetypes, but we will get into that more as we go over each character. The first character, and the only male in the show, is Kodaka Hasegawa. Kodaka Hasegawa is the main protagonist of Haganai. He is the second member and co-founder of the Neighbors\' club and was notorious for being a delinquent and bullying many of his peers. However, those claims are false and the reason why he has such a bad reputation is due to his hair; he is actually a very soft-spoken and polite individual. Aside from being exactly like the main character from Toradora, he really has no defining traits. Now, the fact that he is seen as a delinquent and is unable to make friends because of it is something that separates him from other harem protagonists, it’s about all he has. He has very little backstory, but the backstory he is given feels out of place given the style of the show, being used to force a conclusion to the show. The next character is Yozora Mikazuki.  Yozora Mikazuki is the female protagonist of Haganai. She is the founder, first member, and club president of the Neighbor\'s Club. Prideful and easily provoked by nature, Yozora detests ""normals"" but decided to make a club to make friends. The reason why Yozora doesn\'t have any friends is because she\'s a natural loner and dislikes ""normals"", preferring to have an ""air friend"", whom she calls ""Tomo-chan"". Yozora is a character I’m really not too fond of. Some of this is due to her personality, but a lot of it is the show’s portrayal of her. She starts of in a rivalry with Sena, butting heads very frequently. But as the show progressed, this rivalry became far more one-sided, resulting in Yozora coming across as a serious bully. This conflict would have been better if they kept it as a rivalry, but the fact that it shifted to a one-sided onslaught put a bad taste in my mouth mainly in regards to Yozora’s character. The character this bullying is focused on is best girl, Sena Kashiwazaki. Sena Kashiwazaki is the First member of the Good Neighbors club. Her wealth, beauty and outstanding academic and athletic performance has made her popular among male students, and likewise have made her an outcast among girls. Despite being constantly surrounded by boys (who, according to her, are ""doormats""), all she wants are true friends, which drives her to join the Neighbors\' Club. Sena doesn\'t have any female friends because she is envied by other girls due to her good looks and popularity with the opposite sex. The only thing that I wished they would have changed about Sena is that she would be obsessed with Eroge as opposed to dating sims. It would have added a medium for more ecchi as well as giving her more to separate her character. Sena’s character is really only what you see at face value, but has enough to her personality to easily make her best girl. And by personality, I mean she has extremely large boobs. For the next characters, the sad thing about them is they have one defining trait that they are ruled by, and do not stray from this in any way. Maria Takayama is the supervising teacher and moderator of the Neighbor\'s Club somehow at the age of 10 who’s character revolves around “Onii-chan’s” and poop jokes. And not the good kind of poop jokes, just repetition of the word ""poop."" Yukimura Kusunoki is a cross dressing maid (who’s gender is up for debate) that becomes Kodaka’s underling to try and become more manly. Rika Shiguma is a perverted scientist whose sole form of personality lies in her various sexual fantasies. And lastly is Kobato Hasegawa, Kodaka’s cosplaying sister. But she’s voiced my Kana Hanazawa and is absolutely adorable, so she’s fine just the way she is. The problem with all of these characters is that they are only what is seen at face value and their archetypes. They have no feelings, no emotions, and are left to just be shells of characters soley there for the sake of comedy. There is no insight into any of the characters of the show aside from Yozora and Sena, and the little that is given into them is so cliche and sparse that it\'s hard to separate Haganai from the thousands of other ecchi comedies. This makes the characters for Haganai one of its worst aspects.Art/Animation:Just like everything else in Haganai, the art and animation are completely average, but let’s be real, that’s not what you watch these shows for. And I guess it’s also par for the course. The art is really bland, with no real distinguishing things that give it any merit. The only thing that really made the show any different were the character designs, which I actually did enjoy. But, like I said, this really isn’t a type of anime that you watch for its artistic merit, so it never takes away from the enjoyment.Sound:As if I haven’t said this enough, the sound is yet another thing that really didn’t do anything for me by way of giving itself an original feel. While, yes, this is a show that doesn’t need an OST that emphasizes a certain atmosphere, a god soundtrack could have been what this show needed to stand out. But alas, there is nothing new here and nothing that really makes for a good standalone listen. The opening is quite catchy, however, and really fits the series well. The ending is good, and seeing that the voice actress for Yozora sings it is a nice touch, but even still isn’t enough to redeem the OST. The voice actors all played their roles very well, and did a good job at portraying each character\'s defining traits, which is good because that’s really all they have. And obviously the best voice actor of the show is Hanazawa Kana, who plays the Chuunibyou loli and Kodaka’s sister, Kobato Hasegawa. God, that woman can truly play any role. Can she just hurry up and marry me already?Overall:Haganai is a show that really suffers from the flaw of not doing anything to make itself stand out amongst anime of the genre, and for that reason I find it really hard to recommend you watch this show. I’m not going to go as far as to say you shouldn’t watch it because for an ecchi harem you really can’t go wrong with this one. For this show, it really just has to deal with your opinions on average. If you take everything you watch at face value and enjoy it no matter what, then I can see why you would like this show. While it doesn’t do anything different, it’s still an enjoyable show for those who like seeing antics of club attending high schoolers. But for those that want more, or for those who are tired of seeing the same ecchi harem setup and character archetypes, I can say with upmost certainty this show is not for you. The story is incredibly simple, with no interesting setups or dynamics that make is any different from other shows of its kind. the characters, while they are on the lesser used side, are all standard archetypes of ecchi harems, and are defined by their traits with no real emotions, and are just shells of characters used for the sake of comedy, aside from Sena, Yozora, and Kodaka. The art, animation, and sound do just enough to make the show work, but just like everything else, offer nothing new to be experienced. With the exception of Hanazawa Kana, of course. Even in terms of ecchi, there is nothing that stands out, mainly consisting of your standard beach bikini scene or lewd sexual fantasy. And, I believe this has to be said, but only one scene actually gave me a boner. Too much information? Sorry about that. In the end, I would say if you like these types of shows, go for it. You won’t be disappointed. And heck, even I had fun watching the antics of the characters. But if you’re looking for something new, or expect something that’s not ecchi harem stereotypes, you’ve come to the wrong place. As for alternate recommendations, I think you should check out My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu. SNAFU takes the concepts of Haganai and takes them to the next level by actually portraying the characters as humans through its dialogue. And you should also check out Absolute Duo for more ecchi harem goodness. Not really anything special here either, but if you liked Haganai, I’m sure you would like this too. as opposed to any other shows of its genre? Let’s find out in the second review of ecchi month, where I review an ecchi show every Saturday in the month of February. So without further adeu, let’s continue ecchi month with my review of Haganai.Story:Every teenager has undergone the awkwardness of high school. Making new friends and trying to fit in. It\'s hard enough doing so under normal circumstances. Try doing so with blonde hair and a bad boy outward appearance in Japan. After transferring to a new school, Kodaka Hasegawa was instantaneously labelled a ""delinquent"" due to his eccentric appearance. Having classmates shiver in your presence is not a good way to start the school year. One day, Kodaka has a surprise encounter with a female classmate, Yozora, who just might be more of an outcast than him - she has both a bad temper and an imaginary friend. However, even outcasts desire companionship. The two decide to form the ""Neighbors\' Club,"" specifically designed for people who don\'t have many friends. Kodaka, a lone wolf in the wild terrains of high school, had finally found his pack. But will this dysfunctional bunch be able to form normal relationships with each other? Or will their unique personalities collide? To answer my question from before, “What does Haganai do to give itself an original identity?” is very simple. Nothing. There really is no outliers in the story construction, the show sets up nothing new in its genre, and it really follows all the archetypes and scenarios shows of this caliber have set up.

But it’s even worse when every single student and teacher on campus is convinced that you’ll beat them up for minor offenses.  This is the boat Kodaka Hasegawa finds himself in when his entire class sees him stumble over his feet in front of them, and automatically assumes he was trying to assault the teacher.  Feared and avoided, the already timid teen seems doomed to never make any friends...  Until he walks in on one of his quieter classmates having a lively conversation with her invisible friend.Their conversation convinces her to...create her own club for the sole purpose of helping people make friends, and Kodaka is her first member, whether he likes it or not.  Soon enough, their club attracts a bunch of other socially awkward kids from around the school, all of whom possess their own special forms of insanity, and all of whom have a big heaping helping of puppy love for Kodaka.  Will these lonesome losers be able to teach each other how to make friends with their fellow students, or will they realize that the best friends they could ever ask for were right under their noses the entire time?Haganai was produced by AIC Build, a company that’s been around since the mid eighties, and they’ve been more or less active ever since, pumping out some very diverse and varied titles.  It’s difficult to find a common thread between them, but it would appear that they’ve been very astute about keeping with the styles of the times...  Their newer work like this and Kotoura-san looks nothing like their earlier work, like Battle Athletes Victory and several Tenchi titles.  I talked about them before in my Oreimo review, and my comments from back then still hold up...  Well, some of them do.On the plus side, the series looks great.  The character designs are inspired, with very unique and attractive appearances for each character.  The bright color palette that was applied to them contrasts beautifully with the darker, more realistic looking settings they often appear in.  The animation, on the other hand, is a little on the dull side.  Static shots of the characters talking to each other is only ever broken up by repetitive panning shots, and only the smallest bursts of movement seem to have been deemed worthy of being truly animated. The use of lighting is thoughtful and does tend to make up for it at times, but that trick gets old pretty fast.Well, to be more accurate, the animation budget appears to have been allocated towards all of the fanservice scenes, and boy are there a lot of them.  There’s one character who has breasts that are roughly the size of watermelons, and I’d be willing to bet that two thirds of the budget went towards showing off these giant honkers, whether it means putting her in a skimpy outfit when she’s playing a fantasy video game, jiggling them around in a swimsuit, or just jiggling them around in general.  It’s transparent as all hell, but at least the animation doesn’t look bad as a result...  No, bland animation and generic settings aside, it’s a pretty easy-on-the-eye series.The music is your standard fare for this kind of show, but that’s also not really a bad thing...  It does a serviceable enough job, even if it doesn’t feature any stand-outs and isn’t very memorable.  The opening and closing, on the other hand, are SO AWESOME.  The opening, Zannenkei Rinjinbu by Tomodachi Tsukuritai, is fast, catchy, and features some intense orchestration with a fast-paced and well-animated video to go with it.  The closing, Watashi no Ki-Mo-Chi by Maria Inoue, is pure rock and roll.  The video features the two main female characters rocking out on guitar while cloaked in shadows, which...  I’m not gonna lie...  I couldn’t skip once.The English dub is yet another Jamie Marchi effort, which of course means I’m going to spend the entire experience face-palming from all the lame faux teen dialogue and repeated phrases, right?  Well, no.  This is actually one of the better dubs she’s written.  It had a few hiccups in the beginning, with her two favorite terms (totes and what the crap?) shoved into the first episode within a single minute of each other, but from there on, the teen slang she uses never really feels false or out of place...  The only real problem I had with it is the “Clever” little joke she made twice about the main character’s hair color.See, in Japan, blondness is a stereotypical sign of non-conformity, as it means someone is either a foreigner who doesn’t understand societal norms, or a delinquent who just doesn’t care.  Kodoka is perceived by his classmates as both, so his hair color was obviously a deliberate detail that was added in during his design process...  But Jamie Marchi still manages to slip in two jokes about his blondness meaning he’s an airhead.  Not only is that an American thing, but in neither case is it actually called for in the script.  But even with one glaring mistake like that one, the acting is still pretty good.To be fair, Jerry Jewel does sound like he’s phoning it in with the lead role, but I can’t say I blame the guy...  After the first episode ends, his character just isn’t that interesting.  That’s not to say other actors couldn’t have put forth a much more interesting performance, but for what we got, it’s not bad.  Whitney Rodgers in the role of Yozora is cruel, sarcastic, diabolical, and plays the character as though she genuinely empathized with her.  Jad Saxton is haughty, manic and insecure as the boisterous Sena, and her particular high pitched nasally voice projects her frantic whining perfectly.  Alexis Tipton goes balls-out insane with Rika’s perverted ranting, doing a very impressive job with material that a lot of actresses probably wouldn’t have been comfortable with.  Alison Viktorin does okay, but I’ve heard her do much better in other roles.Slice of Life and Harem are two of the most heavily maligned genres in anime history.  The former is known for being boring and by the numbers, while the latter is largely known for being misogynistic self-insert cheesecake.   They used to be, for the most part, two separate genres.    There were some blends, but they didn’t really become a common thing until the concept of the ‘misfit school club’ anime was invented and largely popularized by a certain god girl and her brigade.  With that innovation came the perfect excuse to gather a group of color-coded school girls and examine their daily lives in a small communal setting.  Oh, and occasionally, there would be one male character among them to become the object of their affections while taking the high road at every possible opportunity.It’s pathetic and transparent, but it made production of such titles a lot easier, as slice of life titles had some extra flavor that they rarely had before, and harem titles were no longer solely dependant on coming up with new plots to set themselves against.  Now, that’s not to say this formula can’t be done right...  As long as the product is well written, funny, and brings something new to the table, a slice of life harem series can easily become more than the sum of its parts...  Just look at Ouran High School Host Club and Oreshura as prime examples of this.So what does Haganai bring to the table?  Well, it brings a very interesting set-up, with it’s two downtrodden main characters with depressed, cynical attitudes towards school and other people, yet making the effort to rise above it and develop social lives anyway.  Their first club member is a bubbly popular girl who wants their help making genuine friends who aren’t just after her for their own benefit, and her upbeat attitude clashes instantly with Yozora’s more pessimistic outlook.  Now, this set-up is a very promising one, and offers a lot of potential for depth, complexity and character development as these three very different people bounce off of and challenge each other through their many differences.  It could have been a truly great dramedy.Unfortunately, this intriguing dynamic is thrown out with the burnable trash as the show is taken over by shallow new characters and ridiculous situations that seem to have been conceived for the sole purpose of putting the female characters in skimpy outfits and baiting them into different kinds of male-driven otaku porn, which they’ll watch, play, and adamantly defend.  We get the beach episode, we get the pool episode, we get a bunch of token harem characters, and by the time Kodaka’s 13 year old little sister bursts onto the screen naked as the day she was born for the first of this show’s many nude scenes, it should have been clear to everyone watching that any hint of depth there may have been in the beginning was nothing more than insincere ennui, which was intended...  With help from the darker, bleak aesthetic of the series...  To make the characters seem more intellectual and edgy than similar characters in other harem shows.And no, there is nothing smart or substantial about this series, even when you compare it to other titles in the school club/harem genre.  It’s yet another twelve episode commercial for body pillows.  But that’s what the genre is, right?  You can’t criticize a harem for being a harem any more than you can criticize porn for being porn, right?  Well, even putting aside the achievements of the few good titles out there, Haganai still has one problem that sets it apart from any other harem that I’ve seen...  Or better yet, and other anime that I can think of on the spot.  Haganai might be the only anime I’ve ever seen that pretends to have had effort put into it.  It actually pretends to try.Generally speaking, no harem show really has to put much effort into writing their characters.  They fit into pre-set categories, and you can pretty much write them with a checklist in the other hand.  Haganai takes this a step farther by stealing it’s characters wholesale from other anime, and then rewriting those characters just enough to make them legally original.  Here, let’s do a brief run-down of the cast of this show.The main character is a good natured boy who’s a great cook, but he gets mistaken for a punk due to his looks and an unfortunate misunderstanding.  He has a name, but you’d do just fine calling him Ryouji from Toradora.  He meets the first member of his harem when he walks in on her doing something embarrassing in an empty classroom(because of course he does), and she winds up being a loner weirdo who can’t make friends because she doesn’t want to join any clubs.  Her conversation with him inspires her to start her own club, where she treats her members more as commodities than friends...  Oh, and by the way, they knew each other a long time ago.  You can file her right under the long list of Haruhi Suzumiya clones.Their next member is Sena, a popular girl with great grades who tries way too hard to be the best at everything and is in desperate need of genuine friends, and she immediately enters into a cat-and-dog relationship with the main girl.  She was obviously intended to be a clone of Ami from Toradora, but Ami was never this annoying.  Yukimura is an effeminate boy who has a complex about looking like a girl, so he’s basically Hideyoshi from Baka and Test...  Except that he’s in love with Kodaka, so he’s more like Ruka from Steins;Gate.  Rika is the socially exempt scientist who is sex crazed, overly forward, and acts like a perverted old man.  Think Washu from Tenchi for this one.  There’s a little girl who’s so obviously supposed to be Index, and oh yeah, Kodaka has a precocious little sister who is in love with him and dresses in very otaku friendly cosplays, so she’s pretty much every generic incest/pedophile fantasy ever invented.In other words, there is not one original idea in this entire series.  Even the one good plot line it has was adapted and repackaged from better stories like Haruhi Suzumiya and the Love Hina manga.  The set-ups, which seemed pretty meaty at first, ultimately lead to nothing more than tired harem elements and aimless pandering that accomplishes exactly what it tries:  nothing.  Which is a shame, because these set-ups really did have a lot of potential, and I’m not just saying that in an empty way.So, since I have such a great record of putting my money where my mouth it, here’s a list of some of the opportunities that Haganai missed by leaning back on the notoriously low harem standards..  Yozora could have forced her club to interact with other clubs, only to unintentionally alienate them even farther with hilarious results.  Sena’s sudden nosedive into video game addiction could have come into conflict with her studying habits, making her grades suffer as a result.  Speaking of Sena, she could have used her popularity and influence to show the student body that Kodaka isn’t really as bad a person as they think he is(Seriously, if you're going to steal an idea from Toradora, you might as well go all the way with it).  Hell, maybe if Sena’s giant boobs hadn’t permanently damaged her backbone, she could stand up to Yozora instead of running away, calling her out on the fact that she wants to make friends, but is a complete bitch to anybody who comes close to her.Are those ideas great?  Maybe not.  I’m not a professional writer.  I write fanfics occasionally, but if we’re being completely honest, they’re not very good.  But I have 100 percent confidence that the scenarios I just cooked up are better than the ones Haganai comes up with.  I’ll bet anything they’d be more interesting than watching Yozora intimidate a 10 year old girl by threatening to make revenge porn of her, or having Sena’s dad get drunk and hit on Kodaka, or having the entire female cast act like mewling, manipulative, infantile idiots who bickerwith each other for literally no reason other than a continuous feud that started over nothing and escalated over nothing.  They beat the hell out of seeing the cast play a virtual reality game that somehow knows exactly what they look like in real life.I’ll admit, though, Haganai does have it’s moments.  The feud between Yozora and Sena, while annoying and pointless and at one point even a little rapey(beach episode), was funny at times.  Yozora’s history with Kodaka is also really interesting, at least in the very small amount of screen time it’s given.  But aside from that, the only way I could make this experience less painful was by pretending that the Neighbors club didn’t really exist...  That Kodaka was just a lonely boy in an empty room imagining that he had a harem of hot girls at his beck and call.  He based a few of them on girls he knew, and based the rest off of anime and games he’d enjoyed.  That’s why none of them ever act like real people...  He doesn’t know how real girls act!That’s why he’s always rejecting or ignoring their advances...  Because while having them want him helps his fragile ego, he doesn’t want to be known as the guy who fools around with invisible people.  That’s why these girls are so interested in porno and video games...  Because he wants to be able to relate to them, so he gave them the same hobbies and interests that he has!  It’s not as terrible a show as it looks, it’s a deep character study about a delusional porn game addict!  Yes, I know this theory doesn’t hold up.  Yes, I know it’s BS.  But you know what?  I had to try really hard to enjoy this turd muffin, and that BS is the only weapon I had at my disposal, so back off!Haganai: I don’t have many friends is available from Funimation.  You can find it in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack for between thirty and forty dollars.  You can also find the second season for exactly the same.  There have been several written iterations of the series, and while the original light novels have not yet been translated into English or released in America, a few of the manga series have been released stateside by Seven Seas entertainment.  Netflix does not carry it, but Funimation does, although you’ll have to pay to see beyond episode 2.  The second season doesn’t really improve upon any of my complaints, aside from the fact that all of the nudity is gone, which is...  Kind of missing the point.At first glance, Haganai looks like it has the potential to become more than the sum of it’s parts, both as a harem series and just as a series in general.  Well, that’s what it wants you to think, with it’s eye-catching aesthetic and cynical tone.  By not following through on any of this potential, it falls far below the sum of it’s parts, offering the same damn cheesecake garbage we’ve seen a million times before.  I might be able to forgive it for that if it hadn’t been so pretnetious in it’s presentation, and had just decided to have fun with itself like any ecchi show should do...  But it doesn’t, which lowers my opinion of it right back down to the level of all those other pandering titty-fest shows that it should be at least technically superior to.  It’s lazy, unoriginal; and just flat out not worth the effort.  I give Haganai a 2/10. create her own club for the sole purpose of helping people make friends, and Kodaka is her first member, whether he likes it or not.  Soon enough, their club attracts a bunch of other socially awkward kids from around the school, all of whom possess their own special forms of insanity, and all of whom have a big heaping helping of puppy love for Kodaka.  Will these lonesome losers be able to teach each other how to make friends with their fellow students, or will they realize that the best friends they could ever ask for were right under their noses the entire time?Haganai was produced by AIC Build, a company that’s been around since the mid eighties, and they’ve been more or less active ever since, pumping out some very diverse and varied titles.  It’s difficult to find a common thread between them, but it would appear that they’ve been very astute about keeping with the styles of the times...  Their newer work like this and Kotoura-san looks nothing like their earlier work, like Battle Athletes Victory and several Tenchi titles.  I talked about them before in my Oreimo review, and my comments from back then still hold up...  Well, some of them do.On the plus side, the series looks great.  The character designs are inspired, with very unique and attractive appearances for each character.  The bright color palette that was applied to them contrasts beautifully with the darker, more realistic looking settings they often appear in.  The animation, on the other hand, is a little on the dull side.  Static shots of the characters talking to each other is only ever broken up by repetitive panning shots, and only the smallest bursts of movement seem to have been deemed worthy of being truly animated. The use of lighting is thoughtful and does tend to make up for it at times, but that trick gets old pretty fast.Well, to be more accurate, the animation budget appears to have been allocated towards all of the fanservice scenes, and boy are there a lot of them.  There’s one character who has breasts that are roughly the size of watermelons, and I’d be willing to bet that two thirds of the budget went towards showing off these giant honkers, whether it means putting her in a skimpy outfit when she’s playing a fantasy video game, jiggling them around in a swimsuit, or just jiggling them around in general.  It’s transparent as all hell, but at least the animation doesn’t look bad as a result...  No, bland animation and generic settings aside, it’s a pretty easy-on-the-eye series.The music is your standard fare for this kind of show, but that’s also not really a bad thing...  It does a serviceable enough job, even if it doesn’t feature any stand-outs and isn’t very memorable.  The opening and closing, on the other hand, are SO AWESOME.  The opening, Zannenkei Rinjinbu by Tomodachi Tsukuritai, is fast, catchy, and features some intense orchestration with a fast-paced and well-animated video to go with it.  The closing, Watashi no Ki-Mo-Chi by Maria Inoue, is pure rock and roll.  The video features the two main female characters rocking out on guitar while cloaked in shadows, which...  I’m not gonna lie...  I couldn’t skip once.The English dub is yet another Jamie Marchi effort, which of course means I’m going to spend the entire experience face-palming from all the lame faux teen dialogue and repeated phrases, right?  Well, no.  This is actually one of the better dubs she’s written.  It had a few hiccups in the beginning, with her two favorite terms (totes and what the crap?) shoved into the first episode within a single minute of each other, but from there on, the teen slang she uses never really feels false or out of place...  The only real problem I had with it is the “Clever” little joke she made twice about the main character’s hair color.See, in Japan, blondness is a stereotypical sign of non-conformity, as it means someone is either a foreigner who doesn’t understand societal norms, or a delinquent who just doesn’t care.  Kodoka is perceived by his classmates as both, so his hair color was obviously a deliberate detail that was added in during his design process...  But Jamie Marchi still manages to slip in two jokes about his blondness meaning he’s an airhead.  Not only is that an American thing, but in neither case is it actually called for in the script.  But even with one glaring mistake like that one, the acting is still pretty good.To be fair, Jerry Jewel does sound like he’s phoning it in with the lead role, but I can’t say I blame the guy...  After the first episode ends, his character just isn’t that interesting.  That’s not to say other actors couldn’t have put forth a much more interesting performance, but for what we got, it’s not bad.  Whitney Rodgers in the role of Yozora is cruel, sarcastic, diabolical, and plays the character as though she genuinely empathized with her.  Jad Saxton is haughty, manic and insecure as the boisterous Sena, and her particular high pitched nasally voice projects her frantic whining perfectly.  Alexis Tipton goes balls-out insane with Rika’s perverted ranting, doing a very impressive job with material that a lot of actresses probably wouldn’t have been comfortable with.  Alison Viktorin does okay, but I’ve heard her do much better in other roles.Slice of Life and Harem are two of the most heavily maligned genres in anime history.  The former is known for being boring and by the numbers, while the latter is largely known for being misogynistic self-insert cheesecake.   They used to be, for the most part, two separate genres.    There were some blends, but they didn’t really become a common thing until the concept of the ‘misfit school club’ anime was invented and largely popularized by a certain god girl and her brigade.  With that innovation came the perfect excuse to gather a group of color-coded school girls and examine their daily lives in a small communal setting.  Oh, and occasionally, there would be one male character among them to become the object of their affections while taking the high road at every possible opportunity.It’s pathetic and transparent, but it made production of such titles a lot easier, as slice of life titles had some extra flavor that they rarely had before, and harem titles were no longer solely dependant on coming up with new plots to set themselves against.  Now, that’s not to say this formula can’t be done right...  As long as the product is well written, funny, and brings something new to the table, a slice of life harem series can easily become more than the sum of its parts...  Just look at Ouran High School Host Club and Oreshura as prime examples of this.So what does Haganai bring to the table?  Well, it brings a very interesting set-up, with it’s two downtrodden main characters with depressed, cynical attitudes towards school and other people, yet making the effort to rise above it and develop social lives anyway.  Their first club member is a bubbly popular girl who wants their help making genuine friends who aren’t just after her for their own benefit, and her upbeat attitude clashes instantly with Yozora’s more pessimistic outlook.  Now, this set-up is a very promising one, and offers a lot of potential for depth, complexity and character development as these three very different people bounce off of and challenge each other through their many differences.  It could have been a truly great dramedy.Unfortunately, this intriguing dynamic is thrown out with the burnable trash as the show is taken over by shallow new characters and ridiculous situations that seem to have been conceived for the sole purpose of putting the female characters in skimpy outfits and baiting them into different kinds of male-driven otaku porn, which they’ll watch, play, and adamantly defend.  We get the beach episode, we get the pool episode, we get a bunch of token harem characters, and by the time Kodaka’s 13 year old little sister bursts onto the screen naked as the day she was born for the first of this show’s many nude scenes, it should have been clear to everyone watching that any hint of depth there may have been in the beginning was nothing more than insincere ennui, which was intended...  With help from the darker, bleak aesthetic of the series...  To make the characters seem more intellectual and edgy than similar characters in other harem shows.And no, there is nothing smart or substantial about this series, even when you compare it to other titles in the school club/harem genre.  It’s yet another twelve episode commercial for body pillows.  But that’s what the genre is, right?  You can’t criticize a harem for being a harem any more than you can criticize porn for being porn, right?  Well, even putting aside the achievements of the few good titles out there, Haganai still has one problem that sets it apart from any other harem that I’ve seen...  Or better yet, and other anime that I can think of on the spot.  Haganai might be the only anime I’ve ever seen that pretends to have had effort put into it.  It actually pretends to try.Generally speaking, no harem show really has to put much effort into writing their characters.  They fit into pre-set categories, and you can pretty much write them with a checklist in the other hand.  Haganai takes this a step farther by stealing it’s characters wholesale from other anime, and then rewriting those characters just enough to make them legally original.  Here, let’s do a brief run-down of the cast of this show.The main character is a good natured boy who’s a great cook, but he gets mistaken for a punk due to his looks and an unfortunate misunderstanding.

Some people make them easily, while others struggle. Regardless of your ability, few people would turn down the opportunity to make a friend.Haganai is a show about a group of people who simply just want to make friends. So to go along with that, they make a fake club that's sole purple is finding friends. However... That plan largely fails.The characters somehow manage to be the last refuge and the biggest disaster of the show at the exact same time. It’s rare for that to be the case First and foremost is our main...character Kadoka. Everyone in the school has an illogical fear of him due to his harsh voice and two toned hair. Everyone other than the girls who join the club the start. Literally none of them even hesitate to talk to him, despite the fact that the entire school seems to hate him. Assuming he steals, beats up, or even rapes other students.The other main characters are Yozora, the obvious childhood friend that Kadoka has forgotten about, and Sena, the busty, beautiful, rich, arrogant, crybaby. These characters are the only ones that actually matter as the rest are so shallow it’s pointless to talk about them for any length of time.Take Rika for example. Known as the perverted scientist because… Well she is, and that’s all she is. She has no past to speak of, she has no emotions other than being in a state of extreme and constant arousal, the entire time she is on screen she is being perverted and that is all she does. Maria is no better, the loli character who of course takes to calling Kadoka her big brother while constantly insulting all the other girls in the club using her favorite insult, “poop”. The others all fall in with this pattern.Yozora and Sena on the other hand are actually fleshed out characters that have at least some depth to them. However, most of Yozora’s motivations and emotions aren’t really elaborated upon until the finale. These two are hard to talk about singularly because most of their screen time is spent arguing and competing with each other on anything under the sun.The only thing they seem to have in common besides good looks is their obvious crush on our main character. Sena is arrogant and rude on the outside, but is actually very sweet. That sounds like a typical tsundere but she doesn’t really have many tsundere qualities. Whenever she’s with Yozora and her ego is shattered she often runs away crying. She, of course, has no real friends so she doesn’t know how to make any. It’s hinted but never elaborated upon, that her ego and rudeness is a shield of some kind to protect herself as she is a crybaby.Yozora on the other hand… No matter how hard I try Yozora is a character that easily infuriates me. She’s never nice, she’s always insulting everyone, she manipulates Sena and Maria, the list goes on and on. While some of these instances were comical and could be laughed off the simple amount of times she did them, and their intensity was ridiculous. In the first or second episode she slams the door on Sena’s face then when they finally talk she insults her by saying something along the lines of, “[Sena] just a worthless piece of meat that will have to sell her body for money if she ever plans to support herself.”Some of the things she said simply felt like they were going too far to be funny. Especially since Yozora herself claims to not be a bully. The only thing that saves Yozora from me outright hating her is her few moments of being cute and the finale when her past and motivations are explored. These rare moments are genuinely adorable, probably made even more so by her complete bitchiness outside of these few moments. If Yozora wasn’t so harsh and maybe calmed down a little, she would have been much better off. Hell, she probably would have even won out over Sena as my best girl, but that is not the case.Despite my comments I actually did enjoy this show quite a bit. The comedy that wasn’t focused on Yozora being a bitch was genuinely funny. These moments shined in the first few episodes when Kadoka, Sena, and Yozora were playing video games and dating sims in an attempt to become more sociable. When the other characters were introduced that chemistry was ruined and disappeared (although Sena was always playing a game any time she was in the clubroom, it was just never the focus of the show anymore). The other characters, while being completely one-dimensional, were funny. Again though, that’s all they were. Shallow comic relief. While they accomplished their job, I feel they could have been even funnier if the characters had been fleshed out more.Overall Haganai is an average show.

The storyis amazing, and the comedy is great. I loved it so much I went and read the light novelwhich gets even more interesting as to where the story left of in the anime. I saw thepreviews for the second season and it will probably tell most of storyi hope you guys give your time in watching it ', 'you know what. despite the fact i see that everyone hates this show. i really enjoy it. i mean yes sure the characters are pretty much everyone is a anime cliche trope. but that doesnt automaticly make the suck. i mean Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu characters also were cliches and everyone loved them. i know anime cliches are the worst but if its done right they can be enjotable. the show also got some fanservice (if you might call it that) i personnaly think its very VERY pointless and the show wouldve been soo much better without it.so yeah i do like the plot....the unsocial freaks who try to find friend. even though i can see the writters did this ONLY to relate to friendless internet pepole to get more views wich is a very pathetic attempt to get the show populare. that would also explain the dumb unessecary fanservice. anyway the point is. i do like the story and the main characters too. every character recived enough time to be introduced and be mixed with the others , the start was everything but rushed. there is of course the typical love triangle between the main guy, the childhood tsundere and the big breasted blond, good at everything . but i dont mind those cliches about those 3 too much. because the love triangle thing isnt shoved in our face like how other animes do . its nice hidden for the first episodes they look just like normal frie-i mean club memevers. there is the science geek. the trap guy, the kawai loli and goth loli. i dont mind the geek chick. she is pretty funny with all her nerd language wich is very much like internet language so its nice references for internet losers like me. the little nun girl can be annoying sometimes. but usually she is not that annoying. and i actually like the main guys little sister. i really like the bond between them wich is very cute ^^also id like to point out one thing that i really love about this show. the main character guy IS NOT AN PUNCHING BAG. yeah you heared me. in harem animes the main guy is allways the punching bag victim wich gets punched or owned like 10 times per episode for either reasons he dont deserve it or dumb misunderstandings. if this is what you think slapstick is? then just go and jump from a cliff please.. the main guy usually is allwyas nice and he never recieved undeserved pain. so yeah in overall i do like the story and love the characters even though they are most of them one dimensional walking cliches. but as i said just because they are one trope-based doesnt automaticly mean its bad sometimes we do need simple shows that are not overfilled with character development. i mean if cartoons are allowed to have silly one dimensional characters with no develpment and we still like them. why arent animes allowed to do this?. i also like the refernces to actual stuff like play station 3. monster hunter etc. it makes laugh ^^so yeah thats about the characters & story.the art is not bad. i do hate the pink lips on girls though its f**king annoying. i mean even the little 10 year girls have pink lips? what the hell. thats groess.but yeah thats the only thing i dont like about the art style. the rest is nice. smooth animation and nice shading.the sound is good if you ask me.i myself enjoy this show aloot .call me a person with lack of good taste if you want. but i really enjoy watching this and get some good few laughs here and there.in overall i really like this. and cant wait to watch the second season the unsocial freaks who try to find friend. even though i can see the writters did this ONLY to relate to friendless internet pepole to get more views wich is a very pathetic attempt to get the show populare. that would also explain the dumb unessecary fanservice. anyway the point is. i do like the story and the main characters too. every character recived enough time to be introduced and be mixed with the others , the start was everything but rushed. there is of course the typical love triangle between the main guy, the childhood tsundere and the big breasted blond, good at everything . but i dont mind those cliches about those 3 too much. because the love triangle thing isnt shoved in our face like how other animes do . its nice hidden for the first episodes they look just like normal frie-i mean club memevers. there is the science geek. the trap guy, the kawai loli and goth loli. i dont mind the geek chick. she is pretty funny with all her nerd language wich is very much like internet language so its nice references for internet losers like me. the little nun girl can be annoying sometimes. but usually she is not that annoying. and i actually like the main guys little sister. i really like the bond between them wich is very cute ^^also id like to point out one thing that i really love about this show. the main character guy IS NOT AN PUNCHING BAG. yeah you heared me. in harem animes the main guy is allways the punching bag victim wich gets punched or owned like 10 times per episode for either reasons he dont deserve it or dumb misunderstandings. if this is what you think slapstick is?

Well I for one get that sometime, but if your school have a club for specifically making friends, would you join?Yes it is a harem romantic comedy. However this has a better balance of romance and comedy than most romantic comedy. This anime is a lot like Baka to test to Shoukanjuu. A group of friends hanging out doing stupid activities together and one person usually acts as the “fool.” Plus it’s also like lucky star, where the anime shows the random events/ activities and...daily lives of the group.The first episode is a little misleading (episode 00). I would recommend you watch it after you have watched the entire series. The anime may not have a hook because there is no complex plot. It’s just a group of people who has some trouble making friends all come together, thinking of a way to make friends… Ironic isn’t?    They all don’t seem to have a grasp of friends making even though they hung out, shared a laugh or two and done activities together. These interactions are commonly shared among friends but of course they wouldn’t have known because they never actually made a friend before... This anime takes on a little of the social problem where people can’t seem to make any friends due to their “misfit” into society.Art is reasonably suitable, the characters looks pretty clean and cutesy because of the random joke here and there.  The opening and ending is quite suitable because it send out a cheery fun atmosphere which is a nice way to open up. Of course you can’t miss the characters, which are obviously the ones you have seen before. First we have the take charge tsundere female lead, then the arrogant, prideful princess, two prodigies who have spend most of their time studying then having a childhood, and a girl who wants to be manlier but doesn’t have the tomboy personality.This anime may seem to be soothing and somewhat normal, but it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. This anime focused on the activities that you do with friends and not how to make more friends.  It seems like a group of weird people who has some kind of problem making friends but have no problem of being friends with the club members.Honestly overall I enjoyed the anime. It’s a causal school life comedy with a harem feature. Haganai has some good time, but it isn’t a interesting or romantic anime to watch so don’t expect too much out of it. If you’re looking for something like Baka to Test or Lucky Star then give it a shot.One piece of dialogue I like the most is:Girl: Can you accompany me to the bathroom?Boy: bathroom?Girl: I’m afraid of the…ghost!Boy: (sigh)Girl: are you still there?Boy:  YesGirl: ……are you still thereBoy: yes…..zzzzzzzGirl :………are you still there………Hello? (scream and falls off the toilet) OMG OMGBoy:….Huh? OOh! I’m here… Calm down and make your poop!LoL.. one of the most funniest dialogue ever. .. Yes this comedy is pretty amusing if you ask me.~Later daily lives of the group.The first episode is a little misleading (episode 00).

I do find the character designs appealing and befitting for Boku Tomo though the details of the lips isn’t my cup of tea. Though the great thing about incorporating Denpa’s art into Boku Tomo was its ability to suit each characters personality and enhance their original designs from the light novel. Sena’s character design mixed in with...her seiyuu and personality is a befitting example of a character portrayed well. Even just looking at her most of us would suggest straight away that she’s got a spoiled personality and maybe even tsundere. Of course this is just one example of all the characters in Boku Tomo and I couldn’t have wished for a better artist. Also to mention those backgrounds are superb and everything in that festival on the 11th episode was none other than beautiful to say the leasMusicEverything clicked into place and everything worked as it should’ve in executing the various emotions Boku Tomo wishes you to feel and this played a major role in most of the episodes (especially episode 11) in either portraying each individual comedy skit they pull off or a serious event. It was magnificent and each of the BGM’s and SFX’s used in whatever scene they were put in did its job well. There was never once I thought that this certain sound or this certain atmosphere the music is creating does not work with what’s really in front of us. No, everything was in the correct places at the correct time though why 8 out of 10 if it’s so ‘stunning’ you might ask. Even if something is befitting, it doesn’t mean its impact could not have been better. Besides episode 11 which was overall amazing!StoryIt’s true this was a series that mainly incorporated comedy and the comedy in it was continuously being thrown at us yet while this is all happening, Boku wa Tomodachi was still able to incorporate a story behind the making of the club and the development of characters. Even though at times you might not notice it, the story was building up constantly; either with a minor progress or a major progress, it was still advancing to the point that it offered us a breathtaking episode 11 and a befitting ending to the show in episode 12. Whatever it is, it kept pulling us towards the show and hooked us into it. I was only one of the few who were anticipating this show as a great series this season and with a high expectation too and now I’m amazed. It was able to surpass my expectations, making it my personal favourite of the season.CharactersTruly a bunch of lovable characters for all and even if you don’t like some, you’ll like most of the characters in Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai due to the brilliance of how each character responds to certain situations, reacts to certain situations, their personality and how they themselves contribute to the humour being executed. Each character is supported by other characters in every situation and just seeing different characters or the usual suspects (Yozora and Sena interaction) doing the things they do is entertaining to see. You’ll never get bored of what the cast of characters in Boku wa Tomodachi have to offer. As much as each character retains their own personality and behaviour, their interactions hold limitless possibilities in this show. This would have to be my favourite cast of characters for the year.OverallAll in all Boku Tomo is truly a show that was knocked off too early for most and didn’t offer a great enough ‘interest’ level with our first impressions of its synopsis and trailer at the start of the season but I’m glad it proved to be one of the best series in the season and I do dare say it’s one of the best series in the year! All those characters put together created a fun-filled club that offered us a variety of enjoyment interpreted differently between individuals but what makes this show such a great series is comedy it incorporated within the show. I haven’t laughed so much in a long time and usually there’d be hit and miss for such a series constantly throwing out comedy skits at us but no, nearly all or every comedy skit it threw at us offered a great laugh to the wide audience; appealing to a wide range of viewers with its vast variety of characters and comedy it uses.Not only that, you begin to fall in love with this series once you find that special character who you can’t help but love in the series accompanied by his/her reactions in each situation Boku Tomo offers us. They took cliché to a new level, they made a harem enjoyable even to those who don’t like harems and added a male protagonist who would stereotypically be disappointing but astonished us with how likable and BAMF this guy can get with his sense of realism and the manners of a proper gentleman. It’s hard to put all this in words because this series was such a lovable series and I’ll really miss everyone and everything this series had to offer us.Should you watch it?Definitely yes! There’s no way I wouldn’t recommend this show because it is truly brilliant in executing its story and comedy it has to offer. A job well done with the adaption from the light novel and I couldn’t have asked for more from this series. You will definitely fall in love with the characters and if not, Boku Tomo will hook you in with its comedy. Sure it might start off slow at the beginning but the more you watch into it, the more you’ll love it. There’s no other way of putting this, you who have not watched this series or you who have dropped this series, watch it. You’ll be missing out on one of the best 2011 has to offer in the anime industry. her seiyuu and personality is a befitting example of a character portrayed well.

The bare bones of it is an ecchi harem but it kinda took the piss out of itself and I appreciate that even with regards to characters.

I may write some additional note if something was particularly good or not (like art or the characters voice).I am going to try to be impartial, even if i like the anime a lot or i dislike it like the kechtup on the pasta and put things in the right context (i can\'t expect a complex plot for an harem)REVIEWPlot - 7Nice plot. Not something great but totally enjoyable. We are talking about a comedy with a bit of seinen so i am totally fine...with it.

It\'s nothing so original but as i already stated it\'s worthy if you are looking for a good comedy.Characters - 7They are well designed but not everyone got a real ""soul"", some of them are the usual clichès but luckily the main characters are good and i was really ok with them.Other detailsThe jokes are funny, late some of them become boring but it\'s not a big deal and art is amazing for my tastes.Overall - 7Plot? Check. Characters? Check. Ok good characters in a good plot make this anime a good work, almost for me.

CONTAINS SPOILERS*At first I wasnt really drawn into the anime. The only reason i continued to watch it was because I was hoping for a main character who was a badass. First off the main character has no friends because hes labeled as a delinquent and because of that a girl who has no friends starts a club to make friends and drags him along... she know the entire anime that they used to be childhood friends and doesnt say anything while he doesnt know its her while shes in love with...him. He makes every girl fall in love with him because its a harem (Thats obvious that would happen) but then whines up choosing no one? The blonde girl straight up confessed to him in front of everyone in the club and then he just runs out and ignores it all... His decision making is stupid imo. Ideally he should of said give me time to think about it and then thought of a way that he could either let her down genitally or gone out with her... i hate the fact that he acts like a coward through out a lot of this anime when it comes down the the important parts... he stood up for the blonde girl and protected her at first which got me really interested in him and made me think he could amount to something, but in the end i was disappointed. I\'m not going to go out and say this anime is trash, you shouldn\'t watch it, or its a waste of time because for a lot of people it was a good anime and I only notice a small amount of people who dislike it. but i will let everyone know that out of the 150+ anime I""ve watched this is the only anime I\'ve had that went under a 6 overall and im rating it a 2 on top of that. I honestly was uninterested since episode 5 since the majority was ""comedy"" which didnt really make me laugh and a story that didnt seem like it was moving very much. I do however commend the anime for the fact that There was MILD nudity (I saw very little nudity in this one) and it wasnt 100% there to make you get off it felt mostly like it was pushed towards the story more which I liked because I don\'t watch anime with nudity because i want to see naked anime girls usually i watch them because i was interested in the story.

For me the main character of Kaichou wa Maid-sama! is the best example of this. He is by far my favorite character of any anime although the anime itself isnt my #1...

It has become one of these shows I think if only my school life had gone like this. Clubs, as they do in Japan, would be great elsewhere.The story being simply of some outcasts trying to find friends. All struggle to their own quirks coming together to form a club. It is a really nice thing. In real life, it would be pretty nerve-racking to walk in the club the first time though!The art of the show does it...a great service. It is consistent and really well done.Sound is really enjoyable. I love the opening that links to art with the drawing of Yozora running.Characters are very good. I love the wide array of characters in the club and the different issues they all have and how they all play off each other. They all have pretty damaged lifestyles but coming together helps fix it all bit by bit. I really liked that in the show.I also must make it clear that Rika is the best girl. She is relatable, cute, funny and has a great personality even if she is a weirdo she is great. It is better to be known as weird than normal I think.I would recommend this show to anyone that loves a good slice of life. If it continues on like this I would be very happy but I would love to see things get more complex with how they are trying to make friends with very hard personalities. a great service.

This show is an ecchi done right, I normally don't tend to give ecchis more than 7 when I loved them but... this one is with Sora no Otoshimono imo.The Story, like most of this kind of this anime, is not it's strong point but, even being simple like Yozora and Kodaka making a club to make friends because they are awkward people who has troubles making relationships with other human beings... is not that bad. You are going to have really good momments with this anime, and you are going to laugh...a lot or maybe sometimes, that depends on you.

Especially when the reason is ""she\'s popular, but wants real friends"" that\'s a situation that a LOT of people find themselves in, pretty much everyone knows them, but...they don\'t really have any real friends.

So, I\'m not particularly a fan of that crushing situation being turned into a shitty joke.', 'Note: This will be a review of both seasons.Overview:""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"", generally translated as ""I Don\'t Have Many Friends"" and usually shortened to ""Haganai"", is, for a lack of a better word, interesting. What seems like just your typical ecchi/harem anime on the surface is actually a surprisingly deep series about the meaning of friendship, complimented by complex, well-written characters and a lot of genuinely funny comedic moments. It\'s by no means a masterpiece and I can see why it wouldn\'t be to everyone\'s taste, but I would certainly be lying if I said I regretted watching it.Story (7.5/10):The person we follow throughout...the series\' 24 episodes is Kodaka Hasegawa, a teenager who has recently transferred schools but has yet to make a single friend at his new school. This is due to a combination of his looks (his thuggish face and foreign hair) and the TERRIBLE first impression he made on his first day, something he has yet to get past. One day, he finds a girl named Yozora Mikazuki talking to an imaginary friend and quickly  discovers she\'s in the same boat as him. After a long discussion about their mutual loneliness, Kodaka accidentally gives Yozora the idea to form a club dedicated to making friends, which she dubs the Neighbours\' Club, and gets pulled into it against his will.Okay, a lot of you may think it all sounds a bit ""Haruhi Suzumiya"" and trust me, I noticed the resemblance long before any of you did. Thankfully, the series quickly goes beyond this and into its own thing, discussing what really makes a friend and whether or not a friendship can actually be considered such. If you find it difficult to make friends like I do, I think you will definitely be able to identify with at least a few things the characters say. One of my favourite parts is when a certain character states that what really matters is how much the few friends you have matter to you rather than how many you have, and that having one real friend is better than a ton who are just okay.If there\'s a reason for the story\'s not-so-glowing score, it\'s that not an awful lot happens in it- not enough to justify it\'s length at least. One plot point in the first season relating to Kodaka\'s past is shown as early as the third episode and is sidelined for the rest of the season before finally getting picked up again in the last episode, so we spend most of the series having the cast drive each off the deep end. The second season is better-paced and contains a lot of great moments, culminating in a brilliant final episode, but unfortunately the series ultimately ends on a bastard of a cliffhanger that will most likely never get resolved. In other words, anyone going in expecting a neatly wrapped up story will be in for a whopper of a disappointment.Art & Animation (8/10):""Haganai"" doesn\'t look outstanding, but it still looks pretty damn good. The character models are well-designed and very detailed and the animations are very smooth. If there is a problem, it\'s that when you look close, you can see that quite a few characters have the same face, and there ultimately isn\'t a lot of variety. There is also quite a lot of gratuitous fanservice, and by ""gratuitous"" I mean it just seems thrown in to titillate the viewer and doesn\'t really serve any purpose.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):The soundtrack is overall very pleasing to the ears. There aren\'t many tracks you\'ll want to look up but it\'s still nice and fits the show very well. The two openings definitely deserve a mention. The voice acting is great as well. Jerry Jewell does a fine job as our main character, which is saying a lot since Kodaka is a far cry from the characters he usually voices (who are generally very smug and arrogant). My favourite performance, however, would have to be Whitney Rodgers as Yozora. I had never heard her before I watched this series, but she still managed to do a fantastic job and her voice fits Yozora\'s personality perfectly.Characters (8/10):As usual, I\'ll start with the main character. Kodaka is thankfully far from your generic harem lead, and does a great job at dodging most of the stereotypes. He\'s a good student, makes no stupid mistakes (or at least no more than the average person), stands up for himself, frequently calls out the girls for going too far and overall acts very much like someone you would expect to act like in his situation, with quite a few hilarious sarcastic lines. And while it may seem odd that he doesn\'t just dye his hair to help his reputation at school, he actually has a good reason; he had an English mother who died prior to the story, and his hair is the only resemblance he has to her, so he believes that dyeing his hair would be like turning his back on where he came from. Overall, Kodaka is one of those rare, well-rounded harem leads who is just as interesting and fleshed-out as any of the girls who surround him.Well, that\'s true for the most part, as long as the girl you\'re referring to isn\'t Yozora. Almost every member of the Neighbour\'s Club is more than they seem at first glance, but Yozora takes that to a whole new level. She\'s not only the most complicated character in the series, she\'s one of the most complicated characters in any anime I\'ve seen. She comes off as little more than a bullying bitch on the surface, but the people she bullies most do tend to be the most deserving and, whether it was intentional or not, her abuse ends up having a positive effect on their personalities, to the point that some argue she\'s actually a GOOD influence on them. She is not without her kind side either, which is especially shown by her love of children and cats. There\'s also her reason for acting the way she does, which is a combination of loneliness, depression and a serious lack of social skills. I don\'t want to go into too much detail, but basically it could be argued that everything she does is just a facade to hide her insecurities.The third member of the cast is Sena Kashiwasaki, a rich, popular girl who joins the club at the end of the first episode. It\'s obvious from her first few minutes of screentime that she has a huge ego, bragging about how great she is at everything, which immediately puts her at odds with Yozora and makes her the most frequent target of her abuse. I didn\'t like her as much as the other two but given that a running gag is her running out of the club room crying, it\'s hard not to feel sorry for her at times, and like Yozora she\'s a lot more likeable than she initially seems, though her reason for acting like she does is weaker than Yozora\'s. Other noteworthy characters include Kodaka\'s sister Kobato, who has the delusion of being the vampire from an anime she watches, but puts that to give herself confidence as she\'s very shy otherwise, and Rika, a scientific genius who somehow finds something perverted in EVERYTHING, making her extremely funny to listen to.Unfortunately, the rest of the cast aren\'t quite up to standard. One example is Maria, a ten-year-old nun who I found to be pretty annoying for the most part, at least until she got some character development. Simply put, she\'s a bratty know-it-all who falls for the dumbest tricks in the book and is clearly not as smart as she thinks she is. Personally, I found her sister Kate to be a superior character, though that\'s let down by her notably small screentime. Despite this, I can\'t think of any character that I absolutely hated, or at least not any that got significant screentime.Enjoyment (8/10):""Haganai"" is a very entertaining watch from start to finish. There is plenty of hilarious comedy to keep you invested and each episode will make you laugh at least once. Some of the jokes can get a bit repetitive, however, and if the unpleasant personalities of the two female leads prove too much for you (regardless of what they\'re actually like) then you\'re probably better off staying away.Overall:""Haganai"" is one of the overlooked greats of this decade. The problem is that it\'s difficult to recommend, since on the surface it seems like little more than your generic harem series with dull or unlikeable characters. All I can really say is if you enjoy slice-of-life comedies, give it a go. Who knows, maybe you\'ll find the series to be a lot better than you initially thought it would be.

Kobato is the sister to Kodaka and well she really likes really bother and also has a persona that she does otherwise pretty odd but good character. Yukimura is another supporting character and well is the trap of the anime the guy dresses in girls stuff so there you go otherwise again another sweet person overall.

Things that i didn't like: personally i enjoyed this a lot i cant honestly find a reason to not dislike it but i think if your gonna watch this be ready for a good number of boob and also poop jokes as well (i didn't dislike it because of this its more of that if you guys wanna watch it be aware of this but this didn't bother me like at all)Overall: honestly i know this in sense breaks a rule with MAL but man id give this a 8.5 it was easily that good i would have giving it a 9 but something i wanted to see didn't happen at the end but otherwise this anime is really damn funny and the jokes with it are really funny also that the characters are damn good aswell this anime is easily worth the watch for sure. aswell also a bunch of other people join as well.Art: art is really good for the anime nothing else really to say detail is really goodSound: Op is pretty good not the best but decent at best the Ed is meh really wouldn't listen to it i watched the dub and everyone in it did a good job with itCharacter: Kodaka is the main male lead of the anime and well hes a pretty good and chill male lead just trying to make friends again a pretty cool and just overall chill guy. Yozora is one of the female leads and she is well she acts really tough but she also is a pretty good person again though she really can get at a lot of the member's but a good character. Sena is the other female lead and well she really thinks all high and mighty of herself but she kinda is a airhead sometimes but she is a pretty sweet person. Kobato is the sister to Kodaka and well she really likes really bother and also has a persona that she does otherwise pretty odd but good character. Yukimura is another supporting character and well is the trap of the anime the guy dresses in girls stuff so there you go otherwise again another sweet person overall. Rika is scientist and well she is a really perverted person and really out there with the perv stuff like that but she can be really cool and stuff but a perv at best.

It definitely has the ecchi genre but it doesn\'t dwell on it too much. It\'s been a while since I\'ve been presented with something that\'s harem and ecchi on one package and is actually something that\'s pretty edible.Going through its plot, it\'s very standard and typical. Highschool students making a club then the club progressively growing on the number of members everybody having a unique type of personality and so on. Yet the pacing of the show is well thought out, From the first 3 episodes we are pretty much consuming appetizers. The show creates a relationship for...the main characters first before moving onto the side supporting ones. Throughout the show we are introduced with the supporting characters one by one. And throughout the last is just refining and enhancing the relationship these characters have.There\'s not much to filler. Although I may say that there are a lot of swimsuit episodes in this anime, a fair amount of them having fan service moments. Though every episode has its own purpose and there\'s really not much time they have wasted throughout the series.Things that I may have not liked are; The lime green school uniforms. I\'ve never liked anything that\'s green in any school uniform you see, I\'ve even considered not enrolling on a local school once just because of its green uniform. Why? Because it just looks weird and mossy. Next is the number of swimsuit episodes. They did compensate doing a great job in enhancing the characters still they can do it in other ways like camping near a lake or in the forest hills or even something like shopping but well I\'ll let some slide.I\'m not supposed to talk much about this on a review so I\'mma be as less elaborate as possible. The ending is great, it hypes up the next season, That\'s it.So do I recommend this?Hmm I\'m not really sure. It\'s something that doesn\'t come to mind when someone asks me ""hey what highschool anime do you recommend?"" but it\'s something that you won\'t hate.

Yozora is a total bitch but she plays that role perfectly so no problems there either.. Sena is kinda air-headed but she\'s cool too. But lets come towards his little sister.. okay i get she\'s a weeb and likes to cosplay.. but come on... every time you show her is it really necessary that she has to be in that role? she has no character imo. Also the nun is pretty good but her poop ""jokes"" aren\'t funny. Also there is a weird  dude or a lady idk what the hell it is i cant remember. the perverted scientist rika uses too much overused jokes and in the end she is a nuisance instead of being funny.Enjoyment(5/10): the comedy is terribly placed and therefore it is kinda hard to really enjoy this anime.well I wouldn\'t say it was a complete waste of time.. but it was a waste of time this anime... the characters are so bad and there is no development whatsoever except for like yozora and sena. you have a pretty decent MC no problem there...

But I will occasionally watch them because the friendship development that occurs at the beginning and throughout is akin to typical Slice of Life shows and these non-Harem elements can still be enjoyable.What with Harem shows appealing to the most basic of (particularly teenage) male desires they have a tendency to be lazy in almost all areas but the ecchi so unless you\'re scratching a particular itch, you wont be getting a whole lot...out of the average Harem. Which brings me to my next point, this isn\'t a typical Harem.Whilst the show does conform its characters into certain tropes; a tsundere, a childhood friend, a lolicon, a little sister, a female BL nut, the male protagonist ripped right from Toradora. The characters are so much more than that as demonstrated by their constant efforts to exceed their own parameters. They still feel like real people doing average and typical things despite their eccentricities (at least most of the time).The show isn\'t necessarily anything original and you could probably predict most of the major plot twists within the first quarter of the show (some of which is clearly intentional (good old Shakespearean ""dramatic irony"") and some of it less so). What the show does right is the focus on the characters and their interactions, unlike other ""lesser"" shows which concentrate on just throwing their characters into slap stick sketches for cheap laughs. Things actually progress and develop. Which made the story more enjoyable than it otherwise could have been.The art is actually pretty good (another thing that is always hit and miss with Harem shows). There\'s not a whole lot too it, it\'s just high in detail and well refined. Especially the background art. There are some really out of left field nudity scenes which seem really out of place and unnecessary and left me wondering why they were there at all, but for the sake of having some nudity somewhere. But they are few and far between.The only thing that really irked me throughout the show is the extent to which the female lead (Yozora) and the support tsundere (Sena) were combative. Part of their relationship was an intended hostility and competitiveness, but sometimes it came across, particularly from the female lead as downright nasty and little short of out right bullying. But the odd thing was the show seems to acknowledge this when they have other characters who witness it cringe and/or tut in awkwardness at it. This odd character dynamic doesn\'t devolve into a cheap repetitive joke like one might expect it to nor does it evolve into an actual character development between either the two or with the protagonist Taka who seems like he\'s going to intervene (on account of being the most overt in their frowning upon of this behaviour) and potentially disenfranchise who ever\'s side he doesn\'t take (suggested even more by the fact they are the main potential love rivals and this is a common love story twist), yet never does anything.It seems like the author has intentionally created a powder keg here, first highlighted when Taka comforts Sena at the beach hut after she was embarrased more than usual after just such an event. But this never comes to fruition. Perhaps this is something that will be elaborated in the second season. After all, the actual Harem element, much like how i remember the show Oreimo being, doesn\'t seem to have come into full swing; we are tantalisingly left with a suggestive cliff hanger when one of the characters drops the word ""love"" and ""Taka\'s happy ending"". So despite dedicating two paragraphs to that minor complaint, it could still be resolved.TL;DR the show goes above and beyond expectations with quality art and writing, notably in its witty humour, contemporary satire and refreshing and largely realistic characters (which makes for easy relating) and just overall being a pleasure to watch despite featuring a bottom of the barrel gimmick (Harem).

It has hints of romance and harem. This is a well written high school drama that has a nice balance of comic relief and the feels. Also, the character development in this is exceptionally good. All the characters have well rounded and distinctive personalities and the way they interact with each other is the main draw for the show. The second season is just as good as this one. I usually watch the fantasy, sci-fi, action, and adventure genres, but this is one was written well enough to hold my attention despite being outside...my normal tastes. my normal tastes.', ""Warning possible SpoilersNow we all want friends don't we, well how about an anime that shows a group of characters trying to do that exact thing while providing some quality entertainment.The story begins with Kodaka Hasegawa a transfer student who is trying to put on a good impression and find some friends, but that is already blown when people already mistake him for a delinquent, however luck may change when he discovers Yozora Mikazuki talking alone to her imaginary friend.Now to start this off this show is probably one of the funniest anime's I have seen, definitely the funniest and most dysfunctional harem I've...seen so far.It was an entertaining 12 episodes of seeing a group of people who created a club for making friends, but the people that join are just really odd and funny people who all have a troublesome relationship with each other, there's a lot of pranking and annoying each other which just makes for fantastic comedy that it never gets tired, however the activities the club does actually some good life advice like protecting your friends from tougher looking people, going to places is more fun with a group instead of on your own and the same could be said when playing video games. The instances that the club go through which are the usual Slice of Life moments compared to other anime's that have this were very enjoyable mainly because no matter what the group does they always end up arguing which usually annoy's me, but for this show it works really well and made for some quality entertainment.You also got to see how these characters interacted with each other and how their messed up friendship grew it certainly wasn't pretty I'll tell you that.The characters in this anime are people that certainly act like they would have difficulty making friends which makes them even more likeable considering how bad they are at social interaction.Kodaka is the only male MC in this show and his character is sort of bland, but in a funny way, usually being the one who is caught inbetween the arguments he's more of a victim really however he can be pretty useful since he can cook and because of his delinquent look it makes other guys who would be willing to make a move on the girls avoid them because of Kodaka.Yozora is the one who started the club along with Kodaka and unlike most of the girls she has a very short-temper and pretty much has a lot of arguments with Sena which involves tricking her or even abusing her like rubbing sun cream on her back with her feet, but she does have a past with Kodaka which eventually comes into light by the end of the series.Sena is the other female MC and is the first member to join the club, she is a rich, good looking and smart girl which she uses these qualities to make her seem superior to everyone else which Yozora despise's, however once you get to know Sena she's actually quite gentle and a bit pervy too since she has a fascination with games that have a lot of steamy erotic scenes and Kodaka's sister.Kobato is Kodaka's sister and is a Chunnibyou as she has a major interest in an anime series she watches that involves a magical vampire girl and her fandom is so high that she even dresses and acts like the character, but because of this Sena absolutely adores her to the point where Kobato doesn't want to be near her.Rika is pretty much the most sexual hungry of the group saying as many sexual innuendos as she can along with her love for Mecha hentai's I know weird huh, but she is surprisingly smart and even creates a lot of devices for the club to test out like a new VR game or even a dream machine.Yukimura is a girl who wants to be a boy so she wears a maid outfit so she can overcome the feeling of being female and become a true man and because of the confusion of her gender she always end's up in awkward situations with Kodaka like getting undressed in the men's locker room at the swimming pool.Maria is the youngest member of the club along with Kobato and she is the nun of the local church at the school, but she is rude, immature and willing to believe what anyone says and because of this it creates some disputes like her constant rivalry with Kobato for domination over Kodaka and running around the school grounds nude after believing a joke from one of the club members.The artstyle reminded me of the anime's where the characters have freakishly large eyes and small faces although the characters were well designed and had a nice mixture of body size and height, also some of the outfits that some of the characters wore were actually pretty good too.The fanservice in this anime isn't as too exposing compare to others, but it still throws in some juicy moments mainly with Sena who going by her figure is the fanservice girl and there are multiple moments where you see her exposed not that I'm complaining, but she isn't the only one Maria and even Kobato are given a chance and those moments just felt awkward and uncomfortable since they are both 10 years old so it didn't feel right.The comedy was just absolutely spot on since seeing the club members argue and prank each other mixed very well and the personality of the characters helped with this too because since each character is very different they all have different opinions on certain subjects which leads to some really hilarious moments, there is even some Romance thrown into the mix too, but the way it is done was really sweet sometimes because Kodaka doesn't really hate any of the girls and gets along very well with them so whenever there is a nice moment between Kodaka or any any of the girls mainly between Sena and Yozora it felt quite heart warming to see.Overall this was a very funny and entertaining show definitely one of my more likeable harem anime's that relies mainly on comedy and the interaction of the characters to keep the show going so if you're a harem fan then you'll definitely enjoy this one. seen so far.It was an entertaining 12 episodes of seeing a group of

The characters are lovely and lively, and I feel that while they did slip towards stereotypes, they never fully embraced them, allowing the characters to feel more relatable or interesting. I would probably have give it higher marks, but the entirety of the second season seemed to bog down the story by placing unnecessary blockades to character growth, and I\'ll explain that in better detail further down.Story: 7.It\'s hard for me to ever give a slice-of-life anime higher than a 7 because a SoL...anime is often character-driven, the plot or story falls to the wayside in a fair trade, as that is obviously the charm. The act of creating a club for social outcasts of various reasons was a fun idea, and executed mostly effectively except for the lingering fact the (opaque language so as to not spoil) they refused to acknowledge the club\'s achievement until the 25th episode. Do not get me wrong, I\'m ALL about a slow burn in an anime, but that was too much. Especially as word (as of this moment, January 2018) of a third season shrinks further and further into the depths, we\'re essentially given what ruins so many romance animes for me. When feelings are finally put onto the table (romantic or otherwise!), I want to see the direction the show takes so that I can feel the closure for the characters I have come to love. This easy ending technique does not wrap up the story in an acceptable manner for me, so to that, I knock a point. There was also a brief period of transition between the two season that focused heavily on the main character\'s sister and another young character her age, and that was annoying. I won\'t make personal attacks, but I do not enjoy loli characters as a general rule of thumb, and having 2 filler episodes dedicated to only slightly tying in their characters was an annoying waste of an hour for me (I ended up skipping a few minutes here and there throughout, not something I am accustomed to doing).Art: 8.The art style is attractive. I cannot recall any moments of particular beauty, nor was the color choices or character design particularly breathtaking. I did note that many of the characters have a stylistically-upturned nose that I am not sure I\'ve seen elsewhere, and that was interesting.Sound: 7.The sound department did its job. It was not heavily music-influenced, and the voice acting was all fine. I will note that the younger sister Kobato\'s vocal performance was hilarious, and the trademark laugh of hers was infectious and funny. The voice actor for Maria on the other-hand really struggled too hard to pull off a truly youthful sounding voice, and to that, I was not impressed.Character: 8.Obviously for a slice of life/school life comedy, the characters are what matter the most, so I will focus more on this section than the others. The characters were entertaining enough to keep me invested, but their perceived flaws were less bothersome than their written flaws. Allow me to elaborate without spoiling. Many of the character are very obviously described quickly, one might be a genius but a pervert. One is a tsundere, one is too detached from reality, etc. I could handle this fairly well, but the weakness we were supposed to observe from these characters did not bother me any as they were often charming in a sort of way. The flaws that were written unintentionally were the ones that kept me from fully loving them. (It is so hard to delve into character and remain spoiler free, woe is me T^T) For a show that seemed to market itself as a romantic comedy, all I will say is that the ""romance,"" was completely mismanaged. Tensions were often left unaddressed, situations meant to grow relations fizzled out mildly, and until the final episode, any addressing of emotional depth was stunted or ignored entirely. There were hints of moments, such as why Kodaka had such a strange hair color, for example, but these moments quietly played their part and immediately swung back into the fold. Honestly, slight spoiler here folks, Kodaka\'s ""Ehh? What did you say?"" mechanic was heavy-handed and overly-wrought that it had, in my opinion, all the finesse of sewing a shirt with a hammer. Although the final episode addressed this, 24 episodes of wondering why they kept reusing the exact same response to every new situation was tiresome and bothersome and made me mostly hate Kodaka more often than not. Bonus points though, this is, I think, the first anime in my generally 300 history where I saw a character fart, and that\'s... an accomplishments of sorts?Enjoyment: 8.As I said, the various plot and character sins kept my suspension of disbelief from fully immersing, but for what it\'s worth, this is a DAMN funny anime, and when they aren\'t pissing me off, the characters will surprise you. It\'s fun, and accomplishes this often by evoking parodies of the school comedy genre that work because the plot itself allows them to stand outside the realm of what is ""typical,"" in the genre, even whilst they follow, tongue-in-cheek, the exact same formula they all use. The story then is arguably a deconstruction of the school comedy, and this makes it all the funnier. As I am a sucker for a good romance, I believe this series squandered many opportunities, and did not offer a well-scripted scene of emotional realness until the very last episode, so despite how much I enjoyed it, it still kept me from giving it a full 9 or 10.Overall: 7.This is a good anime. It likely won\'t become your favorite, and it might not entirely mesh well if you\'re on a slice of life or school comedy kick, as this one steps a little out of the box when it comes to traditional tropes of the genre. If you start it, keep this in mind and unlike myself, try to watch it not as a romantic comedy or a school comedy, but rather, an amusing parody of both, that fails one and achieves the latter. Definitely worth the time if you want a casual laugh with fun characters. anime is often character-driven, the plot or story falls to the wayside in a fair trade, as that is obviously the charm. The act of creating a club for social outcasts of various reasons was a fun idea, and executed mostly effectively except for the lingering fact the (opaque language so as to not spoil) they refused to acknowledge the club\'s achievement until the 25th episode. Do not get me wrong, I\'m ALL about a slow burn in an anime, but that was too much. Especially as word (as of this moment, January 2018) of a third season shrinks further and further into the depths, we\'re essentially given what ruins so many romance animes for me. When feelings are finally put onto the table (romantic or otherwise!), I want to see the direction the show takes so that I can feel the closure for the characters I have come to love. This easy ending technique does not wrap up the story in an acceptable manner for me, so to that, I knock a point. There was also a brief period of transition between the two season that focused heavily on the main character\'s sister and another young character her age, and that was annoying. I won\'t make personal attacks, but I do not enjoy loli characters as a general rule of thumb, and having 2 filler episodes dedicated to only slightly tying in their characters was an annoying waste of an hour for me (I ended up skipping a few minutes here and there throughout, not something I am accustomed to doing).Art: 8.The art style is attractive.

I always like to speak frankly, and so I will give it to you straight. If you immedietly break into hives from mild-moderate fanservice, you should not watch this show. If you are a humorless robot who is looking for a serious endeavor, this show surely still has something to offer, but you will probably be too turned off by the comedy/harem aspect.Now that that's out of the way, I will proceed to fanboy out about what is so far my favorite anime of all time.This show is a comedy/harem...deal. And the humor in this show is great. I will warn of some poop jokes down the line but overall it is a genuinely funny show, with the protagonist, Kodaka, playing the straight man while all the other characters are borderline insane. Another big element of the humor is irony/parody. The show is chock full of references to video games, other anime, heck - even references to high-brow classic literature. While some references are blatantly stuffed in your face, there are many more subtle things that are worth keeping an eye out for that you might not notice the first time.And that brings me another big point: this show is very cleverly written and animated so there is plenty of re-watching potential. For example, just about every single character in the show makes a brief appearance in the first 30 seconds, many even before Kodaka is introduced himself. It's the little stuff like this that really add to the show. The references are everywhere from the visuals, characters' lines, even episode titles. And they made carefully sure not to lose any of the jokes or references in the dub, no matter how subtle they may be.Probably the best part of this show is just the way that the characters all interact with each other. They are all friendless and lonely, and when they all get into a room together, all hell can break loose. As you would expect of a show about making friends, the focal point of this anime is relationships. And it is both funny and genuinely interesting to me to see the relationships change, and as all their personalities come out, their relationships with each other change. And, as all of them become closer to kodaka, the club starts to derail more and more. The unrealistic, wacky and unfortunate scenario that is this show's setting creates both great humor and food for thought. It's almost like a science experiment how this crazy, specific scenario was set up with these funny characters as they just try to be normal and make friends.Now let's do a quick rundown of the characters:KODAKA HASEGAWA - The friendless, blonde-haired protagonist who looks like a scary thug but is really a painfully nice, caring guy.PROS: The nicest human ever. Funny (often unintentionally), and is a good cook.CONS: Completely ignorant to romance. but maybe there's a reason behind it...YOZORA MIKAZUKI - Also friendless but this time it's because she hates everyone and everything.PROS: Her good looks are canonically her only good quality. She is also a good student I guess.CONS: A lot...SENA KASHIWAZAKI - Bestgirl. Unrealistically beautiful, rich, good at literally everything. Because of this, she is the target of Yozora's endless bullying and it actually makes you root for her. Also, she has a foot fetish for some reason?PROS: What's not to like? well, besides...CONS: She is incredibly full of herself, even to the point of calling herself a goddess. Yikes. No wonder she has no friends.RIKA SHIGUMA - Genius scientist and inventor. Also a massive pervert. Also has no friends.PROS: Probably the most real human-like character. Has character development and is not as crazy as she may seem.CONS: she weird manYUKIMURA KUSONOKI - Is it a boy or is it a girl?PROS: maid costume (if you're into that sort of thing)CONS: definitely the least real human-like character. Mostly used for jokes and barely has any character development at all.KOBATO HASEGAWA - Kodaka's little sister. Obsessed with a vampire anime and always acts like one of its characters. Target of Sena's unreciprocated affection.PROS: Funny gags and stuffCONS: She is only really used for comic relief.MARIA TAKAYAMA - A literal 10 year old.PROS: ???CONS: aforementioned poop jokesAlright, now lets wrap this up with the overall pros and cons of the show:PROS-funny characters-makes you think-memorable lines and jokes-2 seasons-the manga goes into a lot more depth and gives you more development but is by no means necessary to fully appreciate it-the dub is actually good (this is one of the very few anime where I might recommend the dub over subbed)-music is great and very fitting for the show, not just main themes but the background music as well-excellent visuals that are very respectful to the novels' original artworkCONS:-no season 3 (and the novels don't give us an ending to be proud of)-people don't like how kodaka is a typical stupid harem protagonist but that is actually a crucial part of the storytelling.-it's not for everyone-many people don't approve of its use of cliches, even if they are used for parody/satire-*KIND OF SPOILER* ends on cliffhanger deal. And the humor in this show is great.

While the story was entertaining, the characters were inviting but the fact is that there is no happiness. The feeling of being left hanging, with no real growth.I ""felt"" sorry for the girls, if Kodaka had chosen the other girls would be devastated. If he doesn\'t choose there is frustration and loss.For Kodaka, he can\'t choose. Leaving his life as miserable as it was before the saga began.  I didn\'t have many friends as a child, so I felt the story line may have been too familiar.Rika may have been the biggest...looser in the game, all she wanted was Taka back.I would like to watch another season if I can find it, but I doubt there would be any closure. looser in the game, all she wanted was Taka back.I would like to watch another season if I can find it, but I doubt there would be any closure.', 'Generally, I review shows based on enjoyment mostly, that being said.Haganai is about a boy who managed to fuck up first impressions at his new school that he i alienated for his entire first month, but after discovering that his classmate is in a semi-similar situation, they team up to make a club where they can just chill and make friends with people.This is one of my favourite series of all time, despite its rating as a 7, this is because despite the fact that it does alot right, it looks great, has an incredible opening, season 1 has its issues.Season 1 ends abruptly and...leaves us hanging for a possible season 2. I am aware that season 2 exists however i am rating this season by itself and I couldn\'t find \'Next\' for upwards of a year.Overall though, I really felt myself in this show, it brought back memories of what i call the ""crackhead crew"" that i used to hang with at school and that touched me. This show is not for everyone but it is definitely worth a shot, you may see yourself here.I enjoyed it as a 10 because it made me laugh, it brought me up and it touched me when i was feeling down.

The characters don\'t really change. Early on you see what the main twist/crux of the series is, so you\'re more watching to see the main characters interact rather than change or develop over the season. Even at the end when you think some development may happen, it really doesn\'t go very fart.2. The soundtrack was pretty good, albiet simple. I can\'t really fault it though.3. The story is super predictable for the first season. You easily see where the show is pushing a few episodes in, and past that you can tell...who ""best grill"" is.4. The art is pretty good. It has a ton of ecchi undertones and even some minor nudity, so if you\'re not looking for something that comes off as kinda trashy this might not be the show for you.Overall this feels like one of the simplest harem shows I\'ve watched. It\'s less of a ""will they won\'t they"" and more of a ""when do they bang"" type of show. The art and story was decent enough to keep me interested, but just don\'t go into this expecting Monogatari and you\'ll probably enjoy yourself. who ""best grill"" is.4. The art is pretty good.

I’ve gone on countless rants about light novels in the past so I’ll refrain from doing so and instead destroy the story (for what it is).Kodaka is the new kid in school and scares everyone because he looks like a punk (because it worked in Toradora, so why not rehash the idea here?). He has the most ridiculous off-color hair I’ve ever seen as well as a passion for high-water pants and boat shoes. As he prepares to leave...school after a rough first day he encounters a smoking hot girl talking to herself and is suddenly forced into joining a club he accidentally helped create (because it worked in Haruhi Suzumiya, so why not rehash the idea here?). The club, founded so Kodaka and his new friend, Yozora, can meet more friends and try to gain a social life, is quickly peopled with strange girls such as the rich Sena, the sexually obsessed Rika, and the girly-boy Yukimura. In true harem fashion Haganai quickly shifts gears a few episodes in, going from the construction of a club and finding of friends to doing generic harem things.And of course, as with all harems, every girl (and boy) in the harem is madly in love with the main character to some extent. This means lots of feuds. The two main girls, Yozora and Sena, are constantly bickering while Kodaka’s little sister, Kobato, fights with the ten year old teacher/nun (that makes sense) Maria over who is Kodaka’s true little sister.Aside from that, there’s no plot to speak of. After all the characters have come together each episode is a bunch of loosely connected events, most of which are boring outings to the beach, the pool (twice!), a festival, and karaoke. There’s also a bullshit PTSD storyline about Yozora actually being Kodaka’s best friend from when he was a kid. She remembers it and knows him; he’s forgotten and doesn’t recognize her. It’s groan-worthy for sure.All this culminates in what I think is the single most underwhelming final episode I’ve seen in a long time. Rather than an emotional revelation or any sort of progression or closure with the cock-tease romance, we get a bunch of clips of shit we’ve already seen followed by enough open-endedness to ensure future seasons and OVA’s.CharactersI can summarize the cast as being lackluster, but that’d be unfair to the few mildly entertaining girls.Our main character Kodaka is the typical harem guy. He’s completely boring aside from one thing that sets him apart from the rest. And he, of course, also has some past event that ties him inexplicably to one of the girls. Project yourself into his boat shoes like the writers wanted and you’re doing it right.Yozora appears to be the main love interest though I see the series going another way (which would be especially nice considering the predictability of these type of shows). She may be one of my most despised anime characters of all time. Kodaka sums her up pretty well in a later episode when he says she’s “Gorgeous but evil”. She’s very pretty, yes, but a total bitch. She has pictures she can use to blackmail characters; she forces Maria, the loli, to run around naked; she treats Sena like complete crap out of spite but also enjoyment. She’s a sick human being. You don’t have friends because you’re a cunt!I’ll defend Sena because I don’t think she’s that bad, especially compared to Yozora. She has some affluenza issues and is a lolicon, but is an otherwise pleasant character to be around in the quieter, less comedic moments of Haganai. She’s given a lot more time to gel with Kodaka which endears her more to me.  You also see her get type-cast as the tits when she’s really smart and just…autistic for lack of a better term, which further makes her more than just the piece of meat Yozora wants everyone to believe. Sena is best girl.Kobato and Maria are the lolis. What disturbs me most about the DVD version of the series is that they are sexualized a lot. The first naked pair of tits we see are Kobato’s. We also see Maria’s. While Sena’s are shown twice I don’t take as much offense to that as I do the unneeded explicit sexualization of the ten year olds. It’s unneeded and weird considering other characters, especially Rika, get censored during more racy moments. Aside from that these two bicker as much as Sena and Yozora and neither are developed enough (not in that way) to be worthwhile.Rounding the club out are Rika and Yukimura. Rika is obsessed with sex, talks in the third person, but is also an extremely successful scientist. She brings the funniest moments to the series despite her only character trait being “She’s sexually repressed and needs to get laid”. Yukimura is the trap/feminine-boy. This character’s necessary only to lure in a certain crowd and the strange blushiness and near-boners of Kodaka around him (I.E the swimming episode) lead to some awkwardness that is otherwise unneeded.AnimationFantastic animation is Haganai’s strongest point. The characters, for the most part, look unique enough to be memorable in that regard and every scene has beautiful lighting and color. There are some derp moments when characters are in the background and their irises are in strange spots but, for the most part, I have no complaints. Even four years later, it’s still high-quality stuff.SoundWhile the opening isn’t exciting, it is catchy. The ending song is much better, though still nothing worth putting on an iPod. Music during the show is what you’ve come to expect of this type of anime with happy music punctuating silly scenes and bringing an air of joviality that isn’t fully utilized. I watched the English dub (sacrilege to most, but dubs sometimes pull me into an anime more than subs) and found it to be watchable. Kodaka’s voice actor is as boring as the character himself with a phoned in, lazy performance. Sena and Yozora, for their part, do a pretty decent job. The loli’s are as annoying as you’d expect and other performances are serviceable. Some of the reworking of the Japanese script is where the most cringing comes, especially Sena telling Yozora to “lay off the Hateorade”. I’m shivering just typing that.EntertainmentDespite all complaints, Haganai is a watchable and fairly entertaining show. It’s predictable and some of the comedy is flat merely because it’s nothing but girls calling each other lame names (meat, cow, floppy). I’ve been more entertained by other harem series, but Haganai is one of the better of the mediocre ones. It made me laugh (a feat some can’t even manage) and it did, despite the characters being relatively two-dimensional and generic, engage me in the pseudo-romance.OverallHaganai is a lot of cut-and-paste from other shows of the same genre, but it’s also got a grasp on keeping character interactions interesting and funny, even if some of it comes across as forced and annoying at times. The exclusion of a plot makes it hard for me to recommend based on any sort of writing merits, but the animation sure is pretty and the show comes across as harmless (except for the pointless nude scenes). It’s nothing new, but it’s good for what it is. Fans of harems and ecchi will enjoy this; people who aren’t into those genres will want to steer clear. My original review gave Haganai two and a half stars, but I think it’s more deserving of three, above average but not quite good. school after a rough first day he encounters a smoking hot girl talking to herself and is suddenly forced into joining a club he accidentally helped create (because it worked in Haruhi Suzumiya, so why not rehash the idea here?).

We also see Maria’s. While Sena’s are shown twice I don’t take as much offense to that as I do the unneeded explicit sexualization of the ten year olds. It’s unneeded and weird considering other characters, especially Rika, get censored during more racy moments. Aside from that these two bicker as much as Sena and Yozora and neither are developed enough (not in that way) to be worthwhile.Rounding the club out are Rika and Yukimura. Rika is obsessed with sex, talks in the third person, but is also an extremely successful scientist. She brings the funniest moments to the series despite her only character trait being “She’s sexually repressed and needs to get laid”. Yukimura is the trap/feminine-boy. This character’s necessary only to lure in a certain crowd and the strange blushiness and near-boners of Kodaka around him (I.E the swimming episode) lead to some awkwardness that is otherwise unneeded.AnimationFantastic animation is Haganai’s strongest point. The characters, for the most part, look unique enough to be memorable in that regard and every scene has beautiful lighting and color. There are some derp moments when characters are in the background and their irises are in strange spots but, for the most part, I have no complaints. Even four years later, it’s still high-quality stuff.SoundWhile the opening isn’t exciting, it is catchy. The ending song is much better, though still nothing worth putting on an iPod. Music during the show is what you’ve come to expect of this type of anime with happy music punctuating silly scenes and bringing an air of joviality that isn’t fully utilized. I watched the English dub (sacrilege to most, but dubs sometimes pull me into an anime more than subs) and found it to be watchable. Kodaka’s voice actor is as boring as the character himself with a phoned in, lazy performance. Sena and Yozora, for their part, do a pretty decent job. The loli’s are as annoying as you’d expect and other performances are serviceable. Some of the reworking of the Japanese script is where the most cringing comes, especially Sena telling Yozora to “lay off the Hateorade”. I’m shivering just typing that.EntertainmentDespite all complaints, Haganai is a watchable and fairly entertaining show. It’s predictable and some of the comedy is flat merely because it’s nothing but girls calling each other lame names (meat, cow, floppy). I’ve been more entertained by other harem series, but Haganai is one of the better of the mediocre ones. It made me laugh (a feat some can’t even manage) and it did, despite the characters being relatively two-dimensional and generic, engage me in the pseudo-romance.OverallHaganai is a lot of cut-and-paste from other shows of the same genre, but it’s also got a grasp on keeping character interactions interesting and funny, even if some of it comes across as forced and annoying at times. The exclusion of a plot makes it hard for me to recommend based on any sort of writing merits, but the animation sure is pretty and the show comes across as harmless (except for the pointless nude scenes). It’s nothing new, but it’s good for what it is. Fans of harems and ecchi will enjoy this; people who aren’t into those genres will want to steer clear. My original review gave Haganai two and a half stars, but I think it’s more deserving of three, above average but not quite good.', '(Note: while this review is listed under the first season, it encompasses my thoughts on both seasons and the show as a whole.)Unless you\'re big into fanservice and characters who are unable to process or communicate their feelings, I suggest skipping this show. Because that\'s really all it offers. Fanservice and cheap padding.Every character is either obnoxious or one note - Sena is a rich tsundere, Kobato is a chunni with a brother complex, Rika is just creepy, and Maria won\'t shut up about poop for some reason. The only characters I enjoyed were Yozora and Yukimura, and the way the show treated both of...them left me bitter overtime.Yozora seems to be the show\'s punching bag, giving her a heartfelt, meaningful backstory, and then refusing to give her any sort of long-term happiness. Instead, Sena appears to be the front-runner to actually end up with the protagonist, and while the dude is boring as can be, he does not deserve that sort of fate.Yukimura, on the other hand, could have been a very interesting character if the show knew how to properly handle LGBT+ themes. Instead he just becomes a joke character whose sex and gender play tug-of-war with each other just for laughs. Because queer people are funny, I guess.Overall, I got little enjoyment out of this series. It\'s shallow, unfunny, and you\'re best off only watching it if you want a ""so bad it\'s good"" show, or if you just really like titties.Also, the OVA makes a bunch of rape jokes. So there\'s that, too. them left me bitter overtime.Yozora seems to be the show\'s punching bag, giving her a heartfelt, meaningful backstory, and then refusing to give her any sort of long-term happiness.

Well, I just haven\'t found the reasons to see why it\'s a particularly impressive piece of work; that\'s about it.But it never felt like a bane to me to watch Boku wa Tomodachi; I enjoyed it. And I think that\'s an important part in why I guess the lot of us were able to enjoy this anime.My only main gripes are that the main male is too unflawed to be fleshed out of...a character, and I\'d say that there are a bit too many female characters. Some of the girls aren\'t really all that important, although they may be fun to watch. The black haired girl, ""Mikazuki, Yozora"" plays an interesting role however, and is able to make the plot progress. For me, that\'s the character I care enough about to be able to say that I think she carries the show.This is a slice of life anime, and anyone hoping to get a sermon out of this would be missing the point, I\'d think. But I could be missing something. There\'s a good story here about a bunch of kids who lack friends being a part of this club and spending time together. And that\'s what it focuses on most of the time.There is a really key portion of this anime though (an important dynamic between two characters) that I feel was never really fulfilled because it spent too much time having fun. I\'m sure this aspect was explored more in its second season, but I\'ve yet to watch its second season. However, Boku wa Tomodachi manages to show how difficult it is to not only establish but also to maintain a relationship with someone, and I was really able to feel that reality within this anime. Especially with that time gap at the end there. It goes to show that, before you know it, someone you know can suddenly disappear from the face of the earth. And you don\'t know if or when you\'ll ever see them again. There\'s merit in that conveyance. And so as regular as much of the aspects of this anime may be, I think it deserves a nudge for being able to do well in some of its more important moments. a character, and I\'d say that there are a bit too many female characters.

I felt that maybe, I could relate to this show and see a beautiful friendship grow among characters my age. Coming back after not completing it the first round and watching the entire season in a few days, I realized how wrong I once was.""Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai"" (nicknamed ""Haganai"" and released under this title in North America) is what I like to called a ""harem"" anime; a guy surrounded by a bunch of beautiful and different types of...girls and they do normal things that seem better with cuties around. However, I don\'t see this anime too cliche.The story of this series takes you an emotional roller coaster throughout the twelve episodes, shifting moods very often and have an interesting dynamic. The story centers around a boy named Kodaka who moved back to his childhood home and transferred into a Catholic school in his second year. Already mistaken for a delinquent, he ends up not having any friends. However,in over a month\'s time, he finds himself surrounded by girls once he is forced to join ""The Neighbors Club"" by Yozora (already sounds like Kyon and the S.O.S. Brigade, right?), a girl who looks like she has issues and has an imaginary friend named Tomo who is made of air. Along with Yozora and the other club members, it feels like they are all constantly fighting for Kodaka\'s attention. So far, it all seems like the have an interesting past but very few have been revealed. Overall, the story felt like it was indeed interesting. Though, it obviously craves for more detail. But that is the kind of thing that makes the story thrive and progress, which leaves a lot to be revealed in the future which is why I am glad there is a second season.I enjoyed the art and animation from this series, though, it was nothing spectacular. What I really enjoyed about the art was the landscape scenes and other background elements. From the country side where Kodaka lives with mountains and fields to the architecture of the Catholic school, it is all very beautiful. The characters designs are very interesting through it feels like there is a base for each teenage female character and one for female children characters. The only distinguishable things between the girls were their hight, bust size, eye color and shape, and overall hair style. I have not seen many male characters other than Kodaka so I cannot say it is the same for the males but I wouldn\'t expect much.I actually enjoyed this series a lot because while this show is not about about how to make friends, it is about social outcasts being awkward together and their interactions. Being that, it is kind of scary how much I relate to some of the characters. Whether it be about cell phones (""Oh, yeah! I can use my cell phone to call someone else besides home and my sister"") or going to public places (""I have social anxiety""), I understand where the characters are coming from. There are plenty of intentional innuendoes but I believe that is to be expected from outcasts who have just way too much time on their hands. Also, there are hits of different fanservice but I do believe that being of a seinen \ufeffdemographic, it is to be expected. I can easily overlook the ecchi but that is mostly because I find a lot of it hilarious. It was indeed a ""slice of life"" series though, it really leaves you hanging for the next season. There is indeed an internal battle going on inside of each of the characters that I think most people over look.

I can\'t see a reason why not to.My purpose isn\'t to write a summary for the anime, but simply to point out several key points as to why you\'ll fall in love with this anime, too.The whole story is focused around a mistaken delinquent who is forced into a number of different embarrassing, hilarious situations. These escalate quickly, and usually fall on him getting in some form of trouble.The harem-esque nature of the anime has appeal for anyone who likes a decent love story, but I\'ll be honest, it was completely and utterly unbelievable. Don\'t get me wrong, that doesn\'t...mean it wasn\'t /good/, that means it just simply wasn\'t something you\'d ever come across in real life (which is what ""slice-of-life"" animes should really be focussing on).That being said, I definitely found that this story had a certain charm and more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.The only part of this anime I found very disappointing was his interaction a certain scientist girl (to avoid spoilers, names won\'t be given). It was unrealistic and cheesy, ultimately serving no purpose to the plot or storyline, and it didn\'t further their relationship with each other.Other than that? Excellent anime (could use some work on the in-anime tracks, both sound-effect and BGM, otherwise, outstanding). mean it wasn\'t /good/, that means it just simply wasn\'t something you\'d ever come across in real life (which is what ""slice-of-life"" animes should really be focussing on).That being said, I definitely found that this story had a certain charm and more than enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.The only part of this anime I found very disappointing was his interaction a certain scientist girl (to avoid spoilers, names won\'t be given).

You get this very fun and enjoyable series, Haganai. Plus there’s bits and pieces of several other anime as well, but I’m not sure if I would be just nitpicking, especially considering some of them were released years after this anime was. However, it’s not simply just a knock off of many different animes, though the episode titles appear to be just that. This will be less of a “rigid review” then some others, since a few other people have already done extensive reviews.I...really loved the artwork, it had a very unique style, and it made the characters look awesome! Especially the faces, and even more so with the girls in the series, very kawaii! What? As they would say in anime, I am a guy after all! lol The setting was very interesting too, a private Christian Academy in Japan. I went to a Christian school myself for a good part of my primary school days, so I can relate to some of the stuff that I saw in the series. also, with the lead character living alone with his little sister, that was one of the reasons why I compared it to Bunny Girl Senpai. That and of course Rika being the Futaba of this series.The story was at first not too substantive, but it got much more substantive as a story went on. And I don’t mean that in the usual way that stories develop either. This was supposed to be a slice of life romcom, but it turned out to be much more than that. I want this to be spoiler free, so I can’t give too much in the way of details. But you may want to get your tissues out for episode three, the one with the flashback of Kodaka as a kid, and that other kid who helped him. It’s definitely a bit heartbreaking, just as a heads up. And some really good back stories with the characters as well, I was really impressed by that. And speaking of which…The characters themselves were much more interesting than I thought they were going to be. Yes with the backstories like I said, but even with the main girl Yozora, she goes from being weird, to being caring, to being very sinister and even depraved at times, to being caring and considerate again. And no, I don’t mean in a knee-jerk way like someone who has mental issues or anything, I mean the fact that despite some big flaws of hers, she is overall a very good, caring, and compassionate person. Sena, ugh, not a terrible person, but like I said in the episode 4 discussion thread, very stuck up, because she’s the spoiled little princess of the school president. And as the series went on, I understood more and more why Yozora really ripped into her at times, though that in itself went way too overboard sometimes as well. Kodaka, with his English mother’s blonde hair, and his scary looking eyes, you gotta feel for him for how he gets the wrong rap so often. But still, he actually takes that stuff really in stride, and only “uses it” like once or twice this season, and only to bail Sena out, with something that she herself started by clearly provoking those guys at the pool.Kodaka’s little sister, Kobato, is the Rikka from Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions of this series, simply put. And I already told you about Rika being the Futaba of the series, though extremely perverted, and clearly a yaoi fangirl in addition to that. The little girl nun, Maria, has a serious attitude problem especially for someone who is supposed to be in the clergy. And no, her being a little girl doesn’t excuse some of the stuff that she says. And that finally brings us to the timid, effeminate boy, Yukimura. You know, I don’t know why both him and Maria are so damn gullible to Yozora’s words, but it shows up even more in Yukimura. I mean it gets to point to where she convinced him to even wear a girl’s swimsuit to a pool in one episode. I mean seriously? Yeah, and no way is him radiating a manly aura through that, supposed to make him any manlier. Yozora clearly played him as a fool.I really, really love the music, especially the opening theme. It’s now one of my favorites, because that’s how good it is! It’s fun, upbeat, has excellent timing, and so much more!Anyways, I suppose that this review has already gone on too long, so I’ll end it here. But I really, really enjoyed this series a whole lot! Not too many misunderstandings of pervertedness, (also with the many actual perverted scenes as it is! Lol) and even then it didn’t strain the relationships between the characters that much. Very heartwarming turns of events throughout the season, and just when it was really starting to get on my nerves, it kept making it up to me, time and time again.

Review is for both.Story: High School Guy(Kodaka) is lonely cause people think he\'s a thug, but he\'s just been misinterpreted several times and is actually a nice guy. He discovers a girl(Yozora) talking to an imaginary friend, afterwards she decides to start a club to help people make friends and essentially forces him to join.I was all-in on this premise, but the show doesn\'t really go the route it sounds like it will. My initial thoughts were that they would become friends and find other people who are friendless and basically amass their own friend group. Technically that...sort of happens, but not really.A third character shows up to join the club, a rich girl(Sena), and Yozora hates her immediately. And that\'s basically all the characters that matter. Others join fairly quickly, but they don\'t actually matter that much are a somewhat 1-dimensional.Over the course of the story the characters practice doing friend things with each other, but they never try to find new members(they just show up) and it\'s mostly just wacky sexually-charged hijinks over and over again. At first this works pretty well, with them sometimes trying to apply what they\'ve learned to be friends with others but it never works out. This part of the plot kind of disappears a few episodes in and the group just generally hangs out as friends but never ever call each other friends despite spending a lot of time together in and out of school. Literally the MC constantly says he has no friends and then hangs out with his harem several times times a week, but FOR NO REASON, none of them consider each other friends.SPOILERS: Some things about their pasts are revealed, but nothing really happens with it. Like it\'s discovered that Yozora and Kodaka where childhood friends, but Yozora looked like a boy so Kodaka doesn\'t remember her. After this is revealed to everyone they STILL aren\'t friends. Sena is also revealed to be a childhood friend of Kodaka\'s(even earlier) and that they apparently promised to marry each other.Characters: They all kind of suck, mostly.Yozora is just kind of a bitch. At first it seems like she picks on Sena in a playful way, cause she\'s jealous of her body, but then she genuinely does incredibly mean and spiteful things to her for no reason as the series goes on, including things that would physically harm her. She also emotionally manipulates and tricks several other characters into doing things solely for her amusement or to make things easier for her. It seems like the writer knew they overdid it and actually had an episode showing several unseen moments of her doing the mean things she did for good reasons, but it doesn\'t really make up for any of it. She also manipulates a girl who thinks they are a boy into being their servant, and wearing a maid outfit, saying it will make them more man-like. She assaults a 10-year-old nun and manipulates them into being their club advisor so they don\'t have to answer to someone with real authority. She also convinces this girl to do sexually explicit things and to strip off her clothes and run around publicly several times. At one point she writes a story where Sena\'s character is raped in it. She sucks and seems to genuinely be a bad person, yet we\'re supposed to feel sorry that they don\'t have any friends and that maybe she\'s just mean because she felt abandoned by Kodaka when they were kids(cause he moved away).Sena is a conceited rich girl who thinks she\'s better than everyone, and actually is, and she\'s a bit naïve and prone to tears. Overall she\'s not as horrible as that sounds, the worst she does is mention that people should lick her boots a couple times. Most of the time she\'s somewhat normal and sometimes nice and sometimes a little overbearing with her prideful-ness. She doesn\'t really deserve the bullying she gets from Yozora. And it definitely feels like bullying 90% of the time. Outside of that, she\'s lonely cause she has no girl friends, just a throng of guys who worship her(who never appear in the show past a single scene in the first episode.) She actually spend the most time with Kodaka and it seems like the story is pushing them together.Kodaka is a nice guy and does genuinely nice things for a few characters, but has no spine and is very self-deprecating. He plays the role of the straight man, but never does much of anything in the show other than react to things or get into sexual situations with one or all of the girls. However, this nice guy persona is kind of weirdly done as he allows the bullying of Sena to happen every time, then only chides Yozora about it after Sena runs away in tears. And even then only tells her she went a little too far. He easily could stop it, but never does. Sena\'s father even asks him if she is being bullied at school, but he says she isn\'t, so either he\'s secretly a spineless jerk or the writer doesn\'t understand bullying. Then there\'s a gender-fluid character who is female but believes they are male. Yozora convinces her to wear a maid\'s outfit and be Kodaka\'s servant, which they happily do and Kodaka never objects to this or finds it problematic. Overall he\'s sort of depicted as being ""oblivious"" to the things going on(like characters being in love with him and other sexually explicit things) but it\'s revealed that he just ignores it cause he just wants to make friends and doesn\'t want to harm the group by dating anyone. Overall this an interesting angle for him to take, but it just feels like the writer trying to ""dangle a carrot"" for as long as possible. Also Kodaka is the narrator and we hear his thoughts, so we should know this already, but instead it\'s used as a bit of an ass pull at the end.The other characters are fairly one-note.The trans-boy/girl is just that. She has little to no agency or story focus other than characters learning that they are actually a girl. She also refers to Kodaka as a big brother, as do 3 other characters.Kodaka\'s actual little sister pretends to be a vampire, and is a little shy and that\'s about it. She\'s also in love with her brother and gets nude several times, ugh.The 10-year-old is just that and she call things Poop or characters Poopy ALL THE TIME. She calls Kodaka big brother as well. She is also nude far too many times. There is a somewhat fun dynamic between her and the real sister, since she\'s a nun and the sister pretends to be a vampire. It seems like they\'d become play friends thru this but they mostly stay rivals and insult each other all the time.Then there\'s a nerdy scientist girl called Rika who refers to herself in the third-person. She doesn\'t seem to have any emotions, but absolutely wants to bang Kodaka and constantly makes sexually charged comments to him. It\'s completely out in the open and nobody really comments on it beyond a ""omg perv... anyway..."". That\'s her character 90% of the time. I nteh end she kind of tries to force Kodaka to be honest about himself, but it feels out of nowhere for the character.END:By the end some stuff gets thrown out into the open, but then the anime ends and nothing is resolved and it never will be(in anime form). Overall, I thought the show was going to go somewhere but it never really does. They never really try to make friends with others or each other even though they clearly have become friends. Characters never really change apart from some 11th-hour revelations that mean nothing. Characters never seem to have any real conversations.Overall, I don\'t really recommend it because none of the characters are that realistic, they don\'t do much or grow, and the show doesn\'t do much with it. I don\'t really understand the positive reviews for this anime apart from the fanservice. sort of happens, but not really.A third character shows up to join the club, a rich girl(Sena), and Yozora hates her immediately. And that\'s basically all the characters that matter. Others join fairly quickly, but they don\'t actually matter that much are a somewhat 1-dimensional.Over the course of the story the characters practice doing friend things with each other, but they never try to find new members(they just show up) and it\'s mostly just wacky sexually-charged hijinks over and over again. At first this works pretty well, with them sometimes trying to apply what they\'ve learned to be friends with others but it never works out. This part of the plot kind of disappears a few episodes in and the group just generally hangs out as friends but never ever call each other friends despite spending a lot of time together in and out of school. Literally the MC constantly says he has no friends and then hangs out with his harem several times times a week, but FOR NO REASON, none of them consider each other friends.SPOILERS: Some things about their pasts are revealed, but nothing really happens with it. Like it\'s discovered that Yozora and Kodaka where childhood friends, but Yozora looked like a boy so Kodaka doesn\'t remember her. After this is revealed to everyone they STILL aren\'t friends. Sena is also revealed to be a childhood friend of Kodaka\'s(even earlier) and that they apparently promised to marry each other.Characters: They all kind of suck, mostly.Yozora is just kind of a bitch. At first it seems like she picks on Sena in a playful way, cause she\'s jealous of her body, but then she genuinely does incredibly mean and spiteful things to her for no reason as the series goes on, including things that would physically harm her. She also emotionally manipulates and tricks several other characters into doing things solely for her amusement or to make things easier for her. It seems like the writer knew they overdid it and actually had an episode showing several unseen moments of her doing the mean things she did for good reasons, but it doesn\'t really make up for any of it. She also manipulates a girl who thinks they are a boy into being their servant, and wearing a maid outfit, saying it will make them more man-like. She assaults a 10-year-old nun and manipulates them into being their club advisor so they don\'t have to answer to someone with real authority.

While there are some moments that make the show feel bland and slow to watch, there was definitely a lot of funny moments in there also. I think it has everything that a loner, shut-in, or even introvert needs in their life.I believe that the main purpose of this show is to explain that you don\'t really need to be really popular to hang out with people that are in the same/similar situation as you are.There was so many moments where Yozora takes...advantage of what she is doing and throws it all out on Sena whenever she gets the chance to bully Sena. Whether it is inside the clubroom or somewhere in a public place where the club members are doing club activities.

Rita also seems to be very lewd and perverted whenever she gets the chance to do so in front of all the club members without shame.The cutest (and even most insane) moment that I took away from this show overall was the fact that: Kodaka and Yozora (or Taka and Sora) were childhood friends 10 years ago. It seemed as though this duo is in fact friends but I\'m a little unsure if you still consider your childhood friend as a ""real friend"" despite not seeing and speaking to them for 10 years straight.

The basis of Haganai is pretty simple: a bunch of loners starts a club so that they can learn to make friends. The character archetypes are pretty cliche: there is the shy osananajimi, the ojousama, the nerd otaku, the imouto, the loli, the femboy gender bender, and the harem protagonist. However, each of these characters goes far beyond what their character troupe says they should be. Each of them actually has developed as a character and has complex relationships that develop over time. Unlike...in most harem anime, the character’s ulterior motives give harem relationships when they don’t pan out well. The character’s weird oddities and stubbornness are shown to not always work the best for them. Yozora is probably the best-developed character, as her cliche-ness at the beginning breaks down over time as her relationship with Sena and Kodaka leaves the standard development and ventures into her own problems. Her relationships developed to be complex with the other characters and her unwillingness to do certain things are shown to have actual consequences. In addition, unlike in most harem anime, the main character, Kodaka, is shown to have more complex feelings than just “I want to date this girl” and actually is developed well just to want to be friends with all of the members of Neighbors Club, and how he may fail or not fail at it. In fact, unlike most harem anime, there was almost no focus on the main character wanting to date the characters and only focusing on the girls liking him. Other than the characters, the art and animations are just above average for the time and nothing special. Both OPs are decent but not great, and the first ed isn't good (however, I did like the second ED). During the first season especially there were a lot of odd nude scenes, but either I’ve gotten used to it or they were less painful than usual. Overall, this anime was better than I expected and flips some of the troupes to make an actually good anime about what it means to make friends.Score: 8.0date of review: 8/20/2022 in most harem anime, the character’s ulterior motives give harem relationships when they don’t pan out well.

Here are my thoughts:I tend not to like harem shows such as this with a male protagonist and a lot of (typically unfunny) comedy. Nevertheless, I decided to give this anime a chance. The title is certainly enticing and relatable.I really liked the voice acting for Sena, Yozora, and Kobato; everyone else is unremarkable. The OST is bad, in my opinion.The humour is sometimes funny. The comedic theme of social ineptitude is a winner. There is also a lot of \'otaku humour\' which...can be funny as well. Character interactions are sometimes enjoyable. The various activities of the club and the resulting antics of the characters can be fairly amusing. Humour and character interactions are really this mediocre anime\'s only redeeming qualities. Probably the thing I enjoyed most about the anime was the chemistry (or lack thereof, haha) between Sena and Yozora. The way they play off each other is amusing. Sena yelling ""YOZORA AHO"" and then running out of the club room will never not be funny. Conversely, I found the other characters (i.e. not Yozora or Sena) to be unfunny. This anime is at its best when it focuses on Sena and Yozora. In fact these two characters are the only reason I kept watching. Seriously, I did not like anyone else in the cast besides maybe Kobato because her chuuni moments were funny. Despite the 25-episode length of this anime, the entire cast has shallow characterization and is often one-note in their behaviour, which can result in the gags and character interaction feeling repetitive.The writing of this anime feels amateurish and crude. The show has an overarching story that mainly involves Yozora and the main character. The story is quite dumb and I didn\'t like it (the story-focused episodes are the worst in the series). Thankfully it does not suck up that much screentime. This anime is mostly episodic. I did enjoy how both Sena and Yozora have uniquely flawed personalities in their own ways, which is sort of refreshing compared to the usual idealistic love interests you encounter in typical romance/harem shows.I don\'t mean this in an overly critical way, but this show is juvenile even by anime standards, both in terms of the writing and humour. This isn\'t an objectively bad thing; I can imagine that a teenage boy would enjoy this anime a lot more than I did. It\'s not that I can\'t enjoy childish anime, it\'s just that a lot of the content of this one fell flat for me, and a pervasive underlying reason for this seems to be the juvenile nature of the show. This is coming from someone who generally enjoys the SoL genre. It\'s difficult for me to articulate this point because it\'s hard to concisely express why this schoolyard comedy is more juvenile than other schoolyard comedies.In terms of visuals, the art style in this did not age well. I did not like the character designs (although purple eyes do look great on Yozora — wish that were a more common design choice). The colour palette is also very dull. Animation quality was acceptable — there were \'quality\' moments but at least the facial expressions were adequately animated. There\'s a ton of fanservice as well, which isn\'t surprising since this is a harem anime.My overall rating: 4/10It was pretty bad but amusing enough to keep me watching. This anime did have funny moments, but my average level of enjoyment while watching was fairly low. There were plenty of unfunny skits that diluted the parts that I did enjoy. Yozora and Sena basically carried the entire show — I would have dropped this on episode 1 were it not for those two characters. Also, as I said, the voice acting for some characters (Sena & Yozora) is an outstanding aspect of this anime.A teenage boy would likely enjoy this anime more than I did.Compared to season 1, season 2 has notably better animation quality, cinematography and lighting effects.

If not for the latter, i would genuinely recommend the show for the good boys of the Christian community.There was no anime subtrope more criticized than the ecchi cluster. Dismissed as guilty pleasure, adult series for teenagers, and lives in dies in the concept of sex. I for one delve in such sinful commune so that i learn what makes it tick. I never left.Haganai takes you in the everyday lives of the Make-Friends club which has different members with varying mental...and emotional conditions that make it difficult for them to establish friendship with other. So they band together in this half-assed club where they merely hang out and mess around with each other in pretense of becoming able to make friends outside. With such a well-meaning premise and cast with relatable mental conditions, Haganai could seriously be a hardcore drama... but we got a raunchy comedy with occasional warmth instead. Not to say that it has good drama though cause there is something there, just beneath the cleavages, asses, and elsewhat.The show is often a slice-of-life kind of show where shenanigans happen because of someone's impulsive desire or so. The humor was good, with my favorite being the monster hunter episode which made me glee with joy. When drama kicks in, it does feel dramatic though the show does not linger there for long.Haganai's cast was relatively small but each one was kinda different. Kodaka is somewhat generic as the main protagonist though the show's appeal comes from the other members of the club, most notably Sena, the eroge gamer richkid who was also the buttmonkey of the group and Yozora, the bitchy bully who i genuinely feel irritable to. The others was the gender-dysphoric maid, the genius pervert, and Maria, the little nun. As with ecchi, having a sole male protagonists has been quite the norm and most of the perverted moments in the show involves Kodaka one way or another. Each of the characters has varying levels of relatability but Yozora stuck to me as very unlikable. Eventually i realized that why she irked me is that she is the most grounded and felt closest to an real-life bitchy kind of woman. While Sena is easily the most likable, Yozora is in the opposite spectrum.Artwise, the show has anatomically great design(if you know what i mean). Ecchi moments do not happen as often as the others, but when they happen, expect to see them in full view. Sena, Maria, and Kodaka's sister were very memorable in their design. As there was barely any action, the backgrounds are detailed enough more so that most ecchi.Sound was alright. I do skip the opening and EDs but they do give the impression that it is an ecchi. The OP also has a short shot of Maria, the loli nun in a compromising position so.... be wary of FBI. Voice work was fine.My main complaint lies with the fact that each of the characters has serious need for therapy on what they are experiencing but have no choice but band together to go against their common inability to mingle well with others. The show did acknowledge this but glossed over in exchange for boobies. I did feel that Yozora's issues have been focused well nonetheless. The ecchi is fine and well... yeah it should shudder some cattails but man.... there are two lolis in the cast.Overall, Haganai is entertaining, with mostly likable cast, and generous amount of boobage and skin worthy of its ecchi brand.

Voice work was fine.My main complaint lies with the fact that each of the characters has serious need for therapy on what they are experiencing but have no choice but band together to go against their common inability to mingle well with others. The show did acknowledge this but glossed over in exchange for boobies. I did feel that Yozora's issues have been focused well nonetheless. The ecchi is fine and well... yeah it should shudder some cattails but man.... there are two lolis in the cast.Overall, Haganai is entertaining, with mostly likable cast, and generous amount of boobage and skin worthy of its ecchi brand. Sena, in particular is a total waifu.Binge it. The pacing aint perfect but flows better when viewed consecutively."", 'It looks like I\'m holding an unpopular opinion when it comes to this show, so I\'ll be straightforward.Haganai is a comedy, alright, but it is one of the most painfully average, cringiest comedy I\'ve seen. It does have its shining moments, however, so it was actually pretty okay. That being said, several aspects of the show put me off from truly liking it. At best, it was ""meh."" But the fact that it stays with me shows that it\'s done some things right. Or perhaps it means it\'s done some things terribly wrong. You decide after reading this.The major issues I had with this show...were the characters and gags. Now, those are pretty hefty components for a slice-of-life romcom, so you can see how that would quickly halve a series that I would have ordinarily given a nine.The two female leads, Yozora and Sena, were what irked me the most during the show. More specifically, their interactions. They fit into the categories of ""sadist"" and ""dumb busty blonde"", respectively, which already has the issue of tropes against it. They couldn\'t ever be considered real friends, all throughout both seasons of the series, which isn\'t necessarily bad. It serves to cause tension when they\'re in the same room together.The problem was the execution of this dynamic. The insults, reading, and catfights were very one-sided, with a Sena solidly getting smacked down once or twice an episode. The result of this was a quick dislike of Yozora\'s character, as she showed no mercy in any respect. Half of her character became defined by ""being a bitch to Sena"". Actually. She was nothing but a bitch to Sena. And she exhibited these qualities to several others, occasionally. What puts the final nail in her coffin his her lack of development. She starts out being a bitch, ends the second season being a bitch, and leaves in the bitchiest way possible. I am well aware that there is a light novel in which she may or may not progress as a character, but I didn\'t sit through two dozen episodes to see her act the exact same way to the exact same characters.Sena, on the other hand, is defined by her trope. She\'s naive, too carefree, (very sexualized) and a pervert. And a lolicon. That\'s her character. Her redeemable quality is her eventual frankness (even if how it came about was an accident) in regard to her feelings.The main character is nothing special, from what I\'ve seen of him. He\'s likeable insofar as he can be a bit of a badass at times, but unlikeable in how little he retaliates to Yozora and Sena\'s shit.The older nun and younger nun were there, I guess. In truth, they kind of disgusted me, with the older nuns character being defined by vulgarity (really, fart jokes?) and the younger nun\'s character defined by being a brat.The characters I really liked were the fujoshi scientist and the samurai reverse trap (who\'s best girl, fight me). The samurai trap, in particular, was a pretty original spin on a slightly worn trope, and was by far the purest, cutest, most innocent character in the show. She was a breath of fresh air. Seriously, even chuuni imouto wasn\'t that likeable.Others? There was another male character, I think. That\'s about it.As I said earlier, the jokes pandered to a pretty low denominator, most of them being some form of fanservice, or just plain nauseating. Like forcing someone to read literal porn out loud, or riding a rollercoaster until they literally puke. That was a weird catfight.There were several plot points that I found compelling, like the mystery childhood friend. Even though it was obvious, hanging on the edge of my seat, waiting for the characters to figure it out was exhilarating. And the end portion with the fujoshi and MC was very invigorating, as well.All in all, I might be doing this series a disservice. Who knows? But I watched this in my early anime days, when I consumed and enjoyed literal garbage, and when moderately good series like Sakurasou blew me straight out of the water. Despite that, I just barely enjoyed this enough to finish it. It wasn\'t particularly boring. It was just... irritating. I couldn\'t bring myself to feel sad at what happened at the end. I wanted justice done to those two. And when you end up hating a pretty significant portion of the main cast, it hinders your viewing experience.

But let\'s not judge a book by its cover, or in this case, an anime by its tongue-twister title.First things first, the story of Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai is like a bowl of instant noodles - quick, easy, and not too filling. It\'s nothing groundbreaking, but it\'s still enjoyable to watch. The art style is crisp and colorful, and the character designs are cute enough to make you want to pinch their cheeks.Now, let\'s talk about the...main character. Kodaka Hasegawa is your typical angsty high schooler with a tragic backstory, but he\'s also got a heart of gold. He\'s like the lovechild of Sasuke Uchiha and Naruto Uzumaki, minus the jutsus and the fox spirit. Overall, he\'s a decent protagonist, but he\'s not exactly a game-changer.The voice acting is solid, but nothing to write home about. The music is catchy, and the opening theme is like ear candy. It\'s the kind of song that gets stuck in your head, but you don\'t mind it because it\'s so damn catchy.So, what\'s the verdict? Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai gets a score of 7.3/10. It\'s not the best anime out there, but it\'s not the worst either. If you\'re looking for a lighthearted comedy with some cute girls and a sprinkle of romance, then this anime might just be your cup of tea.

Ini bukan sesuatu yang luar biasa, tapi tetap menyenangkan untuk ditonton. Gaya seni yang digunakan jelas dan penuh warna, dan desain karakternya cukup imut sehingga membuatmu ingin mencubit pipi mereka.Sekarang, mari kita bicara tentang karakter utama. Kodaka Hasegawa adalah siswa SMA yang angsty dengan latar belakang yang tragis, tapi dia juga memiliki hati yang baik. Dia seperti anak hasil hubungan cinta antara Sasuke Uchiha dan Naruto Uzumaki, tanpa jutsu dan roh rubah. Secara keseluruhan, dia adalah protagonist yang cukup baik, tapi tidak benar-benar game-changer.Akting suara anime ini bagus, tapi tidak luar biasa. Musiknya enak didengar, dan lagu pembukanya seperti permen telinga. Itu adalah jenis lagu yang terus terpikirkan, tapi tidak apa-apa karena sangat mudah diingat.Jadi, bagaimana kesimpulannya? Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai mendapat skor 7,3/10. Ini bukan anime terbaik di luar sana, tapi bukan yang terburuk juga.

I'll give it credit where it's due, the art style is nice, and it's animated decently.sound: 3/10.

I've never wanted to strangle a fictional child so badly.enjoyment: 2/10. it wasn't really funny to me. it was all just either sexualizing the underage cast or the girls fighting with each other. it got boring and repetitive really fast. I was uncomfortable most of the time. apparently it has an ova and a second season, but with how bad haganai was, I don't think I'll be missing out on much if I skip it. maybe I'll watch it someday if I have literally nothing else to do.overall: 3/10.

We\'ve got here some okayish characters with a potential (Yozora, Sena), some boring characters (MC, Yukimura), and some really fun characters — most notably Rika and Kobato (and maybe Maria, but well).However, during the second half I got so bored with the plot and everything that I can\'t even put it in words. Every episode feels like an iteration of the first five, and MCs don\'t develop at all. For example, Yozora: interesting background, A LOT OF potential for romance, but all she does is picking on Sena. Maybe she will change in the...end of the season (at least a bit???) when **** happens? No, literally nothing changes.Sena, on the other hand, turns out to be suprisingly nice and has some kind of side-story with MC that is not bad, I guess. Nevertheless, she doesn\'t really change anything.And that ""nothing really changes"" is like the moto of the anime/ln/manga/whatever.PS Don\'t look up the ending of the light novel if you liked the manga, it\'ll probably destroy you or something. For me it was like ""what the heck how is this even a thing""3 wasted hours out of 10 rika\'s jokes end of the season (at least a bit???) when **** happens?

Kodaka and Yozora start a club in order to make friends. The fact the no one wants to be friends with Kodaka because his hair is yellow and makes him look like a thug is ridiculous. Yozora is a freaking bully. It's hard to feel sad for her because she treats Sena like shit. I felt so bad for Sena. You can't help but feel bad for Sena. Kodaka is a little bitch for not helping Sena when Yozora attacks her. He complains to Yozora and...tell every time that she wrong for she's doing. Yet he stands there all the time and does shit. Kodaka later finds out that Yozora is his child good friend that he thought was a boy. When he finds out he not even shocked. That was just stupid.

I liked the idea of the club, the characters played off each other well enough, the art style is fetching, **SPOILER** and I loved the idea of them never realizing they were all actually friends... but as usual with harem anime, they have to sacrifice the story for a gaggle of cooing pixie-girls all fawning over the only guy around.

My review might become invalid with just that.I have heard these actors before. I have.

Initially, I thought this would be a slightly better version of Oregairu since the main character didn\'t seem like a wannabe edgelord. And while the MC in Haganai is much more tolerable, everything else fell short.Similar to Oregairu, it\'s a slice of life featuring a cast of socially incompetent (aka friendless), eccentric characters, that at its core is just a harem anime filled to the brim with unwarranted fan service. While Oregairu and Haganai have wonderful animation production and they both offer a promising coming of age story, both stories turned out to be placid melodramas...with insufferable characters.In Haganai, the three main characters are Kodaka, Yozora, and Sena. Kodoka being your run of the mill boring and vanilla male lead with his own harem despite having the personality of dried oatmeal. As for the other 2 characters, Yozora and Sena, they\'re Kodoka\'s main love interests (yup, a love triangle, who saw that one coming?) each one of these girls being a stereotype within a stereotype-- a sadistic tsundere and blonde bimbo with a big rack.As for the other characters, they\'re just more stereotypes: a girl obsessed with yaoi, the little sister trope played out with Kodoka\'s actual little sister AND some random 10-year old that just happens to casually hang out at the high school, and finally, a boy that crossdresses as a girl-- I mean how cliche can this get?But while cliches can be annoying, my main problem is with one character that single-handedly ruined the entire show for me. That character, being the one, the only biggest bitch out there: Yozora Mikazuki. To label her as a sadistic tsundere is an understatement-- she\'s just a bully with a pretty face. And using the word ""bully"" to describe her can\'t fully show the extremities of her awful behavior: she shits all over people, talks down to them, and emotionally and verbally abuses them outright-- and she suffers no consequences!! At first, you laugh because you think it\'s anime slapstick humor but as the show progresses, she gets worse and worse with no remorse or any desire to change (hell, she even says in the last episode or so that she likes who she is just fine). This mentality actually seems really contradictory to her expressed motivations: to make friends. That sentiment just seems like a cheap gimmick to get closer to Kodoka making her character even more shallow than intended.And the reason why I\'m so atrociously disappointed with Yozora\'s character is that at first, she reminded me a lot of Yukino Yukinoshita from Oregairu (ironically, the one character I really liked from Oregairu)-- from their almost identical character designs to initial first impressions (they\'re both the spitting image of one another). But unlike Yukino, who undergoes a subtle and mature character growth throughout the show, Yozora gets meaner and bitchier without having any reason for doing so (my guess is that the writers will pull a tragic backstory card with the typical ""I\'ve been treated like crap so now I treat others like crap"" bullshit). It just pisses me off because Yozora had the potential to become an interesting and likable character with a really great arc but at this point, she\'s just unredeemable.As for the plot, what plot? It\'s nonexistent. It\'s episodic (which only works if the characters compensate for the lack of story but we obviously know that\'s not the case here) that revolves around the Neighbors Club\'s club activities like trying karaoke or playing an RPG game or going to the pool/ beach (you bet the writers made the excuse to dedicate 2 full episodes for bikini shots).Overall, just skip this anime. It doesn\'t offer anything new or insightful or funny. The one thing I can praise it for doing well is the art. But compared to Oregairu or any anime from Kyoto Animation, it\'s nothing special in that department for you to suffer through 12 episodes for. with insufferable characters.In Haganai, the three main characters are Kodaka, Yozora, and Sena. Kodoka being your run of the mill boring and vanilla male lead with his own harem despite having the personality of dried oatmeal. As for the other 2 characters, Yozora and Sena, they\'re Kodoka\'s main love interests (yup, a love triangle, who saw that one coming?) each one of these girls being a stereotype within a stereotype-- a sadistic tsundere and blonde bimbo with a big rack.As for the other characters, they\'re just more stereotypes: a girl obsessed with yaoi, the little sister trope played out with Kodoka\'s actual little sister AND some random 10-year old that just happens to casually hang out at the high school, and finally, a boy that crossdresses as a girl-- I mean how cliche can this get?But while cliches can be annoying, my main problem is with one character that single-handedly ruined the entire show for me. That character, being the one, the only biggest bitch out there: Yozora Mikazuki. To label her as a sadistic tsundere is an understatement-- she\'s just a bully with a pretty face. And using the word ""bully"" to describe her can\'t fully show the extremities of her awful behavior: she shits all over people, talks down to them, and emotionally and verbally abuses them outright-- and she suffers no consequences!! At first, you laugh because you think it\'s anime slapstick humor but as the show progresses, she gets worse and worse with no remorse or any desire to change (hell, she even says in the last episode or so that she likes who she is just fine). This mentality actually seems really contradictory to her expressed motivations: to make friends. That sentiment just seems like a cheap gimmick to get closer to Kodoka making her character even more shallow than intended.And the reason why I\'m so atrociously disappointed with Yozora\'s character is that at first, she reminded me a lot of Yukino Yukinoshita from Oregairu (ironically, the one character I really liked from Oregairu)-- from their almost identical character designs to initial first impressions (they\'re both the spitting image of one another). But unlike Yukino, who undergoes a subtle and mature character growth throughout the show, Yozora gets meaner and bitchier without having any reason for doing so (my guess is that the writers will pull a tragic backstory card with the typical ""I\'ve been treated like crap so now I treat others like crap"" bullshit). It just pisses me off because Yozora had the potential to become an interesting and likable character with a really great arc but at this point, she\'s just unredeemable.As for the plot, what plot? It\'s nonexistent. It\'s episodic (which only works if the characters compensate for the lack of story but we obviously know that\'s not the case here) that revolves around the Neighbors Club\'s club activities like trying karaoke or playing an RPG game or going to the pool/ beach (you bet the writers made the excuse to dedicate 2 full episodes for bikini shots).Overall, just skip this anime.

Show goes through the cliches one by one, and eventually reaches its very predictable ending. It serves as an adequate watch in-between 2 actually artistically driven series, to keep your standards lower.Really dislike the two main girls here. Yozora portrays more emotion and interesting character within the first 5 minutes of the first episode than she does from there until the ending combined. She is just there to insult Sona and assert her moral superiority over the other just as one-dimensional girls. Sona is also very irritating; an entitled, very sensitive girl with the preferred look for your avid anime...fan (big tits and ass, long blonde hair, blue eyes). All she has to her is to keep Yozora somehow within the diluted plot, by being a punching bag for a better written character by a miniscule amount. Kobato is alright and I really like her voice, the high pitched kids voices are really starting to get on my nerves. Gotta have one very out-of-touch character in every anime ever made. Maria is really annoying and just pure moe, Rika is the one recurring character trope I hate the most in all of anime, the nerdy girl who is secretly SUPER sexual and perverted, how wacky and original right?Seeing naked children doesn't sit right with me. The nude scenes weren't sexualized further so I won't take away score for that. Just beware if you like me for some reason weren't expecting such from this show.The main character is relatively good on the other hand. Unlike with most slice of life/ecchi/softcore (whatever you call it it's been a while since I watched Mt last show) anime MC's, Kodaka doesn't react to every sexual, weird or creepy comment or gesture like someone who has never seen an exposed shoulder before. His character, although rather slowly, does actually go through some miniscule development as the series progresses. Doesn't mean he isn't just as one dimensional, though. Most of the time Kodoka acts accordingly to whatever he is presented with, like a real person actually would to the situations he is in. Despite all this he is still one of those weaker kind of MC's. Throughout the series it's clearly always about which of the girls is the most competent at something, not Kodoka. The girls constantly mock him for whatever reason as well. The backstory is super generic and not fully fleshed out either.Character designs are decent, of course the main two girls being easily the most visually pleasing, and the rest of them just kinda being there to truly elevate Yozora and Suna and for them to stand out in the viewers eyes. Everything else is bland from a visual standpoint. You could just search up anime ____ (residence, school, park) and end up with nearly identical settings as what you get here.If you like to see a lot of fanservice and naked loli scenes but don't care for plot, writing, character traits/personality, this is the show for you. And I suppose this makes up 50% of all anime fans so there definitely is an audience. fan (big tits and ass, long blonde hair, blue eyes).

Date A Live,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15583/Date_A_Live,"['Boobs, explosions and cute girls are a time-tested formula. Apparently.If there is one that has remained true about the anime industry, it is that cheap entertainment and low-risk adaptations prevail. AIC\'s ""Date A Live"" is yet another addition to this tired trend- doing nothing interesting or even particularly well. It expects the audience to willfully ignore its poor writing, because hey-- there are cute girls to gawk at!Drawing inspiration from the 2008 manga ""Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai"", Date A Live presents itself as a pseudo-parody of otaku culture. After our protagonist Shidou conveniently encounters two busty ladies fighting one another, he finds...himself waking in the headquarters of an anti-Spirit organization, which (surprise!) is led by his bipolar younger sister. Kirino-- sorry, Kotori, proposes her master plan to Shidou: prevent the Spirits\' destruction by making them fall in love with him. How is he meant to achieve this? By studying dating sims, of course.Funnily enough, this ridiculous premise is actually one of Date A Live\'s few redeeming points. It is self-aware and (usually) does not attempt to be anything more than silly fun. Some of the best moments are when Shidou attempts to swoon the girls with cliched eroge lines, only to be met by awkward silence and/or violent threats. It is a show that prides itself in absurdity. Mostly. At other times it is just woefully stupid.And that is the problem. Date A Live, in all of its wisdom, also tries to push a semi-serious \'plot\' amidst its comedy. A plot so riddled with lazy writing and insufferable cliches that the anime becomes the very thing that is parodying. Transfer students, toast-in-mouth, and the beloved walk-in-on-clearly-occupied-bathroom cliche? Check. Girls falling in love with Shidou for no conceivable reason except to increase the size of his harem? You bet. Deus ex machina? The third episode contains two within minutes of each other. There is even a scene in the anime where the Anti-Spirit Team-- which for some inexplicable reason is comprised entirely of busty, half-naked high school girls-- gets tentacle raped by ramen. Yes, ramen. Full stop. I will leave that to your consideration.Shidou himself does not do the writing any favors. If there is a problem, he will preach it away- almost always with a few jejune words about self-sacrifice or how his victim simply isn\'t happy enough. If he is hurt, he will be magically healed through some convenient plot device. He doesn\'t need to fight or do anything remotely intelligent, because why the hell would he? He has plot armor to save the day. Date A Live is not concerned about petty notions such as \'sense\'.Writing aside, you will indubitably gain some enjoyment from the \'cute girls\' appeal. And cute they are. Tsunako\'s character designs (most easily recognized through her work on the Hyperdimension Neptunia franchise) adds a level of appeal uncommon to most harem anime. Kurumi\'s design, for example, is one of the most attractive in anime or manga- no hyperbole intended. Their personalities are also equally adorable (though often limited to archetypes) with characters like Tohka frequently finding ways to get your heart racing. If Date A Live were to be judged solely by the cuteness of its female cast, it would be a work of art. But it is not.It shouldn\'t come as much of a surprise given the designs, but Date A Live\'s artwork is for the most part high-quality. Characters are rendered in a consistent manner and the colorful art design tends to make up for any imperfections that the animation occasionally has. It is certainly a step down from the original light novel illustrations, though.The sound also does not disappoint. It\'s almost a little saddening, even, knowing that such quality was expended on a show of this caliber. The background tracks are excellent, as is the cast of seiyuu (who do a skillful job of delivering personality to each girl) while even the catchy opening and ending sequences manage to stand out. It should be noted though that the ending sequences are supremely lazy from an animation standpoint, usually containing a single image that is panned over continuously until the song ends. Surely more effort could have been put there.All in all, Date A Live is an absolute mess of a story-- but a disturbingly entertaining one. It is something to be watched-- maybe enjoyed-- and then immediately forgotten (assuming the writing does not give you an aneurysm). It represents precisely why an anime cannot survive on cuteness alone. Tohka does come close to saving the show, though. Almost.If you are the kind of viewer that cares not for critical quality, then perhaps the girls will be enough to keep you entertained. For everybody else, and especially those already revolted by the harem genre, make sure to keep a few bandages handy. You might need them after hitting your head against the wall. himself waking in the headquarters of an anti-Spirit organization, which (surprise!) is led by his bipolar younger sister.

You might need them after hitting your head against the wall.', ""Date a Live: a series where a protagonist works to defeat invading entities... by dating them. From this description alone, you the viewer should hopefully have realized that this is a parody series - specifically parodying mecha series such as Evangelion, Gundam and Muv Luv, and replacing the invading force with cute girls.This may sound absurd, perhaps even trite - but here's the catch - it's actually incredibly fun. If you've watched (or read) some of the aforementioned mecha series, you should at least find amusement in how the mecha genre is respectfully made fun of; couple to that a great ensemble of characters who...deliver various amusing lines throughout episodes, the result is a show which should keep you laughing throughout its duration.At the centre of the series is the protagonist Itsuka Shidou who is tasked with the aforementioned role of dating invading entities. This of course leads to him quickly developing a harem of various diverse personalities, for which Shidou has his own personal radio-based command centre assisting him from afar - there is no such thing as going too far in Date a Live. As mentioned above, the characters in this are variously fantastic in different ways: thus there is much to like in the various harem members; Shidou himself is a decent harem lead, tackling things head on and taking care of his harem (which is more than can be said for most harem protagonists).Behind the parody, comedy and harem aspects there is also a serious story about the invading entities causing mass devastation and killing millions of people. To counteract this there is (within the confined area depicted) an Anti-Spirit Team consisting of mecha-suited girls who are armed to the teeth with various weapons. This aspect gives Date a Live some nicely choreographed battle sequences, and helps to further along its lively pacing. Whilst this side of the story provides serious undertones, they seldom undermine the generally lighthearted disposition of the episodes.The artwork for the series is particularly nice, with cute character designs that move fluidly when required; characters are also amusingly expressive in accordance with their personalities. I can't think of any instances where the animation fell off-model, which is impressive considering just how much detail is drawn on to each character - sure, this may not be KyoAni levels of detail, but it's nice to see nonetheless.Overall, this is an entertaining show that applies a different twist to the harem genre and doesn't take itself at all seriously. It's well worth a watch if you can enjoy that sort of thing. deliver various amusing lines throughout episodes, the result is a show which should keep you laughing throughout its duration.At the centre of the series is the protagonist Itsuka Shidou who is tasked with the aforementioned role of dating invading entities.

I will try to see both sides of the fence because when i talk to people about Date A Live, they either think the show is a work of art, or they this its a complete mess. I am on the side where I think it\'s a work of art but I will try to not be bias.------------------------------------------------------------Date A Live, or DAL for short, is a show about spirits invading our world and creating spacequakes upon entering our world that kills thousands of people. These spirits are dangerous entities and we do not know much about...them. It\'s up to our main man Shidou to stop these invasions by dating them. Yes, dating them. Now, when I first learned of what the show is about, I thought it was kind of interesting... and stupid. It\'s a unique idea for a show, albeit stupid, it is unique.Story - The story is about our harem lead, Shidou, dating the many spirits that invade the earth. To save the people of the earth, it is up to him to date these spirit girls and get them to fall in love with him. While this is going on, there is an anti-spirit team (all girls, of course) and there job is to search and destroy the spirits. As absurd and unique this show sounds, some might think this is a recipe for a disaster, but it’s actually incredibly entertaining. The whole plot is mainly for the entertaining fight scenes, between the spirits and the anti-spirit team, and the several comedic scenes between Shidou and the several spirits that accompany him. They tried to establish a plot half way through the show but it\'s almost like the creators of DAL just threw their papers in the air and was like ""fuck this shit; we\'ll leave it for season 2"". No, I\'m serious... That’s pretty much what they did.Summary: If you think too hard on the plot aspect of DAL your brain will melt. But, if you are watching it purely for the entertainment factor, you can look past the enormous amounts of plot holes and look at DAL for what it is... and entertaining show.Art - The art style and animations are beautiful to look at. If there is one thing DAL does great its the animations. There were no derp faces, the fight scenes looked crisp, the backgrounds were well done, everything about was done to a tee. The character designs were also very well done. You could tell the creators of DAL put a lot of effort into the art and they didn’t skip a beat. Hats off to them they made the show LOOK good.Sound - Soundtrack is another category DAL excels at. The BGM fit almost every scene and really brought the most out of each scene. The OP is one of my favorite songs to date and the ED isn\'t half bad itself. The voice actors fit each character really well. Especially Kurumi... her voice was great and fit the character perfectly. All in all, the soundtrack as a whole was really well done and does not disappoint.Characters - You can look at the characters for DAL one of two ways. One way is that pretty much every character has almost no backstory and isn’t well devolved. They aren’t very unique as each of them are either the token Tsundere character, or the crazy girl etc.. Or, you can look at it as they are cute anime girls that are funny and entertaining in their each own way. Each girl is cute in their own way, each girl has a great voice actor that fits the character well, and each girl is different enough so that everyone has a different favorite. They are fun; enjoyable characters and each have a different view point on each situation. Albeit while they might not be very flushed out, they do the job. Last but not least, we have Shidou, the main lead and (really the only male character that matters) the one who has the duty of saving these spirits. All I can say about him is that he’s not shit. That is apparently a lot to ask for in these harem type animes. Thankfully, he’s not as bad as most harem leads and in fact he’s pretty good himself. Shidou was probably the biggest surprise out of every character in the show as he didn’t suck.Overall - If you critically look at DAL and try to pick it apart asking yourself ""well, does this show have a good plot? Were the characters good and have deep, meaningful backstories? Does the show have a great soundtrack? Are the animations up to snuff?” you\'re in for a bad time. The plot on a whole is a mess, and the characters really aren’t that great if you look at the big picture. But if you are like me and just watch DAL for what it is, a fun and enjoyable anime, then the show is great.If you are a critic of every anime you watch, DAL might not be the anime for you. But, if you watch an anime for cute girls, cool fights, entertaining comedy, and just plain don\'t care about plot holes and such, DAL is a must watch. them.

Really, the plot is actually intriguing.It may just be because this year of anime has been incredibly awful and has led me to believe that every single action anime producer...is scared to go up against attack on titan, but why lie... when you get passed attack on titan, this anime ranks among the top. On top of that there is a catchy opening and the music featured in the anime is actually pretty good.Rating for Characters: 8Look i wont lie, many of the characters are actually intriguing.

Wow did they do great.Rating for Story and Enjoyment: 10This is not your stereotypical fanservice. There is a plot with back story and there is action. The action is perfectly written. Yeah i do wish a character would actually die for once but other than that i have no complaints. It is a very entertaining 24 minutes watching this.Overall: 9Say what you want to say, but I enjoyed this.

He gets more than what he ever hoped because on a faithful day, he meets a strange girl who completely turns his life into one hell of a ride.Yup, the ride begins here and Date a Live takes the concept of \'dating\' to a strange level. It\'s no...surprise though as the anime industry seems to be often seeking new ways to present the harem/romantic comedy genre. Date a Live is a Japanese light novel series written by Tachibana Koushi with illustrations by Tsunako. There\'s also a manga version of the series but let\'s cut to the chase of the anime adaptation rather, shall we?Date a Live is a series and some may imply is about \'dating\'. That part of the concept is correct because it\'s up to the main male protagonist of the series, Shido Itsuka, to save the world by making certain characters fall in love with him! The series literally takes the concept of a dating sim and transforms it (at it least tries to) into an animated medium. That\'s a lot easier said than done though to be honest especially since the majority of the characters in the series are not so normal. Take for example, Tohka Yatogami (code name: Princess) who came to Earth unexpectedly. She tries to follow the way of the world but lacks common sense. Even with her huge appetite and elite fighting skills, she often behaves like a child and acts immaturely during many situations. However, Tohka does have a cute and adorable side to her and wishes to protect what she treasures. These include the feelings of others as well as the people she has met.Among other characters, the series clearly follows the path of a bit of harem theme. This is shown in the form of another girl (Origami Tobiichi) that Shido attends high school with. To make things more bizarre is that she also seems to have not only have a secret but literally stalks Shido at every corner. For unknown reasons, she seems to have a connection with Shido and declares him as her “lover”. At the same time, her actions often speaks louder than words as she is very direct with her affections which often puts Tohka at frustration when it comes to Shido. In general, Origami is a girl of peculiarity and mystery that surrounds her character throughout each episode.Speaking of mysteries, there\'s definitely some in this series here and there. For one thing, Shido has a mysterious power and that itself is a mystery. Furthermore, the method to seal the deal with the spirits throughout the series is through a contact with the lips. However, at the same time, there\'s questions regarding how this is power is manifested.As mentioned before, the series is titled “Date a Live”. The \'date\' is the keyword here because to seal a spirit, one must make them fall in love with the protagonist. The dating sim part comes into play here as Shido is “trained” by his superiors in order to achieve their goals. The organization known as  Ratatoskr practices dating simulations and gives advise to Shido in order to make the spirits fall in love with him. These often ends up with mixed results.It also seems that at many instances, Shido doesn\'t want to get involved with the whole dating process and is forced directly into it by his superiors. In fact, there\'s no true evidence showing Shido showing any real romantic affections towards any of the spirits he has encountered. Needless to say, he is in a world where he just wants to get the job done and move on with his once peaceful life.The series itself is consisted of only 12 episodes. Going by the phase of the light novel, that leaves only about 3 episodes per \'arc\' for each Spirit. This can spell out a pacing problem with the usual \'things that should have been there but are not\'. However, the series makes some big mistakes in this case as there are instances of fillers as well as cases where an episode has almost absolutely no value to progressing the main storyline. To make things as typical as they seem to be from this romantic comedy/harem, the common usage of fan service is employed in the form of bare skin and gratuitous outfits. These outfits are reflected in the battle gear that the military uses to combat the spirits throughout the series.The fan service doesn\'t seem to stop there though. Even from the first few minutes of the anime, the series takes off with the panty shots and an annoying voice coming from a certain \'little sister\'. Then, there\'s the characters\' designs. Tohka\'s school uniform is generic but Origami\'s military battle suits takes it to another level with its designs showing the suggestive parts. The other spirits are also dressed strangely although it does bring out a colorful background to their characters. Still, it is generic with their different colored hair. Despite them all being spirits, I can hardly take the series serious sometimes with the whole dating concept. The development between Shido and most of the spirits are also cliched and hardly any meaningful if at all. I don\'t sense a real sense of connection or build up but rather as a dating sim game. The dating concept itself is also weak with the lame pickup lines that lakes any flavor. It\'s hardly any humorous at times and often misused according to the whole concept itself.Luckily, there\'s still the action presented by the members of the military. The gadgets they use are as deadly as it looks and packs some devastating firepower. It shows that the military are serious about their tasks of dealing with the Spirits. It is because they hope to contain them should Shido fail in his quest. The spirits themselves are also damn powerful. Some of them proves to be more than a match and it seems that Shido is the only backbone to save humanity. It\'s the whole \'save the world\' concept again but with the twist of dating.Oh and speaking of dating, there\'s definitely some of that where it comes from. It\'s quite awkward though because by the way of things, Shido doesn\'t seem to have an ounce of dating experience prior to meeting the spirits. He often takes actions from “advise” from the military and Kotori, Shido\'s superior. These create awkward situations. Along with the misunderstandings, Date a Live continuously falls under the common cliched anime of the romantic harem genre. It\'s complete with the transfer student, the cute little sister, the nice guy, and of course dating.In terms of soundtrack, I have to admit that Date a Live did pull off a magic out of its hat. ""Date A Live “ by sweet ARMS has an electronic rhythm and gets the point across quickly. One can even see some action in the scenes along with the spirits who are soon to debut. It\'s colorful in the sense that the OST also depicts comedy, drama, romance, action, and emotional moments. Furthermore, there are many different ED songs to the series giving the viewers a variety to enjoy.The artwork of the series is mediocre though. The outfits that the characters dress whether in combat or at school is generic and suggestive. It doesn\'t help by the fact that some of those outfits are little more than a reflection of the characters. Although colorful and distinguishing, it still remains barely tolerable with the way spirits should be. It\'s almost difficult to take it serious at times especially when there are \'gory\' scenes out in the open but the artwork makes it seem like romantic comedy.In general, Date a Live is just another series that takes the theme of science fiction and then mixes it it with some new twists like the dating sim concept. It\'s a fun theme to embrace but can hardly to be taken serious to heart at all. The whole concept itself is weak with the development and rushed sequences. Having read the LN, the pace of the series also seems to fall apart. The catch here is more than just a simple kiss. Rather, Date a Live just tries too hard and make it almost too unbelievable for its presentation. In the end, there are several choices that viewers can choose if they decide to watch this:1) For fun and pass time2) The concept/premise3) Storyline4) None of the above but rather just go with the flowIf option #4 was your choice, then just do what it says. Go with the flow and turn your brains off while hoping to enjoy the series. surprise though as the anime industry seems to be often seeking new ways to present the harem/romantic comedy genre.

It is focused on a protagonist, Itsuka Shidou, as he race against time to save cute spirits invading the Earth by dating them. A really unique comdy, harem, love comedy in my opinion.The story is a 10. Again, there aren\'t anything else out there like Date a Live. There were things in the anime I didn\'t expect to happen and I don\'t mean it in a bad way.The art is a 10. It really depends what you\'re used to watching in order to calculate the art score right. To me, this anime...has some fantastic arts due to Mrs Tsunako. The same artist who designed the game and another series. Chou Jigen.The sound is a 10 also. The fact that I never got tired of the opening proved to me that sweetARMS earned themselves a 10. The background music fitted the situations really well during the actual anime as well.Character was a 10. Koushi Tachibana did a great job developing the different varieties of characters in this series as well as their own behaviour and color themes. I\'d love to talk more about each characters and my wife. But spoilers lol.Enjoyment................Hmmmmmmmmmmmm 10. I watched all 10 episodes non-stop. Though it sounds bad, I didn\'t leave my room at all during these 5 hours. It was very enjoyable for me. An instant ""Add to Favorites"" for me.Overall, it was great that they adapted this to anime and a game. I\'m personally getting them game but anyways, very good anime. A 10 and Favorite is the best I can do on this site but if you come into my room. Yeah you\'ll feel me then. Bye guys, Tohka is hungry again. has some fantastic arts due to Mrs Tsunako.

Bye guys, Tohka is hungry again.', 'If you were looking for an harem, love comedy anime, voila Date A Live is the anime to watch.But hold on, this anime is not only a typical cliché love comedy, but quite full of action and for some people, can be thought of as a bit bloody(?).Itsuka Shido, the male protagonist, basically tries to save several extraterrestrial beings called ""Spirits"" by getting the spirits to accept (love) him and to do so, he goes on a ""Date"" with each and one of them; a typical galge story line. Up to now, it sound a love comedy, but here is what makes this anime called...Date ""A Live"". Spirits, when they appear in Earth causes a mass-area destruction, called spacequake, which can be big or small, but either way cause many casualties and more importantly, deaths. Even with spacequakes they are dangerous, but these Spirits have their personal weapon(s) and armor, called Angel and Astral Dress, which differs from Spirits to Spirits, but the fact is, it is ""quite"" dangerous. Itsuka Shido has to deal with not only one, but several of them, so good luck to our dear protagonist.There is broadly three different divisions in this story. Ratatoskr, an organization founded in order to solve issues with Spirits and spacequakes through peaceful means (Dating). The organization is place in a floating arial ship called Fraxinus and from this ship, Shido gets assistance of how to increase the spirits\' love parameter towards him (galge). AST(Anti-Spirits Team) is a special unit within Japan Self-Defense Force (Japan\'s Army) that uses military power to eliminate Spirits. Even with advanced technological weapons and equipments, however, the damage that they give to spirits is little. Finally, there is DEM (Deus Ex Machina) Industries, which is the one of the largest corporations in the world, which creates and develops weapons to go against the Spirits. They are rivals with Ratatoskr. AST utilizes the weapons created by DEM.Character explanationsItsuka Shido - male protagonist of the story. When young, he lost his memories, and the Itsuka family brought him in. Shido, because of being the only outsider of the family, lived a hikikomori life, full of despair, which made him able to observe other people\'s despair and sadness when looking at them. When he saw the first spirit, Tohka, he saw the despair within her, which made his determination of saving Spirits.Yatogami Tohka - First Spirit that appears in the story. She was referred to as a ""Princess"" until Shido names her Tohka, just because the day that first encountered was April 10th (10th when read in Japanese is pronounced as ""tohka""). In the beginning, she appears in her Astral Dress, firm and dignified, like a noble person. At first, she is skeptical and hostile towards Shido because when Tohka first appeared in Earth, she as attacked by AST. However, after Shido makes her fall in love with him, Tohka\'s personality somewhat changes into that of a loyal puppy. Her Angel(weapon) is called Sandalphon which is in a form of boardsword, but usually even without it, she can inflict quite a damage.Tobiichi Origami - A member of AST, who has a inhuman hostility towards Spirits due to lost of her parents from a spacequake when young. She is not a very talkative person with cold personality but not with Shido. She is self-proclaimed lover (stalker) of Shido. Origami says that she as known Shido for a long time, but Shido doesn\'t remembers.Itsuka Kotori - Foster sister of Shido, who is a human that earn the power of a Spirit. Kotori is the leader of Ratatoskr, supporting Shido with his date with Spirits. When she is wearing a Black Ribbon, her personality is a ""tsun""; when wearing a ""White"" Ribbon, her personality is a ""dere."" All together, Itsuka Kotori is a Tsundere. There you go, end of explanation of her. Her Angel is called Camael, a battle-axe that is capable of changing shape to a cannon.Yoshino/Yoshinon - Don\'t get confused, they are two different characters. Yoshino is the second Spirit that Shido meets and saves. She is referred as ""Hermit"" by the AST. Yoshino is the most nonaggressive Spirit that even when she is attacked by AST, she won\'t fight back. She is shy and VERY shy. Yoshinon is a rabbit hand puppet that Yoshino has on her left hand. Yoshino says that Yoshinon is her ""ideal""; Yoshinon is complete opposite of Yoshino as in personality, which is why Yoshino admires this little puppet. Yoshino, however, when told that Yoshinon is a puppet and, especially loses Yoshinon, becomes ferocious and completely changes. Her Angel is Zadkiel, a giant rabbit that Yoshino summons and controls with her right hand. It breathes out freezing air that is capable of freezing the AST members. She is THE cuteness, period.Tokisaki Kurumi - Third spirit that appears in the story, and the most brutal Spirit. Kurumi, without the spacequake, solely killed over 10,000 humans, and with her gothic lolita appearance, is called the ""Nightmare."" As can be inferred from her name, Tokisaki (time, bloom), she is able to control time. Her left eye has a clock face, with the clock hands moving in the opposite direction, representing her life. She suddenly appears in front of Shido by transferring into his school, and showing her interest to him. She is quite bold with her action, which causes Shido to be bewildered during his ""mission."" Mana repeatedly kills Kurumi, but fails due to Kurumi\'s Angel, Zafkiel\'s ability to control time.Takamiya Mana - A temporary second lieutenant of AST, she works for DEM Industries. She is revealed to be the real sister of Shido, except the only proof she has is that she doesn\'t have any memories of past, just like Shido, and possesses a pendant with a picture showing a young boy and her standing close together. Her appearance is somewhat like the female version of Shido. She is renown for ""killing"" the Spirit.There are many other characters that I haven\'t talked but these are the major characters that came up so far (ep 8). If I get into seiyuus, this is going to be too long, so for the seiyuu, let me say only one thing, Thank you for having Taketatsu Ayana voice act for Itsuka Kotori. Sweet Arms sung the opening theme ""Date A Live"" which when listening to the lyrics, you might be able to catch the basic flow of the story. The ending theme changes from episodes to episodes so that could be a point of enjoyment to watch to, but the best moment of the show is where the narrator in the beginning giving a brief preview of each episodes.Overall, if you want to see a school battle love comedy show, Date A Live is what you would consider watching.ps.

Yoshino, the Best.', ""MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSDate a Live, definitely an interesting series, and does take a unique spin on the harem/dating theme.Please keep in mind that this is my own personal opinion and whether you choose to think I'm an idiot or not is up to you.Now returning to the anime, I haven't read the light novel to Date a Live, but I usually just watch the anime or read the manga series if I found the anime interesting. The one thing that did keep me hooked onto this series had to be the way they spun a new way to the aliens to earth/ in this...case magical spirits each containing their own specific type of power.The Story: I'll have to say one thing, they better air a second series or I'm going to be one pissed new fan, this is caused by the amount of story lines they left hanging and the still missing background info on the fire spirit that turns Kotori (Shido the main character's non blood related little sister, into one of the spirits that seem to torture Japan, but in reality are just lost entities with no memory or purpose). Other than the missing plot continuations of several possible character developments, the story was one of the main reasons I kept into the series, although it seems as if they tried to end this series on its 12th episode and rushed the ending SIGNIFICANTLY, the plot twists they provided were sufficient to the unique hold it had on the whole harem/dating to save Japan kind of thing.The Art and Sound: I haven't found an anime series yet that I have to complain about the art and the sound. Being a new 2013 released anime the picture and animation looked great along with a soundtrack to compliment the scenes sufficiently.The Characters: The main character Itsuka Shido is a combination of an innocent, kind, caring, and savior type of character during the series which contributes to him winning over a few spirits and humans to add to the harem theme. Other supporting characters which play standard roles in the harem theme include Yoshino, the shy, quiet, kind of lolicon aspect who has powers relating to h2o. Yatogami Tohka who contributes as the main girl as which the main character will likely end up with but a easily embarrassed,jealous, supporting, lacks common sense, is very pretty and can eat like Goku. (find this helpful if you got that reference). Now Tobiichi Origami is an interesting type of character, working for the enemy of the spirits, known as the AST,  she doesn't fail to be attracted to Shido in the pushy,get her way type, but when it comes down to her purpose of life, nothing else could matter. Origami may be the most peculiar character in the series, beside Kurumi who can control time. Since Kurumi is a big part of the arc and its ending I will leave out her description, however she is one of the major factors along with Shido, Kotori, and Takamiya Mana's lack of memory of the past. Takamiya Mana is supposedly Shido's biological sister but her only proof is an old pendant of the past, some possible character development and foreshadowing of major conflict and sadness is revealed but never resolved. (Another reason to hope for a season 2).Overall I enjoyed this series it provided a few chuckles, and some tasteful ecchi moments but not to the point where the female characters' boobs have a rave party at every moment,(Highschool of the Dead), and the unique dating harem aspect. I highly recommend watching this series if, you read the LN (which I still need to), and or you liked similar anime such as Angel Beats!, or Sekirei, the To Love Ru series and Sora No Otoshimono (Forte). They fill the time well and the episodes aren't full of too much filler, with some comedy on the side you'll blitz through all 12 episodes in a few hours without knowing it. It's a definite good series and worth watching, the only fault I find it with is the change of pace in the plot development, and the possibility of not having a second season xD.Thanks for reading! case magical spirits each containing their own specific type of power.The Story: I'll have to say one thing, they better air a second series or I'm going to be one pissed new fan, this is caused by the amount of story lines they left hanging and the still missing background info on the fire spirit that turns Kotori (Shido the main character's non blood related little sister, into one of the spirits that seem to torture Japan, but in reality are just lost entities with no memory or purpose). Other than the missing plot continuations of several possible character developments, the story was one of the main reasons I kept into the series, although it seems as if they tried to end this series on its 12th episode and rushed the ending SIGNIFICANTLY, the plot twists they provided were sufficient to the unique hold it had on the whole harem/dating to save Japan kind of thing.The Art and Sound: I haven't found an anime series yet that I have to complain about the art and the sound. Being a new 2013 released anime the picture and animation looked great along with a soundtrack to compliment the scenes sufficiently.The Characters: The main character Itsuka Shido is a combination of an innocent, kind, caring, and savior type of character during the series which contributes to him winning over a few spirits and humans to add to the harem theme. Other supporting characters which play standard roles in the harem theme include Yoshino, the shy, quiet, kind of lolicon aspect who has powers relating to h2o. Yatogami Tohka who contributes as the main girl as which the main character will likely end up with but a easily embarrassed,jealous, supporting, lacks common sense, is very pretty and can eat like Goku. (find this helpful if you got that reference). Now Tobiichi Origami is an interesting type of character, working for the enemy of the spirits, known as the AST,  she doesn't fail to be attracted to Shido in the pushy,get her way type, but when it comes down to her purpose of life, nothing else could matter. Origami may be the most peculiar character in the series, beside Kurumi who can control time. Since Kurumi is a big part of the arc and its ending I will leave out her description, however she is one of the major factors along with Shido, Kotori, and Takamiya Mana's lack of memory of the past. Takamiya Mana is supposedly Shido's biological sister but her only proof is an old pendant of the past, some possible character development and foreshadowing of major conflict and sadness is revealed but never resolved.

It is possible that they will answer it in the second season if there is any.The art is great, the character illustration is realistic and well drawn.

A tsundere \' Princess \', a kuudere \'doll-like\' human, a dandere \' Hermit\' with another personality , a sister or rather foster sister who also has a split personality, a yangire, the most brutal spirit \' Nightmare\' ( I just love using their codenames ) and finally the dense protagonist who helps anyone in trouble thereby making...all the girls fall for him.... now that\'s what you call NEW..or notRecently anime these days focuses on this type of storyline because they think that they would acquire a lot of viewers, especially guys, by watching this type of anime....

With that in mind, many people conclude that shows like Date A Live are why anime has gone downhill in recent years because it has officially run out of ideas on what to do with any story. It doesn’t matter how well they tell it, just how it entertains the masses. I find this thinking overly cynical and silly because this isn’t exactly a new way of thinking. For years, anime studios have put filler shows in season slots since...the beginning of anime; whether they were all bad or good is debatable by today’s standards. Nowadays, these harem shows are the best way to churn out these kinds of filler slots to appeal to the casual fan base who like to watch girls flaunt over one guy in comedic ways.The premise of Date a Live is a common trope of parody anime like The World God Only Knows, where one male character is sent on a mission to capture the hearts of girls around him. The only problem is that Date a Live doesn’t rely on parody or satire. It’s a straight-up action show with romance thrown in for good measure. I can describe this show by taking The World God Only Knows and ripping out most of the charm and wit that show had, and then you have Date a Live. It may seem unfair to say that these two shows are similar when they follow different genres. Still, they are identical in one particular area, which makes them indistinguishable from what I described earlier.With that said, is the show entertaining to watch regardless of this? Yes, it is. The one thing that I will commend Date a Live is the production value, and the artwork is gorgeous to see. It makes you marvel at the talent the animators have in giving us excellent eye candy even outside of action sequences. Even at a draw distance, the characters still look magnificent even by today’s standards.With the special praise gone out of the way, how does this show fair with its characters? The characters from their archetypes and personalities are mixed with elaborating this further. On the one hand, you have someone like Tohka, who is an absolute joy to watch because of her very energetic personality. On the other, Origami is very nicely detailed from her battle armor and humorous deadpan emotions. Many characters don’t give anything on the plate of depth or entertainment. You could call them cliches, but sometimes you can develop imaginative ways of providing cliched characters with good depth to them. Still, you hardly get any of that with Yoshino, Kurumi, or Kotori. They're in the show just because they’re there to get the plot going and nothing else. It doesn’t help the fact to make the story going when you put too many filler arcs that aren’t very entertaining in the first place.While I’m discussing the characters in Date A Live, Shido himself is a weak protagonist in the sense that there's absolutely nothing about him that makes him a well-rounded individual. He is nothing more than your average teenage boy who is friendly but doesn’t have the guts to ask any girl of the girls anything with a straight face. Yes, I know some real-life guys are like him. But in no single second did they give any strong trait that makes him indistinguishable from other protagonists in most harem shows. I know it’s not often you get protagonists such as Yokodera in Hentai Ouji or Tomoki from Sora no Otoshimono who are very strong in expressing their feelings, but is that asking too much?One major problem that needs to be said is the show's overall pacing, not only with the plot but also with the character progression. It seemed as though the writers wanted to rush out the essential steps that made great characters and didn’t bother to slow things down. These steps would make the girls understand Shido more instead of him just kissing the girls to make them head over heels for him. It is not uncommon to see anime adaptations of manga or Light Novels skip many things that the source material initially laid out. Still, it’s essential to realize that the best way is to cut the unimportant arcs in the original Light Novel. From what I can tell, being a person who never read the novel, they seemed to have rushed some plot arcs that seemed crucial in the Light Novel. Then there’s the ending that looked like a cop-out telling us, “Hey, there’s going to be a sequel! So you’re just going to have to deal with it!” At least that’s what I wished they should have said. At best, that could have been a little more amusing.In the sound department, the voice actors do an excellent job with their material. Marina Inoue as Tohka is a definite highlight out of everyone from the cast. From the sound of her voice, you can tell right away that she was having tons of fun voicing herself.In the current Spring season of 2013, I would say this is not a terrible show to sit through. I did have some decent fun with the great action scenes and charming comedy, for what little material they could come up with. With the 2nd season announced, I wouldn’t mind sitting through another season of this. Let us hope that they will learn from their mistakes and make it better than the first one.Grade: C+ the beginning of anime; whether they were all bad or good is debatable by today’s standards.

I was so intrigued with the first few minutes that I grew so disappointed when this anime shown me its true colors that I said and I quote, “Really? I feel so disappointed…” As a result, my sister who overheard me asked if I had a bad day at school and thought I was a freak for explaining why I said what I said. But Date A Live does have its merits...and it is actually very enjoyable in a way. The first few episodes may not have been as interesting but it gets better further into the story.The problem I had with Date A Live was the whole making the spirit fall in love with you. I mean really this is technically the whole plot in a nutshell; some random highschool dude has to use the power of love to save humanity from getting destroyed by spacequakes! As if the whole power of love nonsense hasn’t been used in anime enough times already; ludicrous I tell you ludicrous. If I wanted to hear about the importance of love I’ll watch some romance anime or even a Korean drama and if I wanted to learn about the importance of friendship than I’ll watch My Little Pony. But to tell you the truth, I just wanted to see the action, is that too much to ask for? Can’t I watch one action scene where the lesson of love does not knock on my door? Guess not. My last and only complaint for this anime so far, can’t the pickup lines be less cheesy? In order for Shido to make the spirits fall in love with him a team of love experts was formed to help with decision making or as The World God Only Knows may call it, which route to take. But these so called love experts are what I would describe to be merely as people who FAIL at love, I mean seriously one of these so called love experts was a guy who married and divorced five times! If I wanted a team of experts, I would have hired Katsuragi Keima the god of harems to teach these so called love experts a thing or two about how to get some love points from a decent girl.However, the one thing that I enjoyed the most about Date A Live was that it is still a better love story than Twilight (sorry couldn’t resist). What I liked the most was that the relationship development between the first spirit (named Tohka) and Shido didn’t feel so much as forced but had actually enough development between them to know that these two really do have feelings for each other. Their romance is not the best, but it’s acceptable and cute in a way. Another thing I enjoyed about the anime that it was pretty funny and to tell you the truth it made me laugh more than in actual comedy anime.Date A Live works like a dating sim, it focuses on different heroines every few episodes, but there will always be only one true heroine that will end up with our hero. Date A Live, however, is not far enough in the story currently to make conclusions on who ends up with who. But in a way, Date A Live is unique in a way compared to other anime built up like a dating sim because of the special extras included in it. These extras include the action, the mechas, and maybe some added science fiction. Because of these special added extras Date A Live definitely has a nice appeal going for it proving that this kind of anime does not have to be set in a cliché setting in order to get some proper romance and development in it.I will now commence in describing a few important characters in the story while adding a bit of my own personal opinion on each of them…Shido Itsuka, the main protagonist of Date A Live, he is a Keima Katsuragi in training.Tohka, the main heroine of the story, she was the first spirit saved by Shido, during the course of her arc she develops strong feelings for Shido. If anything were to happen to him, she will do anything to avenge him.Origami Tobiichi, intelligent classmate of Shido who is athletic, ""beautiful"", and the most famous person in his school, she is part of the AST (organization that is sent to destroy spirits) due to the death of her parents caused by spirits.Kotori Itsuka, Shido’s little sister, she is the commander of the organization Shido works for and harbors a split personality that changes depending on the situation. She goes from a sweet loving stereotypical little sister to a sadistic leader when her personality switches.Yoshino, the second spirit saved by Shido, she is extremely shy and uses a rabbit puppet named Yoshinon in order to communicate with others and to let out her true feelings.The opening song of Date A Live has to be one of my favorites its one of the only few anime openings that I won’t ever skip, the song was sung by sweet ARMS. There are two endings for the anime currently known as “SAVE THE WORLD” and “SAVE MY HEART” they are both relatively above average endings but not the best. The art for Date A Live is nothing special, it’s not the best and not the worse. The art does not have any special graphics or artistic effects like Bakemonogatari or ef- a tale of memories. But the art has fluid animation and great backgrounds and coloring so I’ll give it that.The first two episodes of Date A Live, I have to admit, made me almost want to drop the anime all together, but I’m glad I was able to give it one last chance. As the anime’s storyline got better I got used to the misconceptions it gave me at first, that the anime would primarily focus on romance and use its plot as backup, but overtime I learned that the plot was actually getting somewhere and all, I think. I would recommend this anime for people who greatly enjoy visual novel adaptations with a mix of action, fantasy, and much more. So far this anime isn’t what you’d rate a very good just yet in my opinion, but I feel that it will only get better in the future. and it is actually very enjoyable in a way.

So far this anime isn’t what you’d rate a very good just yet in my opinion, but I feel that it will only get better in the future.', '[This is a spoiler free review in case anyone is wondering.]It appears as if Date a Live seems to have been an anime I was recommended to by so many friends, yet when I looked at reviews, many of them were... negative. If figured I should go watch the anime myself and see how I feel. So without further wait, let\'s go.Story: (6/10)Admittedly, the story is where Date a Live fails the most at. It\'s not really anything original (then again it IS a parody anime) It takes on the life of this protagonist who has to date a bunch of magical girls...known as ""Spirits"" and make them fall in love with him in order to prevent them from getting killed by another organisation. Perhaps the only thing interesting about this plot is that the main character uses visual novels to train for this and during his dates he is faced with many options he can choose(again a reference to visual novels).With this you can see that it has its fair share of harem and of course, fan service. Now, I\'m generally not a big fan of harems (as I personally prefer the main character to focus on one person and I hate cheating *cough*School Days *cough*), but they can be quite good when they are done correctly or if they\'re not taken seriously. Sadly, DaL doesn\'t do that. It tackles the harem genre, yet attempts to keep a flow of seriousness between the relationships going which kinda ruins everything. For a bunch of episodes, you\'ve got the main character developing his relationship with the current girl, only for her to be thrown aside as a side character, replaced by a new girl. That seriousness isn\'t only in the romance however. No. For most part of the show, it keeps a light hearted mood and that\'s what it\'s good had. Keeping it cool and funny. But then you have moments were the show tries to be serious and you just want it to be over cause it\'s bad.Another major down point in the story is that events seem to happen just for the hell of it. Things just happen and characters do things without really having any reason behind it. Characters often don\'t have a proper backstory and if they do, the characters themselves don\'t remember it so you\'re left with nobody really knowing anything and just doing stuff solely to get the story moving. Of course some stuff does get explained at the very end, but I personally thought it took too long to explain them and still didn\'t block a lot of the plot holes you\'ll find by the end of the story. Ah well. Season 2 is coming up so we\'ll see.Art: (9/10)The Art of DaL is actually pretty good. Animation is smooth for most parts and the opening is a joy to watch. But perhaps what I really like about the art is the character designs. Each character (especially the girls in their spirit clothing) look stunning and original. They are filled with detail and fit their personalities so darn well. Very colourful. Then again the guy who designed them WAS apparently the same guy who designed the girls in Hyperdimension Neptunia and those girls looked beautiful too. Main character DOES look a bit plain but apart from that, everything looks nice.Fan Service is alright. I somewhat enjoy good delivered fan service so it was quite ok at some points.Sound: (7/10):Sound is alright I suppose. Though quite frankly, the only song that stood out and was a pleasure to hear was the Opening song which made me listen to it every time I watched an episode. Apart from that, nothing really stands out so if you want an anime with a lot of fitting tunes and perfectly orchestrated music, go watch Attack on Titan.Characters: (8/10)I kinda have mixed feelings for the characters. Almost all of them have their own unique personality that makes watching them interact with each other a hilarious experience, though again, that\'s when they\'re NOT trying to be serious. Of course some might argue that the main character is a bit too plain, which I wouldn\'t disagree with. Along with his dull look, he will come off as very normal and generic to some people. Personally, I found him alright.So yeah, when it comes to personality and design, characters look great. But oh boy, again, with their backstory. Like I said, half of them don\'t remember anything about their past, and those who do, won\'t say anything till the end. Some of them don\'t even bring up the topic of their past as if it doesn\'t even matter.Enjoyment: (9/10)Now here\'s where my personal opinion comes in. Despite the show\'s horrendous story flaws and other problems, I actually really enjoyed this show. This is mainly because it was just so funny and hilarious watching it. Like I said, when the story isn\'t taking itself seriously, it\'s so hilarious watching the main guy try to interact and deal with all the different girls, including your regular tsundere, emotionless but intelligent girl and loli.I wanted something funny and that\'s what I got... well for the most part anyway...Overall: ( 8/10)To make this short, Date a Live isn\'t the type of anyway you should watch if you\'re expecting something serious with deep plot elements cause it disappoints in that area. However, it\'s the type of show you can sit back to and laugh along with. It does a great job when trying to be funny and makes interactions a joy to watch.Think of DaL as a half-arsed knitted scarf your grandmother made for you. It\'s a bit uncomfortable but once you get used to it, it\'s actually pretty good. It\'s also silky smooth but don\'t look at it too closely cause you\'ll start seeing the holes. Peace out. known as ""Spirits"" and make them fall in love with him in order to prevent them from getting killed by another organisation. Perhaps the only thing interesting about this plot is that the main character uses visual novels to train for this and during his dates he is faced with many options he can choose(again a reference to visual novels).With this you can see that it has its fair share of harem and of course, fan service. Now, I\'m generally not a big fan of harems (as I personally prefer the main character to focus on one person and I hate cheating *cough*School Days *cough*), but they can be quite good when they are done correctly or if they\'re not taken seriously. Sadly, DaL doesn\'t do that. It tackles the harem genre, yet attempts to keep a flow of seriousness between the relationships going which kinda ruins everything. For a bunch of episodes, you\'ve got the main character developing his relationship with the current girl, only for her to be thrown aside as a side character, replaced by a new girl. That seriousness isn\'t only in the romance however. No. For most part of the show, it keeps a light hearted mood and that\'s what it\'s good had. Keeping it cool and funny. But then you have moments were the show tries to be serious and you just want it to be over cause it\'s bad.Another major down point in the story is that events seem to happen just for the hell of it. Things just happen and characters do things without really having any reason behind it. Characters often don\'t have a proper backstory and if they do, the characters themselves don\'t remember it so you\'re left with nobody really knowing anything and just doing stuff solely to get the story moving. Of course some stuff does get explained at the very end, but I personally thought it took too long to explain them and still didn\'t block a lot of the plot holes you\'ll find by the end of the story. Ah well. Season 2 is coming up so we\'ll see.Art: (9/10)The Art of DaL is actually pretty good. Animation is smooth for most parts and the opening is a joy to watch. But perhaps what I really like about the art is the character designs. Each character (especially the girls in their spirit clothing) look stunning and original. They are filled with detail and fit their personalities so darn well. Very colourful. Then again the guy who designed them WAS apparently the same guy who designed the girls in Hyperdimension Neptunia and those girls looked beautiful too. Main character DOES look a bit plain but apart from that, everything looks nice.Fan Service is alright. I somewhat enjoy good delivered fan service so it was quite ok at some points.Sound: (7/10):Sound is alright I suppose. Though quite frankly, the only song that stood out and was a pleasure to hear was the Opening song which made me listen to it every time I watched an episode. Apart from that, nothing really stands out so if you want an anime with a lot of fitting tunes and perfectly orchestrated music, go watch Attack on Titan.Characters: (8/10)I kinda have mixed feelings for the characters. Almost all of them have their own unique personality that makes watching them interact with each other a hilarious experience, though again, that\'s when they\'re NOT trying to be serious. Of course some might argue that the main character is a bit too plain, which I wouldn\'t disagree with. Along with his dull look, he will come off as very normal and generic to some people. Personally, I found him alright.So yeah, when it comes to personality and design, characters look great. But oh boy, again, with their backstory. Like I said, half of them don\'t remember anything about their past, and those who do, won\'t say anything till the end. Some of them don\'t even bring up the topic of their past as if it doesn\'t even matter.Enjoyment: (9/10)Now here\'s where my personal opinion comes in. Despite the show\'s horrendous story flaws and other problems, I actually really enjoyed this show. This is mainly because it was just so funny and hilarious watching it. Like I said, when the story isn\'t taking itself seriously, it\'s so hilarious watching the main guy try to interact and deal with all the different girls, including your regular tsundere, emotionless but intelligent girl and loli.I wanted something funny and that\'s what I got... well for the most part anyway...Overall: ( 8/10)To make this short, Date a Live isn\'t the type of anyway you should watch if you\'re expecting something serious with deep plot elements cause it disappoints in that area.

Peace out.', '- This is a Edited version after the show finished- This contains a small amount of SPOILERS.As this is not a very complicate show, I would go straight into business. By no means was this bad show, but this is not something stunning/moving either; despite a rather attractive background and seemingly innovative setting, This is a mediocre show: It is not really that innovative, Not really that corny, not really touching/entertaining and not really humorous, but Instead it stucks right in the middle of everything.Despite a clear vision as they attempt to innovate by adding Galgame Elements into the plot, adapting some sort...of “Love-Meter” into the show and makes a parody show about Galgame, It goes nowhere beyond that. The setting was nowhere near complete, for example you never know what the Ratatoskr does besides helping Shido to date and helping him to make his choices, which seems to be everything that this seemingly huge organization does.Despite a rather innovative approach of adapting Galgame Cultures into anime backgrounds, the core elements (Like the screenwriting) that hide inside the Galgame setting are the wrongdoings. The pick-up lines are incredibility cheesy and old fashioned. Rather than dating, most of the time it almost seems to be some sort of social worker trying to help the wellbeing of the applicant, along with some quite heroic actions that you could certainly live without because you’ve probably seen it too many times – to be exact, four – as every single segment ends with shido trying to man up and save the girl.And, surprisingly, the best part of the show comes not from the main plot, but from the side elements of the show – which is the jokes and some of the characters. Tohka Yatogami’s four episodes are not very interesting. However, those tiny bits between Tohka and Shido after her episodes were more then enough to show the relationship between Tohka and Shido. Tohka is the only one that had showed growth and had thought for the others at the final episodes. Besides Tohka, the rest only serves as jokes and side dishes that were not very important. Origami took a major role in the show, but whenever she comes up, she would be only doing three things: trying to kill somebody, ask for Shido’s care, or act as some sort of joke. The rest was either not potray entirely and had to wait till second season (like Kurumi), some was just not very interesting and act as a joke/insignificant plot device throughout the whole series, like DEM, AST, Mana, Yoshino and so on.To conclude my short review, I would say that Date Alive attempts to be joking but act serious (by using a joke to cover up the serious bits), but it becomes the other way round and turned into something that is seriously joking. It might be interesting if they actually manage to pull it off (what they are trying to be), but a show like this is probably just outrageously ridiculous and had turned into some sort of funny show that somehow sounds stupid. I would say that this is an entertaining show, since some of the episodes actually made me laugh hard, but probably that would be my biggest (and my only) compliment for them.PS: It is said that the second season would be much better. Many of the fans from the original novel series actually recommend me to read the novels. I would consider that as an option as the original series is something quite big.

Basically fanservice, fanservice, fanservice, more fanservice, boobs, explosions, boobs, explosions.The main character's reactions to everything made absolutely no sense and had no rationality whatsoever. My adoptive sister is suddenly the commander of a floating invisible airship? Okay, cool. She wants me to date potentially life-threatening girls who can flatten a suburb in a matter of seconds and kiss them? SURE! No problem!I don't even care if this spoils the beginning, hopefully you won't make the same mistake as me and watch this garbage.I have...the lowest standards for anime out of anyone I know. I enjoy anime people find horrible, but this was just unbearable.

As I said many times, all magic school genre is trying to be Toaru whether they admit it or not, but none of them ever understood why Toaru was good.

Some loved it, some hated it. Many anime released prior to Date A Live have been well below decent so how does Date A Live stack up with the new releases? Well then, let\'s find out.From my experience, I felt the story had a lot of potential but unfortunately some of that potential was bogged down by rather ridiculous concepts. I\'ll explain as I go along. A strange phenomenon called ""spacequakes"" has been causing destruction all over the...globe and they are caused by female entities called ""Spirits"". Our protagonist Shido has been tasked with having to seal their powers before they can cause anymore spacequakes. With what you may ask? By having to go on dates with the Spirits and make them fall in love. That explains what I meant earlier about the story\'s potential being lack-luster. The concept of spacequakes and Spirits where in my eyes well conceived and I think they could\'ve add more potential to the anime then they let on. But unfortunately the ridiculous concept of a dating sim has killed off the seriousness of these ideas and made it feel more like a harem comedy (which is the anime\'s true genre). And this was only the first episode. After finishing it, I thought the concepts will make the rest of the anime crash and burn. It turns out that I was wrong. Despite the ridiculous concepts of the plot, this anime was still able to maintain its entertainment factor and improve as the episodes progress. This was a big surprise for me. The rest of the story is basically Shido dating Spirits to seal their powers before the Spirits are killed off by an organization called the AST (Anti-Spirit Team). The story is flawed but it makes up for it with a well-executed entertainment factor.I\'m not too familiar with Tsunako\'s art work but I can tell that the art style of the characters is pleasant to look at. Each character has their own unique style that makes them quite memorable. Whether it be Kotori\'s twin pink ponytails or Kurumi\'s goth-like outfit. The character designs were well done. The setting and background art though are average. Although not bad or terrible, the city designs didn\'t catch my drift as much as the characters did (mainly because the city the anime takes place in doesn\'t have some very memorable spots like other cities from other anime). The overall animation is also good and everything runs smoothly to the frame rate. The only issue I have with the animation though is that some scenes will show background characters completely motionless or show only a still image that is being panned. This takes away the livelihood of the scenes that should have been. Otherwise, the art is good nonetheless.The music that plays in Date A Live has been well composed and each tune fits their scenario very well with their unique melody. So far I haven\'t heard one mediocre tune in the anime that disappoints. The opening theme is also good but because of the story\'s quirky concept, the theme feels out-of-place. The ending themes are basic and average and they fit more to the genre than the opening theme. The voice acting is also superb with each character sporting a unique and pleasant voice to listen. But because this anime hasn\'t been dubbed yet, there\'s not much I can say about the voice acting at this point.As far as characters go, each of them have very likable personality traits and their personality developments runs very smoothly throughout the course of the anime. Such as Tohka starting out cold and distant and eventually becoming cheerful and protective later on. So far I haven\'t seen one excruciatingly hate-able character in the anime. One exception though would be Kotori and her ""annoying Imouto"" trait but I never found her a really huge problem. She\'s still likable. But if there is possibly one character that is the best of the bunch, it has to be Kurumi for her Yandere personality. Just her alone makes her very entertaining (I don\'t know why, she just does). However because this is a harem anime, there will be a lot of ""WTF"" moments with these characters. Such as Shido making the most ridiculous choices possible that makes him seem like a pervert in front of the Spirits. Despite this though, all the characters are likable and they will keep you entertained for a while.Despite its lack-luster story and quirky concepts, Date A Live still manages to keep the entertainment factor going with its likable characters and memorable soundtrack and art. This anime is definitely worth a try. The first episode is the anime\'s weakest point so if you can bare with its flaws, you\'ll have yourself a good time with this anime. However keep in mind that this anime has a lot of fan service so if you\'re not into these types of genres, I recommend you stay away from Date A Live until you\'re sure that you can handle them all the way through.Overall, it is worth the watch. globe and they are caused by female entities called ""Spirits"".

No use previous example above.', ""This is easily one of the worst anime I have watched so far in 2019. You see, it's garbage like this that gives us real anime fans a bad rep. I'm surprised that this horrible anime even has sequels to it. It's literally just the typical cliche harem you get all the fucking time. When this anime tries to be original it just fails miserably and ends up going back to the stupid ass harem tropes you see in every damn harem anime. This review will only be about the first season btw.The first mistake I noticed in this anime is that it actually...tries to have a serious story. When I first started watching this trash I only i did it to watch a guilty pleasure ecchi anime to beat off to. This anime is a fucking joke. On one hand it tries to take itself seriously, on the other hand it's just your typical harem bullshit trying to be funny (even though it's not). It keeps flip flopping 24/7.The premise of this anime is extremely stupid beyond belief. There are spirits that invade earth and cause spatial quakes, and it was never explained why they do this. All of the spirits are coincidentally female, just to add to the main characters stupid ass harem. The main character has to make the spirits fall for him, turn them into good guys, and kiss them to seal their spiritual powers away. That is the most stupid bullshit I have ever seen.All of the damn spirits fall for him so easily as well, and it's because they're all poorly written one dimensional characters. I'll talk about how bad the characters are later on in this review.There are many nonsensical things about this anime, here are a few for examples. Firstly, even after he seals their spiritual powers away they still fucking get it back over and over again. What's the point in kissing them to seal it away if they constantly get it back everytime?The action in this anime is pure garbage as I expected it to be. Every single fight they're always using force fields and there isn't actually any injuries or anything. That isn't even entertaining to  watch in the slightest. They always have their god damn force fields up, so there is no fucking sense of danger at all!Now onto the characters. The characters are straight up garbage as I expected them to be. I was extremely disappointed to see how cliche of a character Tohka ended up being. In the first episode she was hinted at having a depressing backstory, or having motivations. In the end she falls for the main character easily. She goes from being edgy to a straight up bitch. The way her personality completely changed was just awful writing at it's finest. I thought she would be an interesting character at first, but literally two episodes in and I took that thought back.The other characters are horrible as well. Kotori is just the typical sexualized loli bullshit. Nothing about her character was interesting as far as I've watched. Origami is a shitty character because of her generic backstory and motivations. Wow you want to take revenge? How many times have I seen that in an anime, like 1000 times now? Not even going to be talking about the other loli ventriloquist because she was absolutely irrelevant.Just like every other stupid ass harem, the main character in this anime is completely fucking clueless. He doesn't even realize that multiple girls are trying to get into his pants. He's such a shitty character it's actually ridiculous. Again, he has no depth to his character whatsoever. All he did in this show was whine and bitch whenever the other girls got into a conflict. Nothing he did made me think he was interesting character. Again, he's just your typical harem protagonist with absolutely no depth whatsoever.People seem to like Kurumi, but I don't see it. She's just a generic yandere bitch and that's it. Nothing else about her character was interesting. Well that's it. Those are the only characters worth mentioning, because the rest shouldn't even be considered characters. The only other character I know is the blonde haired man that constantly talks about Kotori's body and shit. So there are multiple instances of this character being a pedophile, which is absolutely disgusting.Didn't have fun watching this piece of trash at all. Again, this is easily one of the worst anime I have watched so far this year. The only anime I've watched this year that's worse is Mirai Nikki. I didn't enjoy this piece of trash whatsoever. Bad characters, stupid story, pedophilia, incest, asspulls, plot holes, horrible fights, horrible plot, etc.Now as a reviewer, I should always try to point out the good things about an anime in my reviews. The problem with this anime is that I couldn't find anything good about it. I guess the girls are hot, but then again I can easily go watch another anime with even hotter girls in it, so that wouldn't even count. So yeah this anime doesn't do it for me. Pure garbage tries to have a serious story. When I first started watching this trash I only i did it to watch a guilty pleasure ecchi anime to beat off to. This anime is a fucking joke.

I thought she would be an interesting character at first, but literally two episodes in and I took that thought back.The other characters are horrible as well. Kotori is just the typical sexualized loli bullshit. Nothing about her character was interesting as far as I've watched. Origami is a shitty character because of her generic backstory and motivations. Wow you want to take revenge? How many times have I seen that in an anime, like 1000 times now? Not even going to be talking about the other loli ventriloquist because she was absolutely irrelevant.Just like every other stupid ass harem, the main character in this anime is completely fucking clueless. He doesn't even realize that multiple girls are trying to get into his pants. He's such a shitty character it's actually ridiculous. Again, he has no depth to his character whatsoever. All he did in this show was whine and bitch whenever the other girls got into a conflict. Nothing he did made me think he was interesting character. Again, he's just your typical harem protagonist with absolutely no depth whatsoever.People seem to like Kurumi, but I don't see it. She's just a generic yandere bitch and that's it. Nothing else about her character was interesting. Well that's it. Those are the only characters worth mentioning, because the rest shouldn't even be considered characters. The only other character I know is the blonde haired man that constantly talks about Kotori's body and shit. So there are multiple instances of this character being a pedophile, which is absolutely disgusting.Didn't have fun watching this piece of trash at all. Again, this is easily one of the worst anime I have watched so far this year. The only anime I've watched this year that's worse is Mirai Nikki. I didn't enjoy this piece of trash whatsoever. Bad characters, stupid story, pedophilia, incest, asspulls, plot holes, horrible fights, horrible plot, etc.Now as a reviewer, I should always try to point out the good things about an anime in my reviews. The problem with this anime is that I couldn't find anything good about it. I guess the girls are hot, but then again I can easily go watch another anime with even hotter girls in it, so that wouldn't even count. So yeah this anime doesn't do it for me. Pure garbage"", ""Shows like this don't have to be plot heavy to get by. A gimmicky premise plus some cute girls and action is enough to justify watching for many people (and that includes myself). Whether it's the cuteness of the girls or the hokey Hogan's Heroes/military-ish sounding music used for the preview (and as background music during various light moments throughout the series), Date A Live has a certain charm to it that doesn't need to provide a deep experience to be enjoyable.That said, I found that I was more interested in the plot than I thought I would be. While I wasn't immediately impressed from...the first episode, things did become more interesting about halfway into the series. That isn't to say that the previous episode weren't entertaining in their own right, but the dark side of the story really shines (insofar as darkness shines) in contrast to the light side. In fact, the episode just prior to the (well-placed) injection of drama was fluffy enough to be called filler; the contrast between the two sides makes the drama feel (subjectively) deeper.In any case, you shouldn't expect a masterpiece out of Date A Live. However, if you keep an open mind to light fun and humor mixed with surprisingly interesting story developments (and with bits of action interspersed), then this could be the right anime for you. the first episode, things did become more interesting about halfway into the series.

However, the whole idea of girls in Mecha armor should be an obvious hint that it's nowhere near close to what we though it would be. I'd have to say that what made this anime enjoyable was the balance between comedy and plot. It wasn't too serious and at the same time, it wasn't too comedic. The amount of fanservice here was average for a new anime (In this century at least). What captivated me the most...was the climax where things started to intertwine. However, the big disappointment was that it came when the series was close to halfway done. The biggest flaw of the anime had to have been the sheer amount of things left unanswered. For example, what happened to this character, or that one, or this one? They could've gone more in-depth on the characters rather than stick to the main crew. In fact, if they did then the series wouldn't just be a half series. There'd be more story rather than just dates after dates after dates alternating between battle and fanservice. This just means that there are a LOT of open questions that need to be answered. Once again, there could've been a lot more done with this anime and that is it's fatal flaw. I enjoyed the characters. Each one of them was loving. One more things that bothers me is that they never dodge and they recover at the speed of light like nothing ever happened. Anyway, that's all I can say about Date A Live. I reaalize that I'm pointing out a lot of flaws but it's a good anime. It just lacks story and information. If you're looking for an anime that is similar to Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai but with a little more sparkle, then you've found a good anime. Kotori wins Imouto of the year.

Overall score: 8/10"", ""Date A Live, a series that I never really took seriously to begin with. When it comes to harem based animes, they're either suppose to be funny, serious or romantic and Date A Live was none of that. There were no jokes to laugh at, the serious moments about Kotori and Origami's past were presented horribly and the romance was as good as a third grade stage play about Romeo and Juliet. I'll be honest, the only reason I actually decided to watch this series was because of Kurumi and Yoshino who have been added to my list of Favorite Psychopaths and Favorite Kawaii Characters.Date...A Live attempts to be serious with the whole Spirits can destroy the world and everything but having to make them fall in love with them turns the situation into a horribly done comedy. After reading the synopsis, you may think this show has to either be funny or serious with comic relief but you're incredibly wrong. The only thing that actually stuck out in this series are the character designs and the weaponry used by the spirits. Date A Live has perfect cosplay material (for females anyway). The weaponry and powers of the spirits are each incredible but sadly their handlers are not.The characters are each pretty damn annoying except for Yushino who makes a great dandere and Kurumi who plays a great villain. Maybe that's just my bias but none of the characters are very memorable. The only time I found any enjoyment while watching this series was during the fight scenes. Everything else was pretty much needless and a boring wannabe romance.

For me, it was. Even if its a parody. My friends know I have no nice words for this series, but I'll try to stay nice now.The story is simple, the earth is endangered by these huge earthquakes, wich turn out to be very powerfull girls. From what i got, they are aliens, and are vieuwed as enimies. They get attacked but it doesnt work because everything still gets destroyed. So our protagonist is forced to do...another approach, date them!What?Yeah.And it doesn't end there, but I'll spare you the spoilers.Even though I hate the story itself, the art is pretty good. Nice coulors and scenery, your moe girl here and there, cuteness altogether. It's not an eyesore, to be fair.-6The sound was decent, I dont really remember any remarkable things, so I wont go into it.-6Characters were easy written, and had no development in this series. I feel like they had no depth or anything interesting. Even the secrets in some weren't very interesting. Although I liked Origami, but one character doesn't really make up for it.-4Overal I didn't really enjoy this anime myself, but I can see why others can. It's a refreshing series, although a bit confusing. The only good thing I have to say about it is the art, and it wasn't even that great. -4Again, this is my first review, I tried (and English isn't my first language).

That was the point, where it got a lot of attention for. Deserved?Story: The Anime is adapted from a Light Novel of the same name: ""Date A Live"". It\'s takes place in a quite near future (at least it seemed to be future), where events called Spacequakes happen, because of which many people die. To prevent this from happening, everyone gets evacuated whenever they happen. The Anime now revolves around Itsuka Shidou, a normal highschool boy that one day wittnesses a space quake and finds a girl in...an armor standing in the middle of it. She immediatly attacks since she thinks he wants to kil her. Fortunately Shidou is safed after explaining to the girl that he was just searching for his little hyperactive sister. He finds himself in a big space ship, where he finds out that the sister he had been searching for, is the tsundere leader , of an organization that needs him to seal the powers of the girl from the Spacequake called ""Spirit"".Date A Live definitely gets a bit of credit for the originality of the whole concept (I mean saving the world by dating hot girls...I guess it\'s the dream of every teenage boy). The execution though is only mediocre. The show is set up as a romantic comedy, with your typical fanservice (4 pantyshots in first minutes) and the typical humor (which I myself don\'t like but that depends on the person). Later on though, where the big twist starts to happen the series suddenly gets darker, seemingly pulling of a Madoka Magika and just fooling around a few episodes and then turn everything into epic darkness. But it doesn\'t follow that path and doesn\'t decide where to go, so they just put in a dark scene and a bit fanservice right after, which doesn\'t fit at all.6/10Characters: The characters are in total quite ok. At first seem to be quite generic, but as you dive a bit deeper, you can see some developement and some attachment to the characters presented.Itsuka Shidou is the typical main protagonist, that wants to help everyone and doesn\'t have ANY further motive. He reminded me a bit of Emiya Shirou from the Fate/Stay Night Series, but a little better executed.Yatogami Tohka, is the spirit from the spacequake Shidou witnesses. She doesn\'t believe in Shidou at first, but as it goes on she realizes he was serious about the saving the spirit thing.Itsuka Kotori starts off as the cure little sister character that only seems to be there for the fanservice, but it\'s not that late until we see her Tsundere side as the leader of a group which wants to save the sprit.7/10Art: Date a Live has been animated by AIC Plus, which never had any major work before, the only thing that might be notable being ""Asobi ni Iku yo"". The Animation is nothing spectacular. The fighting scenes are quite well done, but all the other scenes were rather mediocre. The character design looks quite good and whoever is supposed to look cute looks cute as well.5/10Sound: The sound was at some points really good. The Opening was one of the best of the whole season in my opinion and it actually got used in an instrumental way several times within scenes later on. The voiceacting was quite ok but not incredibly good.Personal enjoyment: To be honest...I got bored quite often! While the first half of the series only focused on humor I didn\'t like (I just have a weird taste I guess), it really wasn\'t good for me and I would\'ve given it a 4/10 then. When the show reaches a certain episode though, it kind of gets really interestiing and I found myself even looking forward to next week. If it would have kept this up, it might have scored a lot better!5/10In total Date a Live is an anime with an original concept, that was not really well executed.

The ratings really don\'t reflect on the quality of the anime because it is purely subjective. Being subjective is like talking to guys who like Hyundai because of its ""fluidic sculpture"" and immediately concluded that Hyundai is awesome; and if you\'re like me who\'s looks at what\'s under the bonnet on car displays and motor shows, you\'ll end up asking yourself if those guys have never seen a Ford or Toyota before. It\'s exactly the same in anime: you find out that a harem-anime has almost the same score as Ano Natsu de Matteiru,...you wonder yourself for a moment, then you realized that if we\'re on the same wavelength as I talked further, then you\'ve quite been able to understand me for being calm as I review one of the many harem anime that reached a 7/10 rating here in MAL.There\'s another harem anime that has a score of 7, Inifinite Stratos at 7.26. Then there\'s a romantic anime worth the watch and just scored a little higher of 7.78: Isshukan (One Week) Friends. And then there\'s Fast and Furious 7 shown at the theaters right now, and you\'d rather watch that because you can\'t anymore comprehend how come a harem anime got in the same flooring as a romantic one.But that\'s how anime is. In the words of a fellow-MAL-member, Veronin, ""If there is one that has remained true about the anime industry, it is that cheap entertainment and low-risk adaptations prevail"", then he/she quoted some more: ""It expects the audience to willfully ignore its poor writing, because hey-- there are cute girls to gawk at!""Really, I couldn\'t agree more.Harem anime is, for better comparison on cars, we\'re not using Hyundai. They\'re like BMW. If you ever wind yourself on BMW showrooms, you\'ll be offered the 3-series, 4-series, 5-series, and 6-series. Then, you\'ll be offered with the M3, M4, M5, and M6. The 3-series and the M3 are pretty much the same, just like the 4-series and M4, the 5-series and the M5, and 6-series and M6.BMW will say the M-series has better engine, better suspension, better seats, entirely better than the number-series, but  honestly they\'re practically the same car in a perspective that there\'s no way you\'d drive these cars at max horsepower and drift them to be totaled by an incoming Hyundai on the other lane. That\'s how harem anime work: you watch Infinite Stratos, To Love Ru, Kore wa Walking Dead desu Ka, Ore no Nounaiwerawerwrljkjkjkkjkwsheeshteiru, Strike the Harem, the list goes on, and with a sound mind, you concluded that they\'re the same in every sense. Different characters, same structure of story, the ending could spell the same.STORY: 6There are conditions why I dared to review a harem anime. One, because Marina Inuoe is in it; two, because I\'m currently listening/reviewing UVERworld songs the same way I was listening/reviewing Nightwish\'s new 2015 album the other day; and three, because this is the only harem anime really worth reviewing.Let me tell you how to review some other harem anime. For example in Infinite Stratos, there\'s Marina Inuoe on it, as much as Yoko Hikasa on it, there\'s even Kana Hanazawa on it! Yet, reviewing IS (and the rest of the harem anime) isn\'t near reviewing a BMW, but is more like reviewing a Hyundai instead: it runs if you press the accelerator pedal, it brakes if you press the brake pedal,  it has wipers, a stereo, seats for five people, and an aircon.Date A Live presented its story about the fiction world where global threat is caused by ""spirits"", and a male MC, he is an average highschooler, yes, who is needed to save the world from being blown for no real reason. It\'s like watching Ultraman actually, just that it\'s all about pretty shoujos with bouncing boobs for delectable eye candy and borderling the ecchi genre, not a stuntman with a grey mask on a red diver suit with props.Then if you\'ve watched TWGOK (or Gaworare--both are not the stereotyped harem anime), it also has the same formula of trying to subdue girls by love and kisses, sealing their destructive powers, thinking that at the end of the day, they\'d be moe enough to be presented on the next episode filled with fanservice.As much, no matter how the Date-A Live story was written, it has the same backbone or base all throughout. There was really nothing new to it as its other harem cousins.CHARACTER: 7It may be harem, but the shoujo (female) characters may have just enough spark on them. The defining character element is because they have the ability to decide.And yes, for a harem anime, THAT\'S HUGE!They are not the usual submissive, pathetic personification of anti-feminism, they can actually think and helped put the development of the plot from point-A to point J, K, and L.Tohka vows to protect the world after seeing the beauty of it (and for Shido ofc), there\'s Yoshino who only uses her powers under duress and was not intending to harm anyone, then there\'s Reina who\'s reliable enough to help with the shoujo characters\' emotions. As much, the character profile is not perfect: there\'s Kotori who\'s real charm was that she was voiced by Azunyan, Origami who must have originated from the Infinite Stratos world and brought back the harem-essence because she is just being a stalker, and there\'s the astonishing-beauty Kurumi who is actually wicked and a better poised antagonist, just that she went all the trouble because she\'s crushing the MC who said her beauty is astonishing, all made more of failing to break free from the harem-essence.Then let\'s not forget the main character Shido: the personification of what guys/shounen surrounded in harem usually acts as reluctant and being the center of rabu-rabu doki-doki for no apparent reason; yet he, too, can decide on his own. Thus, he\'s not any of those flimsy MC\'s on other harem anime who waits for the author to get over his/her harem fantasies and wrote how the story progresses based on his/her subjective terms.In the end, this is how I put it: despite it\'s harem, the character development was able to take matters into its own hands.ART: 10it may be shoujos with boobs and fanservices, and that\'s what is mercilessly pointed out by hundreds of fans because that\'s what this is primarily all about, but they forgot the other artwork that made the rating to 10: the presentation/artwork of power and destruction, the buildings and geometry, action-scenes, all the secondary artworks that has nothing to do with the superficial (but primary) reason of shoujos and their boobs, and the fact that ""ART"" is a different criteria and nothing to do with the development of plot and characters, are the reasons why I rated this as 10.SOUND: 8The opening/ending themes sound just as right. It\'s a bit aggressive as a pop-rock kind of songs if you will, but fits to the ""world destruction"" theme that Date-A Live presented.Seiyuu-wise: there\'s Marina Inuoe (who uses her exact wavelength voice she used on Kana Minami of Minami Ke), Ayana Taketatsu (Azunyan), Nomizu Iori (Blood Lad\'s Fuyumi), and Sanada Asami (Sawa-chan sensei), they put a good deal of effort and helped seal the sound criteria to be as fitting to the character voices.ENJOYMENT: 7Surprising, I rated this as 7 as what I could rate 5 (or 4, or even 3) to the rest of the harem anime. Like I said, aside that it has Marina Inuoe on it, Date A Live has the potential being an anime that could break the standards of harem genre. It\'s like if we\'re going back to the BMW analogy, you just found the BMW M7 at back of the showroom. The M7 does not exist YET in the line of BMW cars, which then will lead you to conclude that what you\'ve seen is the 7-series with nice touches on it.OVERALL: 6Like I said on the enjoyment part of this review, you found the BMW 7-series.What I mean is, Date A Live could have held the potential, but maybe the author still lacks the conviction to break the standards, or perhaps the publisher of the Date-A Live manga were too standardized and firm that harem anime must include the usual, stigmatized harem elements. There could be other reasons (theories) as well, but somehow, Date A Live is perhaps the only harem anime you need to watch, give and take, the rest of the harem anime are something that Date A Live already encompasses.Verdict: If Date A Live is a BMW, then it\'s the 7-series: it encompasses what the 3-, the 4-, the 5-, and the 6-series have in their boot, bonnet and portfolio. you wonder yourself for a moment, then you realized that if we\'re on the same wavelength as I talked further, then you\'ve quite been able to understand me for being calm as I review one of the many harem anime that reached a 7/10 rating here in MAL.There\'s another harem anime that has a score of 7, Inifinite Stratos at 7.26.

Thus, he\'s not any of those flimsy MC\'s on other harem anime who waits for the author to get over his/her harem fantasies and wrote how the story progresses based on his/her subjective terms.In the end, this is how I put it: despite it\'s harem, the character development was able to take matters into its own hands.ART: 10it may be shoujos with boobs and fanservices, and that\'s what is mercilessly pointed out by hundreds of fans because that\'s what this is primarily all about, but they forgot the other artwork that made the rating to 10: the presentation/artwork of power and destruction, the buildings and geometry, action-scenes, all the secondary artworks that has nothing to do with the superficial (but primary) reason of shoujos and their boobs, and the fact that ""ART"" is a different criteria and nothing to do with the development of plot and characters, are the reasons why I rated this as 10.SOUND: 8The opening/ending themes sound just as right. It\'s a bit aggressive as a pop-rock kind of songs if you will, but fits to the ""world destruction"" theme that Date-A Live presented.Seiyuu-wise: there\'s Marina Inuoe (who uses her exact wavelength voice she used on Kana Minami of Minami Ke), Ayana Taketatsu (Azunyan), Nomizu Iori (Blood Lad\'s Fuyumi), and Sanada Asami (Sawa-chan sensei), they put a good deal of effort and helped seal the sound criteria to be as fitting to the character voices.ENJOYMENT: 7Surprising, I rated this as 7 as what I could rate 5 (or 4, or even 3) to the rest of the harem anime. Like I said, aside that it has Marina Inuoe on it, Date A Live has the potential being an anime that could break the standards of harem genre. It\'s like if we\'re going back to the BMW analogy, you just found the BMW M7 at back of the showroom. The M7 does not exist YET in the line of BMW cars, which then will lead you to conclude that what you\'ve seen is the 7-series with nice touches on it.OVERALL: 6Like I said on the enjoyment part of this review, you found the BMW 7-series.What I mean is, Date A Live could have held the potential, but maybe the author still lacks the conviction to break the standards, or perhaps the publisher of the Date-A Live manga were too standardized and firm that harem anime must include the usual, stigmatized harem elements. There could be other reasons (theories) as well, but somehow, Date A Live is perhaps the only harem anime you need to watch, give and take, the rest of the harem anime are something that Date A Live already encompasses.Verdict: If Date A Live is a BMW, then it\'s the 7-series: it encompasses what the 3-, the 4-, the 5-, and the 6-series have in their boot, bonnet and portfolio.', 'Okay I can\'t deny. This anime was just a pleasure to watch.The story of Date A Live takes place in a world that has these phenomenons called spacial quakes caused by these things called spirits. Shido, the main protagonist, meets one of these spirits after a recent spacial quake and is later finds out his younger sister Kotori is head of a group called Ratatoskr. Their goal is to help the spirits by having Shido going out on dates with them. The ""date experts"" at Ratatoskr rig the dates, but Shido doesn\'t always follow their advice. He meets the same spirits again and gives her...the name Tohka, but they are attacked by the Anti-Spirit Team (AST) as Shido asks Tohka out on a date. After events it is revealed that Shido can seal away a spirits powers by kissing them. Shido wants to save the spirits and help them live normal lives as people, but is afraid that he might not be able to. The anime follows volumes 1-4 of the light novels.The animation is very good. The actions scenes are done very well.The characters are all really good. My favorite is hands down Tohka because before she met Shido she would show up on Earth, buildings would be destroyed, and the AST would attack her. So when Shido takes her out on a date she experiencing emotions she hasn\'t felt. Shido is a generic main lead, but he is done well. Yohino is a spirit who has a hand puppet named Yoshinon and has kind of two personalities in which she conveys through Yoshinon using I guess ventriloquism. The last character is Origami a popular girl at Shido\'s school and has a prejudice against spirits because her parents were killed by one. She also has a weird love obsession with Shido. She is also both loveable and hateable. There is also Kurumi, but she is one those characters that shouldn\'t be talked about because she\'s that awesome and crazy.I really enjoyed Date A Live. This show was just so entertaining from start to finish. The characters are enjoyable and comedic at times. That\'s why I\'m giving this an 8/10. the name Tohka, but they are attacked by the Anti-Spirit Team (AST) as Shido asks Tohka out on a date.

What does kiss mean to you personally? Is it that magical? Hold on to that thought till you finish this anime.Story:6/10Yeah to those who watched The World God Only Knows, this is just like it. Just with... lesser girls. Okay, the story is simple. Shidou(MC) is determined to save all the spirits. Few episodes dedicated to Shidou\'s actions of saving the different girls. Boring? I beg to differ. Much as I initially thought it was really repetitive, I was amazed...at myself enthusiastically waiting for the next episode every week. Believe me, it\'s not that repetitive because all the characters have different responses. However, I would also like to point out that Yoshino\'s arc was really really rushed. I personally think it would be more enjoyable if they could,say, extend her story. Next, Kurumi\'s arc ended abruptly. Come on! No one likes endings that end so abruptly!Art:7/10Did really well as a 2013 anime. Really appealing to me as it kind of makes me feels refreshed and impressed with the art which made me wait urgently for the next episode.Character:8/10I have to say, I\'m really impressed with the characters. Tohka-pretty, innocent and cute. There was one scene I went: ooooohhhhhh.......SO CUTE AND INNOCENT! Okay please don\'t judge me because of this alright? Yoshino- cute and innocent. To all lolicons out there, Yoshino is a really good target. And then there\'s kurumi- direct, forceful and yandere. Killing people with a smile? Now that\'s what I define yandere girls.Sound:5/10Not really the main aspect of the anime in my opinion.The OSTs doesn\'t seem to get me all hyped up and get prepared for the epic scenes. Oh but the opening by Sweet Arms is really impressive. Gave me adrenaline rush and I was prepared this anime is gonna get as good as the song.Enjoyment:7/10Considering I was enthusiastically waiting for every episodes I really enjoyed this anime.

But, not totally, since this anime does have a nice story and plot, the problem is the execution which there are some thing that make the concept of them spirits and the character\'s behind it that seemly conflicts as to what they\'re describe, e.g. them spirits\' powers should have been sealed by the male character and yet we still see them being able to kick ass. Another thing that adds to this anime\'s conflicting concept is between the AST and Kotori\'s  Ratatoskr Crew, one cannot...determine as to which is the protagonist and antagonist. Then again the idea of the male MC being a sort of heroic Casanova  to the spirits and to one of the members of the AST was very sweet to say the least, but that as good as it gets since this anime completely relies on a cliche harem theme and everything else about this anime\'s genre are pretty much trivial. Another thing about this anime was the way it episodes were done- it\'s pretty much a mini series which is irritating because FUNanimation seems to wanna save the best for last which was the Kotori arc, unfortunately, the ending was just too corny. So how do I rate each of this anime\'s category?Here\'s how:Story-good 7.The story is as good as any plan that it has on paper until one executes it .Art- good 7.Well, I do admit that the fanservice and the swimsuit service were entertaining, thought this anime could used some uncensored panty and boob flash.Sound- fair 6.I like the VA\'s who did Thoka, Kotori, Tobiichi, Kurumi and Yoshino, the opening I\'d probably say was ill-fitted for this anime, but the closing fits fine, but I hate both of it.  In fact the anime ending song ""Be my reason"" form Karneval would have been a nice combination for this anime\'s opening.Character- fair 6.If only FUNanimation utilizes the character\'s roles properly then this anime would be good, problem is that all the beans was placed on Shidou.Enjoyment- dreadful 2.The way it ended was just too corny.Overall- pathetic 1.I hope FUNanimation Entertainment doesn\'t even think about making a season 2.Peace muchachos! determine as to which is the protagonist and antagonist.

(think of it as Kaminomi\'s capture plot IN THE FUTURE but with Seirei\'s instead of demons) but had the anime had better direction. then it wouldn\'t be as bad.Firstly, it relies HEAVILY in Chandler\'s law (""When in doubt, have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand."") In other words, a new character appears out of nowhere whenever...the plot comes to a halt or goes on for too longAnd just as quickly, they are FORGOTTEN and never mentioned again (or mentioned but never important despite how obvious that they still could be used to fuel the plot). Yes, it\'s all simply bad writing and to think I had to ignore this before because the plot was pretty interesting.Secondly, just as it introduces and removes characters out of the blue. It also does this to CONFLICT. remember the spacequakes? It stops being a threat pretty early in the story. The anime has trouble making up it\'s mind regarding which conflict should remain central to the ""date"" plot. Why bother using two conflicts when you can\'t even handle it properly? pretty damn stupid move, I gotta say.Thirdly, It tries to juggle between multiple subplot CLUMSILY. since there is too many subplots going on (each heroines have them, there are SIX of them) they get pushed up and down in priority frequently and some even get IGNORED just so the current subplot can be expanded upon. what the flying f*ck? don\'t juggle arcs when you can\'t even do it properly! there\'s a reason most dating sims use heroine based routes.ART 7/10 (10 -3)The art is great. The characters have good designs, the environment is detailed, the fight scenes were cool..... for the first few episodes. it get\'s plagued with off-model stuff in the last few episodes.it\'s like the animation crew just threw their hands up in the air and said ""screw this, let\'s just wing this damn thing and get over it! we\'ll still get paid with the same thing no matter how bad this turns out anyway!"". A waste of perfectly good art.Sound 6/10 (10 -4)OP is great, Save the World(ED) is great, Save my Heart(the other ED), not so much. Strawberry Rain was nice but forgettable, EP1\'s ED was what sold me to this anime.so why 10 -3? it\'s because they\'re pretty standard and don\'t really come out as unique.Character 4/10 (10 -6)You\'ve seen EVERY SINGLE ONE of them before. The Generic Harem Protagonist, his Best Friend,those Extras That Comment On The Plot, and some more Plot Device type of characters.on the heroines: there\'s The Tsundere, the Protagonist\'s Imouto, his Long Lost Family Member, The Moeblob, the Crazy-Ass Yandere, the Rei Ayanami clone. There\'s NOTHING unique about them save for their cool character designs (except for Shido who reminds me of Persona 3\'s protagonist).They all could have been expanded upon and given unique traits, but no~ they\'re plain cookie-cutter cutouts people with pretty basic traits.  THIS is where the anime fails badly. their character development was too straightforward with no curved-balls.ENJOYMENT 6/10 (10 -4)Have I not seen it\'s pathetic excuse for an ending I could have given this anime a 9-- hell no, a 10(My ratings are based on enjoyment, save for 10 which is based on quality). But with it\'s bad writing, HUGE Potential getting unused, and Generic characters. it all becomes a stupid mess of what could have been a perfectly good take on a harem anime.Is this worth watching? hell no. unless you want to waste your time watching crap instead of doing something productive like polishing your dating skills with quality dating sims. the plot comes to a halt or goes on for too longAnd just as quickly, they are FORGOTTEN and never mentioned again (or mentioned but never important despite how obvious that they still could be used to fuel the plot).

What a classic, right? This show started airing so long ago. But then, it got another season... and then another... and another... so people liked it, it seems! And so I wanted to watch it, curious as I was. Now, I\'d like to believe that one of my talents as a viewer is to mildly discern whether a show will be good or bad just from its tags and the poster art. Needless to say, I didn\'t have my hopes up for this show, though surely, it could still be worth a try?No. No it wasn\'t, lol.Date A Live is a particularly...silly harem anime, that tries to awkwardly mix comedy with drama but fails in pretty much both. A show clearly aimed for younger audiences, yet one I kept watching nonetheless for the sole purpose of giving it a proper review and an honest rating. Mind the mild spoilers and profanity, although I doubt spoiling this anime will have any significant harm to your experience.I will start with the least worst part of this anime which is plot. I think? It is an anime set on the future judging by the technology used by the so called ""AST"" unit and Ratatoskr itself, a flying carrot that is somehow allowed to float above a civilian area indefinitely, has surveillance technology that can spy on the entire city at any time, a teleportation room that can take you literally anywhere, and permanent camouflage to top it off. Let\'s not forget the 14 year-old girl commanding this ship and the rest five of the crew with ""unique"" relationship history. Cool. So what is the purpose of Ratatoskr and the aforementioned AST?As we learn, they both have one objective but different approaches. They both want to eliminate Spirits. The AST wants to kill them, while the Ratatoskr crew aims to employ their ""special agent"", Shido, to counter the Spirits by kissing them. Yes, kissing them. You saw ecchi in the tags, I saw it too, so why am I complaining? Silly me. Obviously, Spirits are not aliens or monsters, but cute girls of Shido\'s age, and since he\'s our special boi, he is the only one who can ""seal their powers"".So, we quickly learn that the AST is pretty much a retarded effort. And by that, I do not imply that the show intends to present them as such, but that we, as viewers, can conclude that they are indeed, retarded, from two observations: firstly, Spirits have no ill will and do not cause spacequakes on purpose when they appear on Earth (except some cases where they cause them on purpose AFTER they\'ve appeared). Secondly, Spirits are pretty OP anyway, so not much of a point fighting them when there is another, easier solution with way less casualties and resources at risk. In fact, the AST is so retarded, that on a fight with Tohka, the first Spirit, they nuke their OWN CITY in an attempt to kill her, something which obviously fails spectacularly. On the background you can see the entire city destroyed, with damages potentially ranging on the billions, all the while Tohka is chilling with Shido. But oh well, who am I to judge a next-gen army.Due to the reasons I mentioned, the AST becomes the actual antagonist of this anime. Shido wants to date the Spirits in order to seal their powers (I can\'t write this with a straight face), but that god damn AST is always somewhere trying to kill his waifus. And this is pretty much the entire plot of the anime. A new Spirit appears, she fights a bit with the AST so we can see her powers, then Shido somehow convinces her that he cares about her and yay, everyone is safe and Shido has a new addition to his harem. Some filler episodes here and there and you\'re set.As you can judge by the plot alone, this show is already quite a fiesta. It is devoid of any kind of seriousness, something which becomes even more painfully apparent when it actually tries to be serious, by attempting to integrate drama on the whole mix. That is, trying to present realistic threats to our characters, believable plot devices and the such, and failing spectacularly at doing so. However, I do not intent on focusing on this aspect for the current review. What I want to write about is characters. Because oh boy are they something.I could probably describe this anime vaguely with the following divine trifecta: inconsistency, degeneracy, repetition. Where can you find inconsistency? Take a look at Tohka and Kotori. When we\'re introduced to Tohka, she has kind of a warrior character, bound by some duty, constantly on defense, distrustful. Well, said character lasts literally two minutes, as when she meets Shido, she then becomes the most horribly dumb person on the cast, the one who actually believes everything and thus misunderstands everything, the oh-so-cute girl that wants Shido\'s attention. And what I want to highlight is not how irritating a character Tohka is - I assume the anime wants her to be so for comedic value (believe me, I didn\'t laugh). What I want to pinpoint here instead, is the transition from A to B in such a sudden, disconnected manner. It just feels like a different character.Then we have Kotori\'s character, which is at first an innocent little sister, that then turns out to be the commander of Ratatoskr: imposing and authoritative, even in front of Shido (thus it is not just professional conduct), unlike her previous persona. One could theorize that she was just acting innocent in front of Shido, to cover her ""real"" identity, but we can see bits of her going back to her ""cute little sister"" every now and then... though I believe hiding was not the intention here. The only reason the transition from sister to commander happened in the first episode was to create a premise, that the ""imotou"" character was in fact something else, something unique, something to attract people to the show. It didn\'t matter if it made sense, it mattered how it would be presented, and that was a fourteen-year-old commanding a flying ship. Kotori did not explain anything when Shido first found out about her, she didn\'t apologize for hiding it from him for god knows how long, none of that. She basically said nothing and left him to deal with it on his own.In fact, I really want to emphasize how much of a sociopath Kotori actually is. She watches her brother get shot and killed on the spot, yet she didn\'t give a flying fuck. Even when the crew showed obvious concerns for Shido\'s condition, Kotori was like ""Nah, he\'ll be fine!"" And yes, he does get resurrected (I mean, it\'s still episode three), but he does so with a power that even Kotori is not sure of how he got in the first place. It\'s pretty insane.In another instance at the start of the anime, Kotori and Shido promised each other that they would meet at a specific place after school. However, a spacequake occurred before that could happen. After Shido successfully evacuated, he learns that she\'s actually at the place they promised to meet up. As you might expect, Shido got shit scared and worried, left the evacuation shelter and headed for her, but well, he run into Tohka before getting there. Though he does meet Kotori later on the Ratatoskr, and when Shido explains how worried he was, she... well! She doesn\'t care! She doesn\'t show even a bit of empathy, for how worried he was, for his anger, for not letting him know she was okay even when she was perfectly capable of doing so. She could simply make a phone call and pretend she was on a shelter somewhere safe. But nope. So yeah Kotori is fucked up. But do you know who else is fucked up? Our boi, Shido! Probably runs in the family or something.Remember how Spirits have their powers sealed when they\'re kissed by someone compatible? Also, if a spirit\'s anxiety levels get too high, their powers will return back to them, something which realistically only happens to Tohka. And so whenever Tohka finds absurd reasons to justify that Shido doesn\'t care about her, he\'ll have to commit to the courageous act of dating her. After some AWFULLY forced and generic romcom interactions, we\'ll have to listen both of them saying ""hontou"" 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 times, multiply that by two, so that\'s 12 times in total. But I hear you ask, what\'s the problem with that? Also, if he\'s only dating Tohka, where is the harem? To what I say: NO, GOD PLEASE NO!Now for the degeneracy part. For the purpose of this anime, our man, Shido, takes the brave initiative to cast aside any iota of decency and honesty in his interactions with other people. You see, that comes in very handy when he has to date multiple girls simultaneously. Girls that are not even spirits. Even if he seemingly doesn\'t want to. What are the reasons? They really do not matter, the anime crafts them from thin air. So anyway, how will he manage to date all these girls at the same time? Why, that\'s easy, by how every other prick manages to do it in our world, and that is lying, of course. Many, many times.Shido will throw out such obvious lies so often, and these girls will believe in what he says, every single time. The show maliciously ignores this: these lies are just part of a comedic scheme. Shido is seemingly juggling in front of the audience, trying to satisfy all the girls at once and barely managing. The lies he tells isn\'t what matters, it\'s the struggle of Shido having to deal with all of them - that\'s what the anime wants us to see. And that\'s horrible.Even when Shido wants to be honest, the anime finds the most idiotic ways of letting him be so. For example, when he wants to tell Origami (which for the record is best girl) that in fact, he doesn\'t want to date her, what will he do? Tell to her straightforward? Distance himself? Nope! He will date her of course, and try to make Origami dislike him by humliating her in front of others. Again, how does this anime interprets the whole thing? Comedy. It is truly surreal watching Origami unconditionally obey to degrading acts in public (I genuinely believe the Rtatoskr mind controlled her), all the while clownish comedy music is playing in the background. Yes, blind obedience is Origami\'s problem, but it doesn\'t make Shido\'s behavior any less disgusting and repelling. Even when he realizes she can go in great lengths, he keeps going. It\'s sickening. But wait, there\'s more!I didn\'t mention that while dating girls, Shido is in fact getting feedback from the Ratatoskr crew on how to respond to certain situations. Yep, he\'s not even doing anything by himself, the Ratatoskr crew is guiding him, and their responses are actually chosen among three computer generated choices, dating sim style. You know, I gave up taking technology seriously in this anime a while ago, so! There\'s a problem here. Now the crew also gets a big part of the blame in this situation. Turns out not only Shido, but the entire Ratatoskr crew is a bunch of assholes. Shido of course being the cherry on top, as he\'s actually degenerate enough to relay the answers he gets to unaware people. No filter, no judgement? Aren\'t some of these answers far fetched? Not for Shido it seems. So wow, this anime went from making one person a prick to making an entire flying fortress into a bunch of perverts, so I commend that. Let\'s not forget Kotori\'s advisor, a 27 year old scumbag who\'s an actual pedophile. No joke.So... I\'ve really written quite some stuff here, and believe me, there are so, SO many more flaws in this anime I did not even mention, like the uninspiring music making ridiculous scenes even more ridiculous (let\'s just put generic samba music here, it definitely won\'t make the scene look like a clown fiesta *clueless*), the cringe-worthy attempts at drama which I spared myself the effort of writing anything about, and inconsistent scene direction (one specific frame that stuck with me is right after Kotori fired her gun at Kurumi, pay attention how there is a linear trail on the school rooftop but also a hole on the top right of Kurumi\'s clock... how the bullet teleported from one trajectory to the other is beyond me). The list simply goes on... it\'s really like a target practice, you can go on a literal hunt for bad things in this anime. There are simply so many.In conclusion then, considering the quality of this anime and the enjoyment I got from it, it was... you know, bad? I did not even bother watching season two onward, so that alone settles it. I\'m not a person that drops anime easily, yet it was already too painful to watch by that point. Plus, there are four seasons of this thing! Why do they keep feeding such a monster? So really, there\'s no point in watching something so repetitive. I can\'t imagine myself getting surprised by Date a Live, unless it\'s from something genuinely disturbing... maybe my morbid curiosity will one day make me do the unthinkable? Meh, you know what they say. Curiosity kills the cat. Or your will to live, in this case.Anyway, should you watch it? I would recommend it for two audiences: twelve-year-old horny bois, and seasoned veterans who\'re eager to go on a hunt and write an analysis quadruple in size describing every flaw they find in detail. I expect Nobel prizes to be handed out for the valor and determination it takes to write an analysis for such an anime - I\'m still waiting for mine to arrive, as a matter of fact. So yeah, if you\'re not in one of these two categories, stay away, or else unbearable cringe shall be inflicted upon you. You have been warned. silly harem anime, that tries to awkwardly mix comedy with drama but fails in pretty much both. A show clearly aimed for younger audiences, yet one I kept watching nonetheless for the sole purpose of giving it a proper review and an honest rating. Mind the mild spoilers and profanity, although I doubt spoiling this anime will have any significant harm to your experience.I will start with the least worst part of this anime which is plot. I think? It is an anime set on the future judging by the technology used by the so called ""AST"" unit and Ratatoskr itself, a flying carrot that is somehow allowed to float above a civilian area indefinitely, has surveillance technology that can spy on the entire city at any time, a teleportation room that can take you literally anywhere, and permanent camouflage to top it off. Let\'s not forget the 14 year-old girl commanding this ship and the rest five of the crew with ""unique"" relationship history. Cool. So what is the purpose of Ratatoskr and the aforementioned AST?As we learn, they both have one objective but different approaches. They both want to eliminate Spirits. The AST wants to kill them, while the Ratatoskr crew aims to employ their ""special agent"", Shido, to counter the Spirits by kissing them. Yes, kissing them. You saw ecchi in the tags, I saw it too, so why am I complaining? Silly me. Obviously, Spirits are not aliens or monsters, but cute girls of Shido\'s age, and since he\'s our special boi, he is the only one who can ""seal their powers"".So, we quickly learn that the AST is pretty much a retarded effort. And by that, I do not imply that the show intends to present them as such, but that we, as viewers, can conclude that they are indeed, retarded, from two observations: firstly, Spirits have no ill will and do not cause spacequakes on purpose when they appear on Earth (except some cases where they cause them on purpose AFTER they\'ve appeared). Secondly, Spirits are pretty OP anyway, so not much of a point fighting them when there is another, easier solution with way less casualties and resources at risk. In fact, the AST is so retarded, that on a fight with Tohka, the first Spirit, they nuke their OWN CITY in an attempt to kill her, something which obviously fails spectacularly. On the background you can see the entire city destroyed, with damages potentially ranging on the billions, all the while Tohka is chilling with Shido. But oh well, who am I to judge a next-gen army.Due to the reasons I mentioned, the AST becomes the actual antagonist of this anime. Shido wants to date the Spirits in order to seal their powers (I can\'t write this with a straight face), but that god damn AST is always somewhere trying to kill his waifus. And this is pretty much the entire plot of the anime. A new Spirit appears, she fights a bit with the AST so we can see her powers, then Shido somehow convinces her that he cares about her and yay, everyone is safe and Shido has a new addition to his harem. Some filler episodes here and there and you\'re set.As you can judge by the plot alone, this show is already quite a fiesta. It is devoid of any kind of seriousness, something which becomes even more painfully apparent when it actually tries to be serious, by attempting to integrate drama on the whole mix. That is, trying to present realistic threats to our characters, believable plot devices and the such, and failing spectacularly at doing so. However, I do not intent on focusing on this aspect for the current review. What I want to write about is characters. Because oh boy are they something.I could probably describe this anime vaguely with the following divine trifecta: inconsistency, degeneracy, repetition. Where can you find inconsistency? Take a look at Tohka and Kotori. When we\'re introduced to Tohka, she has kind of a warrior character, bound by some duty, constantly on defense, distrustful. Well, said character lasts literally two minutes, as when she meets Shido, she then becomes the most horribly dumb person on the cast, the one who actually believes everything and thus misunderstands everything, the oh-so-cute girl that wants Shido\'s attention. And what I want to highlight is not how irritating a character Tohka is - I assume the anime wants her to be so for comedic value (believe me, I didn\'t laugh). What I want to pinpoint here instead, is the transition from A to B in such a sudden, disconnected manner. It just feels like a different character.Then we have Kotori\'s character, which is at first an innocent little sister, that then turns out to be the commander of Ratatoskr: imposing and authoritative, even in front of Shido (thus it is not just professional conduct), unlike her previous persona. One could theorize that she was just acting innocent in front of Shido, to cover her ""real"" identity, but we can see bits of her going back to her ""cute little sister"" every now and then... though I believe hiding was not the intention here. The only reason the transition from sister to commander happened in the first episode was to create a premise, that the ""imotou"" character was in fact something else, something unique, something to attract people to the show. It didn\'t matter if it made sense, it mattered how it would be presented, and that was a fourteen-year-old commanding a flying ship. Kotori did not explain anything when Shido first found out about her, she didn\'t apologize for hiding it from him for god knows how long, none of that. She basically said nothing and left him to deal with it on his own.In fact, I really want to emphasize how much of a sociopath Kotori actually is. She watches her brother get shot and killed on the spot, yet she didn\'t give a flying fuck. Even when the crew showed obvious concerns for Shido\'s condition, Kotori was like ""Nah, he\'ll be fine!"" And yes, he does get resurrected (I mean, it\'s still episode three), but he does so with a power that even Kotori is not sure of how he got in the first place. It\'s pretty insane.In another instance at the start of the anime, Kotori and Shido promised each other that they would meet at a specific place after school. However, a spacequake occurred before that could happen. After Shido successfully evacuated, he learns that she\'s actually at the place they promised to meet up. As you might expect, Shido got shit scared and worried, left the evacuation shelter and headed for her, but well, he run into Tohka before getting there. Though he does meet Kotori later on the Ratatoskr, and when Shido explains how worried he was, she... well! She doesn\'t care! She doesn\'t show even a bit of empathy, for how worried he was, for his anger, for not letting him know she was okay even when she was perfectly capable of doing so. She could simply make a phone call and pretend she was on a shelter somewhere safe. But nope. So yeah Kotori is fucked up. But do you know who else is fucked up? Our boi, Shido! Probably runs in the family or something.Remember how Spirits have their powers sealed when they\'re kissed by someone compatible? Also, if a spirit\'s anxiety levels get too high, their powers will return back to them, something which realistically only happens to Tohka. And so whenever Tohka finds absurd reasons to justify that Shido doesn\'t care about her, he\'ll have to commit to the courageous act of dating her. After some AWFULLY forced and generic romcom interactions, we\'ll have to listen both of them saying ""hontou"" 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 times, multiply that by two, so that\'s 12 times in total. But I hear you ask, what\'s the problem with that? Also, if he\'s only dating Tohka, where is the harem? To what I say: NO, GOD PLEASE NO!Now for the degeneracy part. For the purpose of this anime, our man, Shido, takes the brave initiative to cast aside any iota of decency and honesty in his interactions with other people. You see, that comes in very handy when he has to date multiple girls simultaneously. Girls that are not even spirits. Even if he seemingly doesn\'t want to. What are the reasons? They really do not matter, the anime crafts them from thin air. So anyway, how will he manage to date all these girls at the same time? Why, that\'s easy, by how every other prick manages to do it in our world, and that is lying, of course. Many, many times.Shido will throw out such obvious lies so often, and these girls will believe in what he says, every single time. The show maliciously ignores this: these lies are just part of a comedic scheme. Shido is seemingly juggling in front of the audience, trying to satisfy all the girls at once and barely managing. The lies he tells isn\'t what matters, it\'s the struggle of Shido having to deal with all of them - that\'s what the anime wants us to see. And that\'s horrible.Even when Shido wants to be honest, the anime finds the most idiotic ways of letting him be so. For example, when he wants to tell Origami (which for the record is best girl) that in fact, he doesn\'t want to date her, what will he do? Tell to her straightforward? Distance himself? Nope! He will date her of course, and try to make Origami dislike him by humliating her in front of others. Again, how does this anime interprets the whole thing? Comedy. It is truly surreal watching Origami unconditionally obey to degrading acts in public (I genuinely believe the Rtatoskr mind controlled her), all the while clownish comedy music is playing in the background. Yes, blind obedience is Origami\'s problem, but it doesn\'t make Shido\'s behavior any less disgusting and repelling. Even when he realizes she can go in great lengths, he keeps going. It\'s sickening. But wait, there\'s more!I didn\'t mention that while dating girls, Shido is in fact getting feedback from the Ratatoskr crew on how to respond to certain situations. Yep, he\'s not even doing anything by himself, the Ratatoskr crew is guiding him, and their responses are actually chosen among three computer generated choices, dating sim style. You know, I gave up taking technology seriously in this anime a while ago, so! There\'s a problem here. Now the crew also gets a big part of the blame in this situation. Turns out not only Shido, but the entire Ratatoskr crew is a bunch of assholes. Shido of course being the cherry on top, as he\'s actually degenerate enough to relay the answers he gets to unaware people. No filter, no judgement? Aren\'t some of these answers far fetched? Not for Shido it seems. So wow, this anime went from making one person a prick to making an entire flying fortress into a bunch of perverts, so I commend that. Let\'s not forget Kotori\'s advisor, a 27 year old scumbag who\'s an actual pedophile. No joke.So... I\'ve really written quite some stuff here, and believe me, there are so, SO many more flaws in this anime I did not even mention, like the uninspiring music making ridiculous scenes even more ridiculous (let\'s just put generic samba music here, it definitely won\'t make the scene look like a clown fiesta *clueless*), the cringe-worthy attempts at drama which I spared myself the effort of writing anything about, and inconsistent scene direction (one specific frame that stuck with me is right after Kotori fired her gun at Kurumi, pay attention how there is a linear trail on the school rooftop but also a hole on the top right of Kurumi\'s clock... how the bullet teleported from one trajectory to the other is beyond me).

It takes influence from [b]Evangelion[/b] both in terms of style and purpose. It wants to be a fun, humorous story while also have engaging characters and challenge its format a little. Whenever it does that, it succeeds. Whenever it dabbles in Harem cliches, you reach for some funeral music.The premise is nonsense, but not without hope. The why’s are unimportant. The premise forces a non-violent solution to defeat an enemy, and one that relies on character interaction. This forces the creators to make the...Spirits into actual characters instead of an ‘unknown enemy’. It also means they have to write actual character interactions, instead of just making a light show of explosions.It does work, for the most part. The Spirits are all vastly different, and quirky in their own ways. Some of them may seem cliche on the surface, like Yoshinon’s shy girl antics. They do make them weird and silly enough to make them memorable. There are plenty of fun fish-out-of-water moments with Tohka.

Shido’s given a little more to do. It feels like he can be a good character. Yet, has no personality to speak of.

He could be a neurotic, like [b]Evangelion[/b]’s Shinji. He could be a White Knight who’s overdoing it. All of which would have added plenty of more comedic moments. Yet, he’s just a convenient tool to move the plot with less depth than an FPS character. This is one series that deserved so much.Since the male lead has no personality, the romance is also not that exciting. Seeing a man having to juggle three girls could be fun. It’d work here because the series gives them a little more to do, but Shido is nothing. The girls fall for him mostly because it’s convenient. If love was so convenient, it wouldn’t be a staple in the arts. There was also no reason for Origami to be a part of the harem. It added nothing.[b]Date A Live[/b] falls too much into cliches to be great. When it’s good, though, it’s better than another anime where the only effort is in the character design.

It wants to bring us hot girls, a large ammount of explosions and action in general and some romantic drama.Date a live is setup in a Japan where beautiful female creatures, whose are identical to humans, are capable to create huge black hole-like explosions (or should I say implosions). And thus, every now and then, a whole ton of people is threatened to die, along with many other life forms in its way. Enter Shido Itsuka, a typical main character. Long story short, he\'s the chosen one to stop these...catastrophes.Here\'s the deal; I have no problem with the story trying to accomplish these many things at once. My problem with this is the execution they chose for the story to progress. Whenever you are watching you just cannot help but saying to yourself ""I have seen this, and that, and that too..."" And you just go on. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s fairly entertaining, I laughed a lot and I liked the girls and stuff, but the harem concept and its execution is a fairly overused one.Moving on from the harem stuff, there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered, like why is Shido the chosen one, and a lot more (I will not ask them here, since they would be considered spoilers) that you cannot help but asking yourself, since this anime takes its plot pretty seriously.I must admit, that some revelations were actually well done, even if the plot twists were certainly predictable, the exact moments where these twists are revealed adds some shock value (if you could say it that way), not to mention these are the elements that peek your curiosity and make you wonder how these will turn out. However, the lack of direction of this anime didn\'t really let me realize what was happening or what exactly it wanted to achieve. And this is noticed right in the first arc, when Shido is told that he\'s the chosen one (Minor spoilers ahead): When he goes to stop the girl from being a massive destruction weapon, the anime changes its identity and suddenly it wants to become a romantic-comedy one. Next episode we have a fan service oriented focus, and we could go on forever. And this is the big problem with Date a Live. With a well articulated story telling, this could have been THE anime to watch, but certainly they chose to aim for a different appeal.The art is kind of the strongest point of this anime, and I would say it is what it keeps you watching for the most part. The characters are simply beautiful. I\'m personally not ""attreacted"" to anime girls, but I have to say that there were a few girls in this anime that kept my mouth open. Guilty pleasure confirmed! The backgrounds are also full of life and colors, and the animation is really well done when it comes to the battle scenes as well. It was a really good job.When it comes to the sound, once again, I have to say that I usually skip openings and endings, but I turned out to listen to it accidentaly, and I really liked it. I also liked the way they present ""the story thus far"" thing, right when the opening song is starting, and being such a well crafted orchestral begginning, it gives a dramatic and epic feel. It really gets you hyped, no matter how simple the story has been until that point.However, as a sound engineer/musical producer, I have to say that the recording could have been better. Specially on the drums. They literally have no impact at all. Could have been better, but it\'s fairly good and achieves the impact.It\'s really sad that most of the background music is simply forgettable and dull. Does not complement the visual atmospheres at all.Other aspects like sound design and voice acting were really well done, specially the voice acting. Nothing much to say, tho.This anime was really entertaining, and it kept me going until the end, almost hiding the fact that pretty much everything was executed in a cliché way.Although this anime has a really good technique quality and is really entertaining as well (art-sound), it does not redeem that the plot is mediocre.

I do understand...that some are a bit more cliche than others, but that\'s like me watching Gundam and then making a review about how much I despise mecha shows.There are plenty of other genres to enjoy if one does not like Harem/Ecchi genres but to bash it because of the content it is supposed to show is just unfair.That\'s it for my semi rant and on to the review!Date a Live gives a refreshing take on the genre by mixing it up, the typical elements are there but there are also twists to them. There are some really unique characters in the show as well some that you can\'t compare to nearly any other harem genre. One of the best characters in the show doesn\'t show up until later in the series and boy is it worth it.The Opening Music is one of the catchiest and best sounding theme songs I have ever heard and it was the main reason I decided to watch it. I\'m glad I did because Date a Live was definitely one of the harem series that I enjoyed the most. The second season is even better and you should watch it even if you are not in it for the Harem or Ecchi (There\'s a modest amount of it.)The designs pretty awesome looking and the animation is pretty good for a harem series. You\'ll have a sense of ""color coded characters"" but it doesn\'t detract from the viewing as Date A Live builds on it instead.The story is mediocre at best as since its only 12 episodes it doesn\'t have enough time to cover it in more detail and decides to go for more the fan service and character development instead. The character development does help with adding elements to the story though. that some are a bit more cliche than others, but that\'s like me watching Gundam and then making a review about how much I despise mecha shows.There are plenty of other genres to enjoy if one does not like Harem/Ecchi genres but to bash it because of the content it is supposed to show is just unfair.That\'s it for my semi rant and on to the review!Date a Live gives a refreshing take on the genre by mixing it up, the typical elements are there but there are also twists to them.

The character development does help with adding elements to the story though.', 'So, hello everyone, I\'m Mindpower and this is my first anime review here. Why did I decide to review Data A Live as my first one when I have so much more things to choose from? Well, because fuck it, that\'s why. Jokes aside, I decided to review this because of how conflicted I am about it and I will explain the reason for this later on.This review will probably contain spoilers so please bear in mind that if you don\'t want to get spoiled... Don\'t read or watch reviews IN DETAIL, just skip over them and beware of sections where you might get spoiled....With that said, please bear in mind that this is my personal review and opinion and should not be taken as a professional review or something you should take in consideration alone. You should take this review in consideration by comparing it with others so you can have a wider arrange of thoughts and opinions because this anime... Is not for everyone.I\'ll start my review by dividing said review in multiple parts too familiar to everyone here: Story; Animation;Sound;Characters and Overall Enjoyment. So without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, here\'s my review on Date A Live.Starting with The Characters:Why the characters first you ask? Because they are way more interesting to describe than the story and without them I won\'t be able to reference half the things I want to in the story section.The cast is a typical Harem-based cast which has oblivious main male character with a personality so easy to read through you\'re reminded of those books that were made by joining two lines of text with 90% pictures all clobbered up in 10 pages just to say ""The chicken crossed the road"". The character is actually kind of relatable in a sense that it\'s so flat that, unless you\'re a person who\'s out of the ordinary beyond sensible reason, anyone can relate to it in the tiniest, itsy bit.Joining the flat character we have, my personal favorite, the loli-tsundere-not-blood-related-sister-red-haired female lead character which is, once again a harem stereotype we\'re all too familiar with. The only thing I think that sets her apart from most other similar characters is the serious moments she provides along with the comic relief she provides as well. This is where the contradiction starts. Kotori is there to provide both comic reliefs at times and to make the show serious while being a major plot-mover. She also has twin-tails and red-hair which immediately gets a lot of points from me.The rest of the characters are same-old, same-old. Tohka had potential but was quickly thrown away as a side character after episode 3 or 4 and the others are mainly there for 1/2 episodes before being forgotten and only appearing to be a pleasant reminder that they are there and they want to be noticed.There are two other characters I do want to mention which is Origami. Introverted, white-haired, pervert that happens to be a loli with considerable breasts... Do I have to say more?And then there\'s Kurumi, a yandere that\'s crazier than Yuno, that girl that went on a rampage at the end of Another, that girl that went on a rampage at the end of the dreadful anime named School Days AND your typical Anime lunatic all put together. Despite this, I enjoyed Kurumi as a character because she was half-decently put together and her god damn scenes were more than glorious. Her episodes really made the show a lot more enjoyable and *SPOILER* she introduced Kotori as a spirit.Moving on to The Story:Story... Oh, how to begin, if you\'re searching for an anime filled with stereotypes not just within the characters but also within the story then by far this is your best bet. This anime\'s story may sound unique and appealing at first but it\'s basically an excuse to set beautiful, supernatural girls in a high-school setting. These \'spirits\' which are incomprehensibly attractive 16 year-old girls because why not? Enter our world randomly whenever they feel like it or are angry and when they do so they USUALLY create a huge massive black hole-like-thing which basically decimates cities and kills thousands of people there. The only way to stop these powerful beings is by having our main character make them fall in love with him and then kiss them to seal their powers. Yes, a kiss, why? Because fuck it, why not?That\'s the answer for most questions in the show, if you\'re question why a certain character did this or a certain part of the story went like that the answer are basically ""Why not? Fuck it, why not? Fuck all."" and my most favorite one ""if they did it and it worked let\'s do it ourselves.""Now for the Art or Animation:I absolutely LOVE the animation in this show and it was mostly what kept me stuck because the show is so well animated that it allows you to turn off your brain and basically ignore everything dreadful with it. The animation really shines through during the scarce battle scenes and during the scenes where there\'s a bit more action, more blood and more \'special effects\' like ice for Yoshino and Kotori\'s insanely cool flames, weapon and astral dress design. There\'s not much for me to comment about in this section apart from the fact that this keeps the show together most of the time.The Music:Why did I rate this so high? To put it bluntly there are two or three main songs that pop into my mind when I think about this show and the main one is the opening. The opening is great, not one of the best openings ever but an opening that surpasses the show itself. It\'s usually presented after a dramatic set of phrases that will make you laugh when you actually discover that it\'s a pitiful attempt for the show to become serious but you quickly forget about it because the opening kicks in.My Overall Enjoyment:I\'ll be frank... I, every week, waited patiently for a new episode. For some reason the show dragged me into its deepest parts and kept me locked in there for its whole duration. The show is dreadful, completely so, but like other animes it drags you into it so badly because of things like the Animation and the introduction of a new stereotypical character which you happen to love that you just keep wanting to watch it while praying for the torture to end so that you can be released. I enjoyed it thoroughly but I\'m ashamed to say I did enjoy it as much as I did.So, on the categories of story, art, sound, character and personal enjoyment I rate this show:Story: 4/10Art: 10/10Sound: 8/10Character 3/10Enjoyment: 10/10And now for the final verdict.Overall I give it a 6.5/10The show is a complete mess but it\'s a good mess. I recommend that you carefully read my review and the reviews of others more experienced than myself and carefully consider trying this show. The show is good, but it\'s only, good IF you enjoy this kind of thing and you have no problem shutting down your brain so hard it\'ll have a problem working for the next few hours.I\'ll patiently await for season 2 and hope they fix some of the dreadful errors they did so that I can give a more positive review next time. Until then I leave you with this. Goodbye.

Usually, I am fine to watch any series within the comedy and romance genre, having a pure harem. only because of how cliche most are. This anime isn\'t an exception, if you really interested to look at the cover background image of this character. Although what most romance-comedy try to do is have a unique characteristic that separates from the normal, within this story. I will explain in more details, if you really curious to it.The story is great. Its about a main protoganist named Shidou Itsuka, a student of Raizen High School. was...adopted into the Itsuka family when he was ""abandoned"" by his mother from  5 years ago, then Itsuka Shidou living the present and living with her sister, Kotori. After that,They bring a dreadful disaster is called ""Kunkashin"" (Spacequake) is happening at the Earth to destroy this beautiful world. Why? Because a Spirit, mysterious existence  is coming to the Earth, The Special Soilders named AST is trying to attack the Spirits, to stop them from destruction.""The ways to liberate them from suffering; to annihilate them by force or to delight them by a dating.""A dating supposed to hang out each other, and give a lot heart towards the girls. Suddenly, the option like a galge.A unique aspect of this anime is it\'s art. Bright, vibrant colors that separates other anime. It\'s opening and ending truly stand out to show it\'s nice art, but watch out. There\'s many fanservice, or you\'ll get nosebleed.I know this might a bit weird plan, but this is mostly like a Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai. We couldn\'t argue about it, I find it this funny and make you cheer up. My most favorite character is Kurumi Tokisaki, her yangire and cuteness get me hothothothot. The people thinks her she\'s a bit creepy. But my opinion is different than them. Better than Yuno Gasai.Watch it now, you\'ll have no regrets.

Only 12 episodes long as of now, but promising a second season, the first ends with as many questions unanswered as answered. The main character, Shido, is a normal high school student who lives in fear of the impending spatial quakes that have been devouring holes into the Earth for some years now. The day his life changes he finds himself staring down the blade of a beautiful woman, Tohka, who seems to have come right out of the spatial quake herself, but turns out to be the cause of it. Shido is then...recruited by a secret organization that instead of killing these spirits that come bringing the quakes, they would like Shido to make them fall in love with him, in-tow sealing away their spirit powers.One thing I liked mostly about this anime is that it was funny. A lot of anime today try to force their humor by throwing their character into outlandish situations, where don't get me wrong, this happens in Date A Live, but the situation is more believable. I found myself laughing because it just felt natural, not laughing because the writers tried to make something considerably funny rather than just letting it flow through the show. Also this anime is full of partial nudity which you should by now come to expect out of almost every anime, but they at least cover the shower scenes with some steam like they did in Sekirei season 2. All in all this anime is a great story and hopefully they do continue with a second season as promised at the end of the show. recruited by a secret organization that instead of killing these spirits that come bringing the quakes, they would like Shido to make them fall in love with him, in-tow sealing away their spirit powers.One thing I liked mostly about this anime is that it was funny.

Watching this totally changed my view and provided me with a nice anime that finally caught my attention. I must say that if you are a harem enthusiast, you should watch this anime. The action, story, and bits of romance mixed in with comedic relief made me really enjoy the anime and want to keep watching it all the way through. Although this is a great anime, I must say that the ending is a little lackluster and I feel as if it was too quick. My opinion may change because I...know that there is a second season that I cannot wait to watch. know that there is a second season that I cannot wait to watch.', ""Before i say anything i would like to point out that before i watched this show i heard nothing but bad things about date a live. I heard that it was pure fan service and that the second season is just a joke. So i went into here with very low expectations. Which is why i think this is my second favourite anime of all time(Favourite doesn't mean best)Don't get me wrong im not proclaiming this to be amazing or anything like that, but the sheer enjoyment i got out of this show is insane.The story itself honestly is one of the stupidest things i...have ever freaking seen. I mean the main line is kiss the girls save the world. OK well lets hope that this isn't a ecchi anime. Now while the plot itself may be ok at best. I believe it is executed wonderfully. You see i feel that this plot is carried by the characters. By that i mean if they were different then this shows plot would be dreadful. You see the plot brings the characters into situations where you just sit there laughing you ass off and have the dorkyest smile on your face. That is what this plot is. It isn't something like inuyasha which has a deep plot filled with twists and turns or stiens gate which is just a brain fuck. This is a ecchi adventure meant to give you some good feel moments and a lot of funny moments.Now character wise i think this show is amazing. Yes Kayuga ( i think spelt that right) is pretty much Tohka but more energy but that doesn't take away from her. You see these characters are all great. You have the adorable to the stubborn to the down right insane and everyone does their job perfectly. Kurumi and Tohka are my personal favourites. Kurumi being the type of person who will pretty much be locked in a insane asylum but then you'd want to join her because she is just so awesome. Tohka is a bundle of fun. Strong warrior princess as a spirit. Loving and caring airhead when not. Overall the characters are insanely well crafted and enjoyable as all hellMusic wise it is good. While i don't really hate most of the songs used in the show i think they messed up a bit in the second season. You have a sad song playing in a happy moment and vice-versa. The op's and the ed's on the other hand are great. Catchy as all hell.Visuals are amazing. Seriously i bought the first season on blue ray and my eyes were bleeding RAINBOWS! While the visuals over everything are pretty damn good the design and visuals of the astral dresses are amazing. Colorful and pretty and drastically different. You have Tohka's warrior look to Yoshino's young look to the Yamai twins bound together look and so on and so on.Like i said this is my second favourite anime so enjoyment is outstandingSo yea i think this is the type of show you have to go in with low expectations because of how much fan service and ecchi moments there are. Do i think i would of enjoyed it if i had higher expectations? yes, I find the characters and the art style along with the battle scenes to be top notch so yea  would of found a way to enjoy it and in the end thats all that mattersId give Date a live a 8.5/10I have two requestsONEDATE A LIVE III PLEASETWOYEN PRESS GET THESE LIGHT NOVELS PLEASE have ever freaking seen.

DESTRUCTION of property, DESTRUCTION of mankind, and DESTRUCTION of your brain cells that is If you decide to stay up till 3 AM in the morning trying to binge-watch this...anime like me. Now these hot ladies are available in a variety of shapes, sizes, and even brands.

Fan service is endless.Now these spirits appear at random places and at random times and they can\'t control it and don\'t even know how it happens. And BAAM, Black Hole. There is an organization called AST whose job is to kill these spirits because of the destruction they cause. Then another organization took pity on those spirits and wanted to seal their powers. Now the way their power is sealed is very... Ummm... Very Questionable. The main character has to date those spirits and make them fall in love with him and when those spirit\'s affection level becomes high, he has to kiss them and then their powers are sealed. Yeah, I know right??? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MEEEEE!!!!  Once their powers are sealed, the AST won\'t be able to detect them anymore and thus won\'t target them anymore.When I first learned about this plot, I was like how long can it get? But man they stretched it all the way to 5 seasons. The story has many turns and is quite decent enough. Script writing was good, and the music was great too. Solid character designs and peak comedy.

This is similar to The World God Only Knows. I believe towards the ending the series strayed from the original story and focused on other things. It managed to keep me hooked though.Art 8 - Really can\'t complain about art, its same as most newer animes and characters are well animated along with effects.Sound 8 - I loved the OST, opening and ending themes. They went well with the series.Character 6 - Like in many harem animes, we...have the character who is dense. ""I love you"", ""Oh, that\'s nice"". There is little to none character development and all are cliche types. They are still likable though, my favorite being Tobiichi Origami.Enjoyment 8.5 - I really enjoyed Date A Live despite being a little harsh on it in my review. Its worth watching if you\'re not too strict otherwise you\'ll hate it.Overall 7 - Date A Live, a good anime if you like to set expectations to zero and enjoy some ecchi humor. Also do not take Rated R seriously, I\'m sure the rating was given since there is a part where one of the spirits kills people and spills blood all over (if I remember correctly). have the character who is dense.

I won\'t lie however.. when I first saw the title ""Date A Live"", I was more than a little skeptical in regards to how enjoyable the series would be. After watching the first few episodes, (I typically watch anime in Japanese first and English second to make a comparison) I was a bit conflicted. Sure, the show seems in many ways to be directly ripped off of other anime in the area of plot/storyline, and a lot of the time, it even seems a bit silly. However, there is a certain depth...to each of the characters that makes this show enjoyable to a degree.Regrettably, it doesn\'t follow the light novel series as closely as one might prefer. Even so, I certainly wouldn\'t mind seeing this anime continue as it doesn\'t explain many things that are made clearer in the novels.My advice on this one, watch at your own discretion while ignoring any reviews that do almost nothing but put it down. Such ignorance is unbecoming, and if people were to believe it more than not, they\'d never get to watch anything.This series is worth watching, reserving judgement for afterwards. All people have different tastes in regards to what they think is ""good"". Besides, I find it hard to believe someone who types out a summary in their review even when it explicitly says not to. Just watch the first couple episodes and make your own decision. to each of the characters that makes this show enjoyable to a degree.Regrettably, it doesn\'t follow the light novel series as closely as one might prefer.

The story doesn\'t go that much more in depth besides the spatial quakes that occur, and we learn later more about what can trigger them, but that\'s about it. I said before how the story was vague, but after watching the second season, i\'m starting to appreciate the ""vagueness"" behind it, and this story, is actually slightly better in terms of ""STORY"" content comparing it to the second season, which is just an add on..but overall...the story has a nice concept and i liked it.As for the art, it\'s quite enthralling to look at.

Not much to say here other than that, it\'s your average anime-style sound\'s with a decent OP and good dub.For the characters though, this is where i think they did a great job. The characters are very well done in the fact that they\'re all very memorable.  They really give a good overview on all of the main characters, while keeping a lot in the dark at the same time. Every character here has a nice mix of backstory and secrets, as you can never fully trust the spirits, and how we don\'t fully understand where Shido get\'s his power to contain the girls powers. But knowing and understanding more about these mysteries could have been better.The overall enjoyment here is great, i definitely will be re-watching this anime.

It's not the greatest, but it's there. It can be summed up as mech-girls against magical girls. It leads to some interesting fights, but there isn't that much content. There are some plot twists here and there, but the story is not what you should come for.Art - 9/10The art is one of the stronger points, it is very well done with each character having a unique style. The finer points of each character are done masterfully, and it doesn't feel like there was all too much of a compromise. However, they...stuck to a generic style overall, without any real distinction from other well done anime (for examples, see Attack on Titan, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, or Madoka Magica)Sound - 9/10Another strong point, the opening song is amazing, I never got tired of hearing it. The BGM fits the mood in most cases, and complements the picture well.Character - 10/10Warning, minor spoilers in this section.Probably the show's best point, all of the characters are VERY unique.

There is plenty of fan service sprinkled throughout the course of the series, so I got enough enjoyment from that. The panty shots, combined with the epic and often hilarious battles, left me happy with what I experienced.Overall - 10/10I give many of the shows I watch 9/10 or 8/10. There are only a few I watch that I feel deserve a 10/10. This is one of them. It is my new favorite series. Now, if you are not attracted to females, I do not think this will be seen as highly as I see it. This show is filled with a lot of fan service directed towards those that are attracted to females. There might not even be much substance underneath this fan service, but the characters are strong enough to carry this show as a comedy if you choose to indulge in it as such. I got enough enjoyment out of it to give it a 10/10, and I hope you respect my opinion.

Each character has their own sinister track that fits them perfectly. The story is an incredibly cool twist of fate that manages to hinge on the humor of dating. The relationship bonds that develope are strong and standing. The character art is also very impressive and the action that ensues during battles is packed. This series will have you rolling in laughter with each episode. The only thing I have a problem with are a couple of aweful charcaters that were injected...

The same emotions I had while first seeing it were reproduced again, DaL doesn\'t get boring at all![STORY - 8/10]Strange and non-human beings, who are able to inflict a massive damage on wide areas with earthqwakes. Those are called ""spirits"". The high casualties level made them hunting targets, but due to their strong and unlimited powers, taking one down is nearly impossible.Shido has an efficient and harmless ability to put an end to all this. Being able...to seal spirits\' powers within his own body isn\'t something new, as we can see on ""Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls"", that came two years before DaL\'s light novel. However, the dating simulation setting, which makes Shido\'s life look like a gal-game is what brings originality to this amazing piece.Well-elaborated dramatic scenes are its main characteristic, and the way its plot quickly develops into something that will keep you glued to the screen impresses...[ART - 9/10]Maybe the best aspect from DaL refers to its overall visuals, which are absolutely joyful to gaze at. Advanced eye design, gorgeous outfits and a widely detailed scenario are just some of its many features and, side by side with all those intense combat sequences, experience improves a whole lot.[SOUND - 10/10]DaL features a single OP theme song, entitled as ""Date a Live"" and performed by sweetARMS, which has an nice and addicting rhythm and matches perfectly the anime\'s purpose. Three different ending sequences with a selected song for each one, all of them performed by Yoshino\'s voice actress, Iori Nomizu. The sweet timber of her vocals can take anyone down, with these lovely tracks.[CHARACTER - 7/10]Since it\'s a harem, you\'d expect usual stock characters. No! Because DaL is not like ordinary harem animes! Tsunderes are present almost everywhere, that\'s for sure, but including the beautiful and lethal Kurumi Tokisaki, saw by many as the best DaL\'s girl, and the usually quiet and determined genius Origami Tobiichi was a master move.Ingenuous and innocent Tohka Yatogami, who loves to eat, along with Kotori Itsuka, the young leader from a non-violent spirit supression organization represent the main tsunderes. Cute and lovely Yoshino makes a rather small appearance. Still, her way of speaking and shyness is what steals every men\'s hearts...[ENJOYMENT - 10/10]I loved this show so much that I can watch it over and over again! Important lessons on how to treat a girl and what to do on a date were learnt, at least, by myself. Other than that, it\'s a nice romantic comedy, filled with action and drama.[OVERALL - 9/10]Spirits are unable to stop damaging cities and killing people. As a last resource, violent measures were taken, without success. Shido can put an end to this, but, without any idea on how to behave alone with a girl, things get tough.

Thats all I really have to say about this.The Story was Good, and everything else was Fun.  It was fun watching him ""Seal"" away each girl.  The Girl with the Clock in her eye seemed very...  sadistic.  and it was kind of entertaining watching her shoot herself in the head.  I liked the Voice Actress that did her as well.  it fit perfectly.The Last Episode(which i literally just got done watching at the time of this Review) was great.  The ending was great, and I think we\'ll find a 2nd season sometime soon....Because Yoshinon said, To Be Continued, then it pans down to Yoshino and she says, Sometime.  So there\'s most likely going to be a 2nd season.  Cant wait for that, because I wanna see what the Clock Girls going to do next.I\'ve Done another big review on K-On earlier, so I\'m going to keep this one short.Story, was Good and it was fun having Tohka pop in every so often.Art, was Great.  Fun Animation, and great effects, what with the Fiery Healing.Sound was good.  It really brought everything together.Characters were Fun and had quite a bit of depth to them.

Oh my god. It is quite possible nothing will ever compete with how absolutely toefucking this show is. In a masterful display of talent, DateALive studio has done it yet again and blended mecha, sci-fi, robots, harem, and women for one heck of darn ride. Every episode is blood-pumping cum-fucking adrenaline-spiking action, as the protagonist is tasked with kissing a girl. The energy doesn\'t stop there though. Turns out, the protagonist (i forget if he has a name) has a fetish for mecha bitches that can blow up the planet. Safe to say this causes quite a catalyst for plot development, and creates...some of the most dramatic moments I have ever seen in cinema, I will never forget the dramatic reveal in the ""Hot Springs"" episode.

My expectations were not that high and most of them could be fulfilled.So, basically, it is about these unknown beings, called Spirits. They can cause huge earthquakes after appearing and their goals are not known. Shido Itsuka has the powers to seal theirs, by making them fall in love with him (all Spirits resemble girls, eventhough they\'re not human).To achieve that, he\'s ""trained"" by his lil\' sister Kotori (along with the members of Ratatosk) on how to date, since Shido doesn\'t have...the experience. Since Spirits are too strong, killing by common means is almost impossible, so love was the best choice to deal with them.This resembles me of a anime I watched a while ago, Hyakka Ryouran: Samurai Girls. Jubei had a second, extremelly powerful personality, that could only be stopped by a kiss from Muneakira, just like Shido with these Spirits.Art is gorgeous and, despite having only a few key characters, it was nice to watch. A feature that I like about it is that Shido dates are just like one of those dating games, with speech options that can change the anime\'s course. Obviously, Shido is able to take his own decisions in some crucial situations.Short and funny, with some fanservice, I enjoyed it a lot and will maybe rewatch it sometimes. Knowing that it\'ll have a sequel makes me kinda excited, my expectations grow above season 2 and I\'ll surely watch it. the experience.

Now, is that a bad thing? Well, for people that want an anime that makes them think, or at the very least anime with innovation, then yes, it is. However, not everyone on the planet is like that.The story is basic, predictable, and fairly poor. There's not really an overarching plot from all 12 episodes, but rather a couple of small stories contained into one series with some filler too, well,...fill 12 episodes. Nothing worth noting.The protagonist is the same copy and paste hero from every harem you've ever seen. However, he doesn't matter. What matters is the girls! You got Kotori Itsuka which is your typical tsudere imouto that everyone either loves or hates (I'm on the hate side). Tooka Yatogami is the main girl, and she's pretty forgettable to be honest. Origami Tobiichi is much of the same, constantly fighting with Tooka to see who Shido will love more or something like that. Yoshino is a shy loli, and that's about it. Then, there's Kurumi, who is probably the most interesting character out of the bunch.These characters, aside from two of them, don't change from episode 1 to episode 2, except for the fact that they love Shido. The side characters are so forgettable that I don't even remember their names. I think there was a teacher that looked younger than the girls did. Maybe that was a joke. Or maybe all of these characters are jokes.Art and sound are good. A lot of these harem shows seem to have a good visual and audio aesthetic because pretty things + boobs = money.

It's not horrible by any means, but it's definitely not great either.Overall, it was a fun and terrible experience that I would definitely not want to go back to. fill 12 episodes. Nothing worth noting.The protagonist is the same copy and paste hero from every harem you've ever seen. However, he doesn't matter. What matters is the girls! You got Kotori Itsuka which is your typical tsudere imouto that everyone either loves or hates (I'm on the hate side). Tooka Yatogami is the main girl, and she's pretty forgettable to be honest. Origami Tobiichi is much of the same, constantly fighting with Tooka to see who Shido will love more or something like that. Yoshino is a shy loli, and that's about it. Then, there's Kurumi, who is probably the most interesting character out of the bunch.These characters, aside from two of them, don't change from episode 1 to episode 2, except for the fact that they love Shido. The side characters are so forgettable that I don't even remember their names. I think there was a teacher that looked younger than the girls did. Maybe that was a joke.

For instance, the ""princess spirit"" Goes from noble-amnesiac hardy warrior to common jelous-type school girl.

The opening sequence is a complete rip the first 3 pages from the akira manga (completely unrelated to the rest of what I have to say, but I feel the need to point this out).

Multiple times, Shidou is given generated lines...to say to Touka from the strange dating sim program that is used to monitor the engagement. However, every time that Shidou uses these lines, which are told to him by the crew who vote on 3 presented dialogue options via democracy, they always backfire, but whenever Shidou says something on his own volition, things always seem to work out.

While there\'s still the case of an average Joe gaining the attraction of several girls, this time him doing so is necessary to save the world. It\'s a silly premise that somehow manages to work very well, and ultimately ends up being one of the more complex and serious of the genre. While it does have many flaws and you definitely shouldn\'t go in expecting any...kind of realism, it\'s still a great take on the genre that many will likely regard as a breath of fresh air.Story (7/10):The story is set in in an alternate version of modern-day Japan, where mysterious disasters called ""spatial quakes"" have occurred on a regular basis for the past 30 years. As it turns out, these phenomena are caused by interdimensional beings called Spirits, who look like normal girls but have extraordinary powers. Attempting to counter this threat are two secret organizations- the Anti-Spriit Team, a military unit dedicated to hunting down and killing Spirits, and Ratatoskr, who sympathise with the Spirits and want to save both them and the world. And at the centre of all of this is Shido Itsuka, a 16-year-old boy who has no experience with the opposite sex and discovers that he somehow has the ability to seal a Spirit\'s powers via a kiss, and is recruited by Ratatoskr to help fulfill their mission.Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong! Because while Shido has the ability to to seal a Spirit\'s powers, first he needs to make them actually want to kiss them- in other words, he has to make them fall in love with him by dating them, hence the title ""Date A Live"". Essentially, he has to find out what they like, be nice to them, make them as happy as possible, then seal their abilities. However, things rarely go according to plan, especially since almost every Spirit is a tougher nut to crack than the last. Making things more complicated is that a third mysterious organization is operating behind the scenes, and seems to want to weaponize the Spirits for some sinister purpose.While the story is definitely original and interesting, it\'s unfortunately also rather formulaic. With few exceptions, each arc follows more or less the same pattern- Spirit appears, meets Shido, he gets to know her and figures out what makes her happy, she falls in love with him and he seals her powers, rinse and repeat. Another problem is that the series enjoys its mysteries a little too much. For starters, there\'s the nature behind Shido\'s Spirit-sealing power. Exactly why he, of all people, has this ability is only really questioned once in the whole series, and by the end of the third season we\'re still no closer to getting any answers. Nor are we any closer to learning the evil organization\'s ultimate goal or precisely how it involves the Spirits. Oftentimes, it feels like watching two separate stories simultaneously, with the two of them only really coming together once near the end of the second season, which makes it feel rather disjointed. Overall, the story could be a lot worse, but it\'s definitely not something you should watch the series for.Art & Animation (8/10):Despite the fact that each season of the anime is done by a different studio, all of them look basically the same, which is to say they don\'t really stand out when compared to most other anime. While the art is smooth and detailed, there are ultimately very few standout character designs or particularly notable special effects. There\'s a surprisingly small amount of fanservice, however, and the fanservice that is there avoids being gratuitous, which I know a lot of people will find refreshing.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Date A Live""\'s soundtrack is pretty average for the most part, but there are still some great tracks to be found. One notable example is the first season\'s opening, named after the series itself, which proved to be so good that I couldn\'t watch an episode without listening to it. Sadly, ""tough act to follow"" is in full effect here, as the openings of the following two seasons didn\'t resonate with me nearly as well, though they\'re still far from bad. The voice acting is solid, featuring a number of great talents such as Josh Grelle and Alexis Tipton, who voice Shido and Kurumi, respectively. For a lesser known example, there\'s Michelle Rojas, who does a fantastic job as Tohka, and overall I can\'t really think of any bad performances in the series.Characters (7.5/10):I\'ll start with the protagonist of the series, as usual. While he may have initially been dragged into the organization, Shido does clearly believe in Ratatoskr\'s cause. He always tries his hardest to save everyone and wants all of the Spirits to be happy, and so he helps Ratatoskr because like them, he wants the best outcome for everyone. However, while he may work for the happiness of everyone and is extremely forgiving, there are limits to his patience and it\'s possible for him to be annoyed by or even hate someone, which helps flesh out his personality. On the other hand, there are also times when he can be too nice for his own good, to the point that he lets his personal feelings cloud his judgment, forcing more pragmatic characters to remind him of the bigger picture. It\'s small things like this that make Shido both flawed and relatable as well as extremely likable, and helps him stand with the girls who surround him rather than behind them.Next up is Tohka Yatogami, the first Spirit that Shido meets and the overall main heroine of the series. When Shido first meets her, she doesn\'t even have a name, forcing Shido to give her one, and is extremely naive and gullible, which makes for plenty of hilarious moments. Being dumb can easily make a character annoying but Tohka somehow manages to make it work, especially since she never gets people into trouble with her stupidity. However, while not the brightest, she can be surprisingly insightful at times, especially when it comes to her fellow Spirits, and is also very sweet and nice. This makes her extremely endearing, and while the show\'s format should easily result in her being pushed to the sidelines, thankfully that never happens and she gets a chance to shine at least once per season, cementing her as my favourite character.Coming right behind Tohka is Kurumi Tokisaki, the third Spirit Shido encounters and the one regarded as the most dangerous. She has a wide array of abilities, many of which involve time and are generally activated by shooting herself in the head, which brings ""Persona 3"" to mind. At first, she comes off as little more than a murdering sociopath, but overtime we realise that she\'s much more than that, even if she doesn\'t like people knowing it. In fact, an entire OVA is dedicated to the fact that she\'s much more than she seems. Overall, while I didn\'t like her quite as much as Tohka, she is probably the most complex character in the series, which is impressive since she never really becomes part of the regular cast.Besides these three, the show features a pretty large cast of characters, mostly female but there are a few male characters as well. It\'s definitely not the most diverse cast I\'ve ever seen (a desire to be accepted being a common trait in all of the heroines, as well as several characters having multiple personalities), but overall they\'re interesting, well-written and likable with one exception; Origami, between her dryness, submissiveness (which she eventually grows out of in the WORST way possible), biased hatred of Spirits, complete obsession with revenge and mindset equivalent to that of a sociopathic four-year-old, failed to win me over. It\'s just ridiculous that we\'re supposed to believe she\'s a protagonist, as throughout the show\'s three seasons she constantly makes situations much harder than they need to be and whenever she starts to show some sign of redemption, something happens immediately afterwards that invalidates it. They really should have just written out Origami at the end of the first season, as all she really does is take up screentime that could be spent on any number of more interesting characters, Kurumi in particular.Enjoyment (8/10):""Date A Live"" is a very enjoyable series from start to finish. Not only is there plenty of great comedy, in no small part thanks to Tohka, but there are also a lot of fantastic action scenes, particularly as more and more Spirits and actual villains get introduced. While the repetition of the arcs does hinder the enjoyment somewhat, it never does so enough for the show to become boring, and the series never drags things out for too long.Overall:""Date A Live"" isn\'t the best harem anime ever made, and indeed to more cynical people it can sometimes feel like watching someone else play a dating sim. Thankfully, it\'s a very interesting and entertaining dating sim with great comedy and action, well-written characters and some really memorable music. While there isn\'t anything particularly exceptional about it, and the story in particular could use some work, if you enjoy harem anime, you will definitely enjoy this.Score:7+8+8.5+7.5+8=39/50=7.8/10 kind of realism, it\'s still a great take on the genre that many will likely regard as a breath of fresh air.Story (7/10):The story is set in in an alternate version of modern-day Japan, where mysterious disasters called ""spatial quakes"" have occurred on a regular basis for the past 30 years.

Essentially, he has to find out what they like, be nice to them, make them as happy as possible, then seal their abilities. However, things rarely go according to plan, especially since almost every Spirit is a tougher nut to crack than the last. Making things more complicated is that a third mysterious organization is operating behind the scenes, and seems to want to weaponize the Spirits for some sinister purpose.While the story is definitely original and interesting, it\'s unfortunately also rather formulaic. With few exceptions, each arc follows more or less the same pattern- Spirit appears, meets Shido, he gets to know her and figures out what makes her happy, she falls in love with him and he seals her powers, rinse and repeat. Another problem is that the series enjoys its mysteries a little too much. For starters, there\'s the nature behind Shido\'s Spirit-sealing power. Exactly why he, of all people, has this ability is only really questioned once in the whole series, and by the end of the third season we\'re still no closer to getting any answers. Nor are we any closer to learning the evil organization\'s ultimate goal or precisely how it involves the Spirits. Oftentimes, it feels like watching two separate stories simultaneously, with the two of them only really coming together once near the end of the second season, which makes it feel rather disjointed. Overall, the story could be a lot worse, but it\'s definitely not something you should watch the series for.Art & Animation (8/10):Despite the fact that each season of the anime is done by a different studio, all of them look basically the same, which is to say they don\'t really stand out when compared to most other anime. While the art is smooth and detailed, there are ultimately very few standout character designs or particularly notable special effects. There\'s a surprisingly small amount of fanservice, however, and the fanservice that is there avoids being gratuitous, which I know a lot of people will find refreshing.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Date A Live""\'s soundtrack is pretty average for the most part, but there are still some great tracks to be found. One notable example is the first season\'s opening, named after the series itself, which proved to be so good that I couldn\'t watch an episode without listening to it. Sadly, ""tough act to follow"" is in full effect here, as the openings of the following two seasons didn\'t resonate with me nearly as well, though they\'re still far from bad. The voice acting is solid, featuring a number of great talents such as Josh Grelle and Alexis Tipton, who voice Shido and Kurumi, respectively. For a lesser known example, there\'s Michelle Rojas, who does a fantastic job as Tohka, and overall I can\'t really think of any bad performances in the series.Characters (7.5/10):I\'ll start with the protagonist of the series, as usual. While he may have initially been dragged into the organization, Shido does clearly believe in Ratatoskr\'s cause. He always tries his hardest to save everyone and wants all of the Spirits to be happy, and so he helps Ratatoskr because like them, he wants the best outcome for everyone. However, while he may work for the happiness of everyone and is extremely forgiving, there are limits to his patience and it\'s possible for him to be annoyed by or even hate someone, which helps flesh out his personality. On the other hand, there are also times when he can be too nice for his own good, to the point that he lets his personal feelings cloud his judgment, forcing more pragmatic characters to remind him of the bigger picture. It\'s small things like this that make Shido both flawed and relatable as well as extremely likable, and helps him stand with the girls who surround him rather than behind them.Next up is Tohka Yatogami, the first Spirit that Shido meets and the overall main heroine of the series. When Shido first meets her, she doesn\'t even have a name, forcing Shido to give her one, and is extremely naive and gullible, which makes for plenty of hilarious moments. Being dumb can easily make a character annoying but Tohka somehow manages to make it work, especially since she never gets people into trouble with her stupidity. However, while not the brightest, she can be surprisingly insightful at times, especially when it comes to her fellow Spirits, and is also very sweet and nice. This makes her extremely endearing, and while the show\'s format should easily result in her being pushed to the sidelines, thankfully that never happens and she gets a chance to shine at least once per season, cementing her as my favourite character.Coming right behind Tohka is Kurumi Tokisaki, the third Spirit Shido encounters and the one regarded as the most dangerous. She has a wide array of abilities, many of which involve time and are generally activated by shooting herself in the head, which brings ""Persona 3"" to mind. At first, she comes off as little more than a murdering sociopath, but overtime we realise that she\'s much more than that, even if she doesn\'t like people knowing it. In fact, an entire OVA is dedicated to the fact that she\'s much more than she seems. Overall, while I didn\'t like her quite as much as Tohka, she is probably the most complex character in the series, which is impressive since she never really becomes part of the regular cast.Besides these three, the show features a pretty large cast of characters, mostly female but there are a few male characters as well. It\'s definitely not the most diverse cast I\'ve ever seen (a desire to be accepted being a common trait in all of the heroines, as well as several characters having multiple personalities), but overall they\'re interesting, well-written and likable with one exception; Origami, between her dryness, submissiveness (which she eventually grows out of in the WORST way possible), biased hatred of Spirits, complete obsession with revenge and mindset equivalent to that of a sociopathic four-year-old, failed to win me over. It\'s just ridiculous that we\'re supposed to believe she\'s a protagonist, as throughout the show\'s three seasons she constantly makes situations much harder than they need to be and whenever she starts to show some sign of redemption, something happens immediately afterwards that invalidates it. They really should have just written out Origami at the end of the first season, as all she really does is take up screentime that could be spent on any number of more interesting characters, Kurumi in particular.Enjoyment (8/10):""Date A Live"" is a very enjoyable series from start to finish. Not only is there plenty of great comedy, in no small part thanks to Tohka, but there are also a lot of fantastic action scenes, particularly as more and more Spirits and actual villains get introduced. While the repetition of the arcs does hinder the enjoyment somewhat, it never does so enough for the show to become boring, and the series never drags things out for too long.Overall:""Date A Live"" isn\'t the best harem anime ever made, and indeed to more cynical people it can sometimes feel like watching someone else play a dating sim. Thankfully, it\'s a very interesting and entertaining dating sim with great comedy and action, well-written characters and some really memorable music. While there isn\'t anything particularly exceptional about it, and the story in particular could use some work, if you enjoy harem anime, you will definitely enjoy this.Score:7+8+8.5+7.5+8=39/50=7.8/10', 'This being one of the first Romance and Harem Anime I ever watched impressed me and pulled me into the genres it depicts. Date A Live is right up my ally for these types of genres for Anime. My initial feelings started right from episode 1 as I was introduced to the ever so beautiful futuristic fantasy setting. The part of the first episode where Date A Live introduced me to Shido\'s connection and relationship between befriended damsel Tohka. I knew right from Episde 1, I would enjoy this series. Date A Live expresses the feeling of relationships with surrounding spirits/females that establish a sense...of security, love, and happiness. It also makes me realize how love and friendship is important. Also Date A Live seems to stretch to the cornerstone of the Slice of Life genre, being that it shows you can be faced with the dangers of making wrong decisions and regretting some choices that you make, whether it be betraying your loved one\'s trust and companionship or faced with a danger itself of having those closest to you took away. I absolutely favor the genres of this Anime such as Romance, Fantasy, SOL, and Harem. I also favor the ""Damsel in Distress"" situations as seen in some romance anime.

Do you think dates are sweet at the very start? do you expect anything good on the first date? it\'s the same as implanting seeds in the soil it\'s painful work in order to harvest something, So when it come to date a live you need to keep watching till you get to smell the beautiful scent and to enjoy the tasty fruit.While season 1 date a live make the viewer wanting to drop the anime? it\'s still pointing at Bright future with very few and short non-understandable scenes, the anime might be...developing slowly but Dates doesn\'t bear fruit in 1day, Note that Date A live is a 5x seasons of anime.despite the general idea of ""oh no it\'s another harem anime"" it\'s not even close to be considered as that, there was a reason behind every single girl appearing in date a live with passing of time and since this review aim to encourage people to watch Date alive i can\'t reveal any awesome spoiler, So you need to start your Date <3 and hopefully you\'ll find a waifu among date alive adorable characters.the story, the music, the characters!

All are great, the Season1 ova DATE TO DATE is a fantastic (^ ‿ ^)', 'Before I begin my review, I want to say that my reviews are not the best. If you want a in-depth review on the series, I probably will not to be able to deliver, but you can stay around if you want.Besides Date A Live being in my favorites list here on MAL, it isn\'t the best thing around. In fact, the story is quite simple, it reminds me a lot about a similar series called ""Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai"". But, we aren\'t here to compare series, that\'s what recommendations are for.I watched Date A Live around two months ago, and my memory is...quite vague so, do not expect me to remember everything about it. I remember the general story and the big things that happened, but some little scenes I might not remember.Date A Live\'s story follows a completely normal teenage guy named Itsuka Shido. When a spatial quake happens one day, he goes looking for his sister. Spatial quakes occur in this series when Spirit\'s appear, or whatever the other reason is. I think there is another reason, or I might be delusional. But, he goes looking for his sister and then gets caught up in the spatial quake and dies. Kidding. Anyway, turns out his sister is some kind of commander in some giant spaceship thingy.The reason this story reminds me of what I said above, is that, to make Spirits turn back into normal people, people that don\'t want to absolutely massacre people, Itsuka has to kiss them. Which is basically, ""using love to draw out the runaway spirit"" from the series \'Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai\'. Dayum, I should really make a recommendation... Hmm. I\'ll think about that. Anyway, he encounters a lot of spirits, even a crazy one that has killed 10,000 people and is still my favorite, and, a lot of other stuff.The art style for the anime is pretty good, like I say with a lot of things. My biggest concern isn\'t really the art style, but, if the anime is GOOD, then I\'ll keep on watching it, regardless of the garbage art style. I usually watch anime for the incredible story and great voice acting.I have not listening to the soundtrack to this anime properly, so I cannot properly judge it. But, from what I have heard, the soundtrack is... fair. It\'s okay. It\'s not the best thing in existent, but, what do you want, the entire Monster soundtrack?The characters in the series is probably my favorite part about this series, even the part where I don\'t even know if I\'m spelling \'favorite\' right, but, who cares. One of the characters in this series are in my top 5 favorite characters, so, the characters have got to be great, even the annoying, weird... creepy.... psychopathic... yandere... ones.Yatogami Tohka is kind of an idiot, in my opinion, she\'s not really that great, in my opinion once again. She\'s probably my least favorite character in the series, but, she\'s still funny and great nevertheless. I don\'t think the series could of really progressed without her... actually, it could of, but I\'m trying to sound smart, \'kay?! Anyway, Touka/Tohka... don\'t know how to spell, is actually quite an interesting character.Yoshino (does she have a last name?) is probably the cutest out of the spirits and I give her credit for that. Not a lot of characters pass in my book of cute characters, in fact I only have 5-10 characters in all 60 anime I\'ve seen that I actually think are cute. Possibly even less.Itsuka Shido is the main protagonist of the story, and I really couldn\'t really care about him any less. I don\'t think he can even die, so what\'s the point in caring a lot about him. But, he isn\'t that bad of a character, I just couldn\'t care less about him.Itsuka Kotori is, obviously, Shido\'s sister. She\'s the commander of giant ship thingy and has a person on-board her ship that is a giant pervert and likes Kotori stepping on him. Ha. Really weird.Tobiichi Origami is the weridest character I\'ve ever run across. In any anime. But, she\'s probably the source of humor for the show, maybe, I haven\'t seen the second season, who knows, maybe Shido will be the funniest shit ever, but, this girl is hilarious, and, at times, kind of annoying.Lastly, Kurumi Tokisaki is the most craziest spirit in this series, and... is my absolutely favorite fucking character ever. Kurumi Tokisaki probably tops as my Number 1 Waifu, and I have no... clue... why. Well, nothing\'ll probably explain my love for Kurumi Tokisaki, but she wins.And thus, that ends my review. Total, I give this anime a 7/10, and... who said your favorites have to be 10/10\'s? Well, I don\'t think anybody did, but I\'ll stop this review before I get delusional and start magically killing the people reading it... Oh wait, shit, that guy died. quite vague so, do not expect me to remember everything about it.

Oh wait, shit, that guy died.', 'This was a rather interesting show. The concept of the show was fairly nice however, it reminded me too much of the World God Only Knows in a sense. Storyline was sort-of as follows: People are in trouble from giant black balls of darkness. Turns out some weird girls are causing them. Send in some random guy to make them fall in love and lose their powers. Girls fall in love and lose their powers. Guy profits by building up a harem throughout the season and becomes a pimp. I don\'t think it could get any more generic than that but it possibly could. This...is indeed a harem anime to an extent. It\'s not like the typical harem anime, more like a spiced harem in a sense. Take note that the characters don\'t get a whole lot of development in this show. I mean, there is some background explained for each character to a very small extent but that\'s just about it. Otherwise, the characters are kinda dull and a little bit typical of a harem anime. I liked how they basically tried to make the harem genre more interesting simply by adding a ""serious"" sounding storyline. I can\'t really say for sure if there was really a big plot to this whole show but I don\'t think there was. The show was mainly divided up into miniature arcs that had something to do with one another but it\'s not like there was some big major ending to it if you get what I mean. This show was good for what it was worth though. If you are into the whole harem thing but are not getting yourself off on the typical mundane harem anymore, Date A Live would definitely be a nice change of pace if you ask me. I would recommend it, but don\'t expect too much out of this show. is indeed a harem anime to an extent. It\'s not like the typical harem anime, more like a spiced harem in a sense.

I must say, I did not regret my time used on this anime overall. The story is pretty simple: mystics beings appear on planet Earth and the only way to combat with them is by using force. But, there is another way. Make them fall in love with our male protagonist. I feel like I have already seen this kind of story somewhere before.As far as i'm concerned, the art was great! Everything had it's detail.

This series has, apparently gained a significant amount of popularity.  It hasn’t been to years and we’ve already had two seasons and a movie has been green-lite.  Honestly, I don’t get the hype this show has.  The premise is one of the stupidest premises for a series I’ve seen.  Beyond that it’s just a generic harem that we’ve seen done hundreds of times before.  The characters, except one, are stale and boring.  The villains are terrible....The comic relief is painfully unfunny.  There isn’t much to this show but I’m going to be as fair as possible here.The series does have some things going for it.  The animation is pretty good, though it does take a slight drop in season 2.  The animation regarding the fight scenes are particularly well-done.  The music is decent.  The two openings and endings pretty good especially season 2’s opening theme.  The score is fine too.  There are a couple of good and memorable tracks.  I also like the character designs (except Shido’s) especially designs of the Spirits.  There is one other good thing which I’ll get to.The first problem is the premise itself.  This idea is stupid even by harem anime standards.  This premise sounds more like the premise to a hentai.  Shido can somehow seal a Spirit’s power by kissing her which is never explained by the way.  Ratatosk also has Kotori and a team of dating experts constantly breathing down Shido’s neck which ultimately serves no real purpose and is just there for comic relief that isn’t very funny.  The crew of dating experts they recruit are supposed to be the best in the world but the advice they give Shido is often just retarded.  Their main source of information is basically the equivalent to Japanese visual novels.  Who thought this was a good idea?The next worst thing is the characters.  They are all simply tired stereotypes.  Firstly you have your lead Shido who is just your generic main character we’ve seen in God knows how many anime.  His design generic and lame and he has zero personality.  These types of characters are my biggest pet peeve when it comes to anime/manga.  It’s clear that these characters are only there to serve as wish-fulfillment characters and to give the audience someone to relate to.  You can have a relatable character without making him look generic, be a loser, and be devoid of personality.  The prime example is Yusuke Urameshi from Yu Yu Hakusho.  He is relatable but he also has a distinct and likable personality and he’s a true badass.  We need more Yusuke type characters in anime and especially in harem series then I would believe all these women being attracted to them.The second big character is Tohka who is the main heroine of the series (and I use that term loosely) and Shido’s primary love interest.  While she starts off okay and I like her design I ultimately don’t care for her.  She doesn’t do that much despite being the female lead, she’s just an airhead most of the time, and she can get quite annoying at points.You also have the quiet reserved girls Yoshino who is another Spirit and Origami who works as a soldier for the AST.  You have Shido’s sister, Kotori, who is a basic tsundere character which is an archetype that I usually can’t stand and she’s no exception.  There is Shido’s other sister, Mana, who is just as bland and boring as he is.The only worthwhile character in this entire series is a Spirit named Kurumi.  She starts out as the villain in season 1 but in season 2 becomes more of an anti-hero or anti-villain (whichever one it is).  She is your typical yandere character but I found myself enjoying her.  Her design is great, her powers are interesting and cool to look at, and her personality just feels refreshing and fun compared to everything else in this show.  She is, without a doubt, the best character in the show.  She’s not amazing or anything but compared to the rest of the cast she’s definitely a step up.  I think she’s wasted on this show.The other characters aren’t even worth talking about.  They do try to make some of the characters standout from the crowd by giving them some weird quirks.  For example, Yoshino often talks through a hand puppet.  Origami is not only a reserved girl but is also a stalker character when it comes to Shido, though it’s played for laughs (ineffectively I might add).  Despite this the characters are still stale and boring.The comedy doesn’t work at all.  From the stupid comedy from Kotori’s so-called dating experts to the traditional harem anime humor it just doesn’t work for me here.  There isn’t even that much fan service.  Don’t get me wrong there is fan service in this but it’s pretty tame compared to other big harem anime like High School DXD, Sekirei, To Love-Ru, etc.  Fan service is a small point but if the story and characters aren’t grabbing me I have to gravitate to something.  Usually shows like this at least have T&A down but here there really isn’t that much of it.Overall, Date A Live is extremely overhyped.  If you’re looking for a harem series to watch there are many better choices like High School DXD.  That series has better characters, better story, and definitely more fan service which is what the majority watch these anime for.  There isn’t much going for this series.  All the characters suck save one.  The premise is extremely lame and poorly executed.  The only good points are the visuals, music (for the most part), and Kurumi. The comic relief is painfully unfunny.  There isn’t much to this show but I’m going to be as fair as possible here.The series does have some things going for it.

She starts out as the villain in season 1 but in season 2 becomes more of an anti-hero or anti-villain (whichever one it is).  She is your typical yandere character but I found myself enjoying her.  Her design is great, her powers are interesting and cool to look at, and her personality just feels refreshing and fun compared to everything else in this show.  She is, without a doubt, the best character in the show.  She’s not amazing or anything but compared to the rest of the cast she’s definitely a step up.  I think she’s wasted on this show.The other characters aren’t even worth talking about.  They do try to make some of the characters standout from the crowd by giving them some weird quirks.  For example, Yoshino often talks through a hand puppet.  Origami is not only a reserved girl but is also a stalker character when it comes to Shido, though it’s played for laughs (ineffectively I might add).  Despite this the characters are still stale and boring.The comedy doesn’t work at all.  From the stupid comedy from Kotori’s so-called dating experts to the traditional harem anime humor it just doesn’t work for me here.  There isn’t even that much fan service.  Don’t get me wrong there is fan service in this but it’s pretty tame compared to other big harem anime like High School DXD, Sekirei, To Love-Ru, etc.  Fan service is a small point but if the story and characters aren’t grabbing me I have to gravitate to something.  Usually shows like this at least have T&A down but here there really isn’t that much of it.Overall, Date A Live is extremely overhyped.  If you’re looking for a harem series to watch there are many better choices like High School DXD.  That series has better characters, better story, and definitely more fan service which is what the majority watch these anime for.  There isn’t much going for this series.  All the characters suck save one.  The premise is extremely lame and poorly executed.  The only good points are the visuals, music (for the most part), and Kurumi.', ""I really love this anime.It has a really nice and fine paced and directed story.The art quality is really nice.The characters were really nicely expressed and they were nice. Although i love everyone of them but kurumi has a special spot. I love her, she's a yandere but she has a really kawaii side of her too.And the sounds and openings and stuff was mindblowing, it kinda had a nostalgic feel to it too....I had Fun watching it. It was really good and I loved it no matter how much i say.So I give a 10/10 for it I had Fun watching it. It was really good and I loved it no matter how much i say.So I give a 10/10 for it"", 'Date a live sucks it’s one of the mostcliched Anime iv ever seen. all the characters  have personality’s that iv seen before. you’ve got the tsundere, the Kundere and the happy go lucky one. The main character is also absolutely annoying the animation and sound design are the only good things. the animation is clean and looks great and the sound design when the characters are fighting sounds good . Everything else is just terrible and nothing that you haven’t seen before  there is also one another thingthat is good about this about anime....and that is best girl, best girl is kurumi and makes the anime. overall the anime is terrible but there are good things but it’s not enough. and that is best girl, best girl is kurumi and makes the anime. overall the anime is terrible but there are good things but it’s not enough.', ""I first thought about Date a Live the first season I did watch last year before season 3 release the shows it was pretty good but first of main protagonist look handsome the fanseverice  and Ecchi look wholesome character development was pretty okay but i don't like where Origami hurting kotori for getting revenge of her killing family but it was mistake later on but yoshino look so cute even she cry when she lost her puppet where there on trip. Kurumi she absolutely best villain of all time i like fight scene with kotori it so cool and I like the sound effect...on kurumi it was incredible and I did got spoiled from 2018 before Idiscovered anime but overall the first season it was great BTW. on kurumi it was incredible and I did got spoiled from 2018 before Idiscovered anime but overall the first season it was great BTW."", 'A guilty pleasure, to be completely honest. Date A Live was a show I didn\'t think I would enjoy much. Mostly due to the harem setup that usually bogs down the rest of the show. Weirdly enough that isn\'t so much the case here, but I\'ll go into further detail later on. Let\'s get started.Story: 7A weird one to say the least, but a concept rarely seen (at least for me). To keep it frank, other-worldly beings appear on earth causing destructive ""Space-quakes"" and a team is formed to kill them so they don\'t do it again. But our main character joins another team to...try and stop the quakes using the very thing that the show is titled around. DATING. Let the harem ensue. While the plot isn\'t in your face all the time, there is definitely progression happening through the episodes. It only ramps up here and there and when it comes to a genre like this, it is a welcome pacing. There is definitely filler episodes and are usually dumb plots but they are funny and that\'s good because if you aren\'t going to be serious, be funny. The first season will leave a lot of questions for you and not all of them will be filled by season 2\'s end but we are getting ahead of ourselves with that. Just know that this plot is smooth and easy to follow but not disregard-able.Art: 8The show looks nice and I didn\'t find myself disliking any of the animation or scenes based on looks alone. While not the most over the top looking anime, the show does look really good. Not much else to say really.Sound: 10I loved the sound work on this one. This is one of the few times where I flip through the OST listening to different tracks and remembering when they used them in the show. The Opening is great and really sets you up for some high strung fun while two of the ending leave you bumping along to the song and ready to watch another episode. The third ending, which they used in two occasions, was a nice follow up to how the episode ended and I like how they were really diverse with how the episodes ended. Long story short, I love the OST and have a few of the tracks on my phone right now lol.Voice acting was good too. lolCharacters: 9This is where the gripes I have come in. For the most part, the characters are really great and show a lot of emotion and a bit of uniqueness. Tohka and Kurumi are two that will come to mind when you look back on this show. Tohka is so god damn cute with how she does things that even her dim-wittedness will be hard to hate and Kurumi is main waifu lol. Sorry but I just love her personality a lot. So throw me in biased jail if need be. But there is a character that takes the fun away for me a bit, Origami. I like her but the fact that ""why she is the way she is"" is never explained so her character is kind of thrown onto us. One of my main questions to this day is ""why is she like this?"". You will know what I mean when you watch it, trust me.Enjoyment: 8Like I said earlier, this show was a guilty pleasure for me. I will admit that the harem genre is a flawed genre to begin with and that most shows that fall under this format tend to be unoriginal and lacking any form of plot. And this show can sometimes get lost in it\'s harem ways to forget about the plot entirely for a few episodes. But even show, there is a lot to enjoy here for those who take the time to watch.Overall: 8Also, since the seasons, as well as the OVA\'s and the movie, are separated here on this site, I will take the total review score and add it to the next score. So if you wanna keep track, the review train will go Season 1, OVA 1 (Date to Date), Season 2, OVA 2 Encore, DAL Mayuri\'s Judgment.

Humanity has tried several ways of combating these Spirits until they finally set up on just using violence. A new method, however, was recently proposed, one without violence. And that method is kissing the Spirits to seal their destructive powers. Also, did I...say all the spirits happen to be girls?Date A Live uses its premise that would usually be shamed as just another excuse for a harem set-up in a very comedic way. And, it works, Date A Live manages to be genuinely funny and entertaining with its tongue in cheek execution. Date A Live manages to poke fun at waifuism, the harem genre, fan service scenes, and most importantly, the visual novel medium. There is one major problem though. During the middle, Date A Live realizes it’s time to stop joking around and time to form a serious plot. This is a big problem, because during the rest of the duration of the series, Date A Live is actually trying to be serious, and it does NOT work. An antagonist with no real depth is shoehorned in, just because there needs to be one. Drama commonly occurs, with no development or progression gained from it, it’s just there for there to be drama. Characters previously pushed aside become relevant only when the plot needs them to. Date A Live’s previously enjoyable comedic tones are ruined just because the writers felt there was a necessity for an actual plot to take place. 5/10Characters- Date A Live is a harem anime at its core, so it’s characters aren’t anything special in terms of depth, but that isn’t always necessarily bad. Our main character, Shido Itsuka, is a white knight who plays the role of making the Spirits fall in love with him in order to seal their powers. With visual novel tropes, he succeeds in the comedic process of it. There’s a problem in this though, during each conquest of a Spirit, Date a Live seems to develop and characterize each Spirit through and through. During the end of it, however, Date A Live pushes off whatever development each Spirit got and just makes them a side joke for Shido’s harem, which wouldn’t be a problem if it wasn’t for the aforementioned serious plot that Date a Live tries to play later on. So basically, Date A Live isn’t winning anything in the character department.Rambling aside, Date A Live’s grills do have a charismatic charm to them that makes them good picks for waifus. My particular favorites include Tohka and Kotori, so if you’re into those types of things, Date A Live does carry it around marvelously. 5/10Art/Animation- Date A Live looks beautiful. It is consistent in quality, barley ever showing any off model scenes. The animation is pretty good, albeit nothing outstanding, but it doesn’t really need any fancy animation for the type of show it is. The most redeeming point of Date a Live, however, are the character designs for the grills. Examples being Kurumi and Yoshino, the former having a very appealing design that is obvious waifu bait, and the latter having a unique one that doesn’t seem to have been done before. Date A Live’s art does a good job distracting the viewer from its narrative flaws by having them focus on the grills. 8/10Sound- For me particularly, not much of the soundtrack from Date A Live stood out. This isn’t to say that it’s bad. Date A Live’s soundtrack does a very good job at what it’s supposed to do, create a mood. The soundtrack accompanies whatever situation is going on onscreen in a synergetic manner, having no particular scene stand out because of it’s lack of music or inappropriate use of music. The voice actors do a good job making the characters, particularly the grills, stand out. As, as for the OP and ED, they’re nothing special. The OP gets you pumped for the episodes like it’s supposed to, and the ED is your average romance song sang from a female character’s point of view, of course, this is all subjective to one’s musical taste. 7/10Enjoyment- Despite what may seem like me ranting on the show, Date A Live is a very enjoyable piece of media, shockingly enough. Maybe it’s the grills, maybe it’s the hope for it getting better, maybe it’s the fact that even though it tries to pull off a serious plot it still keeps some of its comedic tone, I don’t know, but Date A Live was a blast to watch. If you want to turn off your mind, but still want to watch something enjoyable, Date A Live is a good anime to watch if you don’t mind it’s narrative flaws. 8/10Overall - Date A Live’s narrative does not work taken seriously, it has many flaws that don’t allow it to strive in a medium where originality is highly praised. If you’re looking for a story with depth, developed characters, a strong story, or if you’re bothered by every minor flaw of something, look away, Date A Live is not for you. If you’re a fan of the harem genre, looking for some good waifus, or if you just want to relax to a senseless anime, then Date A Live is a good recommendation. 6/10 say all the spirits happen to be girls?Date A Live uses its premise that would usually be shamed as just another excuse for a harem set-up in a very comedic way.

He is specially gifted to help the girls in the series, most of which are spirits, powerful beings which have wrecked havoc and destruction throughout the land.

The result is good, the story was funny bringing some actions and battles, nothing to say. I love the ending too and I\'m looking forward the second season.Art (9/10)Art was great, nothing...spectacular but everything was well drawn, the battles were well animated and all emotions in each character were well represented.Character (8/10)Every Character was unique, and I respect that. Each Spirits had a completely different personality and it\'s making the anime more funny like this, since Shidou has to deal with all of them. Shidou was great too, as a main character, switching from a normal coward guy to a bad ass ""I\'m going to save the world while dating plenty of girls¨ guy, and that makes him a really funny character.Enjoyment (8/10)It was a good and short anime, good for laughing with a couple of funny passages and the story was not bad either, and since the action start from episode 1, you dive in the anime very quickly.

Spacequakes are basically an occurrence that involves a space to be engulfed by a purple dome, eventually decimating whatever was inside said dome, and wiping away its existence.  Our main protagonist Shidou starts as a normal high school boy, but soon becomes the ""savior"" of creatures that look like normal high school girls known as...spirits, aka the cause of the spacequakes.  Shidou now has a destiny.  To either let them destroy the world as they please, or date them and kiss them in order to seal away their powers.  (Sounds a lot like TWGOK to me.)  Meanwhile, the anti-spirit team, or AST hunts down spirits and does basically what Shidou is doing.  Only more violently.  Although this anime is only 12 episodes long, it actually doesn\'t waste the small timespan it has on random side stories.  There was that one episode that was a huge waste of time, but that can be ignored, kind of.  They actually drive the story plots well enough in order to create a clear and concise story while staying true to its premise.Characters: This\'ll be a long one.  First, Shidou.  As the main protagonist, Shidou has little to no experience with girls.  Because of this, dealing with spirits at first becomes rather a challenge, seeing as how they can easily kill him in one blow.  After some visual novel training, Shidou starts to accept his fate of dealing with spirits and slowly, begins to care for them as human beings.  Next, Tohka.  As the first spirit that Shidou faces, she bears the embodiment of a tsundere.  (Less tsun-, more -dere.) As glutton and a large supporter for Shidou, she cares for him greatly due to many circumstances and becomes quite helpful in certain situations.  She also has an obsession of bread.  Next, Origami.  As a member of the AST team, Origami is the embodiment of a kuudere.  As emotionless as can be, Origami is Shidou\'s self-proclaimed girlfriend and possesses stalker qualities. I.E. sniffing Shidou\'s used gym clothes.  While emotionless at times, Origami has a backstory which fits in well with her actions.  Next is Yoshino and Yoshinon.  As the dandere of the series, Yoshino is often very soft spoken and rarely speaks.  Yoshinon however is a rabbit puppet on Yoshino\'s left hand and acts as Yoshino\'s voice for the most part.  Next is Kurumi, the yandere.  Personally, my favorite female of the series due to her basic existence in the show.  As one of the more developed characters in terms of personality, Kurumi can nearly be summed up as an immortal.  With the powers of time on her side, she constantly kills ""evil"" people for their ""time"" and uses it to extend her own lifetime.  Her main goal in the series is *SPOILER*, which is very different but very good change of pace in this show.  And finally Kotori, the personality conflicted loli.  As Shido\'s foster sister, she possesses 2 distinct personalities.  One with white ribbons in her hair, giving her a little sister quality and calling Shidou ""Onii-chan"", an another with black ribbons which give her a more demanding and strict personality.  It should be good to note that she has a secret within her that creates a mystical feel to this show and can definitely peak interests.  Other characters include Ratatoskr\'s crew, Shidou\'s mental friend with a dating sim as a girlfriend, Shidou\'s real sister, and 3 random girls who literally just gossip about Shidou throughout the whole span of the show.Animation and sound:  Animation is a big, big plus for this anime.  WIth extremely high quality character designs and detail, this anime is truly pleasing to the eye.  While yes, there are some scenes that can be considered fanservice, (the spirit neutralizing scenes), there isn\'t as much as there could be with an anime like this, which is very good, don\'t get me wrong.  The fight scenes in this anime are also very superb looking with very fluent action scenes and weapon design.  Ex. Kurumi\'s clock.  The sound however can be noted, but not as highly.  The opening song is probably the most memorable thing to come out of it as it sounds pretty exciting and good.  The endings change from episode to episode and actually sound good, but are quite bland.Personal Enjoyment: For me, this is one of my favorite anime to date.  To me, it is a perfect combination of everything I love in anime and introduces a story that isn\'t complete crap vs. ""normal"" harem animes.  What I like about it is the fact that the female characters introduced early in the series get decent amount of screentime later on and still develop as proper characters.  Another thing is the small amount of girls that actually like Shidou.  With harems, a minimum of 5 girls that like the main character is the general norm for the genre.  For this, the number is significantly smaller with only 3 possible girls liking the main character, leaving room for plot development and closer relationships.  The mystical aspect of Shidou\'s power is also a good hook, but sadly, it appears much later then it should\'ve.  In the end, Date A Live is one of my personal favorite animes of all time and I would highly recommend it to people who like harems like me. spirits, aka the cause of the spacequakes.

Its a harem romcom, which has been done a lot of times. The only thing different is that he is not completely useless and can actually do something, here and there, without having to solely rely on hiss army of girls to fight every battle for him. However the concept, though not completely original...is appealing. The thought of ""capturing"" girls (almost like pokemon, in a way...bad joke) with a kiss is not something i have seen before and i have found it rather amusing. Also, how its done in a date sim, kind of way, makes this show very funny and adds that comical aspect to the story. though the story can get serious at times, here and there, though honestly, it kinda fails at doing...as it is forced.Art: Very Good (about an 8)i am actually rather impressed with the animation quality, more so than the art. the art style is kind of typical for a romcom anime, but it is still very appealing, as the costume designs for the girls are adorable or just dazzling. that probably its strong point in art design, the female characters. the male characters are rather bland, especially the main character, but oh well. The animation is very good though. its fluid when it needs to be and adds impact to the action scenes. this is clearly done when the characters are fighting in the air, as you can see the ""jet streams"" and ""shaking of the camera"" when they fly/crash down. and most other key scenes are down well, not destroying the impact felt or meant to be portrayed. Also you dont see many ""moving mouth only"" scenes...which is nice. you can tell the animators took their time when doing this anime, and that is evident everywhere.Sound:Good (about an 7)likewise with the art, i was impressed with the sound quality and the voice acting. the seiyuu are great. Practically an all-star cast and they fit the personality and image of each character very well. And plus, there were not so many annoying supporting character voices....which is nice. The OP and ED and pretty good. the ending theme is kinda weird at first, but it grows onto you and you might find yourself singing lines here and there. The OST is pretty decent, it adds impact to the scenes, but nothing extremely too memorable.Characters: Fair (about a 6)the characters, overall, are cliche. you have your hyperactive,ditzy girl (Tohka, she even likes to eat a lot, adding to that cliche); you have your cute loli goth ( Yoshinon, and of course she is shy; you have your tsundere (Kotori), which also is the little sister character as well; you have the seductive, yandere or ""enchantress"" (Kurumi)....and it goes on. Its not that these are necessarily a bad thing. Its just the same kinds of characters, done over and over, with a different character design and name. They lack any real substance to them.  The same applies to Shidou. Honestly, there isnt much to talk about the characters because they are so flat and cliche.Enjoyment:Good (about a 7)this is actually, a rather enjoyable series to watch, but you really dont watch it for the story (since there is not much of one), but mainly because it is funny to watch and the female characters are cute, holding your appeal to the show. This show is for people who either really like furufuru and comical anime, or for people who want to ""take a break"" from intense or story anime.Overall: Fair (about a 6)this wasnt a bad series, but not a completely successful one either. the reason this series held up is because of its animation quality and sound quality. Other than that there is not much too it. the concept is not original, series like TWGOK has already did the date sim kind of thing and series like Haiyore Nyaruko-san. The difference between these two is that Nyaruko-san is a parody and meant to be like that where this is allegedly not a parody. However, it was fun to watch, gave me some laughs, and the characters still hold their appeal making it watchable so i will still recommend you watching it in your free time.

Its just not a very memorable series.', 'StoryDate A Live opens with Japan’s favorite fetish: mass destruction. It then follows that with Japan’s second favorite fetish: little sister love. The anime’s opening episode introduces us to the idea of spirits and spacequakes. Spirits are…some sort of creatures that have super powers and aren’t actually explained all that well. Their appearance causes spacequakes. To combat spirits and the subsequent quakes, Japan has a ground defense force that employs young girls who wear battle gear that look more like Hyperdimension Neptunia armor designs than actual military armor.Our main character, Shido, goes out during a spacequake to save his sister, only to magically survive the...devastating encounter and meet a young spirit; a girl who doesn’t feel that she belongs. This first episode gives you the impression the anime has potential, but the second episode decides to throw that potential out the window and engage in typical harem antics with a splash of nonsensical and a few shakes of stupid.It turns out Shido’s sister is really the commander of a space ship and the goal of the crew is to make the spirits fall in love with Shido so that he holds their powers in check and they become real girls. So Shido goes out on dates with cute girls while his sister tells him what to say through an earpiece.Decisions on what he says are made through a dating game style choice system and from there I’m going to quit explaining and start complaining.The series doesn’t have an exceptional plot. It borrows heavily from other, more entertaining series to create a watchable, but wholly unimpressive piece. There are some somewhat funny moments and some decent drama, but the problem is the series doesn’t understand what it wants to be. In a typical harem/ecchi you either choose to be funny or choose to focus on story or balance both. Date A Live does none of the above and teeters to both sides in an awkward and sometimes annoying way. It also doesn’t help that the anime doesn’t excel in either field whatsoever. The comedy isn’t that funny and the story is very predictable.As far as story goes, Date A Live neglects substance in the hope you can look past that and just worry about the cute girls.AnimationYes, the girls are goddam adorable. The character design is good for some characters, boring for others. There are some very unique looking characters, especially Kurumi. The world itself is well animated and the fight scenes are very fluid and look good.SoundThe opening song is actually pretty good, though the ending fails to impress. Music during the show is typical of the genre. Voice acting is good. There’s nothing impressive to be found here.CharactersDate A Live doesn’t have bad characters, it just has generic characters. None of them particularly stand out except, once again, Kurumi. She’s an interesting character to have in a harem anime like this because of how batshit insane she is. Her power is also cool, as well as her eyes. But that’s not what the point is.The point is that Tohka is the hungry, ditzy, doesn’t know much of anything character. Yoshino is the scaredy-cat loli. Kotori is the tsundere. Kurumi is the yandere.And rounding it all out is Shido, a character who can do no wrong, protects a girl who violently murders people in front of him, and doesn’t have any problem with kissing his sister. He’s the same goddam character you can change out with half the harem titles on the market.I’m sick of being sick of these characters because I’ve spent about one hundred percent of my reviews complaining about them. Aren’t there other tropes? Isn’t there something new, or at least a typical character that is developed to such depth that they become memorable?OverallI don’t hate Date A Live, in fact I wanted to like it. The plot could have been a lot better if it neglected the comedy and focused on the proper story. The story wouldn’t have benefitted much, but it would have made a much better product.The thing about this series is that I can’t hate it. It’s not so reprehensible as to be unwatchable, it’s just another average series floating around the stagnant pool of harem comedies. There are much better examples of the genre, but there are, of course, much worse. Fans of the harem/ecchi genre will probably appreciate the series while everyone else will want to stand back and watch something with a little more depth. I enjoyed enough of it to warrant the rating I’m giving it, though you may find it a tad more underwhelming, or you may be pulled in by cute girls (if that’s your thing) and won’t be able to wait for the second season.For me, it blew some time, and it kept me moderately engaged for four hours.

Kurumi's character resembles a lot like Celes from Danganronpa in her calm and manipulative speech. Tohka's character resembles a lot like Yozora from Haganai. As long as the girls like one guy with a reason then that's good. I also really wanted to see more depth in the characters than just plain and simple.Tohka & Kurumi are my favorite characters in this anime. Kotori is quite annoying.I have seen some harem anime that has great character depth and lesson to be learnt eg. Haganai & Oregairu. Haganai is my best anime.The protagonist I'm refering to is Shido, he gets all the girls and is useless. Shido reminds me a lot like Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki. Never mind most harems are like that so I won't get mad about it. But the conversation is really not so engaing.I actually give credit for the animation and graphics especially for the action scenes.So I will say that there is nothing special about this anime. Just all right 6/10. - Not much depth into characters, just girls liking one guy- Not unique story- Useless protagonist, who gets all the girls- Cheesy dialouge, not-so-funny comedy- Annoying Kotori & ShidoAs long as the fanservice is not in the way of the actual story then that's good.

Just all right 6/10."", ""First off, I get that maybe this anime just wasn't for me, I'm not really the target demographic. But I'll give my two cents anyways, because it's the internet and this is likely one of the worst anime I've ever sat through.This anime is a typical harem in many regards, mildly attractive and oblivious protag-kun and multiple supernatural girls who are all romantic interests. One of the weirdest parts (and biggest plot holes) is that he actually dates all these girls... simultaneously... without any of them seeming to realise... despite living together?I mean, I get that these particular girls are thick in more than just...their chests, but I can't believe that they are THAT stupid. The relationships he has with them are also ludicrously shallow, and while I get that these girls are pretty much supposed to be one-dimensional characters it's still cringe worthy that all he has to do is say one or two choice lines and suddenly they're willing to die for him.I will give it some good points though. I do like the idea of the real-life dating sim concept, I just think it was done really poorly. Also Kurumi is the only character there I actually like, possibly because she doesn't just swoon at the sight of the protagonist (plus her powers are pretty bad ass as well)Yeah, overall would not recommend, but it got a season two, so I guess boobs sell - who'd have guessed? their chests, but I can't believe that they are THAT stupid.

It feels like the blending of the CG elements and the more traditional elements doesn\'t go very seamlessly though.For everything it lacks, it does have some genuinely good character moments sprinkled throughout. They are few in number to be completely honest, but you know, you take what you get when it comes to a series like this.This series is so absolutely hilarious sometimes. I can\'t honestly tell if it is intended, but most things come off completely hilarious rather than serious. I mean, I have to admit, even...when the series tries to play scenes out completely seriously, it almost feels like they are trying to parody the scene. Since this whole show is basically a ""drama"", I guess this was entirely intentional. It still feels like it isn\'t on some level.The purest form of an excuse plot I\'ve ever seen. As I told you at the beginning, the entire purpose of the plot is to make a situation where a guy must date a diverse range of girls and load up a ton of fan service in the foreground. There is absolutely nothing else here. The plot exists only to serve the fan service.As such, nothing in the show seems take itself seriously. The most serious scenes in the series come off, at best, amusing. The character back stories are all over the place, ranging from one-dimensional to unintentionally hilarious, furthering this conclusion. The whole feeling of the show doesn\'t really give the feeling that this meant to be serious at all. The stakes are low even from early on and they rarely get raised at all. Even in death, characters come back either hilariously or insanely.If I had to say, this is average, but it has some sort of perverse ability to keep the audience watching. Maybe it is that thrilling feeling of watching a train wreck in slow motion that humans find irresistibly interesting to watch. I have absolutely no idea why I find it even remotely interesting to watch, butthey managed to convince me I liked it. when the series tries to play scenes out completely seriously, it almost feels like they are trying to parody the scene. Since this whole show is basically a ""drama"", I guess this was entirely intentional. It still feels like it isn\'t on some level.The purest form of an excuse plot I\'ve ever seen. As I told you at the beginning, the entire purpose of the plot is to make a situation where a guy must date a diverse range of girls and load up a ton of fan service in the foreground. There is absolutely nothing else here. The plot exists only to serve the fan service.As such, nothing in the show seems take itself seriously. The most serious scenes in the series come off, at best, amusing. The character back stories are all over the place, ranging from one-dimensional to unintentionally hilarious, furthering this conclusion. The whole feeling of the show doesn\'t really give the feeling that this meant to be serious at all. The stakes are low even from early on and they rarely get raised at all. Even in death, characters come back either hilariously or insanely.If I had to say, this is average, but it has some sort of perverse ability to keep the audience watching.

I was impressed.But y\'know, it had all those typical harem features so I gotta admit almost everything was pretty predictable.But again, heavy emphasis on that almost everything, because there were a couple parts that I totally didn\'t see coming. Especially the ending. carrying on into a 2nd season. Overall I\'d say the story was okay, and don\'t recall ever being bored~ ^.^...(hardly any filler stuff at all).Characters: 9/10For a harem, I was impressed that many of the characters got a ton of interaction, screen time, and backstory.Aside from all the main girls being awesome ;D, I even enjoyed theside-characters! For example, whenever they were out in public, they\'d always run into these three girl classmates that are loafing about and there was this one girl with glasses that always got her one\'liner off where she manages to find an excuse to call Shido, ""creepy/gross"" one way or another XD. Definitely my favourite side-character.Also the main girls. All of them were so unique, had totally different character traits, and AMAZING costumes/wardrobesI mean.. c\'mon... Kurmi?!!!!??She\'s like one of the hottest characters ever created in a long time!Just look at dat![SPOILER][/SPOILER]Music: 10/10You know... we\'re in the year 2013 now, and I\'m loving it~Music and art always seems to be flawless ^.^But back on topic... all I gotta say is..

The only reason I didn\'t give it a ten was due to the cliffhanger ending, which I personally felt was unecessary story-wise, but understand that they want to milk out as much $$ as possible with this so they just popped it in there~Who would I recommend this to? Harem lovers~FINAL RATE: 45/50Above average harem anime I\'d say, great girlsI enjoyed this series as it provided a few chuckles, and some tasteful ecchi moments but not to the point where the female characters\' boobs have a rave party at every moment,(Highschool of the Dead), and the unique dating harem aspect. I highly recommend watching this series if you liked similar anime such as Angel Beats!, or Sekirei, the To Love Ru series and Sora No Otoshimono (Forte). They fill the time well and the episodes aren\'t full of too much filler, with some comedy on the side you\'ll blitz through all 12 episodes in a few hours without knowing it. It\'s a definite good series and worth watching, the only fault I find it with is the change of pace in the plot development, and the possibility of not having a second season XD.(though I really, really, hope for that second season... )Recommendations:- The World God Only Knows -Yeah to those who watched The World God Only Knows, this is just like it. Just with... lesser girls.- Sekirei -Probably the anime I thought this was most similar to, although Shido wasn\'t competing against any other guys XD But they way he had to ""save"" the girls was similar ^.^- To Love-Ru -Typical harem recommendation to the lord of all harems..

I have to say that when I first found out what the anime was about I was kinda like ""Ugh... so he is just gonna date a few spirits and that\'s it hm?"" But that was not the case. The episodes are very different and not plain like I thought they would be. The characters are very diverse from kuudere to yandere and tsundere to dandere. The powers are not cliché and it\'s not like they keep evoling and get even stronger and that type of nonsense like...you see in Dragon Ball. Yes of course there is ecchi, but almost every anime has that. If you can\'t stand that, just watch powerpuff girls or something.Ranting aside I would like to mention that I love the animation and the looks of the girls, who are again diverse. Also a good intro and outro song.This anime is good and I can\'t wait to watch season II and III.Also, love Reine-san. you see in Dragon Ball.

The concept is same as TWGOK, making the girls fall for you, thus eliminating threat they may pose. But such a concept needs other stuffs than the actual story, variety of characters the most. This is something Date A Live didn\'t do well.First of all lets go with the story. It\'s as said in the synopsis. Whatever was made of it, wasn\'t too bad, yet nothing too impressive.Next is...the characters. No comments about the girls, however, protagonist Itsuka Shidou, is probably it\'s greatest failure. Why is that he has no special traits. Why he always managed to pull it off is probably because the girls were quite distressed to begin with, and they\'d have gone for anyone who tried to help them. In some cases, the help he gets even demeans what little he could have, or may have done.The art, it\'s great. I have no complaints whatsoever.the OP and one of the ED were quite good.

Date a Live caught my attention as the premise showed similarities to semi-serious relationship-based shows such as Shana. Unfortunately, this turned out to be yet another (date X or Y will happen)^n, thus extending my streak of bad calls. The show is heavily action-based in a similar manner to Majikoi and Maken-ki, while sharing the stupid, hilariously unrealistic vibe found in Ben-tou. If these titles pique your interest, then by all means pick up this show. Otherwise, try out the...first five minutes of the first episode as that will give you a fair sampler of what\'s to come.Animation:There\'s not much to complain about in this department. The series is on par with the competition with good coloring and nice shading. The background could be a bit more detailed at times but looks good overall. Character designs are decent and facial expressions are believable enough. If there\'s anything to complain about, it\'s Kurumi\'s awkward positions and Engrish when using her attacks.This show is a fan-service based harem, and it lets you know right off the bat with ample shots up Kotori\'s skirt. Expect barely clad females, accidental fondling, and similar shenanigans throughout the show. The protagonist\'s special ability is his kiss, so expect a few pecks as well. This show is also heavy on the action. Expect a lot of fights, special effects, an Excalibur clone, and some blood. Don\'t expect exceptional choreography though the effects are pretty good overall. I\'m really not sure how the Japanese government manages to cover up (or even afford) all the battle scars.Sound:The serious tonality of the beginning of the OP is outright hilarious considering the actual tonality in the show. Otherwise, it\'s a meh melody with nice pad instruments in the background. The show has multiple EDs, which are all different in mood and all fairly good. Expect decent to good BGM, I personally like some of the heroine\'s themes.The VA cast is probably one of the reasons why I picked up this show, with Marina Inoue as Touka. Surprisingly, we also get Takehito Koyasu, though seeing him in such a demeaning role is a bit of a shame.Story:The introduction on the main page sums up the beginning of the show quite well. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a battlefield with an instant girlfriend (girl-spirit-friend) and has to fend off some Strike Witches clones including a classmate, who happens to have a crush on him. The world is continuously being sieged by spirits, who have no common sense or really any knowledge of the world that they are destroying at will. Shidou finds out from Kotori that in order to save the planet, he has to get better at dating and literally date the spirits, who conveniently are all female, into submission (in a very NON-H way). However, the overall vibe of the show is ruined when you find out that there are many, many spirits to ""tame"", very similar to the model used in The World God Only Knows.As you can infer from the above, the story proceeds in an arc based fashion, with a spirit being introduced per arc. The story builds to a ridiculous climax with a spirit\'s life on the line. It then finishes unresolved with a big banner for the viewer to wait for the upcoming second season.In addition to countless unanswered questions, the show\'s plot seems to swerve about unrealistic plot points. Ultimately though, what really kills it is the pacing of the show. Spirits are barely introduced before Shidou miraculously ""converts"" them. The entire show feels rushed, leaving out a lot of character development and explication. It was neither humorous enough nor believable enough to really engage me.Character:There is literally no intelligence (and sometimes not even continuity) in any of the characters here, and it shows with the somewhat random plot progression. One second, Touka will feel jealousy over Shidou working on other girls. The next second, she\'s apparently fine with it and lends a hand. Likewise, the incredibly well-funded secret support organization around converting the Spirits is led by a fourteen-year-old and supervised by a masochistic lolicon. You\'d think they would trust such an important role to more reliable figures...Calling some of these characters boilerplate would be a euphemism. I\'ll be completely honest, it\'s been but a week since I\'ve finished this show and I\'ve already forgotten most of the supporting characters; their presence is just that weak, and their contributions likewise minimal. The very first fundamental criteria to a successful harem is a cast that demonstrates value to the viewer, which this show absolutely lacks. What a shame that yet another interesting concept failed to pan out.Value:Some may find this show somewhat entertaining, either from an action or a character-development point of view. Frankly, I\'ve seen much better elsewhere in both categories.

While this show is a harem/romance, it\'s got a lot more twist than there should be. Here I am, explaining why you should watch this show, and how it\'s good and not cliche compared to other harem/Mecha anime.First of all, the premise itself is wild. For something that\'s adapted in 2013, you know it\'s something that started the trend of this bizarre concept of ""date to progress the story"". It\'s bizarre, it\'s...comedic, and it\'s funny how it all works out, because haha funny plot armor. Secondly, the mechs in this anime aren\'t weird CGI or more cliche giant robots. They\'re more of battle suits mixed with small devices, which is a tad more original I\'d say. Besides, there\'s plenty of explosions; we all love explosions. There are also plenty of new turns for the story; kind of reminds me of The World God only Knows.Date A Live generally has a very nice and enjoyable atmosphere to it. There\'s drama, action and plot advancement. Itsuka Shido is also for once, not a cynical or horny main protagonist, which is something of a plus for me. If you\'re looking for a nice harem mixed with action alongside some drama, I\'d recommend watching this show. comedic, and it\'s funny how it all works out, because haha funny plot armor.

I actually liked it quite a bit, but due to being stringent and taking into consideration the flaws, I can\'t possibly rate it higher than 7/10 even if I kind of wanted to just in terms of enjoyment.The setting is really chaotic and simple, the powers seems weird and feels unrealistic even for a fantasy universe. Because of the whole ""date"" concept(or rather, ""capture"" like in a dating game), we\'re left with so many screwed up parts in terms of story. It\'s all over the place and doesn\'t make much sense. Everyone just falls in...love with the mc without reasonable development beforehand, but I guess it is far from the worst I\'ve seen, at least I am not forced to suspend disbelief at the fact that they like him unlike some stuff out there.Especially at the start, it was amazingly cringeworthy. It wasn\'t, however, the type of cringe where you just want to stop watching because it\'s stupid and childish. Nah, it\'s more of being freaking embarrassed about their silly and unreasonable actions. Things like seducing a teacher for practice or asking someone to date you without even having any feelings whatsoever for them. It\'s even weirder when they\'re somehow so positive about it. That the mc is even doing all of this against his own feelings and doesn\'t refuse is even more cringeworthy. But I can handle that, no big issue there, I just had to pause it quite a few times at certain parts to just get the feelings of cringe and embarrassment out.So, the story is screwed up and really isn\'t that good, so why is this so enjoyable? Well, I think it might be the characters and their interactions. Their interactions are nice and kind of touching or sweet, it\'s enjoyable despite the flaws. I kinda like all of the characters, I didn\'t find a single one to be truly annoying(to the point of hating them), although three might\'ve been slightly irritating at times. The mc\'s true sister is one(not the red-haired one), I just don\'t like her personality much or how she doesn\'t care to listen to anyone. The second is the white haired girl, while I liked her most of the time, there was times when I was fed up with her idiocy, especially towards the end of season one, how she\'s way too impulsive and becomes something of a berserker at times.The last one is actually the mc himself. I just don\'t like characters such as him that much. He never decisively does anything(although he\'s more decisive and doesn\'t spend as much time being a little b*tch as many other japanese mcs). He never truly acts like a man, he\'s just half-arsed about everything. While he shows strong feelings for all the girls, I don\'t feel like it\'s truly love, either he doesn\'t dare to take that step or he doesn\'t want to yet. He just goes with the flow instead of controlling it and when something happens, he\'ll either scream and get sick when it\'s about murder(which is of course reasonable for a normal guy, but a mc like this isn\'t supposed to be normal, it turns me off from a story when mcs acts too much like wimps), hell, he doesn\'t even follow up about it all, he just gets over it instantly, which shows he can\'t have been that disturbed in the first place. Meanwhile, the only thing he can do when things get out of hand is being flustered and running his mouth or jumping in to sacrifice his own life to protect someone else. It feels really fake and is actually quite annoying at times. He\'s the one that feels least like a real human being in this anime. I wonder why japanese people seems to love incompetent and weak mcs whose only good trait seems to be yelling their hearts out and being a super ""good guy"", someone who shouldn\'t even exist in this world. Even when they\'re strong, they usually have no goal or motivations for their actions and still possess the traits of being a pushover doormat as they go with the flow. Well, as I said, he wasn\'t that bad compared to some, but I still didn\'t like many parts of his personality.Might sound like I have really many complaints and should therefore give this a low score, but I feel like it\'s truly worth around a 7/10 even when taking the negative parts into consideration.

I mean, don\'t expect something like Gintama\'s comedy, but there are many funny jokes here and there that that...are refreshing. Not every joke is original of course, but it\'s better than the average regarding the romcom/harem standards.+ The lore regarding the events depicted in this season is original enough and make the viewer ask itself some questions concerning what might happen afterwards etc... It\'s not groundbreaking, but it\'s good enough to justify what\'s happening and make the story feel coherent as a whole.+ Many waifusThe cons :- The character design is too childish, well not for every character, but for some characters that\'s the case, like the male MC.- It\'s linked with the last point, there are a few loli and incest references in this show. Now, there isn\'t any unwatchable scene or anything, but you know, even when it\'s shown with a ""funny tone"", it can never really feel right.All in all, this show has good things to offer : it\'s an original story to justify the harem settings, the comedy while not being always original does have its moments, and the animation quality is satisfying. However, it\'s still far from being perfect since the anime has a few shortcomings : with this story setting, I can\'t find a good reason to make the characters look so young and even include some very child looking girls in the harem. Fortunately, there is nothing too cringe and this anime aims for a ""cute/lighthearted vibe"", so we can forgive those few flaws, but maybe it could have been more ambitious ? Anyway, as a 12 episodes season, Date a Live I was pretty entertaining, I don\'t know if it gets old after watching the 5 seasons, but you should give a try to the first one at least ! are refreshing.

many others said, it is the average harem anime with a blunt main character.Story: 2It has a very, very thin story, spirit girls appear mostly in Japan and when they do, they create massive explosions that kill millions apparently, at the beginning of season 1 it is said, that thirty years ago 150 million people died in a massive explosion that could be seen from orbit even.All that has zero impact on the characters, on the world or anything else, except that all people run to bunkers once a siren rings an alarm.The main character is the average cliché male harem MC, decision-making...that makes you want to choke him through your screen or at least scream at him, no personality and mediocre character development along the series.He out of some reason has the ability to seal the powers of the spirits by kissing them, again no explanation for that and they of course get their powers back all the time, so it has zero worth.Tohka is the equivalent to the female lead, she started out mediocre, I liked her the most when she was more distant and suspicious of humans, but of course the MC has to say two sentences to her, and she becomes his personal pet.After that she becomes annoying, she starts out trying to learn how life on Earth is because she is literally empty and always clings to the main character, however she doesn't learn, she gets jealous about everything and is just as stupid as a toast bread.Kotori is the little tsundere sis of the MC that constantly bosses the MC around, she is 14 and out of some reason commander of a high-tech spaceship, while there is nothing that explains why her organization would want to make a little girl of that age captain of a starship like that.The crew gives the MC tips when he tries to date the spirits, they say that these people are the best in the world when it comes to dating and expertise with women, tho everything that comes from them is cringy and retarded.Kurumi is the only character that comes close to being a little interesting, her ability set looks cool, she is the yandere character and doesn't fall for the MC after 2 seconds and isn't constantly around in the series, she is no awesome character in any means, but OK.Art: 7The execution looks clean and nice, nothing really special, fights look a bit boring tho, there is no threat or danger that would make it fascinating, injuries don't occur due to constant force field spamming and if someone gets injured, the plot armor instantly revives him, and it leaves no mark on him whatsoever, not even psychically.Sound: 7The overall sound in the series is decent but not special, the opening of the first season was to my liking, the rest was mediocre.Characters: 2As said already, the characters show little development, the MC is an idiot and the girls are only there to show boobs, the average harem stuff.Enjoyment: 4When you can plug your brain off and ignore all the plot holes and illogical things in the series and resist the urge to murder the MC, it is watchable, don't expect miracles tho.Overall: 4Overall I can say that the anime is OK, there are anime in every category that are miles better than this one, even in harem genre, so if you want something that shows interesting characters and a story that makes sense, go and watch something else. that makes you want to choke him through your screen or at least scream at him, no personality

I hate comedies, fanservice, pointless characters, and harem series in general. Why did I watch this then? Simply put, a friend purchased this for me and I promised to not only watch it, but skewer it as well. Angela, I am doing this for you.I will keep spoilers to a minimum, as I am aware that some people will really like to watch this show.Story 2/10At the points in which the show didn\'t turn into Stupid People 101, there were some decent plot devices in this show. The reason behind...the earthquakes was an interesting one with a lot of potential, but what should we do with that potential? Have an entire episode dedicated to going on a date and stupid slapstick instead of comically exploring the concept of another world. Perfect! Oooh, or we can have a swimsuit episode whose whole purpose is to ""train"" the MC to not get excited by girls in swimsuits, while sexualizing our loli. Awesomesauce!I also enjoyed the way in which the relationship between the MC and his sister was portrayed, and how their dynamic changed (or didn\'t change) as the series pulled forward. It was a nice touch. (Though it would have been better if not for the BS in the final episode).The biggest shortcoming of the show, in my opinion, is that it could have been clever in its way of portraying love. According to this series there is basically one kind of love: romantic. Anyone who has lived more than five minutes knows that there are many types of love; the love between friends, from parents to children, sibling love, and more. Suggesting that there is only one, and it is romantic is just plain ignorance. It could have even played off of this idea of different kinds of love in the regard of putting some girls in the friend-zone and then there being slapstick there.But nope, instead we get a panel of adults playing dating simulators and bragging about their 100 waifus. Great job anime. You successfully killed my brain cells.Art 7/10The art in this show is good, for the most part. I say this because while the colors are vibrant and the designs are nice, it was extremely generic. Put 10 other harem series in a blender, and you\'ll get this. It looks nice though. Especially on clock girl and the Kotari.Sound 4/10If a sad song plays, you\'re supposed to feel sad. If a happy song plays, you\'re supposed to feel happy. If it\'s dramatic it means a character moment is going to happen that will be forgotten in the next episode.What I mean is, the music is passable and does its job, but that\'s it. The Op is somewhat of a saving grace, but even that is rather dull. It\'s passable, but just barely.Characters 2/10Oh, this thing had characters? All I saw were nicely colored pieces of cardboard.Seriously. I just finished the show and have no idea what the character\'s names even are. The only one I remember is Kotari, and that\'s because they say her name like 100 times in the last episode. Purple was the clueless alien girl with enthusiasm, handpuppet girl is the loli, clockwork girl (who is my favorite) was the Yuno Gasai, Flame girl was [spoiler, but still cliche as heck], stone-faced white haired girl is the character with a tragic backstory, male commander guy is the pervert, second-in-command chick is totally on drugs, oh and there\'s a sexualized little sister. Great job anime.All of my exaggerated whining aside, we as an audience get no backstory on any of these girls except the stone\'faced white haired girl, and that\'s her purpose as a plot catalyst. Kotari, the younger sister, is about the only other one who gets any development (or even any information about her) explained at all. It\'s such a shame ebcause this show could have been a clever sci-fi romance harmen comedy, but instead it chose the formula of cute girls, boobies, and explosions. Ugh.Clockwork girl is awesome though. She is best girl.Enjoyment 4/10As amusing as it was to text my friend about all of the stupid things going on in this series, those texts only provided a minor distraction. I found myself annoyed at almost every character interaction and plot point in the show. With the only saving grace clockwork girl (who has like 15 minutes of screen time), I found myself trying to distract myself from the atrocity laid before me. The art was a nice touch and some of the design were good (clockwork girl), but I just hated this show.Final thoughtsDate A Live is another one of those shows that comes out of the woodwork to satiate the appetite of people who like this genre. There is little remarkable about it besides clockwork girl, although the well animated visual novel had its moments. The show could have been clever and had some actual meat to its cotton candy fluff, but i didn\'t. It was just another forgettable title in the sea of anime that are made to cash-in, without much to actually say. the earthquakes was an interesting one with a lot of potential, but what should we do with that potential?

Boy, was I wrong. To date, Date a live is one of my top animes.Story:Well it is pretty generic with its combination of Harem, Ecchi, Fantasy, and Action, so if you dont like those things, then...this might not be for you. However, those are my favorite categories (along with a sprinkle of mecha) You get a good amount of your generic love-girl characters, except theyre all in love with the MC. Its a time-tested formula, and it has held. However it is, again, quite generic of a formula. As far as the premise goes, it is unique (at least for me it is). It does mix both qualities of action as well as the daily school life together in a convincing way, yet the storyline is not predictable, as i was kept in suspense at some parts of the series (in both serious and comical parts). It also does not do (what i like to call) \'harem-building-fanservice\' episodes, where nothing happens for 6 episodes while they introduce characters. Using only about 3 episodes for setting up the story left alot of time to develop characters as well as advance the story to a good conclusion. You do get the omnipresent ""onsen"" scene though, which is present in every. single. ecchi. anime. But im not complaining. not at all.Art:considering that this was made in 2013, (and possibly with some quality-boosting technology), the art was pretty good. In fact it is on par quality-wise with even newer animes from 2015-2016. Animation is pretty fluid, although at times i noticed that some of the characters don\'t move at all even if all the others are (and it was a main character). However, i think this only happened once, so overall nice art. Details were paid attention to (such as surroundings) and overall the art held together as a world, there wasn\'t any sense of disconnect between the different settings (except for perhaps the school, since there was little time spent there in contrast with other places). Theres good stuff for everyone.Sound:I like fast songs, so I liked these songs. both the Opening and closing songs were in genres that I typically enjoy, and I found myself listening to those songs more than once. VA\'s were well chosen, and they fit the character\'s features well in my opinion. surrounding sound and sound effects in it was also realistic, if generic.Character:Surprisingly for an anime that has the ""ecchi"" tag, it has a decent amount of character development. And the story lends to it. Since its about violent spirits falling in love and all. Almost all of the characters change in some way, and the main ones definitely do. One goes from being hard to showing off their inner vulnerability. One goes from being shy to opening up. One goes from being a violent murderer into a (possibly?) reformed character. As for the characters themselves, there wasn\'t anything about them that I would consider annoying, or traits that turned me off. They cry, get angry, are happy, etc etc. Pretty much character-wise this anime is pretty goodEnjoyment:I enjoyed this anime alot. It had the right amount of everything, from ecchi to serious ideas on family and friendships. The premise for me was great, I personally thought it was quite unique in the background story while also keeping it semi-familiar to what could happen in the future.Overall:3 story + 3 characters + 2 ecchi/Art (it was good but not amazing) + 1 nice songs + 1 enjoyment=10 overall. Like I said it as the perfect amount of all the good stuff from ecchi to comedy to the feels. Art and sound were definitely a plus even if compared to newer stuff from the past couple years, and oh yea, since the 2nd season is already out while im writing this, I have something to look forward to again haha.peace. this might not be for you.

You’re not gonna tell me that this wouldn’t be perfection at least in my eyes to some degree. Obviously this review is for the series as a whole right now like…it’s just a fun show. Loved it in middle school and I still love it now as just a fun thing. If you just want a simpler show with waifus then this is *the* show for it, no doubt about that at all. It doesn’t have to be this hyper-deep thing or whatever. It’s got any girl you want in it. I’m confident you won’t be disappointed. ', ""STORY - 6ART - 8SOUND - 8CHARACTER - 7ENJOYMENT - 8I'm pretty sure Date A Live saw these options: A) Give me harem and cute girls, B) Some cool sci-fi concepts please, and C) Dating sims would be nice, but decided to scratch choosing just one of those and instead incorporated them all into one weirdly entertaining piece. Everything is so silly, so dysfunctional, and so absurd, that I can't help but to humor myself in this show.Seriously though. When you have a premise that basically takes dating—uh-huh, dating—as a way to save the world from mysteriously strong entities called Sprits, and they look like...attractive girls I might add, things can spiral out of control very quickly. This show actually looks as if it embraces ridiculousness more than logic. It took common sense out of the game with the clichéd developments, theatrical dialogues, and generic character tropes like it's the most normal thing you can do. At one point, we see these Spirits demolishing buildings but the next thing, they swiftly fall in love with our protagonist, Shidou, after he spews out some good-sounding yet bland lines. Then there's also that episode about a weird food battle between militarized girls that takes form in fetishized ways. If the story sounds ridiculous, it definitely is. But somehow, it manages to turn an unwanted feature into a fun comedy-drama of farce nature.Narratively speaking, I guess Date A Live can pride itself the most in two things: the dates and the girls. Even though Shidou is a surface-level protagonist in the more serious moments, he's quite a hilarious guy if we're talking about the slice-of-life scenes, a.k.a. the dates. His awkwardness when it comes to love comes out strongly when he's interacting with the Spirits, which brings us to our next topic about the girls. Forgetting the fact that they're not that fleshed out and embody known character tropes, their double personality of being cute and strong is definitely a charming quality. Every girl is given traits with enough distinctiveness from one another that they become enjoyable to watch in both the fighting and adorable aspects. And sexy aspects too, because their attractive looks will come to waste if we didn't get any fan services right?Regarding the sci-fi elements here, most of them are seen in the military groups that fight against the Spirits. Not much explanations are given to how their technologies or operations exactly work, so don't expect much other than them existing for the sake of the dating sim premise and some display of cool-looking futurism.When it comes to the aesthetics, this is where the girls are able to truly shine further with what you can say is the quickest way to a person's heart. The visual boasts a vibrant color palette which—when combined together with the great character designs for all the girls—is pretty darn appealing to look at. Its animation might not be the most immaculate out there, but the consistency helps to provide linear enjoyment. Even for the dating scenes, the quality hardly dips down and did really well to express the differences in tone when you compare the cuter liveliness from the explosive action scenes.One other thing this show has strong rein over is the adaptable set of soundtracks. Variety comes in with galore as scenes are backed up by music that specializes in different moods, whether those are the cheerful colors of dating or the orchestral tension in powerful battles. The seiyuus did a solid job in personalizing their respective characters with fitting temperaments, especially when you consider the regular switches between the fun and the serious sides. Something else worth pointing out is the amazing deep vocal sang by secret ARMS for the opening song. I personally find it to be one of the better elements you can get here.So, what can I say about Date A Live? It's definitely not a tidy show by any means. The story has this peculiarity to it that frequently gets to ridiculous levels, to the point where it doesn't follow the correct laws of rationality. But! If you can somehow find leisure in all that ridiculousness, it'll become somewhat of an amusing aspect. And if you're just here for all the strongly adorable girls, then I suppose you've come to the right place.Be prepared.

It has pretty good pacing and the plot progression feels smooth, never have I felt like anything was rushed in its four arcs. Characters could use some work, and the MC despite being your generic nice guy Harem MC actually progresses the plot, and doesn't run away from their problems and conflict.There was this side plot of mysterious memories from 5 years ago which could have been executed a little bit better which is a shame since I actually liked...it. I really enjoyed this show for what it is, it had great pacing, just the right amount of fanservice, about just the right amount of everything really, but oh boy does the characters hold it back, because when I watched this I iniatilly got fast the fact that this is your generic harem romcom experience done right, since some other harem romcoms have too much ecchi in them, too shallow characters and extremely poor pacing, considering it from that aspect Date A Live season 1 stands out from them.Pros:-Has great Pacing-MC moves the plot really well-Great art-Decent soundtrack and animation-While I don't like Kurumi that much, I will admit that the impact she has, she is different from the other spirits who are portrayed as misunderstood damsels in distress, while Kurumi is just straight up the most dangerous, sadistic and psychopathic out all of them, her arc makes a new conflict overaching the main plot, since for a moment he makes Shido actually feel different and think about his choices and decisions more than ever, and it makes Shido feel dread and desperation in order to seal her with how dangerous and unique she really is. She kills people for her own apetite and being in Shido's position I would think how can I forgive and save someone like this, you know it adds a new interesting conflict and aspect to her character as well.-I actually enjoyed Origami as a character, she's the shy over flirtatious girl thats not afraid to reach pass boundaries, she knows what she wants and knows how to get it, and that in itself is respectable.Cons:-Tohka is not important enough as a main heroine despite her tendency to get jealous over other girls, I'm not really into the naive girl that likes too eat a lot, and is too innocent type, hell Yoshino is easier to deal with her since she doesn't interfere most times, while Tohka causes a lot of ruckus and problems for Shido because of her jealousy towards other spirits.-Yoshino fades away from the background after her arc, which I did notice that her arc is more to emphatize how Tohka gets jealous and is the main girl for this anime. She doesn't have another sideplot nor does she do anything to standout.-Kotori starts off as a pretty good character, you know shes the standard light novel sister, then she is revealed to be the commander of Ratatoskr a organization that seals off spirits before the Asc kills them. Okay thats cool I guess, but like every other little sister out there capitalizing on the sister fetish she starts clinging to much and even has the occasional save me onni-chan moments, plus her arc was just executed so poorly, I actually liked that sideplot, come on anime, why did you have to ruin it like that.Overall Date A Live is your standard Harem Romcom anime experience done right without the over the top fanservice and poor pacing, it has a lot of problems with its characters, plus its execution tho, as it fails at making sideplots a lot more impactful and interesting, despite adding a lot of them. It was as I expected super fun, enjoyable to watch, and decent at its best, I give it a 7/10 as my overall anime rating. I do plan to review season 2 and 3 so stay duned for those as well. it.

Because about halfway through the series they sure forgot they were doing comedy. Such a shame.Date A Live really starts with a bang, It\'s poking fun at anime little sisters,  slice of life anime, Japanese high schools, Magical Girls, Dating Sims,  Mecha Anime, Evangelion in particular and it managed it  allin an incredibly funny and self aware way.  The first few episodes positively shine, and then it just nose dives. It shift\'s from slapstick comedy to trying to play it more seriously and...it misses the mark. The jokes no longer pack a punch and the more serious elements just don\'t work with the comedy / parody background.If you can imagine ""A Weekend At Bernie\'s"" deciding to shift into being a muddle of a James Bond film and Love Story, then you have a pretty good handle on what\'s happening in Date A Live.It\'s a shame they just didn\'t stick to doing what they did well. The animation and artwork were top tier, the voice acting was consistently hitting the mark, and the music was damn near perfect. If they hadn\'t of tanked the concept  this really would have been something.. it misses the mark.

I wanted to like this, and I tried it twice, but not to be rude, the premise was truly asinine. Not sure why this is as popular as it is. Once I realized the true nature of the plot line my interest went buh-bye. You always have to have a level of ""suspend disbelief"" with most everything, especially Anime, but really? IMO it was like written by a 8 year old girl who liked Manga.First off. With earth under unbelievable spacial quakes, attacks, they think that some rando dude (powers or not) should talk to the ""spirits"" and date them. Date them. How...would they ever come to that conclusion or even have an inkling of an idea. That is there idea to save Earth. (slaps forehead)Second off. A 13-14 year old girl is head of a department that is so crucial to the safety of Earth. Really?Third off. To use a dating simulator to come up with the ideas of what to say? They vote, which takes way too long, and the answer is never right.I could go on about the tech people making absolutely no progression when they attack, why do they exist if they are that useless? The regurgitated character styles, I can point to most of them and name other characters from other anime\'s that are almost identical. No creativity there. Lastly, some of the dialogue so far range from cringe to useless.I don\'t plan on ever ""trying"" to watch this again when there are so many better written ones out there. would they ever come to that conclusion or even have an inkling of an idea.

I would say a 6. Like, its ok. Pretty much a slice of life anime with comedy, and hentai which is basically it. Oh theres more, it even has a form that can be activated by kissing a guy. Weird flex but ok. Nothing much to say, I really think this is a fine anime to watch. I would probably give this a similar score to the second season hell even a third season if I have the time for myself to experience those.Its based on personal opinions not yours, so pls don’t get offended and skip what I...said. said.', 'I actually have already watched this show 8 years ago when it first came out, Thought it was trash, Then dropped it. 8 Years after, today, with much more watchtime on various anime and experience from playing dating sims and visual novels now rewatching it made me change my mind about this show.I do tell you right of the bat that this show is no near masterpiece. It still has a lot of mishaps though I do think it\'s a pretty decent one now with experience.The show has pretty much lots of elements in a dating sim, heck it is pretty obvious that referencing...a dating simulator was taken into account when making the storyline.It does well in presenting a Dating Sim environment. Guy who has tasked to basically make girls fall in love with them, to basically save humankind. While a small group of people helps him by using a 3 choice system similar to decision making in dating sims. Plus hitting the worst decision may lead to cringeworthy moments leading to dropping a girl\'s affinity is well presented in this show.Although one episode hit me hard and was episode 8 in particular where MC is dating multiple girls at once which is an essence of playing a dating sim ""efficiently"". This is well done in particular since it also sparks realism seeing how the MC is pretty tired after all that happenings.This does not mean the show is all good though as there are many mistakes the show makes but this one in particular is worth to mention. It is highly fast paced. I don\'t actually have problems with the pacing of the introduction of characters but I have a problem with how they affect the story. Since almost all the characters pretty much majorly affect the main story unlike some other great shows where they just do this on another season. It feels like it does this just to make the show feel and look awesome in paper, it accomplishes that yes but only on paper. It also weakens the surprise factor more as there are just so much happening you\'re not gonna even get surprised anymore. Although this does accomplish a no-filler approach though so it still kind of does that well in that regard. Heck I tell you, even the swimsuit episode isn\'t a filler.Other things I\'ll talk about are the characters. The characters have drastically unique personalities, There\'s not much cliché aura to them. It\'s also a part of a dating sim to have characters that have drastically different personalities to have a different approach on the other characters. The Opening sequence is nostalgic, making me feel when it was 8 years ago talking about why the show just doesn\'t make sense.So should I recommend you watch the show?If you like dating sims then do so, oh wait. Check out Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai first since that show has a much more delicate approach on the topic. The two are also similar in a sense making me think that did date a live actually referenced kami nomi zo shiru sekai?If you don\'t have a lot of experience or just not like the genre in general then don\'t.6/10 a dating simulator was taken into account when making the storyline.It does well in presenting a Dating Sim environment.

When I first heard of the show I was pretty curious to see why this show is called Date a Live and yes its a show about dating Spirits and saving them. But what surprised me is the moments that gives off the wholesomeness of each of the characters they interact with and there are times that I feel like the formula of this kinds of anime is just generic to meOverall this is a spoiler free review of what this anime is to me, I am not generally speaking to all of the majority of anime fans to watch this at some point but lets be honest, you'll never know why Siesta from Tantei wa mou Shinde Iru looks like Toobichi Origami teheee...But yeah if you are a fan of romance and all of the action I recommend you watch the series as a whole because let's be honest again you are not an anime fan if you didn't watch the roots of it( and what I mean is that watching old anime would feel like you are exploring more and more and that is why you must watch this but in my opinion its your choice)Anyways this is a  2021 review and my first for a while so yeah this is my review for Date a Live Season 1, i might watch the whole series and give some honest reviews so yeah thanks for reading anime back thenfor the art its really good back then, but i'mma see if what season 4 could bring and hopefully me watching this at this year might make me hook up to love the series even morefor the character development i'd say its like what happened to Sword Art Online Season 2 and in some parts in where some characters where not included and it was rushed but it was really ok for me because I came here for the characters likability and it was great to some extent.Its 2021 and I know that I am late to watch the series but for whatever reason the idea of saving girls by having them to date is really a letdown for me.

The story is about an ordinary second-year high school student Shidou-Kun, who suddenly encountered a big explosion one day, and in this big explosion a mysterious beautiful girl wearing armour and holding a big sword appeared. It turns out that the true identity of this girl is a ""spirits"", an existence that will bring devastating disasters to the world, and her reappearance will bring a devastating future to the earth! However, the protagonist Shidou has a way to prevent the destruction of the world. The only way to prevent the destruction of the world is to date...her!It is confusing at the beginning how Shin imouto suddenly became the commander and talk in a bossy manner while explaining things to his brother. Then, his normal life changes after that spacequake when he meets that spirit and AST going to lend Shin power to help them. Origami know his name, why?It is moderate ecchi, does not feel like I will throw up after those fan service. A good paced story with lots of mysteries added up and bundled with comedic scenes. Like how they have a team behind Shido to give him a suggestion on what should he talk about when going on dates with the spirits. The uses of the date/dead or live/a a life to seal the power of the spirits sure is good. The spacequake can be controlled?

I watched the first season all the way back in 2016 and I've watched every Date A Live anime since. Only now did I choose to re-watch the show since the first episode, only this time I watched the English dub to become familiar with the English voice actors, like Josh Grelle and Michelle Rojas. So, after three years and with the English version availabe, does the show still hold up? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryBy now, everyone should know the story of Date A Live. Ordinary boy...Shido must become a new kind of hero to save the superpowered girls called the Spirits, by dating them, kissing them and giving them the chance to live normal lives. It is a silly premise and it would only work as a light-hearted comedy, but surprisingly, the show manages to develop a true sense of pathos and heart. Every episode follows a small formula of Shido meeting the Spirit, getting to know about her problems, agreeing to going on a date with her and ultimately kissing her to seal her powers. Granted, the dates aren't easy and there are plenty of obstacles Shido must overcome to save the day, such as attacks from the Anti-Spirit Team, which is determined to destroy the Spirits, or even the Spirit's unstable powers.Admittedly, apart from the dating, season 1 doesn't have a big, overarching story. There are a few plotlines concering the world at large, such as Shido and Kotori's lost memories or the entity that turned Kotori into a Spirit, for the most part, the story remains very character-driven.The show manages to strike a good balance of harem comedy, romance, character drama and action. It can get a bit dark and gritty at times, and there are moments that increase the dramatic tension and the emotional stakes, but the show is so good at these elements that there is never a tonal dissonance that might take viewers out of the story. There is a modest amount of fanservice, but it doesn't take away from the story. (8/10)CharactersThis is where Date A Live's biggest strength lies, the character writing. Since I already watched all the anime adaptations, I already know what happens to these characters, but we shall keep focused on this season, okay?Shido is one of my favorite characters in recent memory. I like Shido because he is the proverbial everyman, the character viewers are supposed to relate to the most or the easiest. He ends up experiencing much of the Date A Live universe for the first time and asks the questions we ourselves would ask if we found ourselves in those exact same situations. Despite his lack of experience with the opposite gender, he adapts pretty quickly to his current circumstances and finds he is pretty good at his craft.Of course, this wouldn't be a harem anime if there weren't any pretty girls and fortunately, Date A Live delivers. First, there is Tohka, who evolves beautifully across the series. She becomes overly attached to Shido and experiences feelings of jealousy whenever she sees him with another girl. As time passes, however, Tohka learns to befriend these girls upon learning they are not too different from her. The second girl in the Spirit list is Yoshino, the kindest and most innocent character in the show. She is very cute and her innocence and moral compass makes her one of the most endearing characters in the show. Kurumi is the closest thing the show has to a primary antagonist. She is the first Spirit that actually uses her powers for malicious purposes, which puts Shido in a difficult position for the first time in his mission.There is also Kotori, Shido's little sister. She might be typical tsundere, but as time passes, viewers learn there is more to her than meets the eye. I'm surprised by the amount of depth and nuance Kotori displays across the show. Finally, there is Origami, who belongs to the AST and has the most serious disposition at destroying the Spirits.The show does a great job at making the characters feel human. Whenever Shido tries to save a Spirit, it comes off as genuine and something he would do if he was a real person. You care about the characters and you feel for them and the challenges they endure. (9/10)ArtSince I'm just a casual fan, there is not much I can say about the art department. The characters look fine. While Shido has the generic male protagonist appearance, the Spirits have their own distinctive appearances, which, combined with their unique personalities, allow them to stand out and develop. The Spirit armor designs look amazing and the animation effects used for the superpowers look incredible. There wasn't much to screw up here. (9/10)SoundI watched the show both in Japanese and English and I'm very pleased to inform you that both versions were amazing. Both Nobunaga Shimazaki and Josh Grelle have the perfect everymen voices for Shido. Marina Inoue has a more innocent and bashful voice for Tohka, while Michelle Rojas makes her sound like a young adult. Iori Nomizu and Tia Ballard delivered beautiful performances as Yoshino, while Alexis Tipton and Asami Sanada nailed the seductive and mysterious tone of Kurumi.Ayana Taketatsu and Misuzu Togashi are fine, but I think Bryn Apprill and Michelle Lee were better VAs for Kotori and Origami, respectively. Overall, the English performances were significantly enhanced by the script, as it made the characters feel more human.I'm no sound effects experts but the sound effects used in this season were fine. They didn't detract from the experience. The music, however, was downright gorgeous. The music team could have gone for something easier and subdued for the show they were given to work with, but instead, they delivered a soundtrack of cinematic quality. The music in this show would be amazing as the soundtrack of a big-budget Hollywood production. (9/10)OverallIn closing here, Date A Live remains as one of my favorite TV shows in recent memory. The story is interesting, the characters are relatable, the productions values were amazing and you are left with a beautiful and heartwarming feeling after watching this show. I will continue re-watching Date A Live to see if the show can still hold up, but I'm very pleased to say that season 1 is still a strong and enjoyable experience.

I will also give one for the LN after I finished it as I'm still at Vol 8. Anyways back to the review:Pretty short review honestly. They missed a few things on the adaptation side especially on the throwback of Shido and Kotori. But honestly, it's a good start for the anime series.Anyone who thinks that Shido is stupid tho, they didn't watch it carefully.Story: 7Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 8...Enjoyment: 8Overall: 7.5 Enjoyment: 8Overall: 7.5"", ""The premise of Spacequakes and Spirits is an interesting one. One day you're a normal high school student, and the next, you're suddenly apart of an organization to neutralize calamity-bringing Spirits, by dating them? That's definitely an original concept. The hilarity that ensues as the main character, Shido, struggles to converse with the Spirits, is given training by his little sister, and balancing a normal life with the responsibility of saving Spirits is definitely memorable, albeit a little distracting from the story at some times.Story (7/10) - Date A Live adapts the science fantasy of its light novel source material very well, along with comedic...aspects, hints of romance, a tiny bit of mecha in the form of the AST (Anti-Spirit Team), but hasn't really developed on the harem front; most likely since this is only the beginning...Art (8/10) - I'm not sure if there's a standard for art in Anime, but to put it simply, it'd say the animation is done very well. AIC Plus+ did an amazing job in bringing the world of Date A Live to life, and I can't wait to see what other forms of work they had brought to life.Sound (8/10) - The first outro of the series was rather slow, and didn't really connect with me. Other than that, I enjoyed the music very much. From Shido's first encounter with a Spirit, to the thematic introduction, and suitably satisfying endings, as well as the themes for the various characters.Character (7/10) - Going from your average high school student to a romancing casanova overnight is no easy task. But once Shido breaks the awkward ice, his true, genuine self comes out.

You saw nothing yet!In a nutshell, this show is basically a parody of date sims and various other otaku culture trademarks. The very setting can best be described as a date sim version of Neon Genesis. You have the world being invaded by alien beings with angelic-themed names, a slutty imouto in the role of Gendo Ikari and the Magi computer being a galge. There are supposed to be tremendous explosions occurring all over the world, that kill millions but that is presented as dramatic as boogies hanging from your earlobe. We never see anyone getting...killed or even giving a damn about their houses being demolished in every single episode. Yet this is literally the objective of the story; the protagonist must prevent the genocide and the mass destruction by dating the aliens. Yeah, he is dating aliens so people who don’t give a damn about all that won’t die; stop trying to reason it. But see it this way; at least the show is honest in telling you right away what a silly fan catering joke it is instead of pretending to be a serious action / survival of the likes of Sword Art Online.As you probably have guessed, these aliens all have the forms of hot girls with sexy outfits and an IQ of around 50. The hero is almost actively aware that he is inside a date sim and needs to win their affection in order to protect the world. Man, what a tragic mission his slutty sister forced him to take part in. IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE HOT GFs IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLD!!! So the way he is managing to make them friendly enough is by using cheesy pick up lines that never work in real life but are fine in date sims. And you even have the secret organization giving him possible replies to further make the whole thing feel like a game. Do these lines work? OF COURSE THEY DO; THIS IS A VIDEOGAME WORLD!And yeah, exactly as it happens in all harems he needs to constantly seduce more girls and have them living with him, constantly going through all those overused jokes where he enters a room when they are naked or having to explain why he can’t just pick one of them and have some sex for Pete’s sake. And they typically get so jealous on a drop of a hat and fight each other for whom gets to spend an evening talking to a guy with the personality of a goldfish. Don’t ever mind how he is in reality just forced to pretend that he cares about them or the city squares they obliterate each time someone goes tsun over bubble gums. It’s like anyone gives a damn anyway. And no, there is no real danger of some jealous girl going School Days on the boring dude, since every time he gets killed, he just gets a CONTINUE, revives, and keeps seducing girls like the bland harem lead he is. Nothing of importance was lost champ; you just got killed for a few seconds before loading your last saved state. It’s not like the show ever tries to be interesting or something trivial like that.Just like all parodies it is good only when you get the jokes and only if you can shut off your brain for long enough to actually find this entertaining. I personally couldn’t since parodies can’t stand on their own two feet and rely solely on earlier works to work instead of being stand alone productions. Also, not many can find pleasure in a show that trashes their favourite titles like that. Even Gintama does it better since it acts like a two-timer. It mocks the stereotypes on one occasion while embracing them on another. Date A Live is a lot more basic in its approach as it is purely about breaking the fourth wall and directly telling you this is all a farce to the point the immersion breaks immediately and you are just looking at an vulgar anecdote that trashes stereotypes. It doesn’t feel funny for more than 10 minutes and the mediocre production values make it even more passable than it already is. It would at least be interesting if this was an orgy hentai but no, the creators were dead set on making a show nobody will like or care for. killed or even giving a damn about their houses being demolished in every single episode.

This show is nothing special: the characters are as if you slapped some cute stickers on cardboard cutouts and the story is as bland as corn flakes. Yet, why was I still binging all the episodes? Because I am a degenerate who enjoys watching a man create his very own harem with the excuse of saving the world.If you're not into that then this anime isn't for you. But you can count me in to watch the next season of this degeneracy because it really does...shine for dem cute, 2D personality, anime grills. shine for dem cute, 2D personality, anime grills."", 'This is my first review: Alright, here\'s what I have to say. I\'m not exactly a master of Anime and I don\'t know what should\'ve or shouldn\'t have been on this anime. Here\'s my personal opinion though:I won\'t say I liked it, but I didn\'t NOT like it. The action was alright for me, not too much unnecessary talking between the fighters that takes up half the episode. It flowed well and there were some pretty unexpected moments. (no spoilers)Story (3)- Story was the biggest problem for me. I appreciate the fact that right from the start, they tell us that there is no...explanation for the existence of spirits. (this isn\'t a spoiler right? lol sorry I\'m kind of insecure about whether I\'m telling a spoiler or not) I\'m guessing they used the cute girls as a cover-up for the lack of plot, but it didn\'t really work for me. I just hope the story will be more clear after I watch the next season.Art (7) - I am honestly clueless when it comes to the art styles. So I just rated it based on what I thought. No hate plz.Sound (6) - If the music counts as sound, it was great. The opening music is honestly really nice, but I\'m not a fan of the credits music. The sound design is fine, sounds like any other sound design when there\'s action in an anime, loud cracking and the ground being blown to bits.Character (5) - I\'m not spoiling, I\'m saying this in case you don\'t want to watch something like this. The characters come on strong on first appearances and show good relationships, but afterwards they kind of die down. I guess that\'s what happens in Harem anime\'s, the balancing gets difficult? idk.Enjoyment (7) - The comedy was light, but it was fun. It got a few laughs out of me, and I don\'t laugh at those ""walk in at the wrong time"" moments, I usually facepalm, but this anime had a bit more variety, which I can appreciate.Overall (6) - Overall, I thought that the anime had potential. It seems to other people that it\'s a \'hate it or love it\' type of anime, but I thought it was okay. If there was more story in this, the overall could\'ve probably went to a 7, maybe even an 8, but, not much we can do about yeah? Honestly, I\'m willing to give it another chance and watch the 2nd season, I\'ll be watching it right now, thanks for reading :) explanation for the existence of spirits.

No hate plz.Sound (6) - If the music counts as sound, it was great. The opening music is honestly really nice, but I\'m not a fan of the credits music. The sound design is fine, sounds like any other sound design when there\'s action in an anime, loud cracking and the ground being blown to bits.Character (5) - I\'m not spoiling, I\'m saying this in case you don\'t want to watch something like this. The characters come on strong on first appearances and show good relationships, but afterwards they kind of die down. I guess that\'s what happens in Harem anime\'s, the balancing gets difficult? idk.Enjoyment (7) - The comedy was light, but it was fun. It got a few laughs out of me, and I don\'t laugh at those ""walk in at the wrong time"" moments, I usually facepalm, but this anime had a bit more variety, which I can appreciate.Overall (6) - Overall, I thought that the anime had potential. It seems to other people that it\'s a \'hate it or love it\' type of anime, but I thought it was okay. If there was more story in this, the overall could\'ve probably went to a 7, maybe even an 8, but, not much we can do about yeah? Honestly, I\'m willing to give it another chance and watch the 2nd season, I\'ll be watching it right now, thanks for reading :)', 'Before I start this review I think this important to say this is not targeted to me because 9/10 times I hate fan service and your probably saying why did you watch it the reason why is because I have only been watching anime for a half a year and this anime had the romance tag on it so I decided to give it a shot and this was one of the first anime I watched so I had no clue what I was getting myself into so lets start the review the story is brutally bad the story follows a Main Character named Shido...Itsuka and during school one day a spacequake happens and these happen frequently and what happens is these spirits come to earth and are very dangerous and it so happens there are only female spirits thats the story with out giving to much away. next the characters are your classic plain cookie cutter lacking personality or back stories characters and all the female wants to be with the main character the main character is shy and lacking a backbone nothing new and just plain boring. now lets talk about the fan service it is everywhere in this anime I only watch 3 heavy fan service and ecci anime and it has the same fan service and ecci scenarios just boring once you seen one you seen them all. this whole anime was pain full to watch I got 7 episodes in there was only 12 might as well finish I got some beer and got drunk I had to in order to finish this. I wish I was trying to be funny but I am serious. now lets talk about the things I like and yes there are somethings but very few the art and the anime was solid  and the fighting in this anime was decent and last is the romance at least to me this was very little romance but it is still there. Overall I learned my lesson avoid anything with the ecci tag 9 out of 10 times and I honestly dont know how people actually enjoyed this. there were some good parts but very little in closing this anime is overrated garbage.

The main plot boils down to our main male lead Shido having to “tame” these magical spirits in order to keep their magical outbursts in check. So yeah it turns into a harem since...by the end of the season he will have four or so girls wanting his D. This however is not the downfall of the series; I tend to like harems IF they are done well enough. This anime falls very short in my opinion because the cast just doesn’t flow very well with each other. The main female lead Tohka is just a whiny and needy girl that gets mad at Shido for literally everything. It also doesn’t help that the show is extremely predictable and drags towards the final episodes. Overall if you are looking for a thought provoking show this is one you need to steer clear of.*Something I forgot to add; there is a pretty large amount of fanservice in this anime but I never found it too distracting.*Animation: 6.7/10Something the show does seem to pull of reasonably well is the visual presentation. Both the fight and more tame dialogue scenes have good quality which seems to hold throughout the entire season without degrading in quality. Character models in my opinion could have been better but they were “good enough”. Have to admit though that the eyes in this anime were really well done (don’t know why I love eyes so much but yeah it’s the only decent thing Tohka had).Sound: 5/10There really isn’t a lot to comment on for the sound of this anime. The soundtrack is generic at best and the voice actors did an “ok” job. Sound is an important thing to try to capitalize on since it is so pivotal to the overall experience of video media. This anime fell short in my opinion but by no means completely failed on the audio presentation.Characters: 4.5/10Harems are only successful if you have the characters to back up the ridiculous notion of calling a man (or women) liking multiple partners a sane thing. In Date A Live, Shido is kind of just thrown in to these turn of events and really doesn’t have a saying in his own actions so he gets a pass. The characters he is tasked with “taming” however just make the show boring to watch. As I mentioned earlier, Tohka is an annoying crying female that overreacts to everything. Kotori (Shido’s sister) is your typical generic tsundere who has a small twist to her character towards the end of the series but I didn’t care for her so whatever. The other two spirits in the show Yoshino and Kurumi were also pretty generic and uninteresting. The only thing they brought to the table was that Yoshino was super ultra cute which can only go so far. So what the show boils down to is its wild card character, Origami. Presented as an emotionless tomboy, she provided many unique and funny scenes with Shido. She developed feelings for Shido fairly early on which provided some interesting moments between her and the other spirits. She is the sole character that I ended up liking in this show.Overall: 5.2/10It really is a shame what is occurring in the anime industry at the moment. I have now seen three really good light novels (Sword Art Online, Oniichan Dakedo Ai sae Areba Kankeinai, and now Date A Live) become these really average anime when they could have been so much more. Actually in general I have noticed that animation studios are playing it safe with these high school romantic comedies and not taking risks on more farfetched plots. The last really good show that was nothing like anything else I had seen was Fate/Zero back in 2011. While this season of anime has brought a couple good shows (thank god for Chihayafuru 2), we are getting too many of these romcons at once. I hope that the next anime season brings some more daring shows.Enjoyment: 4.6/10Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer', 'Date A Live is an otaku-centric franchise―you have the twin-tailed imouto, another twin-tailed bishoujo (who is a yangire gothic lolita), the girl-from-another-world-who-is-detrementally-naïve-about-everyday-Earthian-life (very similar to Lum from Urusei Yatsura and Lala Satalin Deviluke from To Love Ru; same trope), the list goes on. This series has a lot of character designs with twin-tails or ponytails, because, like the great Kyon from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya once said, “Ponytails turn me on.”•\tSimilar to The World God Only Knows, another series that’s mainly in circulation because of otakus wanting more of their fetishes pandered to, the main character is able to choose visual novel screen options...when talking to the female protagonists, and―unlike the other show’s lack of purpose with the conceptーthe protagonist in Date A Live, is acting as the central arbiter to all of the girls’ arcs; he practically goes on dates with these extremely powerful, deity-like women to quell their powers and keep them from bringing calamity onto the planet, or whichever dimension that he exists in!•\tWith the exception of a couple of character arcs, most of the girls are likable and have eidetic designs. I usually don’t care for harem storylines, but unlike the usual “girls fighting each other for the protagonist’s attention” stereotype, this series is a little more sophisticated than typical cat-fight drama and, instead, focuses more on linear routes, like what you would see in an actual visual novel.•\tIn my opinion, I liked Season 2 of Date A Live more than Season 1 because of the addition of Miku AND shit gets real with Tohka’s character arc! Tohka, Kotori, and Kurumi all had very good world lines in Season 1, but I liked that season less because of the focus on Yoshino and Origami, who I found to be the most annoying characters in the franchise!•\tYoshino was an adorable loli that I wanted to like for her design, but I couldn’t get over the fact that her creepy rabbit puppet talks in her place and has an older male voice. I think she would be a gazillion times cuter without the weird, uncanny valley (ventriloquism) sub-plot! As for Origami, she’s just a perverted, manly, solider woman―who’s entire purpose is to get the protagonist to have freaky sex with her… this gets annoying in the middle of a serious plot; that being said, I do admit that her OVA is ridiculously funny and will be appealing to anyone who can enjoy absurdist sexual humor!•\tI agree with the majority of Date A Live fans, when they say that Kurumi didn’t get enough of an appearance in Season 2 (her role is more like a cameo, rather than that of a character that’s written to be important)―despite being the character with the most fascinating abilities and crux; despite that, her OVA more than made up for her lack of presence during that chronicle in the series! It’s short, sweet, romantic, and tragic; it perfectly incapsulates Kurumi’s unstable disposition and leaves room for questions and intrigue―as far as what her role in the story will be!•\tThe Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement movie isn’t worth mentioning, it seems estranged from the franchise with its uninteresting plotline and blasé leitmotif; I see this film as Studio IMS standing on its last leg! And boy, did it show! The movie’s quality looked like a Korean, bootleg imitation of Date A Live, rather than something associated with TV series and OVAs. The only purpose in watching the movie is seeing (the new girl) Mayuri’s character design; it basically suffers from all of the issues that I had with Nanoha: Resurrection.•\tOverall, Date A Live is probably my favorite harem series in anime; Monogatari has a couple of good arcs, but Date A Live is more tasteful and isn’t as pretentious. It’s charming, cute, not too raunchy, amazing character designs, an interesting plot and female cast―to top it off! I rate the first season a 6/10, the second season a 7/10, the Origami OVA a 6/10, Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement a 3/10, and the Kurumi OVA a 7/10.•\tSN: The studio that produced season two, the Date A Live movie, and the Kurumi OVA, Studio IMS, went out of business.

What\'s not to get?To be fair though, There were some aspects that made it stand out, which I understood was the basis of ecchi/harem structure used today. While I admit that it had similar elements as your typical E/H series, it did give way to all the characters having screen time. Most series would\'ve placed them in the background, but this series kept the characters ""alive"".If there\'s one thing I liked, it\'s the BGM. It truly resembled the theme of a dating sim (cute and bubbly) while not forgetting the serious themes embedded in...the series.Overall, it was okay.

It had everything I wanted in a Harem anime indecisive MC, Story somewhat does lack like going on a date is the only solution seriously but it is the title we go with it.. because the anime as whole is enjoyable it makes it up in that. The action scenes are surprisingly very good unlike other Harem animes where they focus everything on the MC impressing girls by cringeworthy things and absolutely sabotages the action.In this anime atleast they nail the reasonings of the girls it makes sense and MC's reasoning with their problems are also very commendable....The art is fantastic I really dig this kind of style in a harem anime. Unlike-Ah My BuddhaIt really sucked. The art is fantastic I really dig this kind of style in a harem anime. Unlike-Ah My BuddhaIt really sucked."", 'tl;dr: An anime that has a weak plot but is held up by character’s that are fun in a lot of different ways.This anime is all sorts of ridiculous, but it’s still a lot of fun. The core of it is very much the characters. Not in that they’re complex characters or in that there’s good character or relationship development, but rather in that they’re just a lot of fun to watch. The protagonist, Shido, is a strange blend of lame and cool, wherein a lot of the time he’s pretty lame, but when it actually matters he manages to be pretty cool, the contrast...of which actually works pretty well. In terms of the heroines, Tohka’s innocence and sense of wonder at everything is really amusing. Yoshino’s shyness, kindness, and reliance on Yoshinon is adorable. Origami being desperately in love with Shido manifests hilariously. Kotori’s tsundere aspect is actually pretty amusing in how she has a literal split personality. And Kurumi is completely insane and it’s awesome. None of the character’s are that deep, rather so far they’re pretty flat and only have a minimal amount of backstory, if even that. Their stories are also incredibly simple, but the core premise of having to go on dates in order to save the world with essentially a military organization essentially helping out in the background is hilarious, and the stories outside of that are generally strong enough to be reasonably heartwarming despite how straightforward and predictable they are.The big exception to that to Kurumi’s arc, which doesn’t really get a proper ending, and rather than heartwarming is just a rush of insanity, but in a good way. Because of that Kurumi managed to stand out quite well, wherein she’s definitely psychotic, but because of how stylish she is with her general mannerisms, yandere aspects, and really cool power set that involves making poses with guns in front of a clock to emulate it’s hands, she’s just ridiculously charismatic and despite her being pretty evil I couldn’t help but be really fond of her and wanting to see more of her. On that note, my biggest gripe so far is that it feels like its going through too many characters too quickly without having enough time to spend on any of them, and if it keeps on adding characters at this pace as it currently feels like it’ll keep doing, it’ll quickly get bogged down. Still, so far the comedy, slice of life, and serious moments have had a good balance so pacing has been solid. The action wasn’t that great but helped add weight to said serious moments.The art and character designs in general I really liked. The animation was only okay though. The OP was solid enough in terms of the visuals and song. The serious sounding but actually funny narration at the beginning of each OP was a nice touch. The EDs were pretty weak I felt. Soundtrack wise, Kurumi’s battle theme Rhapsody Rage was amazing, but nothing else especially stood out though in a general sense it felt fine. of which actually works pretty well.

For everyone else, the most important thing you need to know going in is that this show is so typical and uninspired that I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone.There are some great figures of a few of the characters and it was actually because of the girl with blue hair (who you meet fairly early on) that I watch the show in the first place. She is the only redeeming factor in the show because (mostly), they don\'t...really treat her as a love interest and she\'s adorable.As for the rest, you have the clueless ""sudden girlfried with powers"" who is naiive about all things in our world and the main character has to teach her everything. There\'s the little sister/childhood friend who\'s angry all the time about the attention he gets from these new girls and abuses him. He\'s such a blank slate he just takes all the abuse and does nothing useful ever except ""be nice"". There are a few others, but they\'re too boring to even bring up.The show centers on a boring premise of him having to date each girl one after another to \'save them\' (so yes, they even managed the typical beach/swimsuit/onsen classic episode just like every other show like this).Personally, unless you just want to understand the basics of the show to talk with other people who\'ve seen it or you\'re interested in the art/figures and want to know the characters, this is eminently skippable. really treat her as a love interest and she\'s adorable.As for the rest, you have the clueless ""sudden girlfried with powers"" who is naiive about all things in our world and the main character has to teach her everything.

The story sky rocketed so fast that It felt like-comparing to the novel-it doesn\'t make sense anymore, everything was fast-paced and blunt that the series felt like it lacked the respect that the novels deserved, and along with it the enjoyment and fun that it could have delivered if it only tried a little bit harder in sending us the appropriate message.Overall, from time to time the series deviates far from the original story, but just enough to recover in time and not become a totally different story. lacks the depth and feel that the author originally wanted his viewers to experience, I have read the novels, and personally it was 7 times much more enticing.What the series lacks that the novel fully delivers, is the trivial and subtle things that make a big difference for our beloved characters, especially the girls.

After a couple of episodes, I realized that unfortunately, the artwork was about the only thing going for the show. So, with that in mind, I watched the rest and got about what I expected. While the storyline had its moments that were humorous and enjoyable, overall, it was just disappointing.

No, their's to much fan service, far too much is unexplained, the story is straight up dumb like really dumb, the main character is generic as hell and not the only one. If you come to this anime expecting to see something legitimately good you will be disappointed.On the other hand if you made it past the first five minutes I can only assume that's not what your looking for in this anime. If you like me came to this anime with the mindset that your about to watch a stupid anime, overloaded with far...too many cliches and far to much wish fulfillment, then I think you'll be delightfully surprised. Some of the characters are actually pretty fun and some of the character interactions are actually pretty sweat and emotional. To the shows credit it actually is pretty funny sometimes, overall it's a fun watch and ocasionally it actually crosses over into being legitimately good once in a blue moon. The spirits character designs are actually legitimately good, especially nightmares.It's not a good anime but I wouldn't call it a bad one. too many cliches and far to much wish fulfillment, then I think you'll be delightfully surprised.

It is pure unabashed service. From the opening bedroom scene featuring the lazy older...brother being woken up by the excitable younger sister cliché complete with an overt panty shot that hangs awkwardly just a little too long; and hence forth.literally everything in the show is contrived from the ground up and I don\'t even mean that figuratively.

We may well have witnessed through the first 4 episodes some pure and honest references to Gurren Lagann, Full Metal Panic and Evangelion, but they were so convenient you could be forgiven for overlooking them as a  completely thoughtless plot devices who\'s semblances were entirely coincidental. Given the quality (or-lack-there-of) of the rest of the show i hesitate to think the show is genuinely supposed to be as deep as a meta-parody.The characters are typical cut and paste tropes with no real depth and the animation of said characters play like some early 90\'s Sailer Moon show, but without the excuse of age and subsequently poor animation technology to go with it. It\'s a real cartoon, you could say. With much of the abstraction seeming to take from the western pool of expressive exaggeration rather than your typical chibi eastern equivalents.Funnily enough the battle scenes are actually not bad if only using the rest of the show as context. The entire show\'s meta is simply to set up the main character with cute girls so that teenage boys can project themselves in in his stead, and they make it pretty easy by making the male protagonist so bland and quirkless.To summarise, this show has only one flavour (fan service) and if you came here for anything else you\'ll be sorely disappointed. The show stands on its own feet if you can forgive its numerous wobbles, but i\'d only recommend watching it if you\'re stuck waiting on something better to come around. brother being woken up by the excitable younger sister cliché complete with an overt panty shot that hangs awkwardly just a little too long; and hence forth.literally everything in the show is contrived from the ground up and I don\'t even mean that figuratively.

And I only watched this because of the Anime Watching Challenge (ecchi/harem anime).The story was ok, although uh, the sudden ""she\'s the X??"" etc. was like \'okayy""It wasn\'t all that bad. The action was pretty good, the opening song was great, I am not a big fan of naked girls and stuff, but okay... I knew what I was getting myself into.The art, besides that, was great, I mean, even with that it was pretty good too. As I said, I liked the opening song, the OST (original soundtrack) was good...as well. Characters, well, they were diverse, although the harem was quite interested in the main harem guy, as harems usually work that way.I did enjoy most of it.

Watered down and crappy. The story is exactly as you\'d expect; repetitive. Within the first six episodes we have two forced main characters split up and then get back together and I couldn\'t care less about it.The main character is serviceable, I guess, but everyone else is just window dressing or an asshole, which does not make for a pleasurable viewing experience.The...animation is okay but looks terrible by modern standards, the sound is fine, and my enjoyment of it was almost nonexistent. And yet, everything I\'ve heard about this series suggests that it gets better with time, but I\'m going to give it a 7 as an act of mercy and so that I don\'t have any guilt over not finishing it. animation is okay but looks terrible by modern standards, the sound is fine, and my enjoyment of it was almost nonexistent.

Not much else for me to say; the character art is aesthetically pleasing personally, and the fight scenes were pretty cool.The only character that really...mattered was Tohka, but she compensates for every other archetypal character in the series.

The one character who probably has the most development is Kurumi, who obviously is a fan favorite.DAL it's also your generic harem where incest...and harassments are used as comedy or not taken seriously.

He gets ordered around by his sister, who is 14 years old (I\'ll get back to it) and only interesting thing that he does is dating a ""Spirit"", but even though this concept sounds very attractive and hints us that MC must have some sort of interesting personality, well he doesn\'t. Instead of having him do the dating, he only...says things that comes from \'dating advisors\'? Why do you ruin the most interesting part of this series? Basically the show is making him almost worthless character and if you remove him, only handful of events would play out diffferent.Itsuka Kotori. Let\'s make this quick, she is 14 years old, she commands fully operational millitary flying ship and she\'s 14 years old, great. Because for some reason Shidou\'s sister cannot be an adult woman, but some ""brat"", who possess all the knowledge. Later in the series she\'s seen to have some past trauma, but it\'s implemented with so much force it\'s tedious.Tobiichi Origami. Top student cliché. She\'s 16yrs and fights the Spirits, why do everyone needs to be so young, firstly it\'s ecchi stereotypical to have teenagers as protagonists and everyone else above 20 is a milf, why we can\'t for once get an adult characters ecchi show, like only 15yrs old only gets into embarrassing dilemas. Anyway back to Origami, she\'s cliché, she\'s impulsive character, who\'s brain gets so easily manipulated by jealousy (top student) she\'s willing to put her \'love interest\' into danger cause of her ego.Yatogami Tohka. Probably the best character on DaL, she is introduced as a Spirit from another dimension/world. It is interesting to watch her discover earth\'s culture and food. She\'s probably the only character I like and it is shame that this has show such under average characters.Character progression: 7/10There are dates with spirits that usually reveals some secrets or new info about our characters and I think it\'s done quite well on ecchi standards.Story: 4/10Very interesting concept, bad characters and dissapointing execution. Dating with spirits is a major dissapointment. Moment, when we are expecting our main character to shine, to show his personality we get slapped in the face and instead we see some \'dating advice\' squad do all the work, bravo for ruining MCs potential. MC is constantly being commanded by 14yrs old mostly without balls to do things on his own. I was originally dissapointed this turned into harem, because I wanted to see more from Tohka and Shidou, but when I look back on characters, it wouldn\'t make that much of a difference.Story progression: 7/10Linear story with some flashbacks, nothing difficult to understand, pretty standard.Sound: 8/10Both opening and endings are pretty good.Summary: Date a Live rating is 6,17/10, meaning 6/10.

So that in one I can see why people like it so much.It has its cringy but amusing moments, the anime in it isn't THAT good at making up the story itself though not gonna lie. But of course I'm no one to judge.Art 'n' sound: The art and sound is amazing!Story: It's decent I'd say, cringe and amusing in one as I said, but it is not something I'd watch over and over again.Character(s):...Everything is amazing, personalities etc.Enjoyment: It was hard choosing but I'd choose the enjoyment for this an 8 or 10 not gonna lie...Overall: A decent 5.I don't have quite so much to say about this anime, but do I reccommend this anime?; Hard to say from me, but YES if you do enjoy these kind of cringe/funny animes with a weird story to it.

Either kill the spirits to get rid of them or keep them alive by having them fall in love with the MC. This season kind of played with that concept while sometimes it didn\'t as well.STORY: Story was fine. Nothing too complex to understand. The pacing did feel uneven on some of the episodes but overall it was mostly without any issues. (7/10)CHARACTERS: Most of the pieces of...a generic harem: An MC who doesn\'t really realize that all the girls are falling in love with him, a girl who falls in love with the MC in about 2-3 meetings, a shy girl who also falls in love/has affection towards the MC because he risked his life for her, a girl who isn\'t in love with the MC but probably will fall in love in the later seasons, a girl who is weirdly obsessed with the MC and finally, the little sister who loves her brother a little too much. (7/10)FLAWS: Sometimes the MCs decisions can be rather questionable on the moral front and sometimes even the viewers\' common sense is challenged in a few scenes.FINAL THOUGHTS: Decent but nothing too good. a generic harem: An MC who doesn\'t really realize that all the girls are falling in love with him, a girl who falls in love with the MC in about 2-3 meetings, a shy girl who also falls in love/has affection towards the MC because he risked his life for her, a girl who isn\'t in love with the MC but probably will fall in love in the later seasons, a girl who is weirdly obsessed with the MC and finally, the little sister who loves her brother a little too much.

Best girl IMO. But the story was absolute dog.. typical of any harem... Anyways, if you're a high schooler looking for love in Japanese anime, look no further, every single archetype or cliche is presented for any viewer (more specifically, for the teenage boys out there). DAL will always have a place in my soul. After all, it was one of my first ten animes that I have ever watched. I curse my friend back in middle school for getting me into this genre of anime. As you can see from my profile, I do say I have quite...some experience with this type of genre and have to say that the target demographic has definitely stayed consistent with each passing year. Before you ask, I'm not lonely, just disillusioned with the thought of being able to find a girl as loyal as Origami. some experience with this type of genre and have to say that the target demographic has definitely stayed consistent with each passing year.

However, I walked away from it all rather impressed. The story won’t be winning any awards for being some complex narrative.The premise is completely absurd, as is the idea of a kid being a ship captain. But the show does its absolute best with its premise and when it’s played straight, things can get intense. I like how the two main girls’ story finished with no loose ends, showing it’s committed to good storytelling.The action scenes are impressive, and I like to see the mecha musume of the AST squad. I think...that my favorite character was Tohka, she’s kind of dumb but she’s sweet and very earnest about everything that she wants to do. Also, I appreciated some of the comedy scenes and cracked up a bit.I can’t say too much about her, but “that” spirit is extremely interesting, and I will watch the sequel to see what she does next. She was honestly what made the show for me. It was her that really shocked me and made me realize Date a Live isn’t just some run-of-the-mill harem with action.In conclusion, Date a Live did way better than I thought it would with me. It is competently told yet simple and effective, funny though not all jokes land, and has interesting or at least memorable characters. If you want some above average entertainment, well here it is. that my favorite character was Tohka, she’s kind of dumb but she’s sweet and very earnest about everything that she wants to do.
