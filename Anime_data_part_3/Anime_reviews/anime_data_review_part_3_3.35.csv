Mahou Shoujo-tai Arusu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/872/Mahou_Shoujo-tai_Arusu,"['Brilliantly rendered with unique style and brimming with boundless imagination, Mahou Shoujo Tai Arisu (Magical Girl Squad Alice for the non-weeaboo among us), is a charming anime about a girl who loves magic, who falls into a realm where it is a tool of oppression and warfare. An adventure in the truest sense of the word: a journey to strange new land, and an exploration of the human heart, through challenge and trial. The show is fun to the very core, and its fictional landscape is well-realised in all its peculiar glory, but it also has some very strong dramatic moments, and some dark/mature themes,...which is what ultimately makes it so compelling. Its quirky characters befit the experimental feel of the show in general, especially the protagonist, Alice, who is simply an absolute joy to watch in any scene she&rsquo;s in. The series is 40 episodes long, but each episode is only half-length, so it actually ends up being a shorter series that usual. However, with the way the show is paced, it covers a lot more than pretty much any 26 episode series can manage. In fact, at first the ridiculous speed at which the show moves forward may seem jarring (especially, perhaps, if you&rsquo;re not too quick with subtitles). There is almost constant dialogue, and the scenes move rapidly from one to the next, so you really have to be paying attention. However, I soon got used to it, and loved the way in which it didn&rsquo;t waste time.Produced with a childishly colourful simplicity, but also with an ever-present artistic flare, the show almost always looks stunning. The actual detail in the cel animation is very low, but, as is the case with the lack of consistency in Noein&rsquo;s animation, it just doesn&rsquo;t matter, in fact I prefer the way this show looks to countless other anime irregardless of their detail. The use of colour and an innovative stylised approach make the show look fantastic, and is just one of the things that make it stand out from the crowd as a unique viewing experience. Probably the best thing about the way the show looks, though, is the directing, which, without any doubt, is some of the best I&rsquo;ve seen in any anime. Why this &lsquo;mahou shoujo&rsquo; (albeit unconventional) is deserving of such fantastic direction is beyond me, but it has it in spades. Being very fast-paced, the show has a lot of editing to deal with, and I suppose that some of the interesting techniques evolved from that. But thanks to this factor, almost every scene looks remarkable, and the effort that went in to the show&rsquo;s design really pulls through. Also, I think some of the sense of freedom the show uses as a theme seeped into the minds of the producers, because conventional is thrown out the window in favour of experimental - which, fortunately, works. My only criticism is that there are a few (2 or 3) episodes where the animation is poorly done. The music is also fantastic, especially the theme music (which is also the OP) - I just love it.The show is relentlessly energetic, propelled forward by Alice&rsquo;s uncompromising ideals, stubborn bravery, and love for fun and freedom. For me, she represents the epitome of the goodness of human beings; she is comprised of every emotional quality I value in other people and myself. I think almost all of my appreciation for the show comes from my love of her character, and the way she behaves. Her belief in magic, and her faith in herself is oftentimes inspiring. Her big heart and childish innocence lend the show a strong emotional potency, from the moments of playful laughter, to those of great sadness, Alice&rsquo;s character attached me to the show&rsquo;s emotional context. Very rarely can a character do this, and I think it&rsquo;s because she was so well-written: despite her larger-than-life attitude, she felt very believable due to the fact that despite her actions always being admirable, they were not always right. The other factor that contributed to her greatness was Alice&rsquo;s seiyuu, who I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard until I watched this anime. That&rsquo;s a shame, because the way she voiced Alice her was just spot-on, and her voice itself is so full of life and sincerity that she became her character in a way that many seiyuus don&rsquo;t manage. Needless to say, she&rsquo;s now one of my all-time favourite voice actresses.The thing that ultimately sells the show and made it such a memorable experience for me is that it tells a story with heart; every moment of the show radiates with an aura of originality, and one can see that it wasn&rsquo;t produced just to sell - it&rsquo;s not trying to appeal to its audience through generic moe or pointless mecha, it&rsquo;s trying to tell a story. It&rsquo;s the sort of impression one gets from reading a good book, but one I rarely get from watching anime, and in a sense, that is why this show appealed to me so much; beyond its actual quality it speaks to my inner love for fiction as a product of passionate creativity. To sum up the series, I&rsquo;ll say that it is the best mahou shoujo (if you care to call it that) series I&rsquo;ve ever seen. It is dark and dramatic at times, has a thoroughly compelling plot, memorable characters, an exciting plot, and is always great fun to watch. I&rsquo;m positive that most people won&rsquo;t agree with me on this, and even I&rsquo;m surprised at how much I enjoyed the series - if you only like shounen or fanservice: stay away, otherwise, give it a try! which is what ultimately makes it so compelling.

Like every good children\'s artwork, it also holds appeal for a much larger (and older) audience. Unlike others series aimed at the same public, there is nothing done here to satisfy male-chauvinist fantasies and that is a very welcome change. Everything in this anime breathes honesty. The only flaws are, perhaps, a little over-ambitiousness and, sometimes, a slight lack of clarity. Alll this being said, ""Young Witch Squad Alice"" remains, in my opinion, an absolute must-see anime and I shall try, in this review, to explain...why I came to this conclusion.Story: 9/10The story has a plot somewhat inspired by Lewis Carrol\'s book (hence the name of the main character, no doubt) but does not have the same dream-like absurdity or disjointedness. Like Carrol\'s Alice, our young heroine falls down to a another (dream) world in which everything is very symbolical. In it, magic and the people who wield it are means of expressing very diverse messages all connected to the hopes and doubts of the young Alice. There are many themes treated including identity, individual freedom, love, ambition, knowledge, etc... Each of these themes is addressed with care and all characters and places introduced serve a clear purpose to that effect.One scene is a perfect example of the whole atmosphere of the show. A little after Alice\'s arrival, she is brought before the Grand Mistress of the witches along with the two witches who had her in their custody and then let her out of her cage ( namely Sheila and Eve), resulting in the escape of a great number of fairies. The two young girls are punished for the escape of the fairies and a ""curse of eternal youth"" is cast upon them until they retrieve the lost creatures! There are so many adults who fear old age and decrepitude that they forget that children want to grow up and that staying a child forever is a nightmare to them. The show reminds us how unhealthy it is to want to remain a child but does so in a very creative way, without being insulting.The story spans over a wide array of themes but also places and times and though it encompasses a whole imaginary world it remains very personal. Indeedl, everything rotates around Alice, her absent father, her gloomy view of the real world and the ways she seeks to deal with her doubts and fears. Despite its great ambition, the show often has a very light and enjoyable tone. Even during the more dramatic episodes, there is measure, and though there might be darkness there is no glorification of despair. Some of the finer messages put forth might prove harder to read for a young audience (for instance the ""mirror"" half brother) but will certainly please an older one.Characters: 9/10Like the story, all the characters in this anime are very symbolical and none of them are truly good or truly evil. There are very few characters one cannot sympathize with, to a certain extent, and the design behind each of these was well researched and executed.The main character is an energetic and fun loving girl with a lot of maturity but also a great sense of justice which results in slightly rowdy or rebellious behaviour. She is also very creative and her imagination is a tool she uses to deal with the harsh aspects of her life.Sheila and Eve are the other two members of the squad. Sheila is at first a very law abiding student, eager to earn respect and frowning upon deviation from set courses, even if they seem unfair. Her character evolves for the better as the show progresses and does so in a rather realistic way. Eve is generous and loving but also somewhat weak-willed and cowardly and those traits will factor greatly in the evolution of her character. It sometimes seems as if these two characters reflect two aspects of Alice\'s personality.The remaining cast could be talked about in detail but I will leave you the pleasure of discovering them!Art: 8/10Very original to say the least, the art might seem a little odd at first but, in my opinion, fits the world of Alice perfectly. Many of the charaters, creatures, places and vehicles are a pleasure to the eye. The originality of the design is yet another indication of the great effort spent in making this show. The animaton and art seemed very good to me though perhaps not to the point of inspiring awe.Sound: 9/10A very strong point here. The score (and even the ending song) fit the world of Alice perfectly. The music is not incredibly original butI have rarely ever heard anything so well adapted to a show.Enjoyment: 8/10I greatly enjoyed this show and would recommend it to just about anyone.Overall: 8/10Remember that a score of 8/10 means very good. I could probably have given it 9/10 if I just followed my feelings. I truly hope this anime will gain a larger audience in the future so that the anime industry will be inspired to create more such shows. why I came to this conclusion.Story: 9/10The story has a plot somewhat inspired by Lewis Carrol\'s book (hence the name of the main character, no doubt) but does not have the same dream-like absurdity or disjointedness.

I\'ll tell you where it went wrong at ""the bad things"".The art, holy-moly the art was fantastic. It was refreshing, almost realistic, but not off-putting. It seemed to have come directly from a colorful web-comic like W.I.T.C.H. (but with even better art). There are so many...wonderful designs for objects solely used by witches (the dog-chest, the dragon-house etc.).The only thing that was off-putting were the facial-expressions sometimes. They picked the weirdest times to show off their skills in the ""dramatically-disturbed look""  department. (you know the one, big eyes, forehead-zoom in that looks really creepy).Voice acting:  The voices showed off the character\'s personalities well (tbh, I wouldn\'t be able to pull of Arusu\'s up-beat character for so long even If I had the training).The only voice-actor that left me wondering was the one of Lennon (Renon), whose gender was supposed to be ambiguous, but the voice left little to the imagination.The mediocre things:Characters: Don\'t get me wrong I like them, archetype and all, but their personalities were either too consistent or all over the place. A change of one\'s mind could take up a few minutes before they\'d be back to their old personality again. Their motivations are also vague.(Does Arusu want to go back to the human realm, or does she want to stay? Who knows, not her).Sound: I didn\'t hear anything special in it. The Opening was just a less than epic instrumental and the ending, though soothing enough to make you fall asleep, didn\'t really stick with me. The rest of the OST didn\'t stand out to me and was sometimes a little creepy- though that did fit the situation sometimes.The bad things:The plot:With the plot I mean the following: Structure, pacing, possible potholes and other plot bunnies that never came to fruition.Man oh man, from the beginning I could tell the pacing was off, and it irked me bad. The beginning wasn\'t a beginning but a flash-forward, just like many of the scenes to follow were either badly timed flash-forwards or flashbacks. Take this and put it into a structure that already had no clue where it was going, and you have a mess.The storyline started off simple enough; one objective, and a punishment if it wasn\'t done. But the objective was not only undoable, but also unfair and mathematically (or evolutionary, depending on how you look at the fairy crisis), nonsense. [You want to tell Me, there\'s only one fairy of every species in that entire world? Makes no sense at all.]There were many things that, in the end, didn\'t get resolved (or I had to guess at, like the timeline of the Witch realm and the human realm: a complete mess). Facts were almost always presented late, or kept as guesswork.Some questions I have that contains spoilers- read at own risk:[Why is there such animosity between witches and warlocks? When was the human realm and witch realm divided, and how? How did daddy dearest have two children in different timelines (which doesn\'t add up), How did a child survive alone in that dimensional sea? ] /End of spoilers.Conclusion:It\'s such a shame it turned out this way. If the story-boarders had just paid a little more attention to the structure and maybe a little less time on quests that didn\'t make it through anyway, I might\'ve actually given this a way higher grade.If you just like to watch something when you\'re bored, this show is not a bad way to kill time, but don\'t expect too much, or you might get dizzy. wonderful designs for objects solely used by witches (the dog-chest, the dragon-house etc.).The only thing that was off-putting were the facial-expressions sometimes.

The story overall in itself is genius, and except for a few things is very likable. So, what isn't likable about the storyline?The thing about Mahou Shoujo Tai Arusu is that it likes to slam the reader over the head with 'ideas'. For example, there are messages that become apparent in some of the episodes. One is that we depend to much on technollogy. The other...is that evoulution is true, which might upset people who either refuse to believe it, or hate it when it isn't treated like a theory.And the overall theme is peace instead of violence. The problem with this message, is human nature itself has always had to have a balance of these two. Of course, this is a story where there needs to be a happy ending, so this in a way works.Art: 7The art in here is experimental in the style. There is a lot of detail in their, but in the same time, not a lot. For example, there is detail put into the intricate designs of the costumes and clothing, but the hair and other things lack texture, and it isn't blocked in, not to mention that shadow for visual depth is lacking, giving the anime a kind of haunted look.And some of the techniques don't quite fit. For example, when the characters cry, their tears become really sparkly and look more three dimentional shadow wise then anything else. Other times, one is given a wierd effect as they distort things visualy.Also, flash back are flash backs, flashing in and out for a few seconds. While this fits with the mood and theme of the anime, it should be warned here... if you run the chance of having siezures, you may not want to watch this anime, even if you might find it delightful.Sound: 10The sound was haunting, action packed, and fit the moods as they came and went. The score was beutiful and is one of the highlights of this anime.Character: 10Part of the enjoyment of the characters is that, if it isn't am unnamed character, they are given lots of attention to detail on the designs of the characters. The second part of the enjoyment is the depth behind hte characters. Each has a very distinct personality, which actually helps the storyline along, and to go into depth about the characters would spoil the actual story.Enjoyment: 8While I rather enjoyied this, there was a point where I had to put down the anime. The main reason is, I got annoyied at the time with Alice's overly positive attitude at that time. However, I met characters that I really liked later on, others that I knew I was meant to hate.Overall: 7This isn't going to be for everyone. Some will take one look at the art style and choke. Others will get fed up with Alice's attitude of positiveness, while others will not like things bashed over their head.

But it is at least worth watching for a bit to from ones own opinion..."", ""I wanted to start my reviews on my anime list with an anime that is not popular and not very well known. After seeing “Tai Asuru” or “Tweeny Witches”, I was kind of surprise of the quality of this show when the only thing that makes me curious to see it was the picture. The synopsis was normal, nothing promising. I mean, it seems like a synopsis of “Alice in Wonderland”, so nothing original at all. Also, the average note of the anime isn’t high. At least, the people that have taking the time to review it have an average between 8 and 9, so,...I was not totally thinking that it will be bad.The picture represents very well what kind of anime this show is. Yes, it will be a big roller coaster ride, a pretty chaotic one.Story: 9It’s an anime that is very fast paced. In fact, the only other thing that was that fast that I have seen was maybe a movie from Takashi Miike named Family that I have seen in the last weeks. The story will shake the boundaries of your imagination many times in the course of the show. But what makes this story so good is maybe how the two cultures are described for the two people out there. (The witches and the other that I will not name) I can easily make a comparison with real culture in our real world. One is very close to the way of thinking of the Asian people (Traditions and honour over anything else), the other represent the Occidental way of thinking. (People that live their normal innocent life without knowing exactly what their chiefs are doing, Comparison with the Bush era and all the bad thing he has done while the people were living happily and also other country where it surely happen) A fiction is always better when you can see some kind of comparison or maybe social critic in it. Another thing that I want to point out is the fact that this show is way more an adventure fantasy than anything else. Even one of the recent named Madoka Magika is more a magical girl than this one. The different actions seem predictable, but you will still be surprise. I won’t say that it’s unpredictable, but at the same time, it won’t be easy to know what will happen, I was thinking on how this series will be finished, I was sure about something, and in the end, it was totally something else. That fast paced story always makes me interest about it, I have stopped two times while watching it, but it’s not because I don’t wanted to finish it in one day.Art: 8/10It’s not that good; in fact, it’s a pretty detached kind of art. It was fitting the anime very well on the other hand by helping the chaotic aspect of the anime of being smoother. With an art as good like Death Note, it will be too dark and with an art like Angel Beast, it will have seems a bit too cut up. If you like perfection in imperfection, you will probably like it. (Sometimes, imperfection help something for giving a atmosphere. I talked about a floating atmosphere here.)Sound: 9/10The op is a highlight. It has a Bohemian vibe to it. A bit of epic, not much, that is totally balanced with the show. I have also to point out the drum that make a little atmosphere of a tribal world that also emphases on the fact that the anime is not in the real world. The music in the anime is well fitting with the pace of the show. The ep is only a pass song, but it’s for closure, so ok. The voice acting is perfect, actually, I found myself listening to this anime on high volume, while normally, I’m not that proud of the voice acting that I lower the volume.Character: 9/10I’m pretty surprise of the deepness of the character. Nothing seems forced, and the evolution of them is normal. Nothing extravagant. What I mean is the fact that each character has his own way of thinking, and they don’t accept things that are not similar to their habitude easily. Sheila is maybe the best example for this, because it takes long before she start to accept the fact that she’s maybe is wrong about the tradition that her people is thinking was normal. It’s the same case for all the other character, only one is more open minded and it’s Eva. Eva is open minded because she a bit depressed. She sees in Alice someone that could help her and maybe this is exactly why she accept Alice toughs more easily. Alice is certain that magic is something that make people happy. Been in this world where traddition, authority and natural selection is apply to the feeble frustrate her. She will then want to prove that the witches are wrong. She's not that happy or not feeble at all, in fact, there will be times where she won't know what to do next. Ateria is a character that will grow larger by the end of the show, you only have one clue about it in the first episode, it appear at the moment...(I'm not gonna tell you, see for yourself)Enjoyment: 9/10There’s a bit of humour, but the main reason you will like this anime is the fast paced story that will always make you want to know the rest. The fact that the episode are of less than 9 minutes is maybe the reason why it’s so easy to be drive in. A 20 minutes show doesn’t do the same effect. (By having episode of less than 10 minutes, they have to make a reversal in every episode for giving to the audience something to grip on. If you want something big to happen in all 10 minutes, then, your story is sure to be pretty fast paced and never let down the course of action.)Overall: 9/10I have put out one point from 10 because of the ep song that is not really good, the fact that the anime is a bit difficult to follow in terms of speed. Finally, it’s not totally innovative enough to be considered a masterpiece.In the end, it’s more a 9 than a 8, but I understand why this show isn’t that well receive. I was not totally thinking that it will be bad.The picture represents very well what kind of anime this show is. Yes, it will be a big roller coaster ride, a pretty chaotic one.Story: 9It’s an anime that is very fast paced. In fact, the only other thing that was that fast that I have seen was maybe a movie from Takashi Miike named Family that I have seen in the last weeks. The story will shake the boundaries of your imagination many times in the course of the show. But what makes this story so good is maybe how the two cultures are described for the two people out there. (The witches and the other that I will not name) I can easily make a comparison with real culture in our real world. One is very close to the way of thinking of the Asian people (Traditions and honour over anything else), the other represent the Occidental way of thinking. (People that live their normal innocent life without knowing exactly what their chiefs are doing, Comparison with the Bush era and all the bad thing he has done while the people were living happily and also other country where it surely happen) A fiction is always better when you can see some kind of comparison or maybe social critic in it. Another thing that I want to point out is the fact that this show is way more an adventure fantasy than anything else. Even one of the recent named Madoka Magika is more a magical girl than this one. The different actions seem predictable, but you will still be surprise. I won’t say that it’s unpredictable, but at the same time, it won’t be easy to know what will happen, I was thinking on how this series will be finished, I was sure about something, and in the end, it was totally something else. That fast paced story always makes me interest about it, I have stopped two times while watching it, but it’s not because I don’t wanted to finish it in one day.Art: 8/10It’s not that good; in fact, it’s a pretty detached kind of art.

Being the oddball idealist that she is, Arusu, the human newcomer, manages to get away with destroying the tradition of the magic realm and disrupting what the witches would deem normal by using her enthusiasm and optimism to assure everybody that magic exists to make people happy. Magic is not a tool of war, and war will eventually lead to destruction, despite the ideals that the...higher-up witches hold in high regard.It can\'t be said that the plot is unpredictable, but each episode is short (at ten minutes) and keeps the viewer on their toes as to what will happen next. The story isn\'t hard to follow, and seems to rush into some elements without much explanation (i.e. the magical realm is going to be destroyed), but it is charming and enjoyable in a way that keeps it watchable despite the numerous clichés and tropes it employs.The reason I watched this show is that Studio 4C was involved, and they are renowned for making exceptional anime.

In spite of her human origins, Arisu finds that she too can make use of magic in the realm and becomes acquainted with witch apprentices, Eva and Sheila, as she learns more of the world's workings.At a glance, Tweeny Witches sports nothing groundbreaking in regards to its premise and characters. The focus on a magical world with witches is inspired from Western lore and the series is rather predictable in its plot developments...with Arisu's trio tasked with retrieving the sprites they lost, gradually learning to bond with one another, and eventually coming across an enemy threat to the witch's realm. All the characters have their specific character types they fall under with Arisu the genki gal, Sheila the tsundere, and Eva having confidence issues. However, the series does do a competent job at fleshing out their characters and exploring more about the witch's realm and its workings with how they regard magic and any mingling they have with humans and male magic-users called warlocks. The chemistry between the three also makes for the more enjoyable, and sometimes funny, elements of the series. In spite of each episode to the series being only at eight minutes a piece, Tweeny Witches makes effective use of its time with character exploration and world-building.If there's a major issue I do have with Tweeny Witches though, it comes from the show's forced efforts to push its moral. It seemed like Tweeny Witches may have been made in mind for a younger audience as it idealistically pushes the idea that one's wishes can come true if you wish hard enough for them. This is regularly forced down the viewer's throats by Arisu who has an idealistic bent in regards to her belief in magic being for the good of everyone and not harming others, this clashing with the more jaded outlook that the witches have in regards to its use. Still, this doesn't stop the series from seeming to conveniently work things in Arisu's favor at a number of points in the series to push its moral, even at the price of engaging storytelling for those not among the show's apparently young demographic.Visuals for the series are a bit of a mixed bag. While sporting some creative settings and some Western-inspired character designs that stick out from the typical anime style, the series is rife in a good number of animation shortcuts to get around more elaborate animated sequences such as broom-flying scenes or any magical shenanigans occurring. Also, character designs can usually degrade in quality at points, this becoming noticeable during some later episodes in the series.Still in spite of not offering anything groundbreaking, Tweeny Witches still made for solid entertainment in exploring the developments of Arisu and her friends within the world of witches, even if it gets a bit too heavy-handed at times with pushing its idealistic message. with Arisu's trio tasked with retrieving the sprites they lost, gradually learning to bond with one another, and eventually coming across an enemy threat to the witch's realm.

This 2 parter, Tadaima◇Okaeri,  is hopefully the start of many more new episodes in the life of Mahoro, Miniwa and Suguru.The story takes place between day 270 and day 267 of the remaining days left for Mahoro and involves the old gang coming together to create a maid cafe for the local shopping district festival.

So….yeah, if you remember that ending to the show and thought the OVA was changing things after that, well, you thought wrong.Suguru Misato lives with two maids, Minawa-chan and Mahoro-san, who are combat robots from the war between the alien life form Saint and the Earth. Both were allowed to live on...as maids without weapons. While Suguru, Hamaji, Miyuki-chan and three other classmates prepare for a maid cafe to celebrate the Hiryushi town’s 120-years anniversary, Mahoro-san and Minawa-chan are attacked by robots.So, the whole two-episode OVA is pretty much like the basic structure of the series as I last saw it but it is more restrained than what its usual plot of the show with Mahoro and Minawa being powerful maid weapons and them being hunted by the Management. I will say compared to their last side-story The Summer Special, it didn’t felt like a throwaway episode that relies on the gags only, although the gags appear in here, too. Some gags happened to be funny while the rest is painfully cringe worthy involving one character who really annoyed me during the series’ run.As I said in the Mahoromatic review (this is just a recap of those characters) is that I do find Mahoro to be a charming, interesting and endearing character who, despite being a robotic maid, is the one character in the show I really felt for and also what else I like about Mahoro is that while some embarrassing moments happen to her, she can be very stern about that but she isn’t being a cold bitch about it.. Suguru…..still an okay character; The “Triomatic” (Miyuki, Rin, Chizuko) and his two friends Toshiya and Kiyomi are nothing that interesting to me; Ms. Shikijo is still the most annoying character in the show, especially when trying to seduce Suguru to himself (and how much I wanted Mahoro to end her); Slash is still cool (He’s a partner) and Ryuga, too. Minawa is still fresh in my mind as the newer addition to the group and she’s clumsy while Suguru’s friend Toshiya is crushing on her deep.Yes, there is still some fan service in this show but to be fair, it’s more subtle than most shows of this genre turn out to be (remember “This Ugly yet Beautiful World”/ You shouldn’t.) and the fact that aspect doesn’t take over the show. There is also that it’s just GAINAX is control of the series with SHAFT overall being absent in the production and the animation does perform very well and visually an improvement from the 2002-2003 series (the OVA was released in 2009).The musical score is something that has its cutesy thing going for it and they do fit very well, much like the ending themes to the first two TV series and while I personally don’t care for it, it does rather alright. Now, Sentai Filmworks did license the OVA along with the series from Geneon, they did brought back the dub cast from Bang Zoom Entertainment, with some recasting in some roles. First, as I should’ve said this in the first review, I love Ellen Wilkerson as Mahoro in the dub as I always find her voice acting to be believable as that character. I did like Christine Marie Cabanos as Minawa more or equal to as the previous actress playing her and for Ryuga, Keith Silverstein did do alright but I thought David Lucas was better, not to downplay Keith’s performance. Surprisingly, I did noticed Erik Scott Kimerer, pre-Accel World in this dub.FINAL VERDICT: This special is like my rating of the series as I did have enjoyment in the series with some problems of what they can come up with. It’s a passable OVA that doesn’t stray too far of the original show. I would say you can stream the two only but if you want the Complete Mahoromatic experience, you should check out this and the series overall. as maids without weapons.

I started watching this OVA expecting to leave infuriated and disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised with what I saw.This is only two episodes long, and the short length works in its favour. It doesn't have time to linger on fanservice (though it is present), so it focuses more on the important parts of this series: the battles, the romance, and the characters. The battle was quite cool (it had transforming robots!), as were the rest of the sci-fi vehicles and lore, which made me a lot more sympathetic towards this OVA. The characters (with the...exception of an annoying character who mainly exists in this anime to be sexualized) were likeable as well. The visuals were nice as well -- this has warm colours, a good approximation of cel animation (the original Mahoromatic series was one of the last animes to be cel-animated), and a dash of well-used CGI.If you want a nice, short OVA to watch in under an hour that has cool battles, a warm vibe, and romance, the Mahoromatic OVA would be a good fit. You need little knowledge of the original series to enjoy it (since the premise is explained in the beginning of the first episode). You can easily avert your eyes from the cringey fanservice elements but not miss out on much either, which is a plus. Even if you hate fanservice (though I suggest you avoid this if fanservice is a trigger for you), you'll be pleasantly surprised, as this OVA will give you lots of other things to enjoy.Overall, this is a surprisingly good OVA -- nothing groundbreaking or super cool, but it's still entertaining and beautifully animated. exception of an annoying character who mainly exists in this anime to be sexualized) were likeable as well.

Mazinkaiser SKL,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8666/Mazinkaiser_SKL,"['Japan has produced here is probably the most direct, pull-no-punches super robot series I\'ve ever seen. It gets right down and dirty to the point: There is a badass robot, two badass dudes and lots of shit to ruin in a beautifully animated blaze of glory while lots of huge boobed chicks watch from the sidelines.The story goes like this: The world is modernized and awesome, giant metal buildings, highways through the sky, all of that. That\'s not where the show takes place. SKL\'s tale of gallant heroism resides on an island that\'s permanently stuck in an 80\'s metal video. The shit that goes on...on this island is so metal, in fact, that it\'s threatening to destroy the world via a catastrophe which I can only imagine will involve no less than 4.7 billion wailing guitar solos. So, like an old couple calling the cops on a noisy garage band, the modern people send a bunch of dudes to the island to make them calm their party down.There was one survivor.Said fairly hot survivor girl finds out that the island is cut into three(or rather, four) armies that\'re zapping the planet of all its energy because they\'re making too many giant robots or some shit. There\'s Team A: the one that\'s led by Nobuyuki Hiyama and his team of Road Warrior-esque dudes in their quest for more bitches. A noble endeavor. Then there\'s Team B: led by a big majestic samurai dude in a Japanese castle all covered with spikes and cool shit. He\'s not relevant until episode two. And then we have Team C: a big serene fortress inhabited entirely by young women in togas with huge boobs, who have similarly huge boobed giant robots to defend their castle with. Isn\'t this grand? Finally, we have the most import team: Mothafuckin\' Mazinkaiser. Or rather, ""that skull fuck"", as Team A\'s leader puts it. One robot piloted by two dudes who have no reason to be on the island other than the fact they like to wreck shit. Easily the most just cause out of everyone here.And now we have the characters.-MAZINKAISER: The most badass robot of the year, it looks like something Dethklok would think up. It\'s piloted by two badass dudes gone rogue, via a cockpit that vertically spins around to let one guy break stuff while the other puts his feet up and kicks back. It\'s hilariously cool.-BADASS PILOT 1: Kaido. Hotblooded Kaido pilots Mazinkaiser by crushing and slashing shit to pieces with giant swords and rocket fists.-BADASS PILOT A: Magami. Coldblooded Magami pilots Mazinkaiser by shooting and stabbing shit to pieces with tomahawk guns.-Yuki Tsubasa: Creatively named female who was the only survivor in mankind\'s feeble attempt to make the above characters and armies calm the fuck down.Art and animation?u kidin me?Let\'s just move onMusic?It\'s metal.Overall?Watching animu rarely gets more fun than this. ""It\'s fucking awesome"" is generally an overused term, but this is the sort of thing it was always meant to describe. Mediablasters is bringing this to the US on BluRay(worth it) in a few months, but since that company is godawful, don\'t expect to see a single ad or notice that it\'s out.

It looked fast and bloody, with crisp animation and a stirring classical score.  Now that I\'ve watched the first OVA, I can say that it\'s very far from revolutionary; closer to Rabelais than to Chateaubriand.Thankfully, most of the episode sticks with mech combat.  As obvious as that may sound, plenty of mech series try to shoehorn some plot with humans.  There was so much mech combat that it was a bit jarring to transition to Kiba\'s brothel scene.  Which is a good thing....It feels good to see humans when there are so many robots beating the shit out of each other.  I thought I\'d never say this.  Usually, with mech anime, I\'m screaming for the humans to get off the screen.  But in Mazinkaiser SKL they\'re well-acted, well-animated and written with character, so they\'re a welcome change from the cold shriek of battle.Some other observations: I love Captain Scarlet.  Too bad she died ten minutes into episode one.  ""Every last one of you looks like you want to run home and suck on your mom\'s\' tits!""  Great.  Classic.  Reminded me of Full Metal Jacket.Just like Nagai\'s anime from the 70s, this show is very light on plot, which is both a positive and negative quality.  It\'s cool that no time is wasted on the way to the fighting robots, but if Mazinkaiser SKL (that\'s the skull mech, right?) is so notorious and shit there really wasn\'t much of a precedent to indicate that.Also, there was too much CG.  I hate the current trend in anime which involves sparkling rays of sunlight coming from every angle.  I wish more of it was hand-drawn, like the original Mazinkaiser was, and brilliantly so.That\'s all.  Good mech shounen with a cool soundtrack.

Mokke,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2931/Mokke,"['*Re-write due to system crash*I admit to being a fan of folklore and mythology and, because of this, I\'m always rather pleased when a series manages to incorporate the essence of such things into its plot to good effect. Its unfortunate that many series that make the attempt manage to fail in one way or another (Dark Myth being a prime example).Thankfully, Mokke doesn\'t fall into that category.Mokke started life as a manga series by Kamakura Takatoshi, and was first serialized by the seinen manga magazine ""Afternoon Season Zoukan"" in 2000. The manga was suspended after it\'s 14th issue however, and wasn\'t continued until March...2003, when it was serialized in Kodansha\'s ""Afternoon"" magazine (which is apparently a separate seinen magazine).The re-release proved to be far more popular, and spawned the anime adaptation which was directed by Nishida Masayoshi (Allison & Lillia, Eyeshield 21), and produced by MADHOUSE. The series began broadcasting in October 2007, however it was overshadowed by the major releases of the Autumn season that year, something which is truly a shame for this understated, and highly underrated story.The series follows the lives of the two Hibara sisters, and their various encounters with beings and phenomena of supernatural origins. The elder sister, Shizuru, is a high school student with an ability to see and converse with ghosts and other beings. The younger sister, Mizuki, is in elementary school, and whilst she can hear and speak to ghosts and such, she can\'t see them, and is often possesed by them.The story is essentially a supernatural slice-of-life tale which is told using an episodic format rather than having a ""true"" over-arching plot (very much like Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc). This format allows one to jump in at any point with no real loss of enjoyment. Mokke incorporates many aspects of traditional Japanese myth and folklore that actually enhance the story to a great degree, especially given the differing perspectives that are on hand throughout the series (more on this in a bit).The title is also very appropriate for a supernatural tale such as this, Mokke (もっけ), being the Hiragana representation of the Kanji mokke (勿怪), which basically means ""unexpected"".The artwork for the series is extremely well done. The backgrounds roam freely between the picturesque rural setting, to the foreboding shadow infested nighttime forests. The detailed scenery adds a sense of depth and realism to the tale, especially when the characters are involved. In some parts the series may have a slightly surreal ""Ghibli-esque"" quality about the scenery, but given that much of this tale is set in the countryside that may only be natural.The characters themselves are well designed. Shizuru and Mizuki have a fresh-faced, innocent look about them, a contrast to their grandparents, who are suitably careworn and elderly. The character design takes a realistic approach in terms of clothing and apparel, however the faces are often very simplistic to heighten the effect of emotions the characters are feeling. The downside to this though, is that there are occasions when the characters have a distinct ""cartoon"" feeling, which can throw people off by adding a comedic element where none is intended.The sound is of a very high standard throughout the series. Kawasumi Ayako plays the role of Shizuru extremely well, whilst Mizuki Nana manages to capture the precociously playful persona of her namesake. The real star though, is Hori Katsunosuke, who provides a calm yet stern atmosphere to the grandfather.The music used throughout the series is generally very good. The OP is a pleasant ballad which adopts a slightly more traditional style, however the ED was a bit too J-pop for my tastes. The background scores used throughout the series were very well selected, however there are moments that feel a little off (but that may just be me). That said, my favourite bits of the score are most definitely the creepy, music-box type pieces, as they are very much in keeping with certain stories told within the series.The characters are one of the high points of the series. As is common with shows that use the epsiodic format, character development is often disjointed, or lacking entirely. Thankfully Mokke doesn\'t fall into this category either as both Shizuru and Mizuki are very real characters in terms of their thoughts, actions and perspectives. The most interesting part about the characters though, is how each views the various supernatural occurences in a different way. Shizuru is generally more able to handle some things on her own, and posseses a certain calming quality because of this. Mizuki, on the other hand, is all too aware of the fact that she is easily possesed, a fact which often impinges on her ability to do and say the things she wants.The most defined character in the series though, is actually the grandfather of the two girls. He works as the local priest and is very familiar with things of a supernatural bent. Most importantly, he knows how to deal with such things, and he has taken on the role of protector for his two grandchildren. The great thing about his character is the fact that he is almost fully developed from the start of the series, and because of this he projects an air of assurance and capability that is sometimes lacking in older characters.One of the most fascinating aspects of the series is the relationship between Shizuru, Mizuki and their grandfather. The various phenomena that occur can often be viewed from three very different perspectives, giving them a greater depth and impact. In addition to this, the grandfather may be viewed as callous and uncaring at times, however this is a gross misunderstanding. His role isn\'t simply that of a protector for the two girls, but also a teacher. He understands more than anyone that he has only so much time to teach the girls how to take care of themselves, and his attitude is highlighted well in the fourth episode (Waraiyami, or The Laughing Darkness). His stern nature is actually very important to the series as a whole, and the reason for his sometimes unforgiving method of teaching becomes very clear by the end of the series.Mokke is an unusual and highly enjoyable series that will appeal to any fan of Mushishi, Ghost Hound, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc. The show has a certain innocent yet adventurous quality that is appealing to those who like folklore and mythology, and whilst it may lack some of the darker elements of Mushishi and Ghost Hound, this is only because it takes a very different approach to the supernatural.On the whole, this is a very good series that I would recommend to any fan of slice-of-life shows. Fans of Aria would probably enjoy Mokke immensely, and any fan of supernatural shows will find this rewarding viewing. The detailed nature of the phenomena and how to deal with them sets it apart from most other supernatural series, making it more similar to Mushishi or Mononoke in certain respects. The characters are wonderfully realised though, and it is because of them that this show doesn\'t slide down the path of taking itself too seriously. 2003, when it was serialized in Kodansha\'s ""Afternoon"" magazine (which is apparently a separate seinen magazine).The re-release proved to be far more popular, and spawned the anime adaptation which was directed by Nishida Masayoshi (Allison & Lillia, Eyeshield 21), and produced by MADHOUSE. The series began broadcasting in October 2007, however it was overshadowed by the major releases of the Autumn season that year, something which is truly a shame for this understated, and highly underrated story.The series follows the lives of the two Hibara sisters, and their various encounters with beings and phenomena of supernatural origins. The elder sister, Shizuru, is a high school student with an ability to see and converse with ghosts and other beings. The younger sister, Mizuki, is in elementary school, and whilst she can hear and speak to ghosts and such, she can\'t see them, and is often possesed by them.The story is essentially a supernatural slice-of-life tale which is told using an episodic format rather than having a ""true"" over-arching plot (very much like Mushishi, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc). This format allows one to jump in at any point with no real loss of enjoyment. Mokke incorporates many aspects of traditional Japanese myth and folklore that actually enhance the story to a great degree, especially given the differing perspectives that are on hand throughout the series (more on this in a bit).The title is also very appropriate for a supernatural tale such as this, Mokke (もっけ), being the Hiragana representation of the Kanji mokke (勿怪), which basically means ""unexpected"".The artwork for the series is extremely well done. The backgrounds roam freely between the picturesque rural setting, to the foreboding shadow infested nighttime forests. The detailed scenery adds a sense of depth and realism to the tale, especially when the characters are involved. In some parts the series may have a slightly surreal ""Ghibli-esque"" quality about the scenery, but given that much of this tale is set in the countryside that may only be natural.The characters themselves are well designed. Shizuru and Mizuki have a fresh-faced, innocent look about them, a contrast to their grandparents, who are suitably careworn and elderly. The character design takes a realistic approach in terms of clothing and apparel, however the faces are often very simplistic to heighten the effect of emotions the characters are feeling. The downside to this though, is that there are occasions when the characters have a distinct ""cartoon"" feeling, which can throw people off by adding a comedic element where none is intended.The sound is of a very high standard throughout the series. Kawasumi Ayako plays the role of Shizuru extremely well, whilst Mizuki Nana manages to capture the precociously playful persona of her namesake. The real star though, is Hori Katsunosuke, who provides a calm yet stern atmosphere to the grandfather.The music used throughout the series is generally very good. The OP is a pleasant ballad which adopts a slightly more traditional style, however the ED was a bit too J-pop for my tastes. The background scores used throughout the series were very well selected, however there are moments that feel a little off (but that may just be me). That said, my favourite bits of the score are most definitely the creepy, music-box type pieces, as they are very much in keeping with certain stories told within the series.The characters are one of the high points of the series. As is common with shows that use the epsiodic format, character development is often disjointed, or lacking entirely. Thankfully Mokke doesn\'t fall into this category either as both Shizuru and Mizuki are very real characters in terms of their thoughts, actions and perspectives. The most interesting part about the characters though, is how each views the various supernatural occurences in a different way. Shizuru is generally more able to handle some things on her own, and posseses a certain calming quality because of this. Mizuki, on the other hand, is all too aware of the fact that she is easily possesed, a fact which often impinges on her ability to do and say the things she wants.The most defined character in the series though, is actually the grandfather of the two girls. He works as the local priest and is very familiar with things of a supernatural bent. Most importantly, he knows how to deal with such things, and he has taken on the role of protector for his two grandchildren. The great thing about his character is the fact that he is almost fully developed from the start of the series, and because of this he projects an air of assurance and capability that is sometimes lacking in older characters.One of the most fascinating aspects of the series is the relationship between Shizuru, Mizuki and their grandfather. The various phenomena that occur can often be viewed from three very different perspectives, giving them a greater depth and impact. In addition to this, the grandfather may be viewed as callous and uncaring at times, however this is a gross misunderstanding. His role isn\'t simply that of a protector for the two girls, but also a teacher. He understands more than anyone that he has only so much time to teach the girls how to take care of themselves, and his attitude is highlighted well in the fourth episode (Waraiyami, or The Laughing Darkness). His stern nature is actually very important to the series as a whole, and the reason for his sometimes unforgiving method of teaching becomes very clear by the end of the series.Mokke is an unusual and highly enjoyable series that will appeal to any fan of Mushishi, Ghost Hound, Natsume Yuujinchou, etc. The show has a certain innocent yet adventurous quality that is appealing to those who like folklore and mythology, and whilst it may lack some of the darker elements of Mushishi and Ghost Hound, this is only because it takes a very different approach to the supernatural.On the whole, this is a very good series that I would recommend to any fan of slice-of-life shows.

No other media, that i know of, can produce so many shows with scenes of people eating breakfast and doing the laundry yet still manage to be interesting, (save perhaps some classic british series like Jeeves and Wooster), but it does it, and not only that but it often does it quite well, one only has to look at series\' like Aria, Natsume Yujincho, Hibane renmei,  to see this is true. But from here the trail follows that the best slice of life series\'...are those that successfully mix slice of life with the supernatural, and so be easily relatable but still mysterious, interesting but not ridiculous, and most important of all, require the audience to think a little to discover the meaning behind each episode…Mokke for me, took many of these principles to heart, but perhaps sliced off a little to much life and didn\'t leave enough room in its tummy for a developed plot or story, but more on that particular cake later…The series tells the story of two young girls who both have the ability to interact with ghosts, Shizuru, a high school student is even able to see them, while her younger sister, Mizuki can\'t, but is easily possessed by them. In order to find some peace they both move to the country to live with their grandparents, who have had some experience dealing with these spirits. Together they must both learn that they cannot simply avoid or destroy their ghostly apparitions all their lives, but instead must lean to coexist, and maybe even learn something about themselves and life along the way.In terms of actual plot theres not much beyond the original premise, and thats to be somewhat expected, even preferred in this genre. The story mostly involves episodic plots about one of the girls (rarely both unfortunately) interacting with these ghosts. With Shizuru usually dealing with the creatures affecting those close to her, having to deal with her helplessness and loneliness not being able to talk to or help her close friends. And Mizuki having to deal with the fact thats ghost see her body as a thief sees a stately home with its front door left open. All the while trying to hide her abilities from her close friends and enjoy her childhood as best she can.  An upward struggle for both girls, but one that is characteristically rewarding...Rather than having a continuing story, each episode rather contains a theme, and is very like a parable, with some problem emerging that has to be overcome by our heroines and by the end they are stronger and wiser for the experience. Its makes for pleasant viewing, with some of the lessons being quite interesting and can strike very close to home at times, but it does get a little repetitive, as one sometimes resorts to playing guess the message of the week, as it where. Also one needs a high whimsy tolerance to be able stomach some of these episodes, fans of the gritty, brutal ghost story will find no macabre comfort here, best search elsewhere.This episodic nature may a defining feature of the slice of life genre, but perhaps Mokke took it a little to far, with the only plot point that has even the slightest effect on the story as a whole is when Mizuki joins a club, (in fact the biggest plot point of all happens in the last few minutes of the final episode!). Its true that the best slice of life series\' usually are episodic, for example Natsume Yujincho, (which is probably the closest thing to this series) but Natsume excels where this series stumbles as it managed to include small story arcs and introduce characters that later go on to be an intricate part of the story. Mokke\'s biggest problem is that there is none of this, characters or plot points introduced in one episode cease to exist in later episodes, even if their problems or stories have not fully been fully resolved. Some may argue that this is how real life works, with not every problem wrapped up into a neat little bow by the end of day, and while this is true i would endeavour to remind them that this is a slice of life series, not a full course meal of life series. It simply make for generally better viewing when things that are set up come to interesting conclusion, my opinion but one i feel is very close to the truth.With all that said, the real pillars of the series are the characters, with each one of the three mains distinct and interesting. Mizuki the younger sister is energetic and playful, a product of her youth, this can give the impression that she if full of confidence and strong, but closer inspection reveals that quite the opposite is true. Constantly be possessed by spirits has led her to believe that she is weak and tends to laugh away her problems rather that face them, however as the series progresses she does try to rectify this problem, (not always with the intended consequences) and with the help of her sister, learn to find the balance between fighting and coexisting with these spirits. She is very much the heart of the series, providing much of the light hearted comedy and charm that characterises the series.Shizuru the elder sister, is really quite beautiful, not in some stupid moe sense, but rather she has a very subtle charm to her, the simple art hides the depth-fulness of her character, intelligent, caring, kind, but lonely from never being able to talk to her friends about her abilities.  I would insert a vain attempt to compare her to some flower always out of reach, but truthfully, I would rather take a stroll in front of a firing squad…  Anyway, while not an amazing character, she does stand out as interesting in a medium, that all to often likes to portray women as being about as intelligent and interesting, as a pile of bricks.However the star of the show for me at least was the grandfather, who acts as both their guardian and laissez-faire teacher. Rather than rushing in to save the girls anytime they get involved in the other world he prefers to stay back and let the girls fight their own battles. This may make him sound like a cold man but nothing could be further from the truth, as with many things in this series his actions are both subtle and meaningful. He knows all to well that he will not be around forever, and most importantly, he has learnt that one cannot live ones life in perpetual war with nature, but must rather find a way to coexist with what one can, avoid what one cannot and fight only those that seek to destroy us. Saying very little and always keeping his thoughts and emotions to himself, he seems to know exactly how things will play out, but at the end of the day its clear that he cares very deeply for his family, and would never let any harm come to them, nor would he unnecessarily hurt the ghosts and spirits that he has come to understand and respect.However the side characters are a little different, this ties in with what I was saying earlier about the little to episodic nature of the series, character such as Shizuru and Mizuki\'s friends, while somewhat prominent, as not given a great amount of that far to overused term ""character development"". This term has become the go to weapon of wanna-be critics, and i myself have been guilty of this in the past, but i digress. The point is that some of these side characters have interesting features and stories surrounding them, and while some are given quite a good bit of character and even arcs, there are others who are simply forgotten or just outright ignored. Such as the grandmother, who despite being in an incredibly interesting position, married to a man who exercises spirits for a living, and having two granddaughters who can interact with them, very little is ever revealed about her, or if she also has these abilities. All in all these are small complaints but still substantial enough to distract from the story, which is a real pity.Music wise everything was quite fitting, the opening i found to be quite enjoyable, if a tad dramatic for such a slow paced series. Everything else, like much of Mokke is subdued and pleasant, matching the pacing and the quiet country setting. I am unfortunately not a man of music and so can not speak knowledgeably on the subject, but i do know slice of lifes\'s and their music quite well, and can say that this is defiantly a very nice addition, while no-where near as memorable as something like Aria, it was instead, (like the whole series) ""Quite pleasant"".Overall, Mokke was a fun series that always made for a relaxing and enjoyable watch, containing both interesting and charming main characters. Alas however it lacks enough of a plot to get you really invested, since you are aware that everything will be back to normal by the next episode, and the side characters are very much simply glossed over. Which is a real shame because i thoroughly  enjoyed watching this series and would like to have seen more from it, but oh well, C\'est la vie.  Also a high level of whimsical tolerance is a must if one intends to watch it, however if one is a fan of such classic\'s as Natsume Yujincho or Aria and wishes to watch something with a similar ""vibe"" then Mokke may be the perfect dish, just don\'t expect to be full when its over and you move on to coffee and cigars… are those that successfully mix slice of life with the supernatural, and so be easily relatable but still mysterious, interesting but not ridiculous, and most important of all, require the audience to think a little to discover the meaning behind each episode…Mokke for me, took many of these principles to heart, but perhaps sliced off a little to much life and didn\'t leave enough room in its tummy for a developed plot or story, but more on that particular cake later…The series tells the story of two young girls who both have the ability to interact with ghosts, Shizuru, a high school student is even able to see them, while her younger sister, Mizuki can\'t, but is easily possessed by them.

I must admit that I gravitate towards such shows and I always watch them with pleasure. Mokke in this case is no exception and confidently replenishes the list above.Initially Mokke is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by manga author Takatoshi Kumakura. Later, in October 2007, created...by Madhouse and Tezuka Productions, begins broadcasting the anime adaptation.Mokke is a story about two sisters: the eldest Shizuru who can see the spirits and younger Mizuki, who in turn does not see them, but is very receptive to them. Mizuki is a big dreamer, always disappears somewhere and tells amazing stories that look more like fairy tales. Shizuru is serious, since childhood she is fond of herbalism and wants to assemble his collection of plants.Mokke has an episodic narrative format and the plot is based on the interaction of the two sisters, and more specifically in the influence of the spirits on Mizuki and some other characters. Usually, having an episodic format, the interrelation of the characters is often lost, but this is not the case, the sisters of Hibara are similar in thought, however the characters they meet refer to the supernatural in different ways, therefore so the characters turned out to be very real and alive, that does not turn off any of them during the series.Separate attention deserves the grandfather and his influence on the sisters. Shizuru and Mizuki are naive and young, so grandfather is always serious and strict with them. He is a kind of master in the case of supernatural things and their mentor, but the reason for his rigor becomes clear by the end of the series.The music for the series is chosen very well. All the compositions are pleasant and appropriate, the opening is worth a special praise. Everything else corresponds to the rhythm of a quiet and peaceful environment in the series. Music evokes pleasant sensations and perfectly complements certain episodes.The series is very interesting, in terms of production and mood, which is created when you watch it. Personally for me, Mokke served like a not bad source of inspiration, thanks to the beautiful views of the sunset from the hills, flowering trees and folklore in general. However, despite all the beauty of the environment, the characters faces are simplified to a simple style, which is noticeable in emotional scenes.In general, the series is very pleasant and unusual, the mood in it is quiet and calm, nothing impels depression, there is everything here so that you can say with a smile, ""But life, in fact, is a wonderful thing."" If you are a fan of such shows as Aria, you will enjoy Mokke immensely. by Madhouse and Tezuka Productions, begins broadcasting the anime adaptation.Mokke is a story about two sisters: the eldest Shizuru who can see the spirits and younger Mizuki, who in turn does not see them, but is very receptive to them.

Usually each episode focueses in one of the sisters (Chizuru or Mizuki) and how the deal with a supernatural creature they encounter (or supernatural event). The story was more funny and childish when Mizuki was the protagonist of the episode and more dramatic and serious when the protagonist was Chizuru. Personally, I found Chizuru's episodes more deep because they transmited her feelings of anxiousness, confusing and most importantly loneliness because of being able to see ghosts. Moreover the story is education as it shows elements about Japanese Literature...(the supernatural events). Finally, the bond between the two sisters is shown continously during the show, how they help each other and how they compliment each other. It might be a supernatural anime but the feelings and thoughts in it are realistic and touching.Art:The character's design was simple, yet original in my point of view. The background and attire clearly showed how Japanese people in villages live like.Sound:The sound reminded me a bit of traditional Japanese music, it was deep especially at the end of the episodes when they playes the instrumental version of the opening. Though it is kind of susbjective whether one finds it likeable or not.Character:The two sisters are clearly the opposite of each other, but as I said before they compliment each other exactly due to that reason. Chizuru is kind of pesimistic, quiet and slighly introverted while Mizuki is energetic, extroverted and impulsive. The rest of the characters don't play an important role in the story but in some of the episodes which are focused on them we can see what kind of people they are. It's actually not the typical anime with some school girls making jokes and having fun.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this anime because I found it interesting, I wanted to see what creature would appear in the next episode, if it would be good or evil and how the sisters would deal with it. I believe this series are worth watching if someone is interested in Japanese literature or supernatural events. (the supernatural events).

You know, I've watched a lot slice of life supernatural genre but this one hooked me. So the story is about Hibara sisters, Shizuru and Mizuki. Their usual daily lives that is actually unusual. Shizuru, the elder, can clearly see spirits/ghosts while Mizuki, her younger sis, is prone to spirits and easily possessed by them and can sense spirit's presence as well although she cannot see as clear as her big sis. Due to this supernatural phenomenon, they live in their grandparents' house because their grandpa and grandma can also sense and see spirits...so they understand the situation of their grandchildren. This is also why their parents trust them. Don't forget their little cat, Mike, also recurring character and has its own episode. From this anime, you will know several japanese yokai/ghost. Each episode title refers to the yokai name so the show is episodic, one episode is not related to another episode.Visual: decent. Probably because it's from 2007.Music: surprisingly great for slice of life genre. OP slaps, ED soothing.Most importantly, I really like the atmosphere, because the setting is in the small village where the background is still natural, like ricefield, pond, river, forest, etc.I also think this anime is family friendly, however the very first episode kinda DARK but the rest is just fine and barely I found fanservice. so they understand the situation of their grandchildren.

These girls can interact with spiritual creatures (ayakashis), unlike other people. The plot unfolds in a slice-of-life format, where the two girls engage in daily activities like normal students, while these creatures also appear. Each episode has its own plot separated from the others, with different contexts. Most of the time, it presents itself as a calm atmosphere with a focus on a serious plot, similar to Serial Experiments Lain and others, but obviously without all the tension or nonsensical plots.My expectations for this...show were either a mediocre anime, or a darker anime style, or perhaps something aligned with the themes of Studio Ghibli. However, I was surprised. The messages in each episode made me think about various aspects of life. I noticed that the demographic was intended for all audiences, but it's really filled with concepts that teens or adults can understand and appreciate.Development and work out of plot:In the development, there are episodes without links. However, there is a chronological progression, and also a growth in Mizuki and Shizuru. For example, I can't give any spoilers here, but Mizuki had an egocentric personality, and her peers were forced to follow her in some arbitrary decisions. After certain situations, she changed and realized what happened. This also occurred with the presence of Yokais, who participated similarly to other humans. The ayakashis can be hostile or friendlier, depending on their personality. People's problems are always subject to their expectations, personality, and other situations. However, the plot is free for all different demographics; ideas and reflections presented here are only understandable to seinen, the target audience for this show. Every episode follows the same pattern: Mizuki or Shizure are engaged in their activities and somebody finds themselves in a situation. Then, other situations happen, leading to a climax with a good or satisfactory ending and many reflections. I particularly liked these reflections.Conclusion:In conclusion, I really recommend this show. Mokke is a true hidden gem of anime. Many anime actually don’t have the same vibe; it was forgotten long ago in the industry.

Meiji Tokyo Renka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34209/Meiji_Tokyo_Renka,"[""I LOVED watching this anime as it was ongoing, until I reached the end. The characters are good and the plot isn't bad at all, but literally at the last episode destroyed how I felt about this anime.**Spoiler**Everything was going well in the anime, because the anime is about Mei deciding to stay in a place that she actual enjoys and where people actually like her, or where she is mistreated and she hated. Up until the last episode, episode 12, she decided to leave the Meiji era where she was accepted and had fallen in love! This made me angry that she decided this....There is a small cliffhanger, but as she goes back to her original time, all that is left is whether the Meiji era people she met (including her lover),  will reincarnate or if she is somehow going to be thrown back into the Meiji era again. The only thing is that the magician who did this to her disappears at the end as he says goodbye...So this is why I give this anime an overall score of a 6, but I would of given it a higher score if it weren't for how it ended, because it really hurt me to see how it ended. Also, since this is based off of a game/novel, whose to say that there will even be a 2nd season? So I am really bummed out.. it was REALLY good until the last episode...

Needless to say, his recent works have been hits and misses, and Meiji Tokyo Renka is no different as a miss.After a brief stint in going through a life that is in interaction with spirits every now and then, living in isolation, Ayazuki Mei, a simple and not-so-complicated girl, gets tranced by a passing magician, and subsequently, gets sent...back in time to Meiji-era Tokyo at the bask of the Full Moon.

I recommend that game to those who can only play that particular Otome because they have an Iphone."", ""Years ago, when I was first dipping my toes into the anime fandom back in, say, 2005, I watched an old anime called Harukanaru Toki no Naka de, which centered around a girl and her friends being sent back in time to Japan's Heian Era. I thought it was the bee's knees, and before Shounen Onmyouji came out, I considered it my favorite anime of all time. I later learned it was based on a video game, and a specific type of video game called an otome game. Otome games are typically visual novels aimed at women, where the main character, usually a girl, is...meant to develop a romantic relationship with one of many male characters. These kinds of games don't usually come to the US, especially their anime adaptations, partly because they tend to be poor quality, and because many of the games and their anime adaptations depict the main girl character as little more than a self-insert, or submissive, doll-like, spineless, weak, and overly dependent (Amnesia and Diabolik Lovers, anyone?), among other reasons mentioned in this article here: animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-11-28/japanese-translator-explains-why-otome-games-fail-in-u.s/.124565.Because Americans like myself tend to favor female characters who have more dynamic personalities and are more independent and outspoken, otome games don't really have much staying power in the US. Thankfully, not every otoge nor anime adaptation has this problem, as the subject of today's review, Meiji Tokyo Renka, is one of the exceptions in regards to the quality of its anime adaptation, though even it has its own sets of problems.Based on the 2011 mobile game by the company Mages, which later became a PSP and PS Vita game, the anime centers on Mei Ayazuki, a young girl who's been able to see spirits since she was a kid. This has left her ostracized because normal girls can't see ghosts or spirits. One night, when there's a crimson full moon, she meets a magician, Charlie, who invites her to participate in a magic trick...only to find herself sent back in time to Japan's Meiji Era. She is taken in by the dashing writer and army surgeon Ougai Mori and meets a variety of other historical figures, from Ougai's art protege Shunso Hishida, to Shinsengumi general turned military police sargeant Goro Fujita, to young germaphobic dog-hating playwright Kyoka Izumi. She turns out to be a tamayori, or someone who can see spirits, and they ask her to help them with a variety of spirit related problems, from chasing black cats to helping distressed spirits pass on. While Mei does want to go back to her time, she does find herself drawn to her new acquaintances and finds herself more comfortable in this time period. Will she choose to say, or leave the past behind and return home?First thing's first: Not gonna lie, the animation is kinda cheap. I guess you could say I'm biased because I've seen shows that had better animation than Meiji, but it's easy to tell that the show spent most of its budget on the guys and making them look pretty than actual motion and detail. I mean, the animation isn't really bad, but there are a lot of animation shortcuts taken in certain places, and other times, the camera focuses too much on facial close-ups and still shots, like the animators couldn't actually animate characters moving when they really need to. Some faces go off model and get too long or rounded, and there are times when the characters' clothes swaying in the wind look stiff and just flap up and down at times. Episode 11 is a pretty big offender in this department. But for all I know, maybe the animation errors got fixed for the Blu-Ray version. For what it's worth, the music is much better. It's still kinda saccharine, with classical pieces meant to convey the romance and thrill of being in a new time period surrounded by a plethora of pretty boys, but it does its job decently enough. I do love the opening and ending songs being jazz-inspired and making great use of trumpets and horns. You don't really hear those used in a lot of anime unless it's Sound Euphonium, and unlike another reverse harem anime I saw recently, Bonjour: Sweet Love Patisserie, the singers can actually sing and actually don't sound like they're phoning it in every time they open their mouth. Also, in episode 6, there's an adorable little rap that goes on about the benefits of electricity, and even though it's kinda cheesy and ridiculous, I watch that segment every day because it always puts a smile on my face due to how cute it is, both in Japanese and English.The characters are rather mixed, but I'll start by talking about the best part of the show: Mei. It's an all too common problem for female protags, especially in otome games, to have all the personality of a wet paper towel, whose sole purpose is to swoon over guys, be ordered/pushed around by everyone, and be someone the players/audience can insert themselves into. I can assure you right now that Mei is not one of those protagonists, even though the first episode does have her start out that way at first. After a couple episodes, she's actually allowed to have a God damn personality! She's cheerful, proactive, and helpful, but not to the ridiculous saccharine degree that most kids shows try to shove down your throat non-stop (Megumi from Happiness Charge Precure is a big offender in this). She's kind and caring, but her impulsiveness does get her into trouble sometimes, and she never gives up even when things get tough. She does occasionally swoon over the guys, but she's a teenage girl, and considering how most otoge protags are portrayed, I'm willing to let it slide here since she's actually allowed to have a character and personality! Also, I highly recommend you watch the English dub for the show, because Madeleine Morris as Mei is absolutely adorable and gives her even more charm! While she isn't the most three-dimensional character ever, the fact that she's even allowed to have a personality and character development at all, as small as it is, makes her leagues better than other otome game protags who have no character or personality at all.Unfortunately, I don't find myself singing the same praises for the pretty boy gallery. They all pretty much fulfill typical bishounen archetypes: The confident one, the snarker, the peppy nice guy, the no-nonsense badass who'll beat you up if you look at him wrong, so on and so forth. All of them suddenly start fawning over Mei over the littlest things. Helping you around the house? Insta-love! Giving you some words of encouragement? Insta-love! Yeah, I think you can see how stupid this is. While they all do get some time in the limelight (Except for one light blue haired guy who, despite being in the opening, appears twice and doesn't do anything at all! Why even shove him in there if you're not even gonna do anything with him?!), any development they get is either cliche or really rushed. For the latter case, Goro, the teal haired police officer with the sword, is especially hit hard with this, because he's firmly established as a no-nonsense, badass warrior who hates ghosts and wants to kill them all and is always annoyed with other peoples' antics. His episode keeps this characterization, but near the end, out of freaking nowhere, he suddenly goes out of character and decides he likes Mei, with no build-up and with absolutely nothing establishing how he even decided to change his view of her in the first place, so his sudden change in personality comes way out of the left field. I suppose one reason for this is because the anime only has 12 episodes, so it needed to work under those constraints, but I've seen lots of anime have more organic characterization that knew how to properly build up to it in that same amount of episodes and less! Having a character just randomly go from one personality to another without any good reason just seems lazy. Trust me, having seen The Last Unicorn, which was a pretty big offender in that aspect, that's saying a lot. Also, there are some subplots regarding some characters that could have benefited from being better utilized for character development, but instead just get shoved to the side once Mei gives them an inspirational speech and it's never touched on again, which is what happens with Shunso in episode 11. So yeah, when it comes to anyone who's not Mei, characterization is not one of the show's strong suits.So I wouldn't consider this one of the best anime ever made. It's characterization issues, lackadaisical handling of certain subplots, refusal to address certain things that could pose great opportunities for character development, and adherence to typical reverse harem tropes prevent it from breaking any new ground or reaching lofty heights. But as far as anime adaptations for otome games go, I think Meiji Tokyo Renka is the best you're gonna get, especially if you want to follow a lead girl character who actually has a personality and isn't a submissive little doormat the audience can insert themselves into. It's cliche, but mostly harmless, and makes for pretty good popcorn entertainment. Hey, sometimes even female otaku want to have their cake and eat it too, and I'll gladly watch this over the millions of dumb ecchi and slavery-endorsing isekai shows any day of the week.Oh, and in case anyone's wondering: Kyoka is my best boy.

They're not even subbed, for God's sake! Let Kyoka fans have their Kyoka movies! meant to develop a romantic relationship with one of many male characters. These kinds of games don't usually come to the US, especially their anime adaptations, partly because they tend to be poor quality, and because many of the games and their anime adaptations depict the main girl character as little more than a self-insert, or submissive, doll-like, spineless, weak, and overly dependent (Amnesia and Diabolik Lovers, anyone?), among other reasons mentioned in this article here: animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-11-28/japanese-translator-explains-why-otome-games-fail-in-u.s/.124565.Because Americans like myself tend to favor female characters who have more dynamic personalities and are more independent and outspoken, otome games don't really have much staying power in the US. Thankfully, not every otoge nor anime adaptation has this problem, as the subject of today's review, Meiji Tokyo Renka, is one of the exceptions in regards to the quality of its anime adaptation, though even it has its own sets of problems.Based on the 2011 mobile game by the company Mages, which later became a PSP and PS Vita game, the anime centers on Mei Ayazuki, a young girl who's been able to see spirits since she was a kid. This has left her ostracized because normal girls can't see ghosts or spirits. One night, when there's a crimson full moon, she meets a magician, Charlie, who invites her to participate in a magic trick...only to find herself sent back in time to Japan's Meiji Era. She is taken in by the dashing writer and army surgeon Ougai Mori and meets a variety of other historical figures, from Ougai's art protege Shunso Hishida, to Shinsengumi general turned military police sargeant Goro Fujita, to young germaphobic dog-hating playwright Kyoka Izumi. She turns out to be a tamayori, or someone who can see spirits, and they ask her to help them with a variety of spirit related problems, from chasing black cats to helping distressed spirits pass on. While Mei does want to go back to her time, she does find herself drawn to her new acquaintances and finds herself more comfortable in this time period. Will she choose to say, or leave the past behind and return home?First thing's first: Not gonna lie, the animation is kinda cheap. I guess you could say I'm biased because I've seen shows that had better animation than Meiji, but it's easy to tell that the show spent most of its budget on the guys and making them look pretty than actual motion and detail. I mean, the animation isn't really bad, but there are a lot of animation shortcuts taken in certain places, and other times, the camera focuses too much on facial close-ups and still shots, like the animators couldn't actually animate characters moving when they really need to. Some faces go off model and get too long or rounded, and there are times when the characters' clothes swaying in the wind look stiff and just flap up and down at times. Episode 11 is a pretty big offender in this department. But for all I know, maybe the animation errors got fixed for the Blu-Ray version. For what it's worth, the music is much better. It's still kinda saccharine, with classical pieces meant to convey the romance and thrill of being in a new time period surrounded by a plethora of pretty boys, but it does its job decently enough. I do love the opening and ending songs being jazz-inspired and making great use of trumpets and horns. You don't really hear those used in a lot of anime unless it's Sound Euphonium, and unlike another reverse harem anime I saw recently, Bonjour: Sweet Love Patisserie, the singers can actually sing and actually don't sound like they're phoning it in every time they open their mouth. Also, in episode 6, there's an adorable little rap that goes on about the benefits of electricity, and even though it's kinda cheesy and ridiculous, I watch that segment every day because it always puts a smile on my face due to how cute it is, both in Japanese and English.The characters are rather mixed, but I'll start by talking about the best part of the show: Mei. It's an all too common problem for female protags, especially in otome games, to have all the personality of a wet paper towel, whose sole purpose is to swoon over guys, be ordered/pushed around by everyone, and be someone the players/audience can insert themselves into. I can assure you right now that Mei is not one of those protagonists, even though the first episode does have her start out that way at first. After a couple episodes, she's actually allowed to have a God damn personality! She's cheerful, proactive, and helpful, but not to the ridiculous saccharine degree that most kids shows try to shove down your throat non-stop (Megumi from Happiness Charge Precure is a big offender in this). She's kind and caring, but her impulsiveness does get her into trouble sometimes, and she never gives up even when things get tough. She does occasionally swoon over the guys, but she's a teenage girl, and considering how most otoge protags are portrayed, I'm willing to let it slide here since she's actually allowed to have a character and personality! Also, I highly recommend you watch the English dub for the show, because Madeleine Morris as Mei is absolutely adorable and gives her even more charm!

After originally completing the series in April, I’ve enjoyed it so much that I haven’t been able to stop rewatching it.It’s a cute, short anime that I believe many people can enjoy as it includes romance, time travel and ghost-hunting (don’t forget the delicious food, too!). The story was well presented, considering that this anime was based off a game. Some scenes, interactions and quirks the characters have may only make sense if you are familiar with the series beforehand, and they can be confusing at times.The characters have fun interactions with each other and all have likeable...traits which you can fail in love with. The Japanese dub and the English dub are both enjoyable and leave you with a smile after each episode. The art style does change a bit in each episode, but every scene looks well-made and the backgrounds are filled with lots of detail.This is one of the few anime’s that have made me cry at the ending. This is an enjoyable anime and I hope there will be a second season one day! It is quite popular in Japan, having 2 past movies, two musicals and a live-action drama series and movie. traits which you can fail in love with.

I cant tell if im crying more out of frustration or sadness.. Let me explain. This anime goes where the first 9 episodes saying ""oh no, ill have to return to my real world soon"" then figures out that she doesnt actually need to leave on episodes 9-10. Then she is like, hell yeah get to live my life happy here because my old wrong was bad. HER LIFE SUCKED. Then the last episode decides that they are going to tear your heart out and ruin both yours and her happy ever after....Dont watch if you want a lovey dovey happy ending because you will be hurt....

However, the reason why my overall score was low even though I genuinely liked this anime was her choice in the end to go back to her own time after regaining her memories. She had love and finally found acceptance in who she was as a person after shutting herself out to ghost and humans alike. If the ending was different my score would've been a solid 8.

He loved her when at first no one would in her time."", ""Ok so you've been warned from the unfortunate ones who watched this show that this is NOT an anime you will leave satisfied with. I was happy enough with the show but after wasting 5 hours on this series, I finally reached the end, wondering what was life. What had I just spent all that time watching? It felt like nothing made sense, all the episodes building up told us one thing but it seemed the creators didn't care about making sense at the end. They just wanted to add a cliche twist at the last minutes and play with your emotions no matter if...it fit or not. I sat dumbfounded disappointed and annoyed more than ever, confused as all hell as to what just happened. The heroine character suddenly became selfish and fickle and her hopes and dreams and past actions and promises had disappeared. If the ending wasn't so out of left field and senseless, I would probably give this show a decent enough rating. But it just can't be overlooked. I felt like crap for spending so much time watching the show just for it to go so downhill so quick within the last minutes and completely obliterate the whole story that took place before it. I've gotta give it to them for somehow ruining a decent story within just mere minutes of the end. It all made sense for the most part until those last ten minutes so if I were you, I would skip this or just pause before that and leave while it still makes sense before the ending completely destroys your opinion on it all and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The creators should have listened to the feedback from others and changed their ending before releasing the series. I don't think the show would get nearly as much criticism if they had. Other than that the art reminded me a lot of Kamisama Kiss, another TMS production, and a much more fulfilling story than this one was. The sound was good, I watched the dub and enjoyed it, I thought the electricity song was cute and the jazzy music to be quite nice. The characters are pretty basic and the lead like I said completely contradicts who she's supposed to be at the end. Anyway, if you want to get extremely disappointed confused and frustrated this is the show for you, otherwise beware. it fit or not.

Just from looking at the description I thought it would be the perfect show for me; historical Japan fantasy, time travel isekai, and of course, romance. And when I booted up the first episode to be met with the opening (which I really enjoyed, it has a wonderful sound and groove to it) I thought I was going to be...witnessing one of my new favorite guilty pleasures.But now, after finishing the show, I guess I can say... eh?Look, if you like reverse-harem, slightly trashy, historical romance- ignore the rest of my review. Go and watch it- and just enjoy yourself. It\'s nothing grand, spectacular, or really anything past what it looks like at surface level.It took me nearly two months to finish this show, which is a little unusual considering that it\'s only twelve episodes long. That\'s simply because I lost interest rather quickly. There\'s nothing wrong with the show per se, there was just none of that ""it"" factor that compelled me to binge the series. So I ended up taking my time.The story is simple. A teenage girl from our time gets transported to Meiji-era Tokyo, where she proceeds to fall in love and collect an alarming amount of dashing young men around her. And yet, I do think that Meiji Tokyo Renka does a decent job at setting itself apart from the typical reverse harem otome formula. For one, Mei actually feels like her own character, which I found to be unique. Mei has ~character development~, something you barely see in these kinds of shows- the Mei of the first episode is quite different to the Mei of the last episode.But on the topic of characters, I don\'t feel that the show does a good job at utilizing the colorful cast of characters that it has. Many men are introduced around Mei, and then they just... fade out? Perhaps it is my goldfish memory and not the fault of the show, but if you asked me to provide any sort of descriptor for a character that isn\'t Ougai, Shunso, or Kyoka, I\'d be hard-pressed to tell you any.Also, the show is pegged as a romance when there weren\'t many typical ""romantic"" moments. Or at least, not many of the typical encounters you see in the average shojo series. It\'s still romance, yes, but the story seems to focus more on different plot events about ghosts and spirits (oh, I forgot to mention- it\'s a plot point that Mei can see ghosts). Just a few things to keep in mind, I suppose.I really wasn\'t going to rate the show that highly, until the last two episodes. If a show can elicit any sort of emotion out of me, then I\'ll be fair and give it a suitable ranking- and the final episode genuinely surprised me. I wasn\'t exactly sobbing or anything, sure, but a few tears and a prolonged feeling of melancholy- I\'ll give it to you, Meiji Tokyo Renka, the directing in those episodes was pretty damn good.Because of those final episodes, I\'ve become a little interested in watching the other adaptation of the otome game, the two movies- they\'re apparently supposed to cover Kyoka\'s route, and since I preferred him over Ougai anyway I think I\'ll enjoy it.So no, Meiji Tokyo Renka isn\'t life-changing or a masterpiece must-watch-- but it\'s really not bad, and if you like seeing shows that turn historical Japanese men into ikemen... sure, go for it. I\'m not going to stop you. witnessing one of my new favorite guilty pleasures.But now, after finishing the show, I guess I can say... eh?Look, if you like reverse-harem, slightly trashy, historical romance- ignore the rest of my review.

Unfortunately, they barely did anything interesting with this set up even toward the end. After the first 2 episodes, the entire premise was poorly explained and then was toss aside in favor of normal daily slice-of-life-with-the-occasional-funny-moments anime. Even when they tried something with the whole Tamayori, the thing just ended the minute it got slightly interesting. Seriously why even bother showing a girl who can see ghosts, how it negatively affected her life, and how there are ghosts...within this world where they need an entire division to deal with it only to have like 4 disappointing episodes about it. It\'s kinda a theme with most episodes, something mildly interesting happened only for the payoff to be a disappointment and could have you go ""Why?"".This anime was also over-bloated with characters while under-developed most of the actual main casts and their relationship with the MC. Worse still, the anime kept introducing new side-characters with very little or no significance to the story or were only there for 1 gag/flirt with MC then never appeared again even within that episode. Though one of the few good things I do acknowledge is that the MC wasn\'t a damsel in distress (aside from that one episode) like most reverse harem anime and that she actually went out of her way to accomplish something.Overall, the best way I can summarize this whole anime is ""A girl got sent back in time and lived out her daily normal life in that era, oh and she can see ghost but that\'s not important since only few episodes gonna touch on that subject.""Truly disappointing. within this world where they need an entire division to deal with it only to have like 4 disappointing episodes about it.

I find Otome based games will never pick a route instead they try and make an anime where no one is left angry because the boy they liked is rejected.

While this movie was another decent Pokémon film, it falls short when compared to the others.To understand some of the images and references in this movie, I suggest you watch the two previous Pokémon movies first: ""The Rise of Darkrai"" and ""Giratina and the Sky Warrior"". You will better understand where those other legendary Pokémon are coming from.As a rule, Pokémon movies aim to touch the audience and make them sympathize with the cause presented in the film. While I could understand Arceus\' anguish, that was about it on an emotional level. This movie just didn\'t do...anything for me.They assumed too much, not bothering to work for it. Team Rocket was just tossed around for a few brief comical moments. Our heroes did nothing overly spectacular. The new characters remained empty and uninteresting. I\'m not sure if I liked Arceus\' voice, either (although that isn\'t relevant to the story, right?).I guess after making 11 movies prior to this one made them a bit lazy and they didn\'t bother making this as sharp and dazzling as some of the other movies are. A shame, because there was potential in this. It was very nice to see Dialga and Giratina again, though. anything for me.They assumed too much, not bothering to work for it.

Honestly from Diamond and pearl movies this is the best. We see palkia, Dialga and Gitatina again and that was a sorprise. I thought this movie will decribe a Giratina and Dialga battle, but the battle was between this three and Arceus.THe art was good. Not the best and not the worst. Its like always, so I put an 8 in art. The same goes to characters. The three protagonist are the same, and I think Sheena was a great chaacter.I really enjoy this move. From pokemon movies that...I saw isnt the best, I enjoy other pokemon movies more than this, so I put a 9In oveerall I put an 8 becouse of this: There are more pk movies and are better than this, but this movie is really enjoyable.

Centered around Dialga and Palkia, followed by Giratina and Shaymin, this film unveils Arceus, the Pokemon god. All the previously explored legendaries make an aprearence too. Except for Shaymin. Good riddance.Deciding to go the epic route, this film had some big shoes to fill because it's predecesor, The Rise of Darkrai, was the best film since Latios & Latias seven years ago. Opting to use the classic action epic mold with all the classic time travel tropes, they obviously emulated Darkrai's approach. Unforunately, Arceus's trilogy-closer fell short in the...end - but not spectacularly, mind you. Being a fine watch, it offered nice action, occasional bad CGI and a timetravel story with questionable logic.What stands out here is the ammount of mayhem and overt destruction the legendaries cause. For example, a mountain is split apart on-screen. In Darkrai's flick, the world was being peacefully eroded by pink ether. What a contrast! However, the threat in that movie was used as a plot mover while here it's just ecstatic violence for its own sake. And it works. There's a lot of it, but never enough to get boring.The timetravel plot itself is servicable. I've found some joy in recognising all the classic time travel tropes. While the whole thing almost never feels as serious as it should be and there's quite a few nitpicks and plotholes I can point to, what is there never gets too dumb to watch.There's not much else to say. The film is never stupid, just sometimes dull. The whole thing feels like a passable time waster that's hard to get upset about. end - but not spectacularly, mind you.

I particularly lean towards both the Pokemon movies with the biggest, most ""epic"" plots, and the more sci-fi esque ones, and this delivered on both fronts. Thus, I enjoyed the story a lot throughout, and it also helped that unlike some other movies, it got into it right from the beginning as opposed to padding it out.The fight scenes were great, especially the excellently done battle between the four Legendaries. There was also some cute/funny scenes with Pikachu, Piplup, and other Pokemon (especially Spiky-Eared Pichu, who was adorbz) which...provided good comic relief.And like most Pokemon movies, the animation and direction were excellent. Some of the painfully obvious CGI was a bit eye-rolling, but it was only a minor flaw, as the rest looked great and there was a lot of really nicely animated and cool scenes throughout the movie. And like usually, the climactic scenes were intense and exciting.Overall, not quite the very best in the series, but definitely in the top half. Any fan of the franchise should like this a lot. provided good comic relief.And like most Pokemon movies, the animation and direction were excellent.

It should feature sudden developments that could have a devastating effect to the characters along with the events or narrative. There should be drama, emotional moments full of dialogue, and although optional, should introduce a cast of characters that you can fantasize together for your fan fictions that nobody cares about. Lastly its’ crucial that there are characters that viewers can make a personal connection with to understand them better! Momokuri throws away the standards of the typical romance anime, and curb stomps it to the ground while...laughing maniacally. It replaces the very essences of the romance genre with moe moe cuteness.The best thing about romances is that they\'ll often feature a male or female protagonist. Through his or her journey, we are able to see their mental struggle, hard work and the effort they go through in order to confess their love. The story of MomoKuri ruins the very thing that makes a romance story romantic and deep.  The whole story is a cute mess. From the very beginning the two main characters are already a couple, it’s just that Momo and Yuki have difficulties expressing their love verbally. The two have a difficult time trying to approach each other and act more like lovers instead of two awkward stalker creeps. What’s worse is that a majority of times where there were tense, serious moments that could’ve been romantic, it was quickly ruined by comedy. For example, ""Momo is finally about to kiss Yuki and chickens out."" ""At that moment, when he’s too afraid to do anything, the story tries to take a comedic turn by doing random reaction faces while he’s freaking out."" It ruins the mood along with the scene.The comedic moments were not as funny as I thought they would be. In fact, most of the comedic scenarios came off as “forced.” Its’ like “ha ha ha, you laugh at this terrible turn of events right now” or “Yuki is a stalker with a loyal dogs personality” laugh right now. It was in poor taste in my opinion. Following this goo goo gaga story was like an unsatisfying road trip to a vacation destination with your friends or family. I was glad I was able to stomach the content. Otherwise I would’ve dropped it at the beginning.My biggest hope for the story was that Momo would have a rival in love. I thought that it would be interesting if another male character who loves Yuki would be introduced. That way there is some rivalry and more intense declarations of love to the female. Then I hoped that there would be a rival for Yuki, Rio. Again things just didn’t turn out in my favor. It turned me off from the story even more. The pacing is pretty straight-forward. Each episodes plot is full moe nonsense or failed attempts to try and get Yuki and Momo closer. By the time you know the episode is over and you\'re watching the ending credits. The plot and story doesn\'t seem to get any serious until it starts reaching the last few episodes.The story definitely is not something that I would consider watching this title again for. It\'s lacks the appeal that a standard or average romances title would have. I would say that maybe the writers were trying to be a little innovative with Momokuri however they just didn\'t do a good job stringing all together.The characters designs were great; most of the background settings looked pretty nice. I didn’t have many concerns with the animation.The quality of the show varied from time to time. I didn\'t like a majority of the animation they used outside of school. Nature background settings like trees, rain, grass looked like an animator just went into MS paint and added it into the final project. The skies and water lacked any sort of ""realism"" and the details of trees and grass were minimal. Now, this isn\'t a show that focuses on background settings as much as it does the actual characters. So its\' only natural that they avoid putting much detail into make certain ""environmental"" elements and crap look nice. It appeared as if a majority of the focus went into making the characters as cute and appealing as possible for the fans who love overly cute or ""moe"" designs. You\'ve got big detailed eyes in both males and females. Both male and female clothing are close to real life designer wear. They made sure to make those designs as cute as possible too. So if there\'s anything to be said about the art its\' that it is satisfying to look at, it\'s just don\'t set your expectations too high.Voice actors were pretty good delivering their lines. I was most impressed with Ai Kakuma\'s performance. She\'s definitely experienced when it comes to doing cute girls. I felt that her role as Yuki can definitely be something she can brag about her next try-outs. With Nobuhiko, I think this is my 3rd favorite role he\'s done acting like the ""tough, cool guy"" personality. The soundtrack was a little weak however it does fit the tone of the show. Satoshi Motoyama is an excellent sound director. So he has the experiences and knows who to get to give the show the ""life"" it needs.The characters as I mentioned earlier are made to be cute... ""moe."" I honestly want to say that I did not like Yuki and Momo however; I did like seeing the progression the two made to finally became a full fledged couple. Rio seemed like she could\'ve been a better candidate for Yuki however, it seemed like the director wanted to go in that direction, but later kept the two as senpai & kōhai. Respectful and kind to each other. it would\'ve been great to see an antagonistic rival compete with Momo for Yuki\'s love and affection but because of the shows ""moe"" ""fan-girly"" friendly approach. It seems that the writers decided to keep with the route that worked best for them. I\'ll have to admit it does pay off.Perhaps the best thing about Momokuri is that you often times I find myself being guilty of rooting Momo on. As much as I try and avoid romances, especially girly girl romances, I felt that I could indulge myself a little. Like, he has a QT 3.14 girl whose loyal, kind, forgiving, and a stalker. So why doesn\'t he man up and sweet talk her? He has so many opportunities to make their relationship closer but he keeps letting these opportunities pass.

I was not disappointed after watching just one or two episodes. The colors are really bright and cute and the animation is fluid and easy to follow. Overall I felt that this show was really easy on the eyes. One of the other things that I really appreciated about this art style is how crisp the characters look. The surroundings are the same way, and because of this, it didn’t look like the characters were...superimposed on top of a background that was clearly a different style than the rest. As for the characters themselves, I felt that Kurihara’s character really stood out to me as a rather obsessive character, but it was just obsessive enough without getting to creepy and that made it really funny and cute to watch. As for Momo, the other lead, he was just a bit to oblivious for my liking, but he still gave off a vibe of someone who wanted to be in love and wanted to make sure things always work out. The opening did a really good job of showcasing the different personality traits of each character and that is always a plus that we hardly ever see.Music/Sound: While this show had pretty generic music, I still really liked it. The opening song was one that I just could never skip because of how catchy it was. Normally when I come across a great opening song, it is a good indication of how much I will enjoy a show, and this was no exception. Not only the opening but the music that accompanies the scenes gives the show depth in places where it seems to lack, and this is highlighted really well in the latter half of the series. As for the sound there is a little bit of dip in the quality of this show, I am not too surprised, seeing as it was an Original Net Animation rather than a full-fledged production, but it wasn’t something that I can speak too negatively about. The music more than compensated for this, and that isn’t to say there wasn’t any sound, it was just very much overshadowed by the background music.Story: Kurihara Yuki is a high school 2nd year who is just trying to make it along in her life, but Momotsuki Shinya, a first year at the same school, is the focus of all of her time. She spends a lot of time admiring him from afar; taking pictures, collecting his trash, and generally obsessing over him, all without Momo’s knowledge. But after Kurihara, with some help from her best friend Mizuyama, musters up the courage to confess her feelings to Momo, he agrees to start going out with her. Even though they start to date, Kurihara can’t seem to stop her collecting behaviors. The plot progresses as these two explore dating and friendships within their groups. There are twists and turns that really make the show easy to follow and fun to watch.Personal Reflection: I really enjoyed seeing this show in the list of Summer Anime, I knew nothing about it but the art style was cute and the first episode was hilarious that I couldn’t stay away. I really loved how Kurihara wasn’t that creepy. An example of an over the line creepy character would be Kaho’s brother in Hatsukoi Monster (I go into more depth on that review), but there is just something about Kurihara that makes her less creepy and easier to pass off, even when the behavior isn’t much different. The problems that Momo faces when it comes to Kurihara are very real and not to out-of-character for someone who has never had a girlfriend before. There are times when Him and Kurihara have disagreements, or even outright fights, and rather than going back to normal in an instant (which would be extremely out of character for him, he grows and moves on from the problem after learning from it. Momokuri is a show of first-times, confusion, a hint of crazy, and a whole lot of funny; if that seems like something you are into, check it out!Overall Score: 8/10 superimposed on top of a background that was clearly a different style than the rest. As for the characters themselves, I felt that Kurihara’s character really stood out to me as a rather obsessive character, but it was just obsessive enough without getting to creepy and that made it really funny and cute to watch. As for Momo, the other lead, he was just a bit to oblivious for my liking, but he still gave off a vibe of someone who wanted to be in love and wanted to make sure things always work out. The opening did a really good job of showcasing the different personality traits of each character and that is always a plus that we hardly ever see.Music/Sound: While this show had pretty generic music, I still really liked it. The opening song was one that I just could never skip because of how catchy it was.

Shy kids having a clumsy relationship full of forced misunderstandings and awkwardness.  And that\'s it.  There is nothing else to this show, once sentence is literally all you need to describe everything.But while it\'s not depth incarnate, it does succeed in portraying some legitimate heart warming cuteness.  At first you may find the gags make you giggle or at least smile.  The chibi style drawings are pretty adorable and the voice work is excellent.  There\'s some goofy recorder music...here and there to add to the joyful ambiance, as in most similar shows.The problem is that it\'s just not enough.  The jokes are really sparse, and the rest of the show consists of, well, nothing.  Inner monologues, casual conversations about casual shit you don\'t care about, boring characters doing boring normal things.  All the ""filler"" produces no entertainment, and doesn\'t progress the story, since there is none, really.  Even the jokes are problematic, because as time passes, you will realize that you are just watching a slightly different flavor of the same gag.The characters are pretty much reduced to their gimmick, as is often the case in low quality animes.  But they\'re still decently lovable, so i can tolerate it here.  My issue with these characters, as that if you didn\'t know their school year, you\'d have a really hard time speculating on how old they are.  Sometimes they act like grade schoolers, sometimes like teens, their appearance is overly childlike.  There\'s no adult characters which sucks some more realism out of the setting.Don\'t bother with this, it\'s just not funny enough for its lack of substance. here and there to add to the joyful ambiance, as in most similar shows.The problem is that it\'s just not enough.

But Momokuri just rubbed me the wrong way..Story 5/10: Okay so the story isn\'t terrible and it\'s not amazing.. It\'s a short and sweet romance story and that\'s all there is to it. It\'s nothing spectacular but it will never be bad simply because of how the plot is.. I mostly skipped through this anime due to the fact I started hating it pretty early on and I found it close to unbearable to watch, although I pulled through I wouldn\'t say hate.....But I strongly dislike it. Plot was made for a romance anime and that\'s all it was.Art 8/10: Now the art is fairly decent, I don\'t believe I\'ve watched any anime\'s that\'s close to this kind of animation style but it was really enjoyable and it really made for that cutesy feeling type.Sound 7/10: Sound was also fairly decent and when it came to sad/angry moments you could feel the suspense and you knew something was wrong. Nothing really stood out apart from that but nothing really felt out of place either.Character 5/10: Okay.. here we go! So Momo... Momo was actually fairly decent and he seemed like a decent MC for a romance story. Nothing I could say that I really hated him for because he made sense in my eyes apart from being abit dense at sometimes he seemed perfect for the role and fitted in fairly well. His personality was good and it seemed like he has emotions in check. His jealously moments were the best for me even though he\'d end up not following through almost every time I still really liked him.So now Kuri.. I absolutely hate this character... For an obsessed girl who\'s madly in love with the guy she had zero emotions apart from him being cute when girls around him were flirting with him. I completely understand that she\'s love blind for him but atleast have some sense of direction about this entire thing. I\'m completely with Momo, her jealously annoyed the hell out of me. The only thing I liked about her character is that she played the stalker part pretty well. She\'s dense and way to hyper. She\'s border like a pervert and if someone stepped into their circle would be like ""Holy s*** this b**** crazy!"" All I can say is that she\'s love blind and doesn\'t care what happens as long as Momo notices her...Side characters were fairly decent and played a decent role in to some of it.Enjoyment 4/10: I don\'t recommend this to anyone who likes to get involved with the anime... By this I mean like looking at it in a serious and realistic point of view. Because that\'s what I did.. :P But I strongly dislike it.

Well imagine no further, because Momokuri offers just that!What got me into this series is that despite it being a shoujo anime, it didn't seem like one. To me, it looked like a normal romcom that both boys and girls would watch. Perhaps it's because it targets both the guy and the girl's feelings. We know what both of them are thinking of, thus there's no mystery or plot convenience.The characters were so friggin' cute! The reason I started watching it in the first place was because of how cute these two characters...in the cover looked! And as a guy who likes ecchi/harem, that's saying something! Even the way these two interact was adorable! Too adrable, in fact, that my heart couldn't take all the moe! It's a slow-paced romance, but that's what makes it so good!It was very fun to watch. Wether you be a guy or a girl, you'd enjoy this too! It's just so nice to see a girly guy and a stalker fall in love with each other. And that's the love story of Momokuri! in the cover looked!

Before watching the anime, I had read CH1-CH24 of the manga, translated.I probably won\'t watch this again.---- Positives ----A mostly positive angle on obsession love.Kurihara\'s love for Momotsuki isn\'t completely blind obsession. She directly voices her reasons for liking Momotsuki at least twice in the series, and it gave me a better feeling about their relationship. Some of her actions may still be alarming, but the series generally keeps an upbeat take on this type of love. Momotsuki returns Kurihara\'s feelings in a...more developed way that becomes clearer as the series progresses. He mentions that his reasons for liking Kurihara changed over time in a positive way.Kurihara\'s voice.Kurihara is voiced extremely well for her role. The other characters are also voiced well.There aren\'t any obvious miscommunications.Whenever a direct issue arises, Momotsuki has a conversation with Kurihara about it. There aren\'t many conflicts in this series, but it\'s nice that all of the obvious ones that do exist are dealt with directly. That also helps to give their relationship a healthier feeling.Pacing is actually amazingly good.I read some of the manga before I started watching the anime, so for the first several episodes, I could compare them to the chapters I had read. This series actually does a lot to make otherwise slow sections interesting to watch and feel decently-paced. For how easily the anime could have had pacing issues, pacing was handled very well in this adaptation.Good expressions and scene planning.Expressions are drawn very well. The scenes flow well and are shown from good angles. Even the filler sections [characters not on screen, sometimes a colored background] are done well [as a repeat of the ""pacing"" positive mentioned in this review].---- Negatives ----This ~is~ still about obsession love.At certain times, viewers are clearly reminded that Kurihara has some peculiar habits. Her friend, Mizuyama will usually be there to point out that Kurihara shouldn\'t be doing those things, but at times it can still feel a little odd.Opportunity for cancel: Yes. I never felt too uncomfortable because this aspect of Kurihara was usually shown in a humorous light, since many of her obsession scenes included another character who would react to what Kurihara was saying. Also, Kurihara and Momotsuki\'s relationship stays positive throughout the series. more developed way that becomes clearer as the series progresses.

It's cute.Most other romances try to keep you hooked with drama (sadly, often forged through stupid misunderstandings) and love rivalry. This one has nothing of that sort. If you'd need to describe Momokuri in a single word, it'd be 'cute'.So, don't expect some deep backstories (you actually don't really learn anything about their past or their families) or some fancy plot. It's plain and simple; Girl asks boy out, boy accepts, they do stuff together. So, turn off your brain and enjoy a couple being cute (and awkward) together and having fun with their friends.Their personalities (including the side characters) and the...obsessive stalker-like behavior of his girlfriend made it a pretty entertaining watch for me, even though there wasn't much going on. obsessive stalker-like behavior of his girlfriend made it a pretty entertaining watch for me, even though there wasn't much going on."", 'I enjoyed this series very much!! >///< ♥..though it saddens me that I\'ve already completed this series :\'(I loved how the storyline focused on the lovestory of Momo and Kurihara! :D It didn\'t have a lot of fillers which I liked because I didn\'t get bored at all the whole time i was watching XD Though it\'s sad that each of the episodes were super short :\'( which kept me wanting for more! :""))The love story of Momo and Kurihara was very sweet and naive which I also liked a lot!

I will be reviewing all the slice of a life anime's i've seen so far, so don't mind adding me as a friend if you are just like me a big fan of slice of a life anime's and want to discover more>Urgh! Not another love highschool anime story! That's what the most people would think when they read about Momokuri. But i alway's think; YES! Finally another one to watch.To start with the beginning. It's not your typical Someone meet's on...school and during the complete anime they grow closer to eachother. And finally fall in love together and there's the happy end. This start's right away with that they like eachother. And show's how their relation continues.  So basically it an after story right away.As for the plot in the story, there are some mystery's. And yeah. For so far i've seen (episode 15/16). It's actually a straight forward for me. I love brain breaker's, and mystery's that make's you curious about the meaning behind it. That's one thing i find dissapointing in this story. But even for the rest its a lovely dovely story. Nothing to weird and not to much focussed on fan service. Which is also important for me.  So i gave it a 7 for it.Art :I love this kind of style. No to realistic. But also not lazy art designer's. It's well drawned. Allot of details in the background. So that's also a good for me. worth a nice 7.Sound.For me it's simple. If the music keeps hanging in my head it's really good. If it make's me wanna learn it on the piano it's perfect. But this is not the case. It's decent. Fit's well in the situations. But sometimes they try to hard with squeeking sound effects that made me feel i'm watching a 80's Tom and Jerry cartoon. It is decent enough. So a well deserved 7.Character's.I love the characters. Well almost then. They are the typical character's that you ''bond'' quick with. The girl is panicking really fast. And same goes as the boy. That lead's to funny moment's. But sometimes it get's annoying. I know in anime it's a big deal that it's really special to call someone to their first name. And that annoys me sometimes.  Holding hand's is a big deal. And that give's me the feeling that it's focussed on kid's around 8 year's. But again some situation's make's me feel that the show aim's for more adult people. So that's a bit confusing. But i really liked the characters so far. They are cute, funny , and easy to follow. That's the most important thing in anime right? Here you go MomoKuri, an 8 for the characters.Enjoyment.Like i stated before. i can really enjoy this story. It's different then those typically slice of a life romances because it starts straight away when they start their relation. And that's something i really like to see how a relation grow's bigger.

So we have a very cute couple happening right in the first episode. The show doesn’t seem to waste time.Well, that is until second episode, right away. The show becomes stagnant and stereotypical average rom-com with virtually zero development. We have a couple that has major fear of holding hands, again.The only focus afterwards is about Kurihara being obsessed with her boyfriend, taking secretly pictures of him, stalking, having cringy fantasies and stealing his property to ‘worship’ it.Momotsuki is regarded by his friends...(and girlfriend) as ‘beautiful’ and ‘feminine’, which is not something one describes the looks of a guy. And the further in the series, the weirder the jokes around this established gags become. This is supposed to be funny. But at least I don’t find it to be so.Reaching the end of the series, nothing really happens, except for a small (and I think senseless) drama, so it can be concluded on a positive note.Even if you like rom-coms, I think you can find a better one than this.At least the artstyle is nice.Pros:+ cute main couple+ character design/artstyleCons:- no development- gets boring very quickly- side characters are uninterestingDouble-edged:+/- too innocent+/- main girl is a sick stalker/lives constantly in her fantasies5/10 (AVERAGE) (and girlfriend) as ‘beautiful’ and ‘feminine’, which is not something one describes the looks of a guy.

This show is drama free with no hard emotions, it only contains happiness and rainbow so there is no need to worry about our couple and...just watch it in a carefree way.The show is Slice of Life in nature - tho the Slice of Life element kind of fails, each episode we follow our couple as they go through their daily life and experience the taste of being in love. Both of them are innocent when it comes to love which results in a lot of blushing and awkward moments. Sometimes the narrator changes from Yuki to Shinya and vice versa, as the narrator changes we get to see what they are thinking and understand their perspectives.Shinya goes through some character development while Yuki pretty much doesn't change, there is no story or plot either. There is a bit of character conflict through the end but it is nothing major. Our characters personalities pop up here and there but most of the time it falls flat, Yuki especially gets almost no personality at all, while Shinya is more complete. The characters seem too narrow, too stuffed, if that makes sense. The flow of the story seems to carry the characters rather then characters acting on their own. It seems that certain things happen because they must happen rather then because the character acted that way. In a way they don't seem alive and because of this I can't really empathize with them, I understand their emotions and reasons for doing the things they did but these emotions don't seem real and feel more fake. If our characters weren't a couple then there would be nothing more left in them and that is why the characters seem like they are not complete. I did enjoy the character interactions anyway, when they get together their interactions are more alive and full of emotion. The problem with the characters can be overlooked if you are just here to enjoy a sweet and cute romance without bothering too much about anything else.The main selling point is the character interactions, mainly our couple. It is almost always filled with blushes and cute interactions, both do not know how to act around each other and sometimes feel awkward and clumsy. The whole thing feels innocent and pure. The comedy isn't strong and because of the problem with the characters the Slice of Life fails, since they don't behave like an individual.If you wish to watch a soothing, cute and innocent show about two people falling in love then give this one a try, it has its weaknesses but the strong points are big enough that you can overlook the weaknesses and still enjoy.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------Had a bit tough time choosing between scoring 6 or 7, I usually love absolutely cute stuff + romance on top of that. (ex: ""Acchi Kocchi"" is something I truly adored), but with this Anime ""something"" did not ""click"" with me and I couldn\'t figure out what was that. But I like praising with score more, thus decided giving 7.Anyhow. Story is simple enough, It\'s about cute couple being overly cute and awkward. Getting nervous on simple things and being worried whenever their weird or perverted. I...did enjoy it for the most part. I wouldn\'t say its any bad. Its cute, simple and enjoyable. If if should have any complaint, then it would that I felt it should have ended with a bit more progress regarding their love relationship. I mean, It ended well and innocent. But would have been better with a tad bit more. Story\'wise maybe ""progression"" of side-characters or so felt a bit weak too. Mostly it was cute reaction lasting a while, which probably is the part that took the whole ""screentime""Art was great, it was cute, bright and cheerful. Whilst music/ost part of the anime I would say was quite average. I absolutely felt no presence of OST if there even was any, and opening/ending theme didn\'t really impress me either.Characters were enjoyable, nothing too impressive, but enjoyable. We got main shy guy who is quite girly. And a cute girl who is obsessed of her boyfriend. Side-characters were also quite nice. We got girl with a nice voice that has ""straightman comedy"" persona. We got an odd pseudo-couple, that consist of forgetting boy that cares about her little childhood friend who acts like elementary schooler. Also we got prince type of a girl and some cute ""normals"". Variation is satisfying enough, their presence is good enough. And overall I enjoyed side-characters.So to sum it all up, it\'s a great little glittery overly cute romance anime. It got lacking part of some character progression, maybe.

Roujin Z,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2000/Roujin_Z,"[""Roujin Z is a futuristic, satirically funny, morality tale written by the reknowned Otomo Katsuhiro, more well known for the classic manga and anime Akira. The movie was directed by Kitakubo Hiryuki (Blood: The Last Vampire, Black Magic M-66), and received a great degree of critical acclaim, partly because it was written by Otomo Katsuhiro, but mainly because it was a movie that showed how anime was able to deal with themes that conventional filmmakers would find extremely difficult to cope with, especially given the time of it's release.The story is set in the 21st century, and opens with the alarming news that there are...too many old people in the world. Now, as everyone knows, healthcare is always a hot topic in political circles, and Roujin Z is no exception. The story in Roujin Z is satirical in the main, but it has disturbing echoes in the real world. The medical students in Roujin Z consider Geriatric care to be a career deadend, something that is also widely believed in the real world, and because of this, funding is provided for the development of the ultimate in geriatric care - the Z-001 &quot;Superbed&quot;.The Z-001 is designed to provide the patient with everything that they need, including home entertainment, baths, massages, attending to bathroom functions, performing diagnoses (and administering medication), etc, etc. The machine is powered by a mini atomic reactor, and is designed to function autonomously in the event of power shortages. The Z-001 is viewed as the future of geriatric care, and as a godsend to the young doctors and nurses and much of the populace, all of whom are unaware of the somewhat sinister nature behind the design of the Z-001.Another aspect of the story is the inclusion of the Japanese belief that spirits can exist in any object, something which becomes a major theme later on in the movie.The art and animation in the movie aren't really anything special. Generally the production is sturdy and well animated, but there is nothing really spectacular about it. The sound is equally well done, yet nothing special. My only gripe is that, with the english dub, the dialogue between the VAs tended to vary too much in style, intonation, and accent, from one person to another. Although the english dub is definitely watchable, I prefer the japanese dub on the whole.There aren't many real characters in this story. The main two charcters are Takazawa Kujiro, the dying old man who is chosen as the test patient for the Z-001 prototype, and his nurse Haruko, who is against the idea of machines taking care of humans, especially her patients. Add to these two a mixture of police, scientists, politicians, military types, and student nurses.Although the two main characters get much of the screen time, the real star of the show (in both the japanese and the english dub), is the Z-001 (if I explain more it would spoil the show).Roujin Z is a bit of an odd movie on the whole, but an enjoyable one nonetheless. The movie itself addresses a theme that is becoming more and more relevant in the world, especially as people are now living longer than ever before. The fact that politicians and scientists come up with a method of geriatric care that has all the warmth and empathy of a thrown knife is a central part of the film, as is the callous disregard given to those people who allowed us to get where we are today.This movie would appeal to many fans of many different genres, most especially fans of sci fi or black comedies. The film is darkly satirical from beginning to end, and is surprising in how openly it attacks the idea that simply caring for the body is caring for the patient.Roujin Z - odd, satirical, enjoyable, and strangely enough, more relevant now than when it was first released. too many old people in the world.

This is the aspect that enough for me to give Roujin Z overall 10 ratings because that's the important thing when involving art.Another reason for my 10 ratings is that, although the concern of this anime is the lack of story stretching (we want more story development beyond this. we want more!!), it is quite reasonable to be humble for this aspect and forgive it unless there is incremental development from other authors. Moreover the premise of the arguably simple story is strong enough to tell the whole picture, making it unnecessary to be explained more further. That's why this anime stand on its own in less crowded space.Some might argue this anime was silly or dumb. And some might argue the story is too short and shallow.

But I bet you never in your life could have imagined a computer nursing bed, turning into a self-upgrading mecha xD.

But, putting them in hands of a machine is inhumane - as the young caretaker Haruko puts it.  If you are curious about how absurd can Otomo get in his funny allegories, I suggest watching the Stink Bomb segment of anime Memories.A lot of famous names have collaborated on this movie, including Satoshi Kon, as an art and scene director. It was the first anime he worked on too. In a perpetually self-upgrading mecha nursing bed, you will instantly recognize the absurd mozaic of elements, which Satoshi Kon later developed to it's maximum in Paprika, with his colorful fantasies.Roujin Z has aged incredibly well.

Can anyone guess why? Well, it\'s written by the creator of Akira himself Katsuhiro Otomo. Therefore, this film is great and it\'s a classic because he can do no wrong. Personally, I never bought into Akira\'s masterpiece status, and I don\'t buy into this films status as great anime either. I find it to be decent at best.It appears that Otomo was shooting for something thought provoking and he succeeded. Roujin Z definitely has a very interesting concept. I do know what it\'s like to help take care for an older person whom can\'t feed or wash themselves. It can definitely feel like a burden a lot of the time, and sometimes one could just wish that the person would go away. It\'s a very evil and selfish way of thinking but that\'s human nature.The film uses these feelings to establish an emotional link with the viewer, and at the same time it provides a solution to their problem. The people\'s reaction to the first live display of the bed\'s capabilities is proof. At first, the direction was pretty well done painting a picture of the selfish nature of people. Some of the folks in the audience were even uttering that they can now take a vacation. They completely ignored that the person still needs care from other human beings. Otomo had something serious and really deep going on here, but decided to turn it into a satire of Japan\'s feelings towards the elderly. I wish he could have been more serious with this one.I really didn\'t care for the direction that the film went, and I wasn\'t gripped by the plot at all. The film dabbles between comedy and action in the form of a silly cast, as well as uninteresting mecha fights. The only reason why my rating doesn\'t plummet any lower is because the mecha battle and wacky madness is actually necessary. They play into the themes and the heavy symbolism taking place with Takazawa. The substance present in the film can seriously have some viewers saying ""Wow!"", once everything finally comes together. I really didn\'t have a problem with the music, because it fits well with the comedy and action but there\'s nothing truly note worthy. This also goes for the voice acting which didn\'t stand out to me for neither language.The bit of comedy present certainly delivers through the animation and artwork. The facial expressions can be funny on certain occasions, and the action scenes have decent animation. The viewer gets to know several characters personalities somewhat but there isn\'t much for character development outside of Takazawa.Overall, I feel Roujin Z is worth a watch to the more serious anime fan. It\'s not something I\'ll be watching again and I don\'t consider it bad, but it could have done without the silliness. If you come into this searching for loads of blood and action, or even a dark angst ridden story shades of Akira. Then you\'ll definitely be disappointed.Highs: Realistic and interesting conceptLows: Typical characters, weak plot half way through there is more to the bed itself than expected.-summaryI\'m not a rocket scientist and I never claimed to be one, but it doesn\'t take one to see the primary reason why this anime film is hailed as a classic. Can anyone guess why? Well, it\'s written by the creator of Akira himself Katsuhiro Otomo. Therefore, this film is great and it\'s a classic because he can do no wrong. Personally, I never bought into Akira\'s masterpiece status, and I don\'t buy into this films status as great anime either.

You can see Otomos trademark for example in the character of a guy pretty similar to the character of the colonel of Akira and in the animation too, which is pretty good and you feel familiar with it, even though Otomo being not credited for the animation I get the feeling that he did something in that department.The story is about a new invention, a super bed that is able to take care of the elders like a nurse can take and even more. The thing is that this new invention goes berserk...as there is more to it than meets the eye.We also had a little of a Akira vibe in the story perfectly mixed with Shynia Matsumoto “Tetsuo the Iron Man”, in the department when [spoiler]the machine went berserk and started to assemble parts of other machines into its own body, that was pretty “Tetsuo” influenced, I wonder if it was intentional.The characters were all decent, except perhaps some moments of the lead girl when she was running around screaming “Ojii-chan!! Ojii-chan!!” And in the end “Oba-chan!! Oba-chan!!”[/spoiler]In terms of entertainment and overall feeling, I can relate this one with Otomos Stink Bomb.

I wasn't aware of how visually iconic it was until watching it and realizing the things that had taken inspiration from its visual style. It brought to life all of my fears of being elderly and having all of your human rights taken away from you by a medical establishment.

The feelings of ignorance towards the elderly are shown through Haruko and her group of friends seen at points throughout the film. While her friends and many among the public see the new Z-001 unit as a new convenience that frees up time and stress from caring for the elderly, Haruko sees it as taking away the personal interactions that the elderly can get...from others caring for them. Takazawa and the Z-001 fleeing from their ""caretakers"" for the beach could also be seen symbolically as the elder man regaining the dignity and independence that was taken away from him.The comedy for Roujin Z comes from the antics of the Z-001 unit and a group of elderly hackers that allow the computer system of the unit to come to life. The fact that a group of elderly men in a nursing home became computer hackers was quite a hoot for me as it added to the title\'s satire with technology serving as a sort of distraction for the elderly to prevent the nurses caring for them to have too much interaction with them. The Z-001\'s trip throughout town was the comedic highlight for me thanks to the ridiculous havoc it tore throughout the city and taking in different types of electronic and mechanical equipment into itself to make itself into a monstrosity of electric wires and mechanical parts.Such havoc also made for the animated highlight for me with Roujin Z as the monstrosity that the Z-001 became was nicely detailed and drawn with plenty of animated movement shown with it in most instances as it traveled through town and takes on a combat version of itself in a nicely animated fight in the second half of the movie. Scenery and character designs shown in the movie were also decently drawn with faded color tones. While the visuals are nowhere on par with the quality of Katsuhiro Otomo\'s well-known work Akira, it is still quite above par in quality compared to most anime titles made during the early 90s.While I do have plenty of praise for Roujin Z, it does have some flaws. The means in which the elderly hackers get the Z-001\'s computer to come to life is quite absurd in terms of believability, creating a bit of a logical lapse. Plus for as much fun as the movie\'s premise is, Takazawa\'s character still mostly serves as a tool for both its satire on the movie\'s themes and the havoc caused by the Z-001 as he\'s otherwise a pretty dull character with limited dialogue and not doing very much else without being guided around by the movie\'s characters and the Z-001.I guess I can consider it a first that I find myself genuinely enjoying a Katsuhiro Otomo film with how Roujin Z was laid out.

Basically the goverment funds a bed that takes care of the needs of the elderly and then everything goes wrong.It's a movie that doesnt make sense on paper, but while watching it I definitely learned some important stuff like that we should care for our elderly more and cherish them....The main character is a nurse who wants to take care of the elderly.

The premise has only become more relevant with time: in the near future, an appliance that serves all the physiological and mental needs of the elderly is invented, finally liberating families from the bothersome task of taking care of the old. The consequences of ultra-busy contemporary society invalidating the emotional needs of the elderly and infirm spiral into a nuclear-powered disaster straight out of mecha anime.

However, in its rush to indict the profit-motivated healthcare industry and the people who see their grandparents as a burden, it doesn't develop enough emotional impact to be very memorable.

I didn't really have any sort of expectations going into it and was blown away by the densely detailed set pieces and lovingly animated scenes, along with it's unique premise that manages to propose thoughtful ideas without going into a place that lingers on being too serious.Roujin z is pleasantly lighthearted in many areas, but its main themes primarily revolve around a topic that ultimately goes undiscussed often: how societies treat their elderly and the relation that has to automation. Sounds like the premise to a depressing documentary, but...this movie manages to roll with it in an entertaining way that personally kept me gripped all the way to the end, not really knowing what was going to happen next, as the narrative quickly picks up early on and doesn't let down for the rest of the movie. There's always something happening: a mystery being unraveled by the main cast early in the movie and the wild action scenes involving mechs towards the end.I highly recommend this and I'm a little disappointed that this movie isn't talked about as much. Will definitely be coming back to this for a rewatch at some point. this movie manages to roll with it in an entertaining way that personally kept me gripped all the way to the end, not really knowing what was going to happen next, as the narrative quickly picks up early on and doesn't let down for the rest of the movie.

This is a theme that is very prevalent throughout the film, but is dragged down by the film's poor characters, and worse execution.The premise of the film is one you would associate with a serious drama, as it tackles the struggles of Japan's healthcare system, and the battle between traditional values and modern technology, but instead the creators decided to put this delicate and thought provoking premise inside a action comedy...filled to the brim with giant robots, asshole characters, and sexual harassment. While at the start I was expecting this movie to be a satire dark comedy, I quickly found that it was instead a poorly thought out movie about nothing really.Roujin Z’s strongest points are, one that it is only a little over an hour long making it a quick and easy watch that doesn't take up to much of your time, and two its animation, which while not doing anything groundbreaking, lends the movie a nostalgic feeling that many anime from the 90s were filled with. Sadly Roujin Z is filled with many more faults than pros, starting with its poor choice of voice actors. While I try not to pick on voice acting too much, especially when the movie in question is from the 90’s, it is incredibly obvious that the people in charge of casting had little idea what to look for. The main cast is filled with inexperienced voice actors with little experience under their belt, and while sometimes it's good to give new actors a shot, you need to balance them out with an experienced cast to help cover up their faults, something Roujin Z failed to do.The biggest problem of all was the borderline insane “plot” of the film. While it started out simple enough, following Haruko as she deals with a old patient she cared about forced into this experimental machine that was obviously causing him pain, it quickly devolved as the machine suddenly grows a conscious mind, that inexplicably takes on the persona of the patients dead wife, just because they fed the machine a picture of her. And as the plot starts to crumble no amount of cheesy villains can save it as what could have been a heartfelt story of the problems of the healthcare system quickly becomes your average mediocre mecha showdown.At Least my boy Mitsuru got some in the end. filled to the brim with giant robots, asshole characters, and sexual harassment.

Sekirei: Hajimete no Otsukai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5279/Sekirei__Hajimete_no_Otsukai,"['This will be my first review so here i go. ( ihave no idea why it was not working earlier but o well)Story-7This OVA is just a episode where you can enjoy the cuteness of Kusano. It does a great job n explaining the plot of how each one of them want to become his wife. In thee end it did a ok job. I decided to give the story a 7 because eventhough it was an OVA it could have atleast done a little better job at make people excited for the Second season. I was looking forward to seeing Kusano use mroe of...her powers too but guess that didn\'t happenArt-6The art seem to lack a little bit because the characters seemed kind of drawn quickly. Kusano didn\'t look as cute as she did in the Series. The rest of the characters seemed to be drawn ok but to see that the character that they were trying to focus on wasn\'t drawn well kinda suprised me. Thats why i gave the Art a 6Sound-9The Sound and music of the anime are always great. nothing realy showed up that i thought ""what the heck.... why would they use this music"" The music seemed to fit right in place. Ending with the rating of 9.Character-8The characters were shown well in this OVA that everyone of them wanted to be his wife. I find it funny to see Kusano try so hard. Reminds me of a relationship between an older brother and a younger sister. Gotta love all the characters ;D. which got it an 8Enjoyment-8It was an enjoyable episode though. I don\'t personally like random OVA that have nothing really connected with the main plot. It just seems like a waste of my time but this did show some story at least.Overall-7OVerall i would say this isn\'t the best that they could have done to fill in the time before the second season. It was refreshing seeing all the characters again.

Well.. mostly by herself.If you like Kusano as a character, or just enjoy adorable little girls in general, watch this!It shows how sweet all the girls are together, how much they all love each other despite their situations and how good of friends they've become.It would be nice if it was longer, but it makes you excited for the next season. "", 'I\'m not the biggest fan of Sekirei; though the show (the first season) was satisfactory for what me and my partner were looking for (anime shows with boobs--nudity just makes TV more fun), Sekirei just happened to be the first one we watched, and we\'ve since moved on from caring. The story was never the greatest, in fact, it was pretty dumb in my opinion. The worst part was the loli \'sister\' character, however, who here gets her own ten minute special, more or less. As such, this is probably the worst thing related to Sekirei (thus far), but I\'ll still give it a 5...for the bath scene at the end, which is a decent trade for all the quote-unquote ""cuteness"" happening here. I guess I\'m easy to please.The animation is never bad, and I watched the English dub, which is as acceptable here as it is in the main series. But that little girl just creeps me out too much; and why waste our time on her when we could be animating more voluptuous breasts? for the bath scene at the end, which is a decent trade for all the quote-unquote ""cuteness"" happening here.

So, was it any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?StoryThere isn't a big story in this OVA. It's just a little episode in which Kusano attempts to go buy some grocieres for dinner, with some unexpected help from Musubi and Tsukiumi.

Kusano has...always been more of a supporting character in the main Sekirei series, so it's nice to see her getting the spotlight. Musubi and Tsukiumi also evolve in a meaningful way in this OVA, as they are willing to put aside their rivalry just to help the little girl.

Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20973/Sekai_Seifuku__Bouryaku_no_Zvezda,"['Many kids have big dreams these days. Some wants to win an Olympic Gold Medal for their country. Some wants to date a supermodel. Some wants to become an astronaut when they grow up. But how many kids out there wants to conquer the world? Perhaps not many in the real world but there’s one little girl who really wants to make that dream into a reality. Her name is Kate Hoshimiya. She may be small but has a big dream as leader of the Zvezda, a secret society. Their goal? World conquest.A trip into this show is one that will first strike you out...as bizarre at first. It’s not just the way the premise is crafted but the execution. Even the first episode extravagantly brings its gags in various forms such as jelly bobs, military tanks, mecha, and a loli dressed like if she’s planning to go to a Halloween party. But despite the silliness of the setup, the show maintains somewhat of a serious vibe. Taken for granted, we learn that no one has yet successfully conquered the world. Now, we have this young girl that tries to take on the impossible.Standing no taller than a middle school grader, Kate comes off as a young girl full of energy. Perhaps what strikes her character out the most is her commanding way of leading people. Believe it or not, she doesn’t actually suffer from delusions (as in the ‘chuunibyou’ case). Kate’s ambitions are real that are fueled by her words and actions. More importantly is the fact that Kate has followers collectively formed as a group by the name of Zvezda. The series details their journey and trials of conquests that ranges from a variety of subjects. They don’t mess around as the conquests they complete usually require effort that is perhaps surpassed by a normal human is capable of. During their journey, we also meet Asuta Jimon, a young boy that coincidentally runs into Kate during one of her days in life.Unlike the other members of Zvezda, Asuta has no superpowers of his own. Yet, he is useful for his cooking skills. After all, you can’t fight on an empty stomach. His first encounter with Kate is not only bizarre but comes off as abrupt. Rather than hiding her identity, Kate reveals her goals and who she is. Normally, it would be uncommon for overlords to give out sensitive information. Yet, Kate not only reveals her identity but boasts about her greatness with a large ego. In essence, Kate serves as more of a super villain. Despite this, she does treat her subordinates with respect. She also tends to avoid violence unless a task requires it or something catches her mind in a bind of frustration. But most importantly, she holds together the group through their single-minded task – to conquer the world. You have to wonder how serious this show takes the trope as the story becomes molded with amateurish tactics, lack of common sense, and logic defilement. For what it’s worth, the show is comedic. There’s really no emphasis on a key purpose to the story besides the simple concept of world conquest. Rather than going on with complex plans, the author decides to write this show’s story like an open textbook. Each page tells the story of Kate and her conquests.An organization as it is, Zvezda composes of no more than seven members. Unlike Asuta, they have their own superpowers that matches their character styles. Some of them fits with the classic stereotypes such as the mad scientist (Natasha), Yasu (super soldier), or Roboko (the brains). Their superpower ranges in wide degrees and collectively does make a force to be reckoned with. Yet, there are some silly gadgets to take notice of. One for instance is their hideout that is initially designed like a playhouse as a “super villain base”. (it even says “Zvevda Secret Society” on the outside!) Then, there are the outfits the characters wear when they go on missions. They are flamboyant and even Kate has to wear an ornamental cape to make a point for herself. We also find out that some of the characters has unusual closeness among its group members while others tend to be oil and water. In retrospect, Zvevda is an organization that we like to feel attached to. Their members, ambitions, and missions they set to carry out shows their attributes as well as clearly pointing their strengths and weaknesses.Yet as the story progresses on, we find out about opposition against Zvevda. Taking on the name of “White Light”, they are group that stands out as the adversaries. It’s really silly with this setup reflexively if we look closer. It makes it look like the White Light are the bad guys going up against Zvevda. Caught up in the middle is Asuta. And to make matters worse, we learn that some of White Light’s members are acquitted with Asuta in the school norm. There’s a curiosity that should spark to viewers for cases of identity. In which case, Asuta would become a scapegoat because he is in one group that is portrayed as the “super villains” while the good guys (White Light) opposes their goals. As ridiculous as the concept is portrayed, there’s a certain attractiveness with this setup marked with silliness. It should be taken in as granted for a joke rather than something to take by heart.Having action also means fighting and battles. Whether it’s at home, school, or out in the open world, most of the core characters demonstrates various degree of combat experience. Yet, some of these weapons are so risible that it makes you wonder if it’s all just a big prank in the end. Nonetheless, there are some weapons that are menacing enough to strike fear such as Itsuka’s sharp sword or Natasha’s crafty inventions. Then, there’s absurdity coming from Asuta for his normalcy. Perhaps he’s just too normal and can’t ever conform 100% with Zvevda. More necessary comes with the fact that he needs to acquire superpowers of his own. In the end, Asuta is no more than just a cook despite his ways to help the group. But if we talk about bizarre, action takes it a near imaginative level with its gags and stylish yet artistic way of coordinating its action scenes.The show comes together other aspects with its formulation. Comedy wise, the show nailed it with its colorful dialogues, gags, and characters. However, do watch out for repetitiveness as some jokes can quickly grow old and stale. One particular episode also plays off as a campaign that may actually be offensive to a certain group of viewers despite being advertised as a parody. On the other hand, mystery becomes a rather weak point. There’s a lack of characterization with nearly all the characters. Thus, do not expect powerful flashbacks or development. Rather, don’t even expect story depth. The show itself is one big wisecrack. Despite being in directed by Tensai Okamura (Darker than Black, Ghost in the Shell, Wolf Rain), the show will feel very different. But being different isn’t necessary faulty. It just takes time to get used to because this show has a contagious fun odor that will catch your attention.Artwork doesn’t take itself as substantial credit. Instead, it comes off as more goofy and amateurish. But nonetheless, we get a classic feeling of the superhero (or perhaps maybe super villain) atmosphere. The parts that stands out the most in regards to visuals is the way characters are designed. Flamboyant, exuberant, and conspicuous are just a few words that describe our characters’ outfits. The way Kate is designed gives us a way to appreciate her intentions for someone so small yet with a huge ego At the same time she can come off as a brat with her kiddy outfit. On the other hand, there are characters dressed in ways that gives them more a menacing look such as Itsuka’s eyepatch or Gorou’s skullface. Then, there are the obnoxious bits of fan service such as Natasha’s loosely dressed lab coat and even Kate’s outfit herself. But in retrospect, most aspects come together in union. The backgrounds stand out as average. A-1 Works strikes out controversially for some series in the past but here only comes as something just tolerable.The soundtrack is above moderate in terms of consistency on most parts. But more noticeable is the way characters speak with their diverse mannerisms. Kate for instance has an egoistic way of speech so naturally, expect some words of narcissism to come out of her mouth. Other characters display their personalities with their voices such as Itsuka’s hot-blooded personality, Renge’s innocence, Miki’s elegance, or Roboko’s wisdom. The OST mixes in tune with a combination of rock and rapid pace during action scenes. During more humorous sequences, it attaches a more goofy tone. The OP and ED song are more childish but does make its point.By the time you finish this show, you’ll feel like a kid again. It’s not just a Halloween party you attended where you dress up and look like someone else. Rather, it’s what you’re doing with yourself and the goals you choose to follow. But being a kid is something we’ve all gone through but for Kate, she has goals beyond what any single child can dream for.

Hoshimiya Kate, for reasons that are never explained, is a girl who seems to never age while everyone around her does. She, though a reason is never really given, wants to conquer the world and fights against other organziations who try to foil her plan. As you may have already guessed, my main issue with this anime is that they don\'t explain hardly anything. Characters are given quick backstories that don\'t make much...sense and the plot is full of filler and doesn\'t really go anywhere until the last three or so episodes.The show begins with a high school boy named Jimon Asuta who ran away from home. He is struggling to get food to eat but is determined to make a living on his own and avoid anyone knowing that he has run away. Though, the only person he ever talks to and cares about hiding his situation from is his crush, Renge. Renge is also hiding a secret. She is a member of the group called ""White Light"" who fights against evil, which is mainly Zvesda. The members of White Light wear masks and uniforms that hide their identity from each other even though it should be blatantly obvious who they all are considering their unique hairstyles still show..... But moving on, Asuta ends up running into a conflict between Zvesda and White Light, is recruited into Zvesda against his will, and now has a place to stay even if it might cause him to lose his life in the process. All of the other members are ""quirky"" to say the least, and White Light is out to kill all of the members of Zvesda, and Asuta has to adjust to this new lifestyle whether he wants to or not.The story is very generic for the most part and uninteresting. The characters are all generic except for Kate, and none of them get enough time to develop very much. Asuta is about as unoriginal as a main protagonist can get. He\'s good at cooking and randomly saving the day but nothing else. Kate is a bit unique, but the anime does a horrible job of explaining anything about her mission or why she\'s been 7 years old in both mind and body since many of the older characters were kids. The rest of the main characters consist of a scientist, a tsuntsun swordswoman, an ex-gang member and his underling (who is just a terrible comedic relief character with absolutely no redeeming qualities), and a female robot.The one part of the story I did really enjoy was the anti-smoking (cigarattes, not marijuana) aspect. The one episode completely about anti-smoking is the best one by far, even if it does show how Yasubee is a horrible character which no one should ever trust (seriously, he switches sides out of nowhere and it\'s just plain stupid how everyone forgives him anyway, especially Gorou). Though it was never explained at all how the villain\'s smoke powers were even possible in the show\'s universe.The animation is good, but some of the character designs are very.... fanservicy. Mainly Kate\'s (give a 7 year old a revealing outfit, why not?) and Natalia. Aside from that, the character designs still aren\'t great, but they\'re not terrible. The scenery in the show is also average, and the action scenes aren\'t anything too interesting with only decent choreography. The use of CG for larger monsters and weapons also becomes a bit annoying and clashes with the regular animation. The soundtrack is mostly unmemorable with the OP being the only good song.While I did enjoy some parts of Sekai Seifuku, nothing much really happened. It\'s just going from point A to point B with a lot of filler in the middle and a few mediocre flashbacks to try and make you feel more attached to the characters that never have anything too bad happen to them anyway. The drama in this show just falls flat and the comedy is only occasionally funny. If not for the anti-smoking episode and some of the few good character interactions, the story would have had nothing unique or good about it. I just never even began to like any of the characters in this show or care if anything bad happened to them.

In this extremely original, unique series, you get a combination of comedy, action, drama, romance, and even a little fanservice all wrapped into a great little package! The characters are developed very well, as are the relationships and backgrounds of each of the said characters. The plot and how the series develops is extremely unique and entertaining. But also conveys that you can achieve your dreams no matter how small or what gender you are, or what the odds are against you. Every episode has it\'s own significant story to it and theme to be...taken from it, but all the while adding to the overall plot of the series. You will be continually drawn into this entertaining series more and more as you watch. Great action. Ton of comedy. And an intriguing plot. This is a winner for sure!

World Conquest Zvezda Plot is a story of such conquering, spearheaded by a little girl, a young boy, and the rest of Zvezda squad.STORYWorld Conquest Zvezda Plot begins with Asuta coming across a little kid named Kate. After a small altercation, Asuta (now...known as ""Dva"") is recruited into Zvezda, a group of people determined to conquer the world.Conquest goes about telling its story in a rather clever way. In most cases, instead of outright revealing the information through explanations or visuals, the show often uses indirect speaking as a way to give the audience insight into the world without having it spoon-fed to them. Using this tactic causes the viewers to actually have to ""connect-the-dots"" in order to understand who the characters are, why the world is the way it is, and where things will be headed. Now, the show does utilize flashbacks in order to get the more difficult details across, but for the most part, the writing itself was done rather nicely.In regards to what actually goes on, the over-arcing plot is rather lackluster. The problem is that the goal itself is not only too vague but too large in scope. Meaning, it\'s difficult to understand what exactly the purpose is of what they are doing. On a smaller scale, however, the show does at least a fair job of showcasing a slice-of-life-ish portrayal of a fantastical world. Filled with strange creatures, transformations, and tons of udo, most episodes have simpler goals in mind that help to flesh out not only the characters but the world itself. At the same time, the missions are often unique and filled with comedic moments between the cast and the environments housing them. The humor isn\'t anything great, but the snide quips from Asuta or the overzealous nature of Plamya when it comes to Kate is usually good for a laugh or two.A large problem with Conquest is the ending. At this point, it has done a very nice job of setting up the overall tension and despair that contrasts with the previous events. However, when all is said and done, the contrived plot points, role-reversals, and underwhelming antagonist leave the series on an unfortunate low-note. Coupled with the fact that the story sets itself up for further shenanigans down the road, you are left with a vast feeling of emptiness. Not that things are just getting started, but rather that they have yet to be completed.ANIMATIONThe overall art and animation for Conquest is actually pretty darn good.Starting with the art, the show loves to use a wide variance of colors. The ball-like creatures, the characters\' clothing, and the locations themselves are rife with many different colors that make everything pop. The backgrounds aren\'t so much colorful as they are detailed. The Zvezda base comes to mind as do the underground ancient ruins.Above all else, the character designs are top-notch. Each character has a ""transformation"" that allows them to become their more powerful selves. These costumes contain the same level of detail as the backgrounds do. Goro\'s skull mask and military gear, Plamya\'s eye-patch, helmet, and coat, and Um\'s Halloween coloring and witch-like outfit are the standouts, but easily help to demonstrate how unique each of them look. Even when not in their strong attire, their regular selves also contain some level of detail to make them contrast with everyday civilians.The show also does well in the actual animation department. The fights are easy to follow and nicely choreographed, and the characters contain both fluid movements and varying facial expressions. The CG isn\'t the best, but it doesn\'t feel over-bearing or terribly out of place.CHARACTERSThe characters in Conquest are ""characters"" themselves, but I\'ll at least talk about some of my favorites.Itsuka, aka ""Plamya,"" is a young woman who is strong-willed, straight-forward, and at times simple-minded. In a lot of ways, she reminded me heavily of Asuna of SAO fame due to her interesting character design, swordplay, and general bad-assery. Plamya appears difficult to approach, but her conviction to protect the squad is evident. Her character serves to demonstrate that dedication and hard work may not come easy, but the payoffs in the end more than make up for the trouble one goes through.Garo, aka ""Chief,"" seems like the tough, parental type. Instead, he\'s more like the silent guardian. Among the whole cast, he surprisingly seems the most out of place with his stature and past, but it\'s slowly revealed why such a man follows such a girl. He actually has some of the best action sequences in the show to make up for his lack of humor. Chief represents something that we all hope to do, and that is upholding the ideals we hold true to our heart.Easily the best character from the anime, Kate, aka ""Venera,"" is literally a child. The leader of Zvezda, her strange ability to unite random people from across the land to work towards a common goal is unprecedented. She\'s loud, demanding, and sometimes sleepy. On top of all this, her best friend is a stuffed pink rabbit. For all intents and purposes, she is a baby girl whose dreams are seemingly too grand to be feasible. And that\'s what makes her shine. Sure, she\'s cute, sure, she has an adorable way of talking. But what she isn\'t is being afraid to dream big, to go for the impossible. That despite the troubles one may face, they can always be conquered.If it isn\'t evident by now, what Conquest does right with its characters is having them serve as messages for personal growth, for personal conquest. Dva is about understanding one\'s place in the world, Um tells us it\'s not about being constricted to the past but anticipating the future, etc. The characters\' themselves may be slightly trope-y with some of their character quirks, but almost all characters are. Instead, their most important aspects are not the way they look, how they talk, or what they do, but the ideas that they share with us.One final note is that some of the characters, comparatively, do not have their backgrounds fleshed out enough. Some do and some don\'t. It\'s a mixed bag that is sadly not divided evenly between the cast. Furthermore, as a main character, Dva is rather weak. He provides most of the comedy, but that\'s just about it. When the show is progressing, one isn\'t looking for Dva\'s next scene but rather what the rest of Zvezda squad is doing.SOUNDThe OP is interesting. At first, it\'s not that good. It seems rather plain or generic, given the unique atmosphere that the show tries to portray. However, after a few episodes (roughly half-way through), the piece becomes at least average. It\'s nothing worth listening to on a daily basis, but the beginning, middle, and ending sequences are well done. If anything, the OP feels like lost potential.The ED reminded me a bit of Humanity Has Declined\'s, with its soft vocalist and perhaps out-of-place visuals. This one doesn\'t have the same ""oomph"" attached to it that Humanity Has Declined does, but it does at least remind one of a lullaby, coinciding with Kate\'s nature.The rest of the soundtrack is sadly quite forgettable. The only prominent ""piece"" is the bell chimes that go off during the screen transitions.Finally, in regards to VA work, Misaki Kuno does an above average job in her role as Kate. Her voice has that little kid quality to it that is tough to nail. Plus, it\'s rather unique, making it stand out more than usual.ENJOYMENTWhen it comes to watching this one, it\'s difficult to like it right away. It seems rather similar to other shows out there in the anime world, and to an extent that is a correct statement. The show\'s excitement and urge to watch it never really settled in until about three-quarters of the way through. The action was fine, the comedy was there, it just never had much of a hook or draw to entice me further.Each episode is more or less set-up (at least in the beginning) to give us some indication of who the characters are. This is done in conjunction with the indirect world-building explained earlier. It works decently well, but causes a lot of the scenarios to become somewhat repetitive. Some instances are vastly different from what occurred before, but many of the same jokes and outcomes happen time and again.The ending itself is sadly left open, the romance elements at play are teased at but never really take off, and even with the clever storytelling there are some parts that are just never explained. World Conquest Zvezda Plot doesn\'t really do anything new or exciting, but if you need a fun little show with the added bonus of slick visuals, then this one wouldn\'t be a bad place to start.SUMMARYStory: Bad, nice indirect story-telling with contrived endingAnimation: Great, art is detailed, character designs are unique, actual animation is well doneCharacters: Fine, each provides an underlying ""message""Sound: Fine, okay OP and ED, bad soundtrack, decent VA workEnjoyment: Fine, some fun and laughs for the whole experienceFinal Score: 5/10 known as ""Dva"") is recruited into Zvezda, a group of people determined to conquer the world.Conquest goes about telling its story in a rather clever way.

This phrase was uttered by me each week I watched Zvezda Plot. This show is easily one of the strangest I\'ve watched in a long time, but it\'s really not a bad thing. On the contrary, it\'s actually one it\'s strengths and also the main reason I kept coming back week after week to watch it. I\'ll be leaving a breakdown of its strengths a weakness below, with as little spoilers as possible.Story - Zvezda\'s story to be quite frank is extremely silly. The bare bones plot is about a group of borderline superhuman people and their quest for world...conquest. Week after week they go out and conquer something, be it smokers, buildings, or whatever else they feel like doing. They have to fight other organizations that are trying to stop them from taking over the world. A main antagonist does eventually surface, but it\'s up to you to decide if you think it\'s really worth it in the end. I didn\'t watch it for the plot personally, but as with most things, mileage may vary. (6)Art - The art style is kinda of strange, but all in all it\'s nothing that would turn you away from the show in my opinion. (7)Sound - (9)Characters - This is where Zvezda truly shines in my opinion. The cast is colorful, fun, and their personalities are varied. The way they interact was a treat to watch and kept me laughing throughout the show. Swordsmen, Mafia members, scientists, and mythical creatures are found in this show. You\'ll be pretty hard pressed to not find someone you like in this cast. The only strikes against the characters I seen were that the cast was female heavy and the main character was somewhat lacking. (8)Enjoyment - I enjoyed the show a lot more than I probably should have. The comedy really worked for me and as stated above, I loved the characters. I don\'t regret watching it all. (9)Overall - If I had to summarize Zvezda in a couple words, they would be ""Stupid Fun."" The show doesn\'t take itself seriously and neither should you. If you\'re looking for a show that has and amazing layered plot look elsewhere because Zvezda is nothing like that. However, if you\'re looking for comedy or just something different Zvezda might just be the show for you. Give a shot, you just might like what you experience. (7) conquest.

(7)', 'It took me a while to realize that I\'ve already watched this anime on Youtube 6-5 years ago. Not the full series. Just bits and montages including the ending. Honestly, I remember how repugnant I felt towards the show back then. I\'m rather surprised by how I completely forgot about this show 6-5 years after. Well, doesn\'t really matter now. The past is the past. I just binged this show and here\'s my present opinions of it.This anime was so wacky and silly. Sometimes I feel eminently disturbed by how quirky the characters are. An anime about a loli trying take over the world...with her ""subordinates"". Add some mediocre jokes, weak MC, and fake romance into the show and you get Sekai Seifuku: Bouryaku no Zvezda.Y\'know. I actually had a lot of fun watching this show. Something like these are pretty rare these days. A unique anime that doesn\'t seem to feel like a copy or ripoff of another anime. Something original. That\'s what makes World Conquest Zvezda Plot such a good show.This anime has a lot of potential. With a little bit more improvisation, it might even become something like My Little Witch Academia on drugs.Recommended to those who wants something chill and mediocre funny to watch. with her ""subordinates"".

The premise is an immediate attention grabber, a comedic story about a organization out for world domination from the perspective of one of it\'s low level grunts. Unfortunately A-1 seem to have stopped at the premise and character designs, forgoing writing an interesting narrative.On several occasions I was left with the feeling that I\'d missed an episode or two, plot points are introduced and dropped fast with little explanation. Some story beats completely miss the mark, and the level of narrative convenience on display is unmatched...by any piece of media I\'ve ever watched. Things happen in Bouryaku no Zvezda which is the nicest thing you can say about it\'s plot, but it\'s unlikely to explain why.There is little to no consequence to anything that happens during these 12 episodes. Many of the characters do not get their time in the sun, instead the show assumes that we know them already by introducing characters from their past and forcing us to fill in the blanks. In one particularly insulting instance, the climatic episode of the series is a hot spring episode. The characters return from their vacation to discover that the final act of the story has started without them present. Why?Of course the character designs are interesting, but you\'ll be given very little reason to care about many of them. It\'s impressive that in a show with such an out-there cast they still find time to have anime requisite filler in a 12 episode show. What\'s the opposite of ""tightly paced?"" Zvezda is exactly that.The animation is fine enough, and the voice acting and soundtrack is a particular highlight for me. But otherwise this is a show with very, very little to offer the viewer. In fact it doesn\'t seem to have much to offer to itself. With a bit of effort with it\'s narrative this might have been a highlight of the season, instead it\'s easily forgettable and in some cases obnoxious to remember.Zvezda isn\'t interested enough to have a coherent story, return the favour and avoid this one. by any piece of media I\'ve ever watched.

After a disappointing attempt at Attack on Titan I'd found Kill la Kill, and I was hooked. Both AoT and KLK were easy - the amount of talk they got on tumblr, and the resulting fandoms, provided enough peer pressure and 'buzz' to make entering those series almost mandatory for understanding what was going on on my dash.Zvezda, however, was not one of those series. I've yet to come across any casual reblogs or fan-art of the series on my dash from people I'm currently following....The screencaps I've posted have received attention, usually in the form of 'what series is this' if it's not stated outright, but even so, the attention's been relegated to a handful of notes. The attention the series has gotten, as far as I can tell, has been mostly from people who've fallen in love with the girl whose dreams will always be bigger than her body, the semi-dressed-to-kill Kate Hoshimiya.Does this make Zvezda a sleeper hit? Or just another fluffy show with a fair amount of fanservice to round out last season? It may be hard to tell right now, but I'd say, at 12 episodes, it's worth your time if you're in the mood for something silly and exciting with a heart, you probably won't be disappointed. Full disclosure: I say this as someone who's fallen for the aforementioned half-dressed girl.I found Zvezda on Daisuke from an ad showing a crew of characters dressed in eccentric outfits. A skeleton, a robot, a girl with a skull-and-crossbones kitten eyepatch, and a couple of masked-up, mostly-naked women - as bizarre as this sounds, you'll see how accurately this sums up the series. It's funny, weird, and intriguing, featuring a cast of bizarre outsiders engaged in a struggle over the fate of the world. It will have you laughing, and maybe a bit touched by the stories of struggle against oppression and the bonds of friendship in the face of danger. Over the course of the show you'll get glimpses of a secret world beneath our own, watch intrigue play out between warring factions in the past and present, and discover why smoking is really much worse for you than you might originally think.That said, if that sounds like a lot to work out over the course of twelve episodes, you're right.Like Kate, the vision that Zvezda puts forward might be a little bigger than it's capable of handling on its own. The show devotes a fair amount of time to its ensemble cast, each of which has a strange backstory that you're treated to glimpses of without seeing the whole thing. There's a lot going on, both with the characters and the world around them, and none of it's explained too clearly. What you get is impressions - sadness, fear, excitement, joy - without much depth or elaboration. While this isn't bad, a few times during my initial viewing, and more in retrospect, I found myself asking, 'if they have so little time for the series, why did they put x into it?'.But that being said, I didn't walk away from it disappointed - on the contrary, I wanted more! The OVA, another season, an English translation of the manga - there's plenty of story here to tell, and part of what Zvezda does best is lends itself to the imagination where (much like Kate's outfit) it only teases instead of showing outright. You're mostly along for a very fun. fast-paced and somewhat confusing ride, much like the unlikely protagonist Jimon Asuta himself, and if you're willing to put up with a fair bit of nonsense and a few half-baked ideas this is probably worth your time.

It greatly makes up for that in Comedy,Art,Music and Characters.The comedy of the show is pretty good with a lot of good jokes. The MC is one of the best Straightman i'v seen in recent time and fits with into this show really well.Asuta himself also has a pretty nice Character design that surprisingly looks different then every other male MC. I originally thought he might be a chick and was kind of disappointed when i found out he wasn't.... But in the end i actually like this more.Kate is a pretty adorable character.

If I was to describe Sekai Sefuku\'s plot so you get a good grasp of what the anime is about it would require long mathematics formulas, a few of Newton\'s laws, a wet nap and a glass of cranberry juice. But to simplify, Sekai Seifuku is just what the name entails... World domination. The story centers around a boy named Jimon Asuta, A.K.A Dva, who runs away from home and finds refuge in the the Zvezda;an ""evil"" organizaiton who\'s goals are to....basically  take over the world. Each episode is mixed with a good amount...of comedy but this isn\'t really a gag manga. The manga uses a type of dark humor that seems light at first glance. Add in a light organization who is trying to shut down Zvezda and you basically have Sekai Sefuku.  Instead of being plot oriented this story is more character driven..Characters [9/10]I loved the characters. They kinda reminded me of Awakawa Under the Bridge because in AwaxBridge everyone who lives under the the bridge are weirdos with only 1 sane person trying to figure out WTH is going on. If you relate that to the members of Zvezda, Asuta is probably the only normal person. The character designs are really good and I enjoyed a lot of the back stories. Although they are random at times they made this a really good anime and you cant lie... The costumes are bad a$$.Sound/Art [8/10]The Op was really done well and Its fun to listen to. The art is above average and adds to the enjoyment of the anime. There\'s a lot of pretty colors and its nice an easy on the eyes.Overall [9/10]For me this was the best anime of the winter season. But i didn\'t watch the Oda Nabunaga based anime so I cant count them but I watched a fair amount of the winter season. It takes about 3 episodes to get used to the pace but overall it was done really well. I recommend this to people who loved comedy and weird characters.

While watching it there were several times i had to go back and re watch  scene just to see all the jokes they were able to fit in there.If you\'re here for an anime about world conquest, then you\'re about to be conquested yourself, by a lack of actual conquesting.The whole anime is basically about this girl who plans on taking over the whole world and her crew of comrades, who includeGirl with sword: Features include, a sword, eye-patch, and a  underlying crippling depression that causes her to break into tears like a...2 year old whenever she loses the eye-patchMagic Girl: IDK if its actually magic or just advanced technology but she does some cool stuff and sleeps wherever she wantsThe Tank: He walks, talks, and doesn\'t stop, unless he gets shot then he takes a bullet wound cause he is actually just a human after allRobot Girl: Perks include: Is a robot. Cons include: She runs on vegetablesThat one guy that smokes a lot: He looks like a cowboy and smokes sometimes, usually followed by him getting water poured on him, making him leave the group, then come back and sometimes even not break everything.The normal guy: Our main character, doesn\'t have anything special about him he literally just talks to people and thats about it.This group is fought by the relentless group of highschoolers dressed in white robes and masks on top of masks, with the goal of finally wiping out the Zvezda group and stopping their not-so-tyrannical rule over this small town in Japan.At a certain point you realize that you just enjoyed this anime, thought it was funny, but you got through it without asking any questions on how things work. I mean, how does the entire city run on the energy produced by a giant plant, idk, but it does and its pretty funny.Nevertheless the anime does have some moments that could be called ""tense"" and actually felt like it was doing something sometimes. Definitely worth a watch if you have a free night and nothing else to do.And remember kids, smoking kills... everything. like its actually the main enemy in this anime for some reason. 2 year old whenever she loses the eye-patchMagic Girl: IDK if its actually magic or just advanced technology but she does some cool stuff and sleeps wherever she wantsThe Tank: He walks, talks, and doesn\'t stop, unless he gets shot then he takes a bullet wound cause he is actually just a human after allRobot Girl: Perks include: Is a robot.

Don\'t try to think while you\'re watching. You do have to pay attention though because it\'s really easy to miss one of the gamut of random scenes throughout.The best parts were the animation quality and characters. The action scenes were animated very well when they had them, and the cg was okay. The characters were really kooky but I liked them when I stopped trying to understand anything and just went along with...the show. Another cool thing that I noticed was that the plot exposition was done in a roundabout way.The sound effects wore me out after a while, but that was expected considering the colorful style of the show.The reason I\'m giving this a relatively high score is that the show doesn\'t take itself seriously given what it presents.7.2/10.0 the show.

The character interactions were fun and the character designs were really good. It wasn't very unique, I had seen many shows like this.

And here's where the most forgettable part comes. Cause nothing happens. Of course, plot points occur, but nothing of any big consequences. I don't know why that part had any significance.

The middling score I'm giving it isn't a reflection of the number of things I dislike about the anime, but instead, comes down to the things I did like about it just not being substantial enough for me to properly sink my teeth into it.The show is about a ragtag band of misfits and their attempts on conquering the world, lead by a young girl and helped by a runaway boy who gets more than he bargained for when he joins their organisation. The characters are eccentric and the premise is an immediate winner. Which brings me to my...one main all-encompassing criticism - there's just not enough of either of these things.I really enjoyed the various characters, they're all very unique, well designed and fun to watch, but sadly they don't get enough attention. A lot of time is spent on the comparatively more normal and less interesting main character, while the other small cast of characters are in the side-lines. When these other characters are given their moments, they're often very brief, or sometimes snippets of backstory that feel a little out of context and not very fulfilling. They're interesting enough to catch your attention but not fleshed out enough to keep hold of it.Similarly, for a show about conquering the world, there's just not enough conquering going on. The characters are often decent and passive, with no real criminal behavior for much of the series. Almost all episodes focus in on fairly banal and pedestrian plots that don't deliver on the much grander premise. I really don't need to see these characters idling, going to school, having dinner or going to spa's so often, when what they should be involved in is action, fights and subjugating the human race. As a result, many of the episodes feel inconsequential and meandering.All in all, I just would have liked more. Of everything. More plot progression, more conquering and more reason to care about these characters. Unfortunately it feels like another case of wasted potential. A grand plot with wacky characters gives you a lot of creative freedom to take a story in a variety of directions but sadly it's squandered here and the series as a whole is all too mundane. one main all-encompassing criticism - there's just not enough of either of these things.I really enjoyed the various characters, they're all very unique, well designed and fun to watch, but sadly they don't get enough attention.

This is a Question and Answer format review.First question: Is Sekai Seifuku mainly a kids show?Answer: Well, with the uniforms of some of the characters, it is definitely not for kids. One thing I\'ll do say is that the show really felt like one.Second question: Should I watch Sekai Seifuku?Answer: I think you won\'t gain much from finishing this show. There\'s so many cliches but I still enjoyed watching majority of the show. There are some waifu tier characters in this show which might...mean something to others.Third question: Should I watch the Special episode?Answer: I didn\'t feel like watching it after the main series. I guess you could and I guess it\'s also a mini sequel.Fourth question: What is there to like about Sekai Seifuku?Answer: I\'m able to handle the cliches since I\'ve been able to watch so many anime but there are a few things to like about this show; The music (I personally prefer the ending song), as I said from the above the waifu tier characters, the voice acting for most of the characters was actually enjoyable that I want to hear their voices again, and lastly the designs of these characters as in their uniforms and stuff.Fifth question: What is there to not like about Sekai Seifuku?Answer: Well, cliches, cliches, and cliches. The story, well now that I noticed, they pretty much combined a 3 volume manga and two short manga at the same time and the result (the anime) for me is a decent experience but I think it\'s something that is not good pretty much. Also the age difference is like ""NANI?"" but at this point who cares about it anymore.Summary: Sekai Seifuku is a show for teens pretty much unless some adults happen to have the same humor of this anime, a show that happens to get it\'s story misled or confusing but enjoyable, a show with enjoyable characters and somewhat nice voice acting, and a show that is overall a decent teen yet kids-like show that anyone can laugh with some of the jokes in the show.This is pretty much an anime where if you want to reach a milestone like watching your 100th anime and such, this can be the show although there are way better options out there (compared to this show) like Shimoneta and Prison School.Just watch it if you just wanna chill, just watch it if you wanna see some hot highschool girl do some cool stuff, just watch it if you just wanna understand the usually unrecognised, unpopular, or anime that people don\'t usually watch and yeah that\'s all I gotta say about Sekai Seifuku. 7/10 and Itsuka Shikabane is my waifu from this show. mean something to others.Third question: Should I watch the Special episode?Answer: I didn\'t feel like watching it after the main series.

Princess Connect! Re:Dive,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39292/Princess_Connect_Re_Dive,"['I’ll be honest here. I don’t like mobile game adaptations. From the top of my head, there hasn’t been a many mobile game adaptation in recent years that I rated more than 5 or above. The reason being is that most of them are bankrupt on the creative side. They seem like projects aimed to make a quick buck. Princess Connect! Re:Dive tells a different story. This particular cute little gem is a mobile adaptation that I’ve grown fondly to actually say it’s enjoyable.Right off the bat, I noticed that we have Takomi Kansaki helming the show as the producer. He was previously involved with...the popular Konosuba franchise. So in other words, do be prepared for eccentric humor. It depends on how much you’ll approach this show’s humor but to say the least, it has an immense amount of charisma. With our lovable cast of characters, there’s no shortage for entertainment as we follow Yuuki and his adventures.However, I will say one thing. Yuuki is the male protagonist but he’s not the one to watch out for, or to invest your time into. Being mostly silent doesn’t help his character nor does it help that he feels like an NPC bot. The real selling point is the character chemistry between the three main female cast – Pecorine, Kokkoro, and Karyl. United under the Gourmet Edifice banner, each of them has their own colorful personalities and it catches on very quickly once you pay close attention. Pecorine is armed with a big appetite and a bubbly personality. She is essentially one of the poster girls and it’s easy to see how friendly she is. A recurring gag in the show also revolves her love for food so prepare to see a lot of cooking at her guild. We are also joined by Kokkoro, a servant who is very loyal to her friends. And while not as energetic as Pecorine, she will draw the audience’s attention with her inner thoughts about herself. Finally, there’s Karyl, the tsundere-like cat girl who seems have her own personal mission to keep an eye on the guild. As the show progresses, her character changes and she begins to trust in her new friends. While the writing here isn’t any dynamic or unique, it does bring her character as someone to appreciate more. Plus, Karyl adds popcorn entertainment to the show whenever others try to befriend her, most noticeably Pecorine.Naturally, Princess Connect takes place in a fantasy setting with the show’s various gimmicks. I won’t deny that it can be a bit cartoony at times. It’s adapted from a mobile game after all but don’t let that take away your attention. The show is able to take its gimmicks and bring out the most of it. This is accomplished through the different running gags such as Karyl’s entomophobia, Yuuki being a monster magnet, or Kokkoro’s emotive reactions. Every episode, it uses these little bits of comedic moments in addition to the main storytelling. Make no mistake though. Princess Connect doesn’t have a very serious plot. Sometimes the plot focuses on the adventures while other times can feel like a relaxing slice of life. What’s more fun is how our characters takes their adventures and enjoying the most from it. This isn’t about a group of adventurers trying to save the world or in fact, they don’t really have an endgame goal at all. This show is ambiguous in its main purpose so don’t think too hard into it. Most of the supporting characters also serve some purpose but ultimately, Princess Connect sells itself as a comedy adventure, not some dramatic high fantasy.It did became clear to me this series wants to have fun with the cast as much as possible. Remember, it’s directed by Takomi Kansaki so some character personalities in this anime will feel similar to Konosuba. Pecorine for instance has a dumb mentality comparable to Aqua. What makes their characters entertaining really lies in their emotive reactions. Perhaps Karyl is the biggest face to watch whenever she interacts with the main cast or her fear of bugs. Pecorine and Kokkoro also has their own moments due to their personalities. As a mobile game adaptation, the overall art style actually looks polished. From the sunny beaches to the gourmet guild itself, everything looks convincing like it’s in a fantasy world. Even the food has its own unique style that’s made as eye catchy as possible. The weakest link would be Yuuki, our main protagonist. He’s the epitome of ordinary in Princess Connect.I decided to watch Princess Connect:Re Dive for one purpose but got exactly that: a simple, fun adventure about a group of goofballs. There’s no complex plot and it doesn’t take a genius to figure out our characters’ personalities. In fact, I do wish more fantasy adventures would be simple as this show.

This series doesn’t feel like a game adaption to me it feels more like a manga with how the story feels, usually that’s why game adaptations don’t work well sometimes because...the story is only suitable for a game but though I haven’t played the games myself (heard great things about it though) this series is simple to understand without feeling confused over things that can only be explained in a game formatBasically the story is simple a boy is falling from the sky (we figure out later his name is Yuuki) and he is said to be the fabled hero that’s going to save the world and he is greeted by an elf girl said to help him on his journey named Kokoro and she’s best girl, will explain later, and as events happen we meet the others of his party; Peccorine a very dumb but lovable girl with super strong powers and a monstrous appetite, and Karyl a tsundere cat girl with the power to control monsters these idiots join together and make a food guild where they will travel for the most delicious food. Simple but once you seen that anime you can see why it’s enjoyableCharacters (9): Now I’ve heard some people say they hate ones certain character but I see each character has their own charm. “Main Character” Yuuki is sent to the fantasy world as the hero but in reality he is really dumb because when entering this world he forgot all his memories and not just of himself but instead he can barely talk, hardly can tell what’s food and what’s not and has no strength really of his own, this brings many enjoyable scenes of Yuuki basically being the retarded puppy of the group because he’s useless but you love him anyway and he’s also used for rag doll moments like constantly getting beaten up by funny looking wolves or being eaten by sand monsters or even being dragged away as bait for a dragon...I personally find him hilarious.Kokoro is best girl simply because she’s adorable and her dedication to Yuuki believing he is a special hero is just precious, she also makes a face that resembles this look OxO and it’s great seeing her be the only sane one in the group.Pecorine is wonderful Genki girl with a heart of gold and a bottomless stomach, she’s also got insane powers that make her unbelievably strong so she should be considered the hero but she’s not because she’s to stupid to be a leader of sorts and she’s just of joy to watch.Karyl the cat girl, she took me and bit to like her but she grows on you with funny she is and how she’s the only one who questions the group on why they are all so stupid even though she kind of is as well, in the beginning she’s set up as a major villain but by episode 3 she becomes part of the gang of food loving idiotsArt (10): I’m not exaggerating when I say that the animation in this series is breathtaking and is not only consistent but it gives off a feel of Konosuba with all the explosions, character designs are also fun and very creative with everyone having their own colors palettes and they play off each other wellSound(7); Personally I love the OP but it’s nothing spectacular except for the animation part of it because it’s seriously very prettyEnjoyment (10): this series is very fun for me because this series is a very nice mix of wonderful action scenes to wonderful comedy and slice of life, now if you aren’t usually of fan of these series I suggest not checking it out only because I think some Shounen fan boys would rate this series low for stupid reasons as you can tell by the scoreOverall (9): Now I know this series in terms of story is nothing special but I believe that simple stories can work really well if everything else is good and in my opinion it’s really good I don’t know how the rest of the series will go so that’s why I’m not rating it 10/10 yet but in terms of enjoyment this series is 10/10 but I got to see how the rest of the series goes the story is only suitable for a game but though I haven’t played the games myself (heard great things about it though) this series is simple to understand without feeling confused over things that can only be explained in a game formatBasically the story is simple a boy is falling from the sky (we figure out later his name is Yuuki) and he is said to be the fabled hero that’s going to save the world and he is greeted by an elf girl said to help him on his journey named Kokoro and she’s best girl, will explain later, and as events happen we meet the others of his party; Peccorine a very dumb but lovable girl with super strong powers and a monstrous appetite, and Karyl a tsundere cat girl with the power to control monsters these idiots join together and make a food guild where they will travel for the most delicious food.

Of course you do, after all everyone had fun looking at the Kazuma troop. If so, Priconne is perfect for you! Welcome to the latest work by Konosuba director Takaomi Kanasaki!STORY:Have you ever lost your memory and can\'t remember anything? (Hangovers don\'t count here...) This is exactly what happened to our main character Yuuki, the poor boy can\'t remember anything. A super nice guy, but surely not the most clever one\'s and his actions are sometimes socially...you could call it ""unacceptable"". With the help of his ""servant"" Kokkoro, who always speaks to him very politely even in the ""master-form"", he finds...his way back to the normal everyday life slowly but surely. Together they meet new friends (Pecorine and Karyl) and found the guild with the best name ""Gourmet Edifice"", where even Gordon Ramsay would be jealous. Their main activities are finding new gourmet food, a dream of many of us that will come true for them. Besides that, they protect the people in the city from all kinds of danger. They really care about them. On their quest tour they also have to survive the one or the other dangerous adventures. Although there isn\'t anywhere a big EXPLOSION, the quests can be really hard sometimes and they have to take care. But luckily their discovered food stays intact even after the fights.CHARACTER:Each of the characters has their own charm, which is presented beautifully. They are all completely different, but still have a perfect harmony with each other. The close friendship between them can be clearly felt, they have fun and understand each other very well. Everyone of them has a different background story but in the end they still found each other. The troop really belongs together as one unit.Our main character may not be the smartest at the beginning, but he is very friendly and helpful. No matter if he has the skills to do it, he always tries to save his friends.His loyal companion and servant Kokkoro always keeps a cool head, she has a very calm and pleasant voice and even when the troops get into trouble, she stays calm and show her fear and apprehension only with her famous OxO expression.What would life be without good food? Then you would have no strength to do anything. Our always happy Princess Pecorine, who is also a great cook, has this attitude. She is always optimistic and in a good mood, she wants to make new friends and is able to cope even with dark-looking characters. Besides getting along with everyone, she is also a strong fighter and willing to do anything to protect the weaker.Last but not least, we must not forget the fourth Yuuki-Party member: Our Tsundere Neko Karyl, who has also a few hidden secrets. Nevertheless, it can be said that she feels very comfortable in the group, even if she questions one or the other action of the group.In addition to these main characters, we also experience many other members from other guilds. They are also very nice and friendly. They help each other and have fun together.ART:I have to refer to Konosuba again. At first sight, it immediately gives you that feeling. The beautiful landscape, the really cute characters, all animations are nice to look at. It is a festival of colors, many bright colors are used, which create a very pleasant feeling. The colorful and beautiful nature as it should be is presented here for us!SOUND:Although the music and lyrics do not highlight any special things, it is simply fun to listen to. The OP gives you the feeling that an adventure is coming, get prepared for it. Meanwhile, the ED music fits perfectly for resting after a hard long day. Get yourself an after work beer and make yourself comfy. You probably know the ED song of the first season of Konosuba ""Chiisana Boukensha"", if you enjoyed this relaxed music, you will definitely love this one as well.ENJOYMENT:I had a lot of fun watching Konosuba back then, so Princonne got directly my attention. There are so many parallels, you can see the similarities between those two. Just sit back, relax and watch our gourmet troop. Although I am not a big fan of action stuff, I even enjoyed the fight scenes here. The main part is comedy of course and this was very well brought over. Although I have no idea about the game itself, it was a lot of fun for me watching it.In the end I recommend this anime to everyone.

I love fantasy, magic and swords. So obviously I had to watch Princess Connect. It even has a high score in MAL.I don't understand how this sh*t has a better score than the average isekais. It's the worst and there is why:Story 1/10: Alright, so there is none. it's a comedy show. It should be but it's not funny. It might be fun for 8-14 years old kids to be fair. Konosuba is hilarious, Gintama too. But this, the level of the jokes is so low, it feels cringe. How to stop a cute dangerous enemy that everyone in...the group think it's a cute and kind ally ? One of the character will resolve this issue by eating it. The design of the monsters are made to make people laugh because they look retarded, like tongue out, big eyes one rlooking at the opposite at the other etc. It's very poor written.Art 7/10:Well it's beautiful, kawaii, full of color. As i said, the monsters looks dumb it really doesnt feel real like in Goblin Slayer or Hai to Gensou no Grimgar. So they don't look dangerous but weak.Sound 5/10:It's not really noticeable, it's ok.Character 2/10:The MC is the worst character ever written. He can't talk like a normal human being. He's useless. He's just OP because he has to since it's the MC. When I say he's OP, he doesnt even know. It's like very cliché. If his friends are in danger, he'll have the power to protect them. If they are not, he's weak. It's supposed to be funny or something. The others characters are not good either. They are very simple-minded. Like, it's painful to watch. And once again it's cliché, so they're going make fun of a cliché personality trait.Enjoyment 1/10:It makes me angry. You want to slap the MC, you want to tell them don't do that, do this instead. Please use your brain and think. Where is your education ? The comedy part is not enjoyable, amusing. You can see the joke coming miles away. To be honest it's depressing.Overall: I want to smash my head into a wall/10. the group think it's a cute and kind ally ? One of the character will resolve this issue by eating it.

If there\'s anything good about this now-famous mangaka, is that he can turn anything into a KonoSuba-like world, and Princess Connect Re:Dive, based on Cygames\'s repertoire of mobile games that are always a wholesome time to get invested into.To tell of a trivia on how this anime adaptation went through (if I remembered it somewhere in my memories): There was a time last year when the master comedy director himself wanted a KonoSuba-ish stylized fantasy world, whilst adding all the bells and whistles of what was left...out of KonoSuba into a new entity (after finishing the work for the anime and movie), and the opportunity presented itself when Cygames offered to make anime adaptation of this game in their in-house studio CygamesPictures, and he took it by chance to make it Isekai-like (but thankfully within the confines of KonoSuba), and both directed and scripted this show that\'s in my opinion, close-but-not-close much to said series, but in its own unique way that stands out a lot to ooze its own charm.Reading the story synopsis though, I\'d bet anyone who\'ve watched KonoSuba be like: ""Hey, doesn\'t this sound all too familiar? *proceeds to check the person directing this* Yeah, it\'s that one guy who made KonoSuba a masterpiece comedy!"", and you\'d be right....with a few exceptions. Yuuki the main ""protagonist"" isn\'t like Kazuma, the shallow, bird-brained and altruistic kind against someone who knows the ""tricks of the trade"" right from the start, and before you ask, YES, both boys have to find out the answers on their own, whilst others giving out parts of it in their own sweet time. Instead of being street-smart like Kazuma, Yuuki is that cliché dumb person who doesn\'t talk, and when he does, becomes a parrot instead. But the most important aspect: if he is the ""Hero"" to save the world, then ""save the world"" he must take full responsibility for. I can see some criticism for this character, but to be perfectly honest, his character I can dig for the fundamental dynamics of the show in all circumstances.Along the way, the characters to meet-and-greet the residing protagonist:Elf Kokkoro (or as catgirl Karyl would nickname her Koro-ster), for her simple charm of being thoughtful and caring like a mother would be to a wandering and lost child. Her dedication to Yuuki is simply unmatched to see him be a hero, and always that OxO face that gets me each and everytime.Pecorine the bubbly, energetic and enthusiastically OP girl, who knows no bounds at anything, eating, her magical powers, you name it, she has it all as the Jack of all trades. She\'s like Megumin, only more constricted to her abilities and plays wagers at almost everything to keep everything afloat in good spirits.Cat girl Karyl (who came from the Dark Side), she\'s a plain tsundere once you get used to her character, but she didn\'t start out that way. Being mentally disturbed and controlled by her ""Master"" as a tool to spy on Yuuki, she soon gets bamboozled in the actions of Pecorine, Kokkoro and Yuuki, and eventually joins their group of shenanigans. Altogether, these 4 people of 1 chad and 3 best waifus make up the Gourmet Guild, because the only plot in this show is to keep filling your stomach, non-stop.And not to mention, the other characters that make their cameos in the anime from the game itself, that\'s always a treat for the players of the game to exacerbate some excitement from the hardcore fans.It\'s not hard to say that I\'m a massive fan of Cygames\'s style of games, especially at the start of their mobile game adaptations (with P.A. Works\' Uma Musume: Pretty Derby, and the OK-ish Manaria Friends). And I\'d have to say, Princess Connect Re:Dive really shines the best when done at the company\'s in-house studio CygamesPictures, which are just plain nice, very vibrant and the best of all, the action scenes that are full of constant sakuga that never stops me drooling at how the visuals and artwork are really just well done throughout. Expecting more from Cygames and their mobile game adaptations done majestically.Even more, is the music, the impressive performances of the seiyuus and such: M.A.O for Pecorine, Miku Itou for Kokkoro and Rika Tachibana for Karyl. The OP is already a heartwarming banger in my book, and for a fun fact: it was actually released last year as part of an AMV (with sneak peaks on the anime when it was still in the works), which when I always go back to listen to the great song and basking in the great visuals, makes for a great throwback. Sad that the planned ED is different from the anime, but whatever, I\'ll take it for what it is for such a pleasant end.Overall, this was more than what I was expecting of a good anime adaptation based off a mobile game, this thoroughly exceeded my expectations a lot to throw my brain off and just watch a not-so-KonoSuba-ish in the flesh show that anyone can still enjoy to the fullest.Impressive work. One of the dark horses of the season if you\'d ask me. Total recommendation, that\'s for sure! out of KonoSuba into a new entity (after finishing the work for the anime and movie), and the opportunity presented itself when Cygames offered to make anime adaptation of this game in their in-house studio CygamesPictures, and he took it by chance to make it Isekai-like (but thankfully within the confines of KonoSuba), and both directed and scripted this show that\'s in my opinion, close-but-not-close much to said series, but in its own unique way that stands out a lot to ooze its own charm.Reading the story synopsis though, I\'d bet anyone who\'ve watched KonoSuba be like: ""Hey, doesn\'t this sound all too familiar? *proceeds to check the person directing this* Yeah, it\'s that one guy who made KonoSuba a masterpiece comedy!"", and you\'d be right....with a few exceptions.

One of the dark horses of the season if you\'d ask me. Total recommendation, that\'s for sure!', 'My English is not so good so please bear with me. First thing first, this is a list, my personal list of anime, so it won\'t be like an objective review but more like my personal notes for this particular anime. And since mal require scores to write review then please if you read this for a arbitration refer to this standard, scores to enjoyment.(3): Makes me bored(sometimes I just forget the series)(5): Normal(I just remember its weekly release)(7): Its unique/Its enjoyable(Usually the one that I watch weekly)(9): I love it(I\'m waiting its weekly release)Why no 0 and 10? Well 0 is reserve for series...that I drop even early or the one that I don\'t like, while 10 is for those rare series that I can re-watch many times.First I don\'t play the game this anime is based on nor I know it before so I\'m not a fan or something like that. This based on first 3 episodes. Okay so the story begin with a boy, he just wakes up in some space I guess with Ameth that says she can\'t guide him anymore because she need to be repaired first and instead sends another person to guide him, Ameth also hint that there is something wrong or there is a lie in the world and its like the boy is the one that supposed to solved it. Then she sends the boy to the world/land. Then we follow the one who will guide him which is Kokkoro and learn that Ameth is some sort of divine beings because Kokkoro is sent by her village elder according to oracle from Lady Ameth. We also learn the boy name is Yuuki after Kokkoro meet him, Yuuki is also doesn\'t remember anything like who he is or where he is or even what is money. They go to the capital city Landosol and later meet Pecorine which is very highly a princess and she is very strong like OP af, oh and Kokkoro is like a support role in game but with a lance so she can fight in close range but mainly use long range magic/support. Later we learn that Yuuki has some sort of OP buffing power which Kokkoro said its a Princess Knight, he still can\'t really fight thought. The 3 then meet another girl named Kyaru and she is likely want to assassinate Pecorine by her master\'s order, but later her master said to postponed it and say to observe her instead. The 4 of them then form a Gourmet Guild and begin their adventure.Okay as you can see the world setting is game-like fantasy and no the story is not dark. Yeah right, its not isekai, its our old beloved vanilla fantasy genre(yeay). Okay so what I love from this series is that this is something a good series should be which is not trying to be something else, it just it, its already it. From the start it settled to be not so serious, its relaxing, adorable and cute. The thing is, its not completely adorable and cute like those CGDCT where the story is there in last 2 or 3 episodes like for example Endroll, because the story is still somewhat relevant(later Yuuki remember a piece of his memories where its like some of his friends/comrades/party which all girls died while fighting something and of course the foreshadowing of more girls that seems like already know him in this world/land, oh and also Kyaru\'s master\'s objective).Animation is good(as in they animated scenes that should be animated instead of just still frame), art is good its vibrant colour match with its fantasy setting and I do for some odd reason remember KonoSuBa while watching this its like maybe they have the same vibe(but mostly same degree of enjoyment). As like CGDCT show each girls has their unique personality(Kokkoro is high tier waifu material there xd). Sound is good, I can feel the game aspects from the OST, VA is good in a sense they fit each girl\'s unique concept, OP ED is, well its not something that I will play repeatedly but its certainly not something that I will skip all the time.And yeah its kind of weird because Yuuki is hardly talk, he just ""un"" most of the time but after first episode(or some times) the realization will come itself that he is not the MC in the story, he is just side character with MC\'s power and role xd(I think its called titular).Lastly, will I recommend this to other people? Yes I will highly recommend this if you want something that actually good to watch regardless your personal preference. that I drop even early or the one that I don\'t like, while 10 is for those rare series that I can re-watch many times.First I don\'t play the game this anime is based on nor I know it before so I\'m not a fan or something like that.

They go to the capital city Landosol and later meet Pecorine which is very highly a princess and she is very strong like OP af, oh and Kokkoro is like a support role in game but with a lance so she can fight in close range but mainly use long range magic/support. Later we learn that Yuuki has some sort of OP buffing power which Kokkoro said its a Princess Knight, he still can\'t really fight thought. The 3 then meet another girl named Kyaru and she is likely want to assassinate Pecorine by her master\'s order, but later her master said to postponed it and say to observe her instead. The 4 of them then form a Gourmet Guild and begin their adventure.Okay as you can see the world setting is game-like fantasy and no the story is not dark. Yeah right, its not isekai, its our old beloved vanilla fantasy genre(yeay). Okay so what I love from this series is that this is something a good series should be which is not trying to be something else, it just it, its already it. From the start it settled to be not so serious, its relaxing, adorable and cute. The thing is, its not completely adorable and cute like those CGDCT where the story is there in last 2 or 3 episodes like for example Endroll, because the story is still somewhat relevant(later Yuuki remember a piece of his memories where its like some of his friends/comrades/party which all girls died while fighting something and of course the foreshadowing of more girls that seems like already know him in this world/land, oh and also Kyaru\'s master\'s objective).Animation is good(as in they animated scenes that should be animated instead of just still frame), art is good its vibrant colour match with its fantasy setting and I do for some odd reason remember KonoSuBa while watching this its like maybe they have the same vibe(but mostly same degree of enjoyment). As like CGDCT show each girls has their unique personality(Kokkoro is high tier waifu material there xd). Sound is good, I can feel the game aspects from the OST, VA is good in a sense they fit each girl\'s unique concept, OP ED is, well its not something that I will play repeatedly but its certainly not something that I will skip all the time.And yeah its kind of weird because Yuuki is hardly talk, he just ""un"" most of the time but after first episode(or some times) the realization will come itself that he is not the MC in the story, he is just side character with MC\'s power and role xd(I think its called titular).Lastly, will I recommend this to other people? Yes I will highly recommend this if you want something that actually good to watch regardless your personal preference.', ""This comedy isekai caught me by surprise a bit. I didn't expect too much from what I read but saw the director from Konosuba is attached to this anime so I gave it a shot. It's been funny, cheerful, cute, and a few unexpected elements. The animation quality is great along with cute character designs in the usual fantasy world. The male MC comes off to me as a parody of the same boring male MCs. The female characters have distinct personalities and designs. I'm sure some of them will waifus. I think the direction will simply be a fun show with cute anime girls....This fulfills my desire of seeing waifus, gaming aspects and comedy! This fulfills my desire of seeing waifus, gaming aspects and comedy!"", 'I didn\'t go into this show with the highest of hopes. I was bored, and looking for something to watch, and one of my friends recommended this show to me. He said that he was enjoying it, and that it was kind of like Konosuba, so I figured that I\'d give it a shot. I\'m a pretty big Konosuba fan, and generally trust this friend\'s judgment, so I decided to give it a shot.After watching the seven episodes that were available at the time of writing, I have come to the following conclusion:This show was made for someone; but I am *very much* not that...person.On the technical front, the show is outstanding. The world is beautiful, everything is bright and colorful, all of the characters look amazing and unique (more on this later), the voice acting is spot-on, and aside from the occasional decision to crank the bloom dial to 11 (which is one of the strangest visual decisions I\'ve ever seen, BTW), everything feels right for this world.Now on to the story; which unfortunately will take up the majority of my review, because I have the most to say about it:tl;dr: It\'s a confusing mess.Basically, Protag-kun falls out of the sky after having some vague, lofty conversation with some God(?) about something or other (uncover the truth... I can\'t join you yet... you have great power..., please rember..., etc.) only for him to fall out of the sky and be a literal infant. Like, he can\'t talk in complete sentences, he doesn\'t know how to fight, he tries to eat money, and so on. He literally only exists to create problems for the other main characters, and to occasionally activate his AOE buff when he remembers that it exists.The other main characters are better, but it isn\'t hard to be more competent than a toddler.The first one is a white-haired elf named Kokkoro who was sent(?) by the god(?) to help the protag not die (to literally everything). She calls him ""My Lord"", and is overall a pretty cute and charming character. Honestly, not much to say about this character. Good enough, as far as I\'m concerned.Next we meet Pecorine, who is totally not someone important, despite having a crown, a holy sword, and *a literal assassin* after her, definitely isn\'t important (so don\'t question it, okay?). She\'s OP as hell, is a savant at everything, and likes to eat food. Also, she\'s possibly stupider that baby-kun, somehow.Finally, we get Kyaru. The would-be magical assassin who is conveniently given a chance to join the party without turn-coating her original... Faction? Affiliation? God/religion? (I don\'t really know what word to use here). She\'s the token tsundere, plays the straight-man to Pecorine (kinda), and is also a catgirl. So that\'s cool, I guess.These four form a party/guild with the goal of... enjoying... food... together? Huh? Antics ensue... but not really? Kinda? What? Calling anything that happens a ""story"" or a ""plot"" may be a stretch, but progression is (theoretically) made, so...After about 3 episodes, it became evidently clear to me that I was missing something. Too much in this show either didn\'t make sense, or was otherwise brushed off, almost as if it were prior knowledge. Furthermore, almost every side character that we meet, even in passing, seemed to have incredibly detailed, main-character levels of design put into them.Then, as I picked up my phone to refresh the logistics timers for Girls Frontline - a waifu-collector gatcha game that I play - it all clicked. Perhaps with my newfound knowledge, I should restart my review.PRINCESS CONNECT! RE:DIVE is an anime made for a Japanese-only waifu-collector gatcha game of the same name developed by Cygames.

The protag in the show is (I assume) supposed to be the protag from the game, which is why he is such a personality-less harem-bait brainlet, and probably why Kokkoro calls him ""My Lord"" (read: Commander/Summoner/Doctor/Admiral).When you view the show through this lens, I can easily imagine myself giving this show an 8, 9, or even a perfect 10/10... had I been a fan of the game. Again: from a technical standpoint, it\'s really great, and the characters could be pretty interesting if I knew their actual backgrounds or personalities.I have not, however, played the game - and consequently - I don\'t *really* have a complete idea of what is going on, I don\'t *really* understand these characters, I don\'t *really* understand this world, and I have a feeling that none of that is going change as this show goes on.Maybe I\'ll keep watching, maybe I won\'t; and if things change, I\'ll be the first one to be here singing this show\'s praises.

Oops. My criticism still stands.', 'If anime was made in a factory, Princess Connect is the kind of product that would roll off the assembly line. The show is well presented and packaged very nicely, it has some excellent visuals, character designs and some flashy moments here and there to draw you in, but if you strip away the surface then you\'re left with something quite bland.Princess Connect is entering into the saturated market of fantasy-comedy anime without trying to do anything new. The plot and the comedy are all a bit safe, repetitive and dull. There\'s only so many times a stomach can rumble at an inopportune time...before the joke is no longer amusing. There is zero plot or interesting character moments, and instead they seem to be placing all their bets on minor, episodic, comedic skits. Unfortunately the especially weak ""comedy"" and lack of good characters or plot to fall back on, result in a bland and boring show. The characters are designed well and everything is pretty to look at but no one is particularly interesting to watch.If anime was conceptualized at a corporate level using graphs and spreadsheets, by men and women with no interest in the art-form - they might ask for; a comedy anime, in a fantasy setting, with a conveyor belt of forgettable waifu bait each episode. Throw in some cat-ears, some meme-able faces and a handful of overused character archetypes. They would then pass it down the line, and their factory would churn it out. It would be efficient, inoffensive and pass quality control, but there would be no heart in it. And that\'s kind of what we have here.It\'s a real shame. The animation is great and there\'s obviously some very talented animators that have worked on Princess Connect. I wanted to enjoy this one, even as some harmless seasonal fluff. Unfortunately, everything else is all too boring and predictable. The comedy is often repetitive and falls flat, and the overall experience isn\'t at all enjoyable. before the joke is no longer amusing.

Re:Dive. I think that this anime was actually pretty good.All in all, it feels just like a CGDCT fantasy where characters simply go around, do quests, eat and have fun. I've seen a lot of reviews saying that they hate the male protagonist but I don't see anything wrong with it. For me, he resembles a player. He gives off the aura of a low level player who simply boosts his princesses ( works like FGO Master enhancing their servants ) hence his presence was not even necessary. He's just there for the sake of it....To make the show more comical, perhaps relatable(?) and more entertaining. It's also not even a harem so if you're overly offended about a male being in a group of girls then don't worry.Very good. I enjoyed this a lot. I'm even considering switching from FGO to Princess Connect. Well. Haha. We'll see about that. It all depends on my x10 summon roll today.

There have been tiny pieces added on to the main story but it still seems to be a bit directionless. I think this could be one of the main turn offs for some people who are looking...for a show with a focused story progression.Another problem some people seem to have with the show is that the MC is too dumb/boring.I for one, extremely enjoy the MC because of how derpy he is. I haven\'t watched many animes with ""dumb"" MC characters, so this show is pretty refreshing for me. The way he acts and thinks is cute and especially funny when he interacts with his environment/other characters. I guess he is boring in the sense that he lacks a purpose or drive and instead he is just floating around in life (seems like he lost his memories, episode 1).Another thing I noticed that may be a problem for some people is that the MC is a bit like a side character because the other main characters are more active than he is. However I think the show does this tetra dynamic so well since all the main characters have a completely unique personality compared to one another and the way they interact with each other is like the characters in Konosuba but way more wholesome and nice. Speaking on of Konosuba, apparently the show shares the same director so their influence can be spotted with the art and comedy.The shows visuals I think are excellent. It displays vibrant and a colorful atmosphere. I especially love the way that the grass and water is animated (so satisfying to look at!)Overall, I would describe this anime (so far) as a ""cute fantasy slice of life comedy"" for a show with a focused story progression.Another problem some people seem to have with the show is that the MC is too dumb/boring.I for one, extremely enjoy the MC because of how derpy he is.

Our mc came from another world or so i belive but the story is for the beginning not that focused on the main character. which is kinda unusual. The story is now not the unordinariest thing but the fact that our mc doesnt have his memeory, i think could be a interessting point in a few episodes. But even if they dont focus onour mc we see in few scence a little part of...our mains memory.(oh boi this review is already bad)Maybe im not speaking for everyone but the fact that not every single character is after our main is such a good thing for me.Art (10)Ive seen so many animes with good art but losing so much qualities afterwards or in between but now at episode 4 the quality is still so good. Plus its not like in for example Violet Evergarden but every Frame is so cute and beautiful. The colors are vibrant and not boring which is a blessing for my eyes. And not just the characters but also backgrounds are detailed and good. Its a shame that this anime isnt as i know not that popular.Also usually you can always see whats going to move and what is not and was a little bit messy in my eyes but i didnt see many thinks like that.Sound (9)So im not a specialist in this catergory but i think the Quality of this anime is good. Also the Voices are so cute.Character (9)the character are so individually good. They arent boring they all have such cute character designs. You can see all their personalities in the design. well maybe ecxept the main. Also not everyone but they all have interesting backstories.Enjoyment (10)they are funny which is one point why i think this anime is great. Sometimes if they get serious in a fight they are so fuuny. You can always laugh in this anime. the Punchlines arent too sudden. There are some jokes that repeat like kokkoros face when our mc is just defeadet in the first scene in the fight (its cute and so hilarious)Overall(8)overall its an anime ill watch definitly again bc its funny but i dont think ill say its an 9.

Those type of anime at least got a 7 and you give this anime lower than that? i dont get it.For those of you expecting for a good laugh and just watch an anime with a chill vibe, you gonna love this. For those who are expecting this anime to have a good fighting scene with a overpowered main character and harem, well you better drop this from the start cause it will disappoint you. I...really loved comedy anime, at first i thought this gonna be some other poorly made classic RPG style anime but i was totally wrong this anime is really funny, it has good jokes and it is more than just cute girl doing cute things, there is slice of life moments, friendships and these girl are really doing silly funny things, it has deeper story than just cute girl doing cute things. The main character isnt some douchebag with power and surrounded by his harem, he is just some kid that forgets everything and cant do anything right, thats what makes it even funnier. really loved comedy anime, at first i thought this gonna be some other poorly made classic RPG style anime but i was totally wrong this anime is really funny, it has good jokes and it is more than just cute girl doing cute things, there is slice of life moments, friendships and these girl are really doing silly funny things, it has deeper story than just cute girl doing cute things.

But, that enjoyment is short-lived because as I continue watching this anime, I noticed that the protagonist is incredibly boring, stupid, and annoying at times.  The other characters in the anime are your average air headed type, which is fine for the anime if done with moderation.  However, the anime emphasized the airheaded nature of these characters too much.  Next for the story, I wanted to know why and how the protagonist got to transported to this world.  This reinforces the stigma...that a lot of isekai animes use isekai elements for plot convenience.  In addition, this is done poorly in this anime because the beginning of the anime does not show anything to explain how or why the protagonist got transported to the anime's world.  For example: did he die in his old world? , or did he gets summoned to the anime's world? that a lot of isekai animes use isekai elements for plot convenience.

For example: did he die in his old world? , or did he gets summoned to the anime's world?"", ""As a once avid player of the game, I was initially disillusioned when I heard that an anime adaptation was announced. The mobage itself employs the use of animated cutscenes frequently and is advertised heavily as being so. With the game being incredibly long as it is with a tedious and ultimately boring storyline to boot, I was expecting the worst when it came to this.Thankfully, the show adapts nearly nothing from the actual mobage. With the director of Konosuba at its helm, Priconne is honestly more of a spiritual successor of sorts to Konosuba, albeit less focused overall. The show is practically anime...original with only the characters and some vague character traits lifted from the original source material. Even the isekai aspect goes entirely unmentioned throughout the duration of the show, as the show provides a fine slice of life comedy every week.One of the things that surprised me about the show is how funny it can actually be. The comedy is well written in this, and while not the most high-brow or sophisticated work out there, it still never fails to make me laugh every week (barring the final episode, but I'll go into that later). While you may think the character bloat may diminish a lot of the scenes, the fact that only so few of their traits made it in, they practically become flanderized versions of themselves and ironically it contributes more to their likability and adds heavily to each scene's comedic value. And by flanderization, I really mean it. Kishi-kun for instance becomes a complete utter fool incapable of even basic social interactions, while Kyaru's tsundere traits are bumped up to max leading to her going hammy in almost every scene she's in. I just love it. Charles and Ikacchi really are the MVP of the show though, and I love all of their appearances the most.The plot is paper thin and hardly resembles the mobage it's based on, but even then it's pretty shallow and weak. The whole series concludes just as the plot is about to get interesting, and without a sequel being announced, it does add to the feeling of emptiness. That said I'd be remiss to say if the plot was any good. Which it most certainly isn't. Priconne excels at being a slice of life comedy, its attempts at seriousness comes across as total schlock. It's laughable at best, but frustrating and tedious at its worst (ie the final episode which provides almost no joy).Still despite this, Priconne was an absolute joy to sit through and I was deeply entertained each week by its presence. Even finding Ayumi hidden in each episode was a fun treat.7/10 original with only the characters and some vague character traits lifted from the original source material.

The art is great each environment feels fleshed out and really repersents the beauty of nature. The characters are pretty well written, the MC while not really a character acts as a running gag throughout the anime being a braindead bestboy. Pecorrine is adorably stupid getting her top 10 in waifus this season and kokkoro does a great strightman. Kyaru is a great tsundere too. The ost help with the atmosphere of the anime the opening and ending are ok not great but not bad....If your looking for a chill comedy this is a good show for the occasion.

Did COVID-19 make all MAL reviewers into SUPER-EDGE-LORD-69-WHO-CANNOT-HANDLE-NON-OP-MC?First thing first: Just sheer quality of this show puts this at least at 7.For those who have not watched it, PLEASE do give it a try.I\'ll try to summarize few points:1. Characters start somewhat ""extremely"" stereotypical. Like, the author really tried to do this. MC is extremely useless, and I mean this quite literally; he is basically a mannequin. Should this turn you off? No; I would say he is uniquely useless, unlike those wimpy OP kids. The girls in this anime are all extreme in their personality...as well. They aren\'t quite \'human-like\' qualities, but still feel organic none-the-less.2. Great animation and overall quality in general. What else can I say?3. Unique comedy style that will immediately remind you of Konosuba. And reasonably so, since we have a same director here. This could be a pro or a con depending on your taste in comedy.4. Story is quite painfully slow, but it seems like the main focus of the anime is in character dynamics and slice-of-life comedy. The world is very slowly revealed.5. If you played any sort of Visual Novel or such ""waifu game"" you can probably see that each of the female leads in this anime are very \'moe-fied\'. Each female characters are very adorable (in non-sexual way), but just like the comedy part, this could be a pro or a con depending on your taste.TL;DR: This is a more moe-fied version of Konosuba without Kazuma. Comedy is there, but less lewdness and more adorableness. If you are looking for an MC with strong charisma, this isn\'t it. But I would say he is a funny vegetable. as well.

We have several individual crazy personalities, bizarre and wacky character humor, amusing running gags, and several very appealing character relationships that add to the creaminess of it all.I didn\'t know the game before and only glanced at it afterward to see how similar the game and anime were. The concept is the same, but the anime is a bit different, which doesn\'t affect the quality...in any way. One thing I have to say is that I love that they actually used the main song from the game again as the intro song for both seasons to create an even stronger bond.Of course, it should be said that the anime seems very generic at first glance and the fact that the characters are 99% female doesn\'t make it any better. And also the actual main story keeps both seasons mainly in the background and is transmitted only fractionally. If you\'re looking for a great storyline or expect a huge background, you definitely won\'t find what you\'re looking for. 3/4 of each season consists of everyday episodes, fights, and pure comedy. But it also has massive stronger and not only thanks to the studio.[Story 4]The protagonist wakes up in a mysterious world with no memories of his old life, finds ""new"" comrades, and starts to enjoy his life to the fullest. In the course of the plot, you learn more and more fragments about the connection of the protagonist to this world and the truth that lies behind it. It is a slightly above-average plot, but nothing mind-blowing. To experience the full extent, you\'ll probably have to play the game.[Animations 9]The animations really made me stumped on this one. That SO much budget can actually go into an anime adaptation is beyond my comprehension.The lighting effects are almost permanently at their peak. The dynamics practically never let up. The backgrounds and details are impressively beautiful.Even in the most unnecessary scenes, immensely detailed work is delivered, so that one can only marvel as a viewer.[Characters 5]Completely average. You have some minimal backgrounds and a few monologues, otherwise, that\'s it. Also, most of the personalities are just old familiar stereotypes. BUT, here it comes! The characters are completely convincing on the basis of sympathy and charisma. Not only are they simply lovable, but they have excellent chemistry with each other and complete the dialogues and scenes as they should.Certainly, I would have liked more character depth or better backgrounds and ambitions. But what I got here more than satisfied me by far.Particularly positive to me is the protagonist Yuki (solely because I find him incredibly endearing) and Pecorine, who despite her demeanor and naiveté has been a very mature and adult person who prefers to talk out problems rather than allow them to escalate.[Music 9]The intro is relaxing and simple, it\'s not catchy and it\'s not a masterpiece. But it simply has a very inviting melody.And on the subject of relaxing, the outro is exactly what I want to see at the end. It shows smaller meaningless scenes from the characters\' everyday lives, with very good contrast and a piece of very inviting and relaxing music.The osts in the anime were very well placed and added a lot to the dynamic. And then we have the sound effects, as we know them from series like Fate and JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure. Nothing else can add as much weight to attacks as this kind of presentation. Every single punch, slash, and kick had such a force that you could even feel it on your back.[Conclusion 6]If you\'re looking for an anime that resembles Genshin Impact or KonoSuba and is more into comedy and likable everyday episodes, you\'ll more than find it here.The second season is slightly better than the first until the finale but drops off significantly at the end. Which makes the first season the better one, to my surprise.This series can be easily forgotten, but not the positive memories.[Enjoyment 8] in any way.

Re:Dive ever since it was released back in 2018 and I absolutely had a blast going through its magnificent storyline and set of characters. So when I first saw the anime adaptation getting announced, I was pretty excited to see it and it delivered pretty well.First off, the story. The anime\'s story (season 1) is entirely different from the game and it\'s a good thing. People who played the game and those who can understand what\'s going on are the ones who would most likely appreciate it but it can also be appreciated by...those who are still getting on to the series, especially if they give it a chance and time. The story revolves around Yuuki and his guild, Bishokuden and we see how they go about their daily lives as the anime introduces new characters with a bit of foreshadowing time to time. I\'m pretty sure the adaptation of the game is just meant to introduce the characters and the world of Astrum and that, they delivered nicely. It reminded me of KonoSuba more importantly and that makes it pretty enjoyable.For the art, I give it a hands down 10/10 simply because Cygames is very consistent with the great quality of art it has given both in the game and the anime itself.In regards to the voice acting, the voice actors and music are all pretty good. It is honestly what I loved about the series, seeing my favorite voice actors on almost all of the characters as I recognize their voices, and more importantly, they are the ones who sing the songs of this series so that is also a big plus.For the character, I am a tiny bit disappointed that there are too many characters they decided to introduce that average people might not remember easily. Aside from that, I am very happy with it, especially regarding the main character, Yuuki because I barely hear him speak in the game so hearing him talk a lot in the anime was very satisfying to hear.Overall, I think the anime adaptation of Princess Connect! Re:Dive is pretty good and I am very much more excited to see what they will show in the future given that Season 2 has been announced. I am urging people to give this anime a chance at least and not drop it immediately just because the characters are still being introduced and the plot isn\'t really anything ""special"", yet. I just believe getting to know the characters first is all part of Cygames\' plan. I\'ve been at the end of the road to know what comes in the future of this great series so I am confident to say you won\'t regret it. those who are still getting on to the series, especially if they give it a chance and time.

Re:Dive (2020)For a show again based off a game it really stayed true and conformed to its base.One thing that may confuse people is why the groups are so abundant and that is based on the game having a 5 member party limit generally. This is why it is understandable that guilds are so small. Some do affiliate to expand, however.The show itself is pretty damn good overall and brings a nice story and a great finale. It is also an absolute dream world, what could be better than such a world full of so many girls and for the most...part, they are all cute beyond belief. What an abundance.For this moment I will just say for me Eriko the fiend girl is my absolute waifu of the show. Let me have her for real.The story is let down until you understand the situation by the male protagonist Yuuki due to his memory loss. It later gets explained but it doesn't if I am honest to make him any better. For the most part, his being there could have been totally ignored.The art of the show is very Konosuba reminiscent due to it being from the same place pretty much and it is a high standard of goofy animation that is wonderful for the show. Magic, explosions and cute girls are all done to such a high standard.Characters come to a large collection and they are pretty much all very interesting.Yuuki, as explained, is very dull and lets the show down a bit. The exception to the interesting, I am sure he will be interesting should we see his full story. Also ep11 come on man don't be scared of best girl Eriko.Pecorine a fallen princess that is explained why in the show is very much an eater due to her accessories.Kokkoro an elf girl sent to look after Yuuki as her lord is extremely loyal and cute.Karyu a CAT GIRL who is wonderful and a TSUNDERE making her a pretty amazing character. She is very cute too in her actions.Aoi who is a lone elf girl generally is extremely cute in her search to make friends.Eriko my favourite from the fiend race is an obsessive girl (Yandere) but one that you would do what you need for her. The KuKuKu noise she makes is amazing.For the others, we have everything from lolis to girls dressed as animals like a cow all the way to beast girls and girl beasts. (Girl beast you will understand with one specific character) You get so much choice that everyone should be able to find someone.I would say from start to finish the show is very enjoyable. On one specific note in the finale, we see a user of transmutation that is always nice since it is much cooler than people let it sound usually. One thing I would love to have seen more of is Eriko but that is me since I could have an entire spin-off series with her.Like said the only let down is how they progress Yuuki which is a shame and it drops the show down.Hopefully, we get a second season.9/10. part, they are all cute beyond belief.

The plot doesn\'t make any sense- I don\'t feel as if there is a plot at all. I stand by my word. It\'s not a good show but I guess you\'d find this interesting if you played the game.Why do people like this. What\'s wrong with the world?It really doesn\'t deserve the ""high"" score. It\'s just a Chinese knockoff Konosuba but the main cast is dumbed down where their average mental age is 4.Story:Nothing is ever explained. It\'s probably just a generic isekai but there is a horrible lack of development. The plot is nonexistent....They don\'t even have the overdone ""truck-kun"" scenes. At least that would give some sort of narrative. Again, nothing is ever explained. Who is that initial girl? I don\'t know. Why are the characters there? I don\'t know. There is no backstory.Art:Generic, but quite cute I guess.Sound:Normal I guess? There weren\'t any standouts, but it wasn\'t bad?Character:Where do I even start. Cookie cutter characters. You can basically name any RPG trope and bam- new character. I wouldn\'t even nitpick this part if they breathed a bit of life into the characters but they\'re all just so boring. It\'s nothing I haven\'t seen before.The MC literally has 3 lines in the entire first episode. He knows how to say his own name, money is important, and some other meaningless line. He is mentally 3 years old and only knows how to grunt and \'ehe\'. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve seen such an unlikable MC.Enjoyment:Jokes were pretty bad. The characters aren\'t given enough time to develop so I couldn\'t get attached to them. It doesn\'t help that there\'s also no plot for me to get invested in.Overall,This is one of the worse isekais out there. Please do yourself a favor and watch something else.

This anime its just good to see for his good animation style, but not enough to be a 7,maybe not even a 6... i cant just watch it without being bored in the 90% of the...time...Im not used to write a review of any anime, usually i just enjoy them or drop them without any worry, but this case has been made me a little bit annoyed.maybe i just seach for something different.the point of the review is that i feel constantly that anime promises something that doesn't gives in any moment. time...Im not used to write a review of any anime, usually i just enjoy them or drop them without any worry, but this case has been made me a little bit annoyed.maybe i just seach for something different.the point of the review is that i feel constantly that anime promises something that doesn't gives in any moment."", 'I never knew something so good could come out from a mobile game. One of the most enjoyable animes I have seen up to now, plus the plot twist on the last chapter leaves a great cliffhanger. Every chapter leaves you with a great mix of emotions that really fulfills you. I found it glad to be a Konosuba resemble (both directed by the same person), as I really liked it, but never expected it could be THAT good. But it is.The story is quite entertaining, with strange but fun typical side missions we can found in a MMORPG that take us away from the...typical tension of a far, distant goal. Every side character is really cute and has its own unique personality, which makes it interesting to watch.The audiovisual level of this is masterpiece. The landscapes are perfect, every animation during battle looks really fresh and visual effects are stunning. Plus, OST is really great, and openings and endings asre great. Lost Princess, Soredemo Tomo, Connecting Happiness, and even Yes! Precious Harmony (which may appear in S2) are great songs, really enjoyableCharacters were completely amazing. We have Yuuki, a dumb but really light-hearted guy who always tries to help everyone, Kokkoro, a nice girl always caring and loving which would give anything to protect you and Karyl, a quite dumb and at first outnerving character, which developed really great and ended up being a great girl. All of them three are great, but Pecorine is the one who definitivelly steals the show. Me, a great fan of deredere type characters, couldn´t actually look anything else when she was on screen. She is that incrdibly affective, loving, sweet and energic girl that will always hug you if you need it. Sadly, as japanese culture is more closed, there are not enough of these characters in anime...I really liked this anime. I was about to give it an 8, but that last chapter was just unexpectedly sad. That Pecorine crying part got me really sad, but just after that it had a happy ending, with an incredible cliffhanger and the real plot revealed in the last chapter.

Re:Dive is the anime adaptation of an incredibly popular mobile game by CyGames and right from all those credentials LA was interested in this anime, BUT LA wasn\'t expecting the anime to take such a comedic approach to things akin to Last Period, but where Last Period was meta humor stemming form mobile game elements, Princess Connect! Re:Dive is PURE comedy through and through and with the director of KonoSuba, Takaomi Kanasaki, this anime was the perfect mix of great visual and verbal comedy whilst keeping to it\'s roots of it\'s source material in all manner of ways.Now...LA ha splayed the game but differing circumstances besides LA getting bored of Princess Connect! Re:Dive was the reasoning to why LA can\'t play it anymore but LA just wanted to say that LA has played the game this anime adaptation is based off and much like Granblue Fantasy before it, watching this anime made lA want to find ways of playing it again.*Ahem* with those details out of the way, onto story and characters, let\'s start off with the main cast shall we?Character-wise, it has an air of KonoSuba about it, well we have LA two favourite characters of Kyaru voiced by Rika Tachibana and Kokkoro voiced by Miku Ito, Kyaru as an agent from the villains of this anime to keep an eye on Pecorine voiced by M.A.O, the Princess of the Astraea but she more or less gets roped into Pecorine, Kokkoro and Yuuki\'s mess and becomes the minder to ALOT of the situations they get into, she\'s also a MASSIVE tsundere towards Pecorine due to her mission but the more the anime progresses, the more she opens up to Pecorine and the rets of the main cast. Kokkoro is just the purest maiden of this anime and the one that does the OxO face, she was sent out on a mission to get Yuuki\'s memories back as the chosen hero but hijinks ensues. Next is Pecorine, the aforementioned Princess and her main schitick is that she\'s LOVES food and is extremely powerful at that too but she wants to find new food to eat as that being her goal, latter on she forms the guild Gourmet Edifice with Kyaru, Yuuki and Kokkoro in order to achieve that. Finally we have our ""main protagonist"" an often aloof, sometimes silent protagonist who gets into all manners of trouble, namely wolves or monsters always eating him and him mainly being the ditz of the group. Yuuki IS supposedly suppose to represent ""us"" the player but he does have a touch of his own personality going into this anime but mainly LA can get a hold of him, like whether he\'s actually faking all this in order to gain sympathy (and get a harem) or whether meta-wise, Yuuki is SUPPOSE to be this ditzy for the sake of him losing his memories. Nonetheless this combination of characters and their wacky antics leads to so AMAZINGLY well done delivered punchlines, both visually and verbally with the character interactions.With that, the minor cast aren\'t bad either as many of the minor characters do get subtle or freeze frame bonuses before their actual introductions comes into play and working them into isolated episodes that sometimes intermingle with one another sometimes, you know like an actual lived in world. To this end, alot of the minor characters like Suzume and Saren gets more than an introductory episodes at times and we get to know them better. Now speaking in terms of game, LA wanted Nozomi to be in this anime and she DID (as she was LA\'s favourite character in the series), but because of this anime, more opened up to LA, such as Saren, Misato, Ames, Ilya, Shinobu and Yukari. Nonetheless because of Princess Connect: ReDive\'s semi-isolated plot structure nature, LA is glad that many of the minor characters do get their spotlight and aren\'t relegated to never appearing again after their introductory episodes.The comedy from the mind of KonoSuba\'s directors put both the visually and verbal comedy into play and works wonders for the characters, world building at that. Verbally, it made the main cast extremely likable and funny at that especially with the character jabbing interactions and wacky situations they get into (in a way sorta showing that especially for Kyaru that she likes being with them even with all her jabbing and tsukommi act), visually due to the animation, the execution on many of the visual gags were funny, even the running gas as they used them in great succession that the running gags became things you\'d WANT to keep seeing much the the OxO face among others. All in all you\'ll be getting TONS of laughs form the mind of KonoSuba and man it was a riot on how great in execution the comedy was and still is for Princess Connect: ReDive.The animation done by CyGamePcitures so another words the animation studio that HELMS the source material of this anime, so you KNOW the animation is in good hands, the animation is top notch with crisp to distinctly great production value across the board, from the visually great backgrounding and battles, the great comical reactions form the characters and really much like A1-Pictures and MAPPA toward Granblue giving it all the attention and quality assurance for it\'s animation, CyGamesPictures truly outdid themselves with the animation, LA has no words, the animation was AMAZINGLY done.The voice cast was amazing especially from the Gourmet Edifice. Though Yuuki voiced by Atsushi Abe (ohhh FUKOU DA indeed) has grunts or the occasional words coming from him, his cadence was nonetheless ""ok""...for the character he was portraying. The MVP\'s however easily goes to Rika Tachibana as the minder of Gourmet Edifice and resident tsundere of the cast and LA just loved ever time Kyaru SPOKE. Another MVP would go to Miku Ito as the pure maiden, soft spoken Kokkoro with finally M.A.O doing a great job as the bubbly yet slightly ditzy Pecorine. The rest of the minor cast were great in their roles as well, with some notable examples of Asami Imai as Yukari drawing in her inner Yuu Kobayashi, Kana Hanazawa as Aoi, an incredibly creepy cute of Eriko from Chinami Hashimoto, going from Nero Claudius to Sakura of Ilya from Sakura Tange. LA could go on, seriously this voice cast was stellar no wait, exceptionally excellent with amazing direction.Princess Connect Re:Dive is by the by, KonoSuba 2.0 if it had source material from a mobile game and this isn\'t knocking to either of them, LA genuinely had tons of laughs, fun, loved almost ALL the characters, both main and minor, loved the comedy with the great production value not only making it visually appealing but that worke din favour of both it\'s characters and comedy in tandem with one another. Princess Connect Re:Dive just gives you the entire comedic package and gives it out wholesale as to how great it is. Once again in a game perspective, LA WANTED TO GET BACK INTO THIS GAME, that\'s telling how great this anime and Princess Connect Re:Dive did it\'s job in not only advertising the game to you but you also had fun along the way and best yet, if you got attached to a character, no doubt you\'d be curious of the game. Princess Connect Re:Dive is by far and quite easily LA\'s favourite comedy anime of Spring 2020, maybe as strong contender for best anime of Spring 2020. Be it if your a fan of the game and want to see the game on the silver screen or your curious of all the memes of Princess Connect Re:Dive is about, you will not be disappointed and have tons of laughs along the way...it\'s a must watch.Karyl is Useless Goddess and LA loves her for that...Karyl Best Girl.

When I first started off the series I was confused and lost as I, admittedly, did not play the game or read up about it. Basically, I came here watching it completely fresh to everything other than my knowledge that it was...an isekai and it looked promising. First thing off the bat, the sound, animation, and music are amazing and I just couldn't help but bop to the beat and awe at the animations. The characters seemed quirky and adorable, and I mean almost all the characters, not just the mains. At first, I'll be honest, I was not too impressed at the MC, but along the way, I got used to it and it didn't really bother me as much anymore as I just enjoyed how the series was rising up. As I near the end, the heartfelt moments that develop sometimes and the messages that are portrayed really spoke to me and made me keep wanting to watch more. The next thing I knew, I checked off the next season of this anime to plan to watch already. Overall, some tears were shed, and amazing moments were brought upon, and the character development was smooth and interesting to witness throughout, the animation is spot on and beautiful, the music and sounds were simply music to my ears and I can't wait for the next season! an isekai and it looked promising.

The first couple episodes are a bit too silly for my taste, but don't give up on it yet, it gradually gets better. To me it counts as a fun chill anime, makes many good jokes (many plain ones too, but nothing cringy), the little fights it has aren't cheap. Visually this anime is ridiculously good imo, especially the first episode, but each and every of them are well-animated throughout, no recycled / still-standing pictures, no foul draws, it's just flawless, while keeping the usual anime-style ofc, which I...find important. My reason for writing this review is because I think it's way underrated with its 7.1 MAL score. I can tell a lot of effort was put into this anime and it paid off pretty well.

However, Princess Connect Re:Dive manages to pull off both very well.One of the biggest sticking points for this anime has to be its plot, which is VERY slow-paced. Most episodes are told in an episodic manner and we really don\'t get much plot until episode 10. Further, it focuses a lot more on slice-of-life than most other isekai anime do. While I wish the anime progressed the plot more in the slot it got, and we really need a season 2 to see just how good the plot\'s going...to be, I still very much enjoyed seeing the group dicking around and eating food, not to mention meeting the colorful supporting cast.I can see why Yuuki is a very polarizing character. He makes Aqua look useful as he\'s often a side character in his own anime. However, I still kinda like the way they portrayed the ""blank slate"" character archetype here. Instead of having him be a boring stoic, they make him basically a 17 year old toddler, speaking in sentence fragments 90% of the time. While this creates many hilarious moments where the girls have to save his ass from monsters, it also allows the stronger female cast to shine out even more and gives opportunities to see him gradually become less of a monster punching bag, which are quite satisfying.Speaking of the female cast, they are plentiful and, most importantly, have distinct character designs, which definitely comes from this being adapted from a gacha game. Pecorine, in particular, steals the show with her infectious personality and intriguing backstory, even though I, again, wish they delved into it more before episode 12.What definitely sets this apart is just how detailed this anime is, from the backgrounds to the animation. Fights don\'t come often, usually once per episode. But when they do, they\'re some of the most gorgeous fight scenes this side of Ufotable. They could have just phoned this in for a quick buck to promote the game, but they very obviously didn\'t.

I like to think of it as a Great Value Konosuba. While it never reached the heights that Konosuba did, you could definitely see the inspiration in its art, comedy and direction. In fact, the series director from Konosuba worked on the series as well. To save time, if you liked Konosuba, you’ll like this.Coming into the series, I had never heard of or played the game. The show did a decent enough job of setting the stage for the game’s world and story. It’s definitely another one of those anime trying to get you...to play the game type deals, but it works. After the first episode, I downloaded the game and have been hooked ever since.Plot wise, you’ve got your rather generic fantasy/isekai world with your standard adventurers guild and MC surrounded by cute girls. Nothing realy groundbreaking. The character interactions and comedy are really what carry the show and make it so good. Which is fine, not everything has to be Steins;Gate/Fate level writing.  One notable difference between this and other fantasy style shows is that the MC, at least in the beginning, is not super OP and actually relies on the female supports for most fights.As previously noted, characters are absolutely adorable, hilarious and will grow on you pretty quickly. The story doesn’t take itself too seriously, but manages to mix humour, wholesomeness and seriousness really well. With comedy anime, a big part of my enjoyment is based on whether or not the jokes land. I definitely would say the humour in this one was right up my alley and created a really enjoyable experience that I would recommend.Art is very bright and vibrant and reminds me a lot of Konosuba’s style which I found aesthetically pleasing. Animation and sound design during the few fights was surprisingly really good. Cygames actually put a really good effort in on the animation and for this type of show I must say, I was impressed.Priconne was certainly one of my favourite shows of the year and is a really relaxing and enjoyable watch.

It’s happy, full of adorable creatures, delicious food, and light-hearted adventures. It’s not trying to be profound, it’s about enjoying the moment. It brings you along to enjoy daily wild life with the Gourmet Guild. As someone who’s always stressed and doesn’t want shows adding to my stress, this is exactly the kind of thing I look for. And it was fun! Also I love food anime/manga, and food is a core element of Princess Connect.Neither the story nor the characters are complex, but they’re lively and always doing interesting or funny shenanigans on screen....Its source material is actually an app game, but it’s not a cash grab.

When I first watched it I didn't know that this was an adaptation of the game. And usually adaptations of games are bad, but this one is an exception. They really managed to make the game into an anime that is really worth watching.From the overall story, I think it's good, because it shows a complete story but can be presented casually as a slice of life. And one thing I really like is how they turn a few trivia into a really fun comedy. Just like Konosuba and I'm so grateful to be able to get a story...like that again.In terms of art, this anime is very similar to Konosuba, from the characters, buildings, scenery, and magic. And the same advantage as konosuba is that they can show a lot of behavior and cuteness of the character very well. They succeeded in making each character more unique and memorable.From the sound and music, this anime is really good at demonstrating every scene with suitable music. Like Konosuba, this anime has a good intro, outro, and background music. And also in the sound effect, it is very similar to Konosuba. Even though it's similar, thanks to that, I really enjoy watching this anime without getting bored.In terms of character, I think each character has its own uniqueness that is easy to remember. Some characters do look simple but their uniqueness makes their characters unforgettable.

At the same time, I kinda piss off for people not understanding how and why the story goes.PRECAUTIONS, if u are reading this, u are ready to know something important about this anime and the game. I...will spoil some of them but this will help you understand what anime has shown.987654321Firstly, the reason why the MC was so useless and can't be able to talk. He was reincarnated as the same person without any previous memory and he is 17 years old but as a 1-year-old child mind, that's why he can only know how to speak less like erm or good. You will wonder how is he reincarnated, you can found out when u start their game.Secondly, the princess in the anime looks like op and one-shot monster, the reason why is the main character has the power to buff the princess another word is giving princess more power to one-shot monsters. Don't ask why because that's beyond the spoiler.Third, this is a story where how MC reincarnated, begins his journey, and create a guild with three girls, Kokkoro, Pecorine, and Kyaru.Lastly, please don't give any shit review and bring a misunderstanding to people who haven't watch yet. This is an anime where MC reincarnated with a 1-year-old mind that can hardly know anything but his name, If u think this is funny, try to play the game then u realize u are the main character with a 1-year-old mind but have the power to give a buff to the princess who is trying to protect u.

Sure, in the beginning it starts off as a typical isekai type anime harem thing, but it's not actually a harem because they're all just friends and the main character has brain trauma. Everyone seems to think that's a bad thing, too, but I think the way he emotes with his body instead of his words actually adds to his charm! The animation is actually really impressive too, way better than your typical cash grab isekai anime. It seems like the animators actually...put passion into making this project. The ending also answers enough questions to leave me satisfied but leaves more than enough to make me look forward to season 2. This is not to say that this anime is the best ever or that everyone will like it, but by the end it turns into something genuinely interesting and fun, even if the first part of the series doesn't give that impression at all. put passion into making this project.

Until the MC meets another 2 girls (who we know absolutely nothing about) his ""sisters"" who only appeared in the episode for a short time. Basically what i\'m saying is, their wasting time on random filler parts instead of progressing the story or developing the characters, we still know nothing about the MC and why...he\'s so special nor do we know anything about the girls, there\'s no character development anywhere in the show. My point is, STOP THROWING IN NEW CHARACTERS WITH NO BACKSTORY, epsiode 13 was a great example, they just throw abunch of mysterious characters in and don\'t tell us anything about themThe story was dreadful, the whole show had no thrill at all, there was nothing special about the anime whatsoever. The MC was naturally Overpowered, he didn\'t have to work for his powers at all, the action is horrible, most of the episodes are fillers and there is barely any story progression.It\'s below average by far, the animation was the only good thing about it, the characters were average and the MC is so bad i couldn\'t put it into words, the whole show is just a disaster, it\'s like they didn\'t know what direction they were going in so instead they just made 90% of the episode something random and then the other 10% was story.The show really wasted it\'s potential, it could\'ve been a really great anime if the story was more direct and not as many filler parts and the art was above average by far but the characters and the story was like they took scenes from other animes they thought were good and tried to cluster them all together which turned into a fail cause we never knew which direction the anime was going in.Spoiler part: Am i supposed to feel good about the ending? We still know absolutely nothing about the MC, nor do we know anything about the girls introduced, we haven\'t gotten rid of the evil white haired girl, Pecorine\'s parent\'s still don\'t remember her, do i even need to go on?

THis is based of a Gacha Game if i\'m not mistaken, I\'ve not played it but I have seen some gameplay so with that in mind here\'s my review. The game does not really have the mc talk much tho to be fair to this show.Story-7The whole isekai genre is saturated with these kinds of stories, person gets isekai\'d has to save the world etc... however what makes this somewhat unique is that the MC literally lost everything he knew and I mean EVERYTHING. It has Konosuba vibes which is a good/bad thing depending on you.However compared to other Isekai...the story is very chill, I would rather just see them have fun and mess around than fight bad guys. It\'s great if you want to relax yourself especially with everything going on right now.Art-10For an Anime based around a game with cute characters it would be a travesty if they did not do justice in this department. The art is great it\'s colorful,vibrant. The characters are  c u t e they\'re greatly designed, it\'s perfect eyecandy for anyone. It\'s basically a reskinned version of Konosuba\'s universe this has led to some pretty memable moments of the show.Sound-8I don\'t really have any problems in the sound department but because this show is a chill one, i like that they use sound to strengthen the mood.Character-10They\'re unique. Every character is different from the rest. There\'s a waifu for everyone in this anime. the worst character from this show is the MC but he has this ""must protect"" vibe because of his cluelessness for the majority of the time. The main cast are quirky and have great chemistry with each other. The other guilds are also shown and given ample airtime to for more waifu overload. All in all the show has great and cute characters.Enjoyment- 8I think the best description for the show is a Slice of life isekai. Rather than the fight scenes or the tension I just want to see them mess around and enjoy their day much like Konosuba. They both give off similar vibes however Konosuba relies more on dark humor of it\'s character\'s. With that said I enjoy watching this show, The great chemistry,cute artstyle, and overall chill plot make it a good to watch in order to calm down.Overall-8People can talk trash about the MC and such but tbh though he doesn\'t need to change he has perfect chemistry with his guild I think he\'s the perfect kind of MC for the show the story is very chill, I would rather just see them have fun and mess around than fight bad guys.

Filler sometime can be enjoyable but too much make me feel sick and bored af....now now, I understand this anime is an adaptation from rpg mobile game and also aware that the main objective is to attract viewers to play the actual game but won\'t it be interesting if they actually put an effort to add some plots for example *spoiler alert* like fricking tell me about these princesses power system...like how they get it? are they born with it?..well from ep 3 I know that the catgirl was bestowed upon her the power from some sort of (cult/evil organization?) well that quite interesting...and what are they supposed to be? hero? adventurer? what more confusing is even villain has this power.That\'s not all,the anime was tagged with action, adventure and fantasy...there is no slice of life in it...but the anime started to drift to that side..like why the hell are they starting to make a guild that main purpose is to find the cuisine and best food like wth...look you have been chosen/bestowed to have great power and with great power come great responsibility...but they take the world so lightly..the girl that has immense strength that supposedly use her power to protect the kingdom or even the world itself chose to work as a part timer at a restaurant!? They just do whatever the hell they want;they only fight monster if it appear in front of their frickin eyes and then say something like ..""I will protect this kingdom and shit""..like dude, what a joke...where\'s the responsibility.. Argh man,this is so sad, at least put comedy in the genre...I\'m so disappointed.Don\'t let me get started on the mc....Ohh this shit giving me a headache... well first of all I like the relationship between the mc and the his servent. It\'s super sweet and cute...but dude, he\'s literally aqua in kazuma\'s body...well not really since he\'s more usefull than aqua...well about the mc..look I know he has amnesia and shit...but will he ever regain his memory...and that another thing to worry about cause we don\'t know if the author is kind enough to take that path..like what?will he suddenly become cliche op in the last ep or something?. Well that\'s to be expected for a non long running anime ofc...lastly the good things about this anime is that it has good sakuga in my opinion...the joke in this anime is the reason I keep watching cause it\'s so unexpected like konosuba and not cliche.........I love this anime and I don\'t want it to turn into shithole..I\'m praying for the plot to get better :-(  If the plots is superb I believe this anime can go even further....I mean if I\'m the game developer, wouldn\'t it be a win win situation if both the game and series can be successful ....""if you\'re not sure whether your project will be successful or not, just give it all you got, then accept the result no matter how bad it is bc we human never stop learning""...I heard that line from my prof and it make me feel at ease ;-) like how they get it? are they born with it?..well from ep 3 I know that the catgirl was bestowed upon her the power from some sort of (cult/evil organization?) well that quite interesting...and what are they supposed to be? hero? adventurer? what more confusing is even villain has this power.That\'s not all,the anime was tagged with action, adventure and fantasy...there is no slice of life in it...but the anime started to drift to that side..like why the hell are they starting to make a guild that main purpose is to find the cuisine and best food like wth...look you have been chosen/bestowed to have great power and with great power come great responsibility...but they take the world so lightly..the girl that has immense strength that supposedly use her power to protect the kingdom or even the world itself chose to work as a part timer at a restaurant!?

It's like Konosuba but with a touching story and the MC is extremely quiet. I'm not sure why, but people complain about his quietness, so that quirk may not be to your liking? But for me I'm into it. He doesn't play a huge role and it lets the other characters get quite the development. Karyl's character development was the only one I was a bit iffy on but I've come to kinda understand her situation. However every other character in the show you'll love.The art style is insanely good, like it's serious...eye candy. The animation is fluid as heck and there's never a frame that didn't get full attention to detail. It's the studio's style and I see they've come to perfect it.The reviews on this site don't do it justice. They'll give an anime like this a 7 then give an anime like Oregairu with such slow character development it'll make you fall asleep a star more? It makes no sense. I'm not even ever the one to talk about character development until now and even I realize how slow that anime is. This is far superior. eye candy.

If you've played the game you will enjoy these cameos of characters who are well designed and have some great moments. The story shifts to and from the main story and thus episodes sometimes feel a little out of order and messes up the pacing a little.Art: 10/10Art style in one word: beautiful.Animations in one word: fluid...Fights scenes in one word: dazzlingSound: 10/10I don't need to say much here; the music, the sound effects and the character voices are outstanding.

It does affect some scenes but it can be chalked off as part of the comedy. The other main characters are all fantastic though. Some of the other characters are only really cameos which is a shame, as it would've been nice to see some more scene time for some of them and maybe have more of an impact on the complete story.Enjoyment: 9/10I found myself laughing at some of the moments in the series, it did start off by giving me Konosuba vibes. Those moments really made the series feel more of a comedy, however there are some shifts in the story and it moves towards a more serious story with odd episodes of comedy leading to the finale.Overall: 9/10I really, really enjoyed the show and found myself wanting to watch the latest episode every week. I've even taken the time to try out the game, which also has some fantastic animations and sounds.If you want an anime you can watch, without focusing too hard and enjoy some silly humour then I'd recommend this.

Caught me off-guard this season!Basically, if you enjoyed Konosuba at least a little bit, you will enjoy this EVEN MORE. I enjoyed this so much, everything in this anime was just right. Konosuba did its own things right to convey what it wanted to be and what the show portrayed, and this anime does that as well, in its own way.To begin with, I believe our main star of the show is Pecorine - the best girl I've come across so far. Pretty much the most likable character that I couldn't stop enjoying. Having a friend like that in real-life - can...you imagine? Absolute madness! (in a good way) She has all of that energy and warmth, or so it seems.A good thing to note is that the lord Yuuki's guide - Kokkoro-sama - actually is being voiced by the same person who voiced Schwi in NGNL:Zero and Shiro in NGNL. That is very great to hear her in this show, even despite the fact that her voice, at least for me, didn't really blend in with the rest, it felt monotonous for me, but it did convey the character well - the modest, honest, heartwarming Kokkoro. Might be just me though.I would like to point out one thing I couldn't overlook throughout the whole show - Kokkoro's character, at certain points, had absolutely strange face proportions which I couldn't comprehend. No idea why it is like that, but it always caught my attention (and you might notice it as well).The animation is absolutely great. The fight scenes are very good, even the little fights or simple victories look stunning and manage to amaze you, maintain your attention and make the impression that it was... SOMETHING. Something bigger than just a simple strike.The story is... well, another... story. some details are hard to understand due to the lack of information in certain parts (some of the information can be hypothesized). That might be due to the fact that this is based on a mobile game, so I believe it is aimed more towards the people who already have played or know about the game. It is not that big of a deal though. Of course, I had to read some of the information in order to understand what is the deal with the whole world and what is happening, but fortunately, none of that information affected my enjoyment nor did it really spoil anything. If anything, there isn't much difference rather than just your own curiosity - are you satisfied with what you learnt, or you want to understand the whole picture in more detail? That is basically that.Either way, the pace was great, I enjoyed every moment of this great show, it kept me interested, every battle had me hooked and the characters always intrigued me with their motives, secrets, behavior, actions and ideas. They are all a fun, friendly and loyal bunch who were bound by fate. By fate they cannot avoid.By the way, the OP is amazing, especially the beginning - all that J A Z Z ! Absolutely flabbergasting. you imagine? Absolute madness!

Yet, even with the seemingly abrupt start and finish, this show is still a worthwhile story on its own. The animation is beyond spectacular and the outro song has the same vibes as Chiisana Boukensha from Konosuba. Overall, I'm giving it a 10 because of how little I expected from this at first, but was completely blown away by just how good this is. Granted, this will not crack the list...of Top Animes Ever, but it is still a gem nonetheless. of Top Animes Ever, but it is still a gem nonetheless."", ""The story isn't clear, I agree. But the last few absolutely stepped up it's game. Well to be honest, the story might jump around a bit. But at least it's heartwarming and wholesome. It's basically just reverse Konosuba. The animation is very good, well Cygames tend to have good animations for their games anyway. So that's not a big surprise. To be honest, I didn't really like the opening song. But in the end it sort of stuck with me. Let's be honest here, you know the protagonist is literal hot trash. Nah but really, gotta see the original. But the girls are great. I...really enjoyed this series, maybe cause I played the game. really enjoyed this series, maybe cause I played the game."", ""As a mobile game adaptation, I think it did well. I never played the mobile game so I can't say much, but this anime was pretty good. If you like Konosuba, this is like a more relaxed and not as crazy Konosuba. The story follows our group of four in their crazy, food-filled, adventures. The animation is good and resembles the Konosuba and at times looks amazing. The food looks amazing, that's the only way I can put it. The Characters feel interesting, but can be repetitive at times. I enjoyed this entire series and had to slow myself down so I don't wear myself...out. Though there was the comedy most the time, there was an underlying story that I wish was explored a little bit more, and the last episode seems rushed.

Yeah I think this anime is not even close to konosuba and will never be, but I guess I'm going to continue watching this(just because I want to see how it ends), I hope there are any improvement to the story. comedy that I find funny is the  two thieves from episode 1 and 2 like heck, that afro guy got his hair pulled off.So...

The characters are adorable, the food in the show looks incredible, it's just a nice feel good show. Although the plot is kind of thin, the show makes up for it in enjoyable characters and giving the audience the ability to have fun with these characters rather than needing them to save the world. There are some comparisons to Konosuba, but I honestly don't think it really compares because I found the characters in this show a lot more likable and the humor much funnier than the slapstick and fanservice comedy of Konosuba,...but that's just personal taste. I would probably compare it more to something like Little Witch Academia which focuses on the smaller things that make up the lives of characters in the fantasy world. I know this probably isn't for everyone, but for those who want a nice wholesome anime, I say look no further. but that's just personal taste.

I haven’t played the game and look at this as an anime only. This may look a bit like Konosuba and that is right, because it is the same director. Don’t expect deep plot reveals or character development as this anime has more the purpose of comedy and luring people into the game. This is my full review. TL:DR at the end.*** most light spoilers come from the first 2 episodes ***---- EYE CANDY ----What makes me mad is...the quality of the animation. This insane highly detailed anime has quality animation that most modern anime could use. I’m mad because the story telling or plot is so bad and nonexistent that I feel that the animation budget for this anime is just misused on this. At least the whalers got a good looking adaptation from Princess Connect Re:Dive.If you take some time to analyze the frames you see that there is a lot to look at. The detailing of nature and textures in general feels very “premium” for some reason. Aesthetically this anime is pleasing. Most of the characters look like main characters what makes the anime look very lively and vibrant. To add to this good list, the CG looks very good. The water, enemies and attacks looks absolutely amazing.The design of weapons is also done very alluring and the animation for magic circles and explosions is done so smooth that I want to see more action. All in all this world looks lively and magical and does its job to impress the viewer.---- STORY/PLOT ----So in the first episode were set up with “mc has lost his memories and need to regain his powers” and there is a cute little loli to help him. No questions asked. Literally none. So were left quite in the dark what the main objective is or what the purpose of his quest actually is. You could argue that the mc has to find his powers trough adventures and friendship, but that is told so unclear that I assume that it isn’t the main focus. When you gradually watch this you get thrown off by some plot elements. There are practically two things going on what had to be actually one. I think this would be a huge success if Princess Connect Re:Dive focused totally on questing and their guild OR on their guild and the dangers looming in the world. The quests taken however give a good balance between plot distraction and animation showcase.Sadly some episodes later I’m right. A goofy bakadere is introduced and oh man I wonder if she might be of royalty. There is absolutely no clue this airhead might bear real importance to the mc. Absolutely none. I mean, even the standard peasants have never seen her. Crowns are worn for fashion purpose only. Okay, all sarcasm aside, I think making characters THAT oblivious is a fault. If you factor in the sub plot with the queen, it is very confusing. At the end of the anime I know exactly as much when I started it.Monsters attack from left and right and it is revealed that it is the work of the last member of our seemingly dysfunctional starter squad. Is she bad? Is she good? She might be just a tsundere neko. Anyways, she easily swayed by a bright smile and some food, joins the gang to. It gives such a weird message to deliberately show us that she is bad and then she joins them anyway because it looks fun? While her character could go way deeper, it doesn’t. And that feels like a total bummer. She feels like she was meant to drive forth the plot but got subjected to the comedy aspect of this show.So my point is that this anime has severe lack of good plot writing. The scenes are giving contradicting messages of what this anime is supposed to be. A serious anime about power and friendship? Just magical slice of life cooking? Comedy guild? I don’t know. It has no excuse to put all the money into animation and let story writing out and let it go away with it as it is a “comedy” anime. The amount of naivety from the characters is something that might annoy you if you\'re looking for something “deep” to watch. Let all hopes go and just turn your brain and anticipation off as this anime offer zero plot engagement. This is a no-brainer-good-looking anime.---- CHARACTERS ----This is very much a character driven show. You would expect that the characters are well written and have lots and lots of personality treats. Well sadly no. The characters are interesting to watch as a whole but lack as individuals. Their reactions are predictable and most of their characteristics can be summed up in one sentence. They can only act as a team in order to deliver the jokes. The character development that is done feels not satisfying. The pay-off is little and the amount of hardship/work done for it doesn’t feel much. But somehow, they still manage to look interesting as a whole.Yuuki our “mc”. He is the side character of his own show. While he isn’t the standard awkward holy messiah we often see he isn’t very proactive either. He has some unique quirkiness I’ve never seen before. Having this cheesy reactions from time to time makes me wonder if he actually has some brain activity. His amnesia feels like a total turn off as he is not a character that explores or unlocks his power under stress. Not a run off the mill character and (not) yet a punching bag. Interesting yet hellish boring delivered. You can say he balance out Pecorine excess energy. Probably is going to be misunderstood by seasoned or new viewers.Kokoro is a mysterious character. While we see that she is sent out to serve Yuuki we get no information for what about or why. Her past is completely left to our imagination. She acts like a guide but then fails to give us enough information about the underlying world or situation. Her soft personality is soothing to look at and her OxO face is adorable. The only reason she might be in this is for the fanservice, because other than that I don’t really see her purpose. Other than a comedy factor she is a victim of lackluster story writing.Pecorine is an airhead so naïve it makes me want to cry. She is bright, she shines, she is hungry, she is strong, she is just, but oh man she is so damn gullible. The amount of naivety is so hurtful that you might wonder if she has some common sense. But because she is so bright and cheering I have some mixed feelings about her. She is annoying to see but also funny.Karyl is such an oddball. Is she supposed to be bad or good? Well she is a bit of both. She boast the personality of a tsundere, and not very subtly. A bit harsh and a bit sweet. Her lack of background however makes a bit awkward about why she helps Pecorine. Other than being a plot device which throw random messages, she is very cute.---- THOUHGHTS ----Well at first I thought this was a Konosuba rip off with the characters and jokes and I was not far off the mark when I learned that the same director worked on this project. The animation is stunningly beautiful and the characters are fun to watch. There is a lot of humor but don’t expect a serious plot or good character development. This anime is focused on world building and lighthearted slap stick humor. It doesn’t reward the viewer with good plot twists or excellent world building. It is simply entertaining and pretty.It set itself up for a second season with the amount that is left open. I feel almost any character which is encountered in the first season all makes a grand comeback in the second season. I really hope shit will go down then, otherwise it is just wasted potential.I would recommend this if you like Konosuba or no-brainers in general. the quality of the animation.

It at least attempts to write characters that are dynamic and do more than stick to one pattern of behavior because of the role they\'re supposed to play. At the end of the day, it\'s an adaptation of a gacha game, but it\'s leagues better than Granblue\'s adaptation because of the comedic genius of a director injecting humor and life into every scene.Yes, the MC is boring, but only because he\'s supposed to be a parody of the, ""You\'re the chosen one, now start grinding your way up from lvl...1 you pleb,"" trope common to these sorts of game franchises. The unfettered, blind devotion from Kokkoro, despite having plenty of reason to doubt her supposed calling, sort of subtly calls out how silly these cookie-cutter archetypes can be. The story is slow to develop and nigh non-existent by episode five, but in reality you\'re coming to watch these characters interact and get up to Konosuba-esque shenanigans. It\'s not as impactful, but it\'s a good substitute while we wait with baited breath for news of a Season 3. 1 you pleb,"" trope common to these sorts of game franchises.

I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the story, the opening, and the anime as a whole. This is definitely worth a watch and I am hoping we will see a return of this sometime soon. I thought it was just going to be some cliche and boring anime, but it genuinely had a lot of substance and left me wanting more and more. It has so many elements of common tropes but executes them so well, and I appreciate it so much....If you're needing something a little more relaxed, a little more fun, however, a little more than meets the eye, this anime is for you! If you're needing something a little more relaxed, a little more fun, however, a little more than meets the eye, this anime is for you!"", 'THIS CONTAIN SOME SPOILERSNot gonna lie, this anime is very relaxing. This is the type of anime that is best watched during a rainy night. Few people might not like it and tell it\'s boring, but if you are looking for an anime that is easy to watch and just want to take their time off of the intense animes or you just want to watch anime waifus then this might be worth giving a shot.Story: 7Yuuki falls from the sky unconscious with no memories other than his name. When I say ""no memories"" I mean it. He doesn\'t remember how to speak, nor does...he know how the world works. Because of this, Kokkoro, an elf girl, is tasked to be his guide. Together, they meet Pecorine who is an energetic human girl. She seems to be always hungry, but she is skilled at fighting. And on the next day, the three of them meet Karyl who is a catgirl skilled in magic with tsundere behavior. The four of them made bonds with each other, so they established a guild called ""Gourmet\'s Guild."" They decided to explore different parts of the world in search of exquisite food.That is pretty much how the story goes. The plot is not that big. Tho they also get to meet new friends as well as foes, solving each problem along the way. It also shows character\'s backstories and struggles which is interesting once you get attached to them. I think it\'s interesting to discover every character\'s goals and struggles and how will they overcome them. The comedy is funny and cute which is one of the things I love about the show. I love how they can be cute dumbheads at times. There are lots of wholesome moments as well, like the one where Pecorine and Kokkoro hug during an emotional moment. I can hardly find any big flaws in the story. But one thing that I found that could\'ve been done better was the part where the villain starts making its moves. I feel like they could\'ve thought of something better than sending a bunch of shadows that kidnaps people. But overall, the story is great and I can\'t wait to watch the next parts of it.Art/Animation: 9The art is also something to admire. The character designs are very diverse and unique, from elves to beasts, it is nice to see different concepts for each character. The colors of the character designs are pleasing to the eye. The colors suit the setting very well. The set of colors combined with the grassland sceneries is a great mix. The animations and CGI are great, considering it was animated by a video game studio. The effects of their magic and powers are like as of a game.Sound: 8There aren\'t any serious flaws about the voice acting that takes away the enjoyment from the show. The voices fit well with its characters and personalities. The background music fits very well with the scenes because it enhances every moment. The sound effects sound magical. I like the opening and I didn\'t skip a single one. Though it\'s not like those openings where it\'s catchy, but I\'m pretty sure you will like it as well.Characters: 10Finally, the characters, this is one of the reasons why I really enjoyed this show. It is very entertaining to watch their little skits every episode. Let\'s start with Yuuki. It didn\'t take a while for me to like him. Quite a few people are saying that he\'s pointless and maybe because he always relies on his friends all the time, but that\'s clearly the point of the story which he gets better as it goes on. Moving on with that, We can actually see lots of good moments from him thanks to his memory loss. He gets in trouble every time and he doesn\'t even know what to do so the girls have to rescue him. It\'s cute to watch him being taken care of by the group. He\'s really trying his best even tho he\'s doing things incorrectly. He improves himself day by day to not be a burden to the group. It\'s heartwarming to see him do his best to help his friends.Kokkoro, one of the cutest characters, from the way she calls Yuuki to her face when she gets surprised and her mouth turns into like a cat\'s butthole. She also cares for Yuuki and her friends and you can see it by the things she does for them. She is always polite to everyone she talks with. Honestly, you can never ask for a much better guide than Kokkoro.Pecorine, also one of the best characters because of his lively personality. She always brings joy to every scene that she is in. Her dumbness adds to how cute and funny she is. You will definitely love her expressions. I love the idea about her powers which comes from her shoulder guard. It improves her physical abilities but in exchange drains her energy, which explains why she eats lots and lots of food.Another character is Karyl who is originally sided with the villain and is tasked to spy on Pecorine. She has great character development because even though she is sided with the antagonist the bond that is made between her and her friends made her choose them over the villain. It was honestly one of the touching things in the show. She is the one that always opposes the crazy ideas of the group but will eventually join in. Her cat features make her cute and lovable. The gang wouldn\'t be complete without Karyl.The side characters also add to the show. One that I like was the brothers. Together with Pecorine, their skits become more funny and entertaining to watch. Also, there are lots of waifus to choose from. All of them are lovable as well.Enjoyment: 10If you are into animes that are relaxing to watch where the story is easy to take in then you will definitely enjoy this. I really enjoyed this show despite not having a big plot. It\'s not actually a ""must watch anime"" but it\'ll be worth giving it a shot.Overall: 8Overall, the show is great. The characters are the ones that I really like in the show. The story went well even tho the plot was simple. The plot was good enough for me but if it has a much more interesting plot I would give it a 10. I wish to see the next parts of it. he know how the world works.

The story is nothing special but it's decent enoughit's a nice small Iseki anime. "", ""The story is fair, they are pretty funny since it's a comedy and behind the story, there are lessons to teach how to be a good person.The quality of the art is very good, looks vibrant and lively.The male MC looks more like a supporting character because he lost his memory.This anime targeted for 'soft-hearted' people so for people who like violence, hurting and killing each other type of anime won't like this anime at all. Yes, there is violence in this anime but in the funniest way.Overall, this is a very good anime to relieve the stress and forget the chaotic in real life...we are living in right now for a moment. we are living in right now for a moment."", ""WARNING! VERY BIASED REVIEW!I've been waiting for this anime once they announced its release. I love Priconne Re:Dive, it's one of my favorite games. However, while I was playing I didn't know much about Yuuki since he's just a stand-in character for you to play as... but I'm so happy with how he is portrayed in the anime. I usually don't watch isekais because usually the protagonist is an arrogant asshole but Yuuki is just dumb. It's the loveable kind of dumb. He's cute. I'm also glad the anime isn't trying to force in fanservice/love interests as much as others... with, of course, the exception...of Eriko... but that's just her personality. The artwork and animation of the characters is good but I've always found it to be like a thin drawing (like a sketch or something) if that makes sense. I love all the characters and I can't wait for my favorite guild to appear later in the show. I hope this anime becomes popular so everyone can enjoy the wonders of Priconne Re:Dive! I wonder if they'll get 2 seasons... of Eriko... but that's just her personality.

I wonder if they'll get 2 seasons..."", 'Princess Connect! Re:Dive is an anime that initially, wasn\'t on my radar at all and It didn\'t seem like it was something I would be interested in. I gave the first episode a chance on a whim after a cut of animation in the first PV caught my eye. What I then stumbled across is what has become a surprise hit for me this season.The story follows the adventures of a group of four friends Yuuki, Kokkoro, Kyaru and Pecorine. The tone of the show for about 75% of the show is a slice of life with elements of light comedy as we watch the...group try to put together their guild and all the hilarious problems they come across along the way. It is the comedy that is one of two things that hooked me onto the series as it was in a style that I enjoy. After looking up who was directing Princess Connect! Re:Dive, it turns out it was Takaomi Kanasaki who was the also the director on the Konosuba series so it made sense to me why I was enjoying Princess Connect! as much as I had been. While I was having a great time with the show, there wasn\'t any strong semblance of an actual story until the last quarter of the show where we start to see hints about what\'s going on with Yuuki and also Pecorine\'s backstory becomes a focal point here as well. Strangely enough, I started to feel like ""Oh so this is where it\'s all going to get started from"" even though there were only a couple episodes left from the end of the season. By the end, not a lot gets resolved but it wrapped up in a way that made sense given the tone of the show and I left the final episode feeling extremely satisfied.I mentioned earlier that there were two things that hooked me on Princess Connect! Re:Dive, the second of those two things being the art and animation of the show. So many times I would end up thinking to myself ""There is no way a show like this should be looking as good as it does"" while watching the episodes. The art style is very vibrant and colorful, the character designs were also well done in my opinion. There was use of 3D animation here and there but it never felt too jarring for me. The animation surprised me the most definitely. For example whenever it became time for Pecorine to defeat something for a quest the group was undertaking, you would expect it would just be a couple simple swings of the sword and that would be the end of that but it is in these instances that we would get a little something more than you would be expecting. Other times I would notice the animation is when it came to some of the interactions between characters. So many times there would be these little things done to make the characters feel more expressive and I appreciate the show for this.Speaking of characaters, the cast of Princess Connect! Re:Dive isn\'t too shabby. At first the mute male protagonist feels nothing more than comic relief but as the show progresses I grew to like him more and more. Kokkoro is probably the most stable individual in the group. Maybe she would be too plain all on her own but within that group of friends she\'s a great fit. With Kyaru, the tsundere cat-eared girl of the group, we witness the most character turmoil from for most of show as she struggles with the inner-conflict between having to complete her mission and realizing she enjoying the company of her guild-mates more and more as the days past by. Then there is Pecorine, the bubbly personality that kind of naturally just pulls everyone around her at her pace but there is something more to her that she\'s not willing to share with the rest of the group. The show also has a colorful cast of side characters which really helped the comedy of Princess Connect! and I always looked forward to what was going to happen next whenever they reappeared on screen.Overall I had a great time with Princess Connect! Re:Dive, far more of a great time than I thought I would have. For an adaptation of a mobile game I had no prior knowledge, an excellent job has been done and I hope that at some point there is a continuation for it in the form of another season for the show! group try to put together their guild and all the hilarious problems they come across along the way.

Re:Dive, it turns out it was Takaomi Kanasaki who was the also the director on the Konosuba series so it made sense to me why I was enjoying Princess Connect! as much as I had been. While I was having a great time with the show, there wasn\'t any strong semblance of an actual story until the last quarter of the show where we start to see hints about what\'s going on with Yuuki and also Pecorine\'s backstory becomes a focal point here as well. Strangely enough, I started to feel like ""Oh so this is where it\'s all going to get started from"" even though there were only a couple episodes left from the end of the season. By the end, not a lot gets resolved but it wrapped up in a way that made sense given the tone of the show and I left the final episode feeling extremely satisfied.I mentioned earlier that there were two things that hooked me on Princess Connect! Re:Dive, the second of those two things being the art and animation of the show. So many times I would end up thinking to myself ""There is no way a show like this should be looking as good as it does"" while watching the episodes. The art style is very vibrant and colorful, the character designs were also well done in my opinion. There was use of 3D animation here and there but it never felt too jarring for me. The animation surprised me the most definitely. For example whenever it became time for Pecorine to defeat something for a quest the group was undertaking, you would expect it would just be a couple simple swings of the sword and that would be the end of that but it is in these instances that we would get a little something more than you would be expecting. Other times I would notice the animation is when it came to some of the interactions between characters. So many times there would be these little things done to make the characters feel more expressive and I appreciate the show for this.Speaking of characaters, the cast of Princess Connect! Re:Dive isn\'t too shabby. At first the mute male protagonist feels nothing more than comic relief but as the show progresses I grew to like him more and more. Kokkoro is probably the most stable individual in the group. Maybe she would be too plain all on her own but within that group of friends she\'s a great fit. With Kyaru, the tsundere cat-eared girl of the group, we witness the most character turmoil from for most of show as she struggles with the inner-conflict between having to complete her mission and realizing she enjoying the company of her guild-mates more and more as the days past by. Then there is Pecorine, the bubbly personality that kind of naturally just pulls everyone around her at her pace but there is something more to her that she\'s not willing to share with the rest of the group. The show also has a colorful cast of side characters which really helped the comedy of Princess Connect! and I always looked forward to what was going to happen next whenever they reappeared on screen.Overall I had a great time with Princess Connect! Re:Dive, far more of a great time than I thought I would have. For an adaptation of a mobile game I had no prior knowledge, an excellent job has been done and I hope that at some point there is a continuation for it in the form of another season for the show!', 'I went in just for the Cat-girl, I came out loving all of them!I was surprised by how much I would enjoy this anime. If I were to briefly describe it:It\'s like KonoSuba, but less Kazuma, and more Best Girls.Each Best Girl has their own charm that makes me wish there was an English version of the mobile game just to build my own harem. If not from the main 3, it would be from the selection of side characters.Now what I do want to address is the PROTAGONIST, yes you all hate him. But say what you will, I appreciate his comedic relief as...a PARODY. He was never supposed to be a character you loved right off the bat, otherwise, he would take away focus from the main aspect of the anime and source material. It\'s all about the waifus. So while his incompetence is hard to like, his running gag started to grow on me, and by the end he wasn\'t as inssuferable.Overall it\'s pretty good for being adapted from a mobile game & a good watch for anyone who likes the Fantasy or Isekai genres.

It is a show that I cannot recommend enough. Yes it still has it's flaws and I could make a long winded review, but this is MAL.

The anime has fantasy elements, some occasional action scenes, and it has this episodic story, self contained elements to it hence the adventure tag.BUT, its far more similar to the likes of a slice of life, comedy and fantasy, with adventure and action themes in the background.The characters and their interactions are very lighthearted and wholesome, I would argue its much more similar to a slice of life setting than an action adventure...anime.If you enjoy that kind of thing, then this IS a solid 7 to 9.The direction so far has been good, and it has everything that makes slice of life anime great while not being boring at all.There apparently IS a story element to this, but you can honestly start watching without caring about that element that much. The rest of the anime is just fun on its own right.So my recommendation? Just watch it as if it were a lighthearted comedy and there you, that's all you need. anime.If you enjoy that kind of thing, then this IS a solid 7 to 9.The direction so far has been good, and it has everything that makes slice of life anime great while not being boring at all.There apparently IS a story element to this, but you can honestly start watching without caring about that element that much.

I could rewatch dat shizz on a loop the same way my old roommate leeched off my parents\' Netflix account to fulfill his dream of eternally rewatching the Office until the day he kicks the bucket (ironically, this dude was Japanese, go figure!). Despite the series sharing the same director, I was put off from starting Princess Connect by its mediocre average user rating on MAL, and it\'s this very reason that I feel I should set the record straight so that others like myself might give this show a chance.After seeing a grand total of...three episodes the glaring similarities to KonoSuba are apparent from minute one. The story of a young man sent to a fantasy world by a goddess and accompanied by three girls should sound familiar and is most certainly NOT a gimmick to lure in the male demographic to watch.The background art and scenery design look really alike. They might as well be in the town in KonoSuba, but wait! What\'s this?! The roofs in the Princess Connect town are sharp and pointy! That seems to be the biggest difference that I can find so far, but I don\'t really care if it\'s a ripoff cuz it\'s still nice to look at. Even the theme songs were somewhat alike. Both shows begin with an upbeat, pop opening theme and finish with a more laid-back, rustic ending theme. Fun fact, the endings in both shows are dope and I hella recommend, ya dig?Now considering how close in style Princess Connect is to KonoSuba, most of it\'s flaws could be seen to stem from a comparison of the two. Unfortunately, the two most frequently used words to criticize this show in negative reviews are not necessarily inaccurate: boring and bland.Honestly, while I like this show, I totally get where these people are coming from. The MC is almost nonexistent; the show might as well have just the three main girls as the MCs. As a bonus, however, we also have Ikacchi and Charlie who have me busting a gut every time they have a line solely because their VAs had roles in KonoSuba. Especially mah boi Charlie. Ah Charlie, that rascal!Also, even though Princess Connect has that KonoSuba abrupt, 180-development-surprise humor, some of the jokes have been directly reused without much difference. It\'s a little disappointing, but overall I would still say the humor is a plus for this show, and I still find it funny and entertaining.BUT!! Let\'s get down to business here. There\'s really one big reason why people continue to watch this and why you reading this review should put on some pants and go give it a try.

Which sounds very nice.But. It. Isn‘t.Princess connect Re Dive is not like Konosuba.And it is not chill.I suspect that at least some of those reviewers who compare this show to Konosuba have seen only the first episode. Because...after the first episode I also thought this is a bit like Konosuba. Kinda fun and chill. But that holds true only for the first episode.The following contains some very minor spoilers.Before I go into detail, why Princess Connect is NOT „like Konosuba, but chill“ let me say that I have no qualms with the MMC (male main character). Sent to that world by a goddess, he lost all his memory except for his name: Yuki. But this is not (just) a cheap tool of the writers to skip on his backstory or personality like in other Isekai shows but also a tool for some funny moments. Yuki getting beaten up easily in a fight because he also forgot how to fight, or given a piece of gold when hungry he tries to eat it because he forgot commonplace knowledge like how to buy food with gold as well. Fun little moments.Granted, he is a stupid potatoe. But I think that‘s a great jab at all those generic bland clueless goody-two-shoes Isekai protagonists with no personality whatsoever !!! It‘s hilarious !Also with this nearly non-existent MCC there is so much more spotlight time for the harem – I mean potential waifus – I mean female main characters to shine! Except… they don‘t. Here presents itself one weakness of Princess Connect Re Dive. The stars of the show, the 3 girls our MMC gets to know quickly and forms a guild with, don‘t shine bright but are just bland and generic. None of those girls is interesting; so comparing them to the group of quirky but likeable misfits from Konosuba is a bit insulting.Girl number one is Kokkoro, sent by the goddess to guide Yuki. She wants to protect Yuki and yearns to find friendship and form close relations with other people. A nice but bland servantile character. Her strong point is her facial expression when seeing something shocking and unexpected like helpless Yuki being dragged away by monsters. Precious funny moments but not enough to make her an interesting character.Then there is Xena the warrior princess, I mean Pecorine the OP swordfighter girl. She is the typical cheerful bubbly enthusiastic but as well naive and too trusting girl. She is also a glutton. Never seen that trope before….. BUT there is also a teeny-tiny bit of mystery surrounding her, with her wearing a mysterious tiara shining when she uses her superpowers (or whatever) or her fancy mysterious surely-not-important sword given to her by her father who is surely also not important or the assassin sent to kill her. But thanks to the extremely skillfully storytelling you will reach episode 7 (which is as far as I am now btw) without realizing you haven‘t even been told her real name ONCE which is surely also not important and only know the nickname Pecorine given by Kokkoro. Mindblowing. But don‘t worry those mysteries are never mentioned by her companions because one is a stupid potatoe, the other a servant who would never bother asking troubling questions and the third the assassin sent to kill her.Which brings us to girl number 3 : Kyaru the mysterious sorceress secretly affiliated with the villain faction and a troubled past. First tasked to kill Pecorine then that was changed to observing her. Because reasons. Hence why Kyaru joins their guild and slowly warms up to them.And with this group exactly lies another reason that Princess connect is not like Konosuba. In Konosuba you have the group of 4 that become fast friends going together through thick and thin.The group of 4 in Princess Connect does not share this bond but is divided by mysteries and other loyalties. So it is not as wholesome as Konosuba.Something disappointing of this show is the introduction of other potentially interesting characters which appear just for a short moment and then are forgotten. Maybe in the end when the villains make their final big move they all come to lend our protags their help because they have once spoken to each other on the street or something. Just a theory, I‘m right now at episode 7 of 13. Or maybe they don‘t appear again at all. Maybe those characters are pure fanservice to those who played the game but have no relevance for those who don‘t.  I don't know. A lot of unused (read: wasted) potential here in my opinion.The biggest issue I have with the comparison Princess Connect – Konosuba is in regards to consistency. Konosuba is consistently a funny over-the-top show where even the few half-serious moments have a humerous undertone with a wink. Konosuba is start-to-end a fun light-hearted relaxing show.Princess Connect does not keep that tone from start to end. It does have drama and it wants to be serious at times. That is not chill.Such change of tone in and of itself is not bad. Other shows used a change in tone to its full advantage, like Made in Abyss.  But for me it was unnerving because I had the expectation of it being relaxing like Konosuba and therefore didn‘t want drama and mystery and seriousness half-heartedly mixed in. That is why I want to emphasize not to compare this show to Konosuba.If you stay away from those expectations you can find here an average show to binge or even a nice and entertaining Isekai/Fantasy show for you.

I can pretty say that it did a...pretty decent job doing the side quest of the story aside from focusing entirely on the solving the mystery about yuuki's loss memories which becomes a good build up and foundation in order to reach its conclusion for season 1.Art: Oh boi the art is so beatiful. its like an upscale from the game itself.Sound: The OST are great. The OP and ED are also good but not that great.Character: I love every characters in this Anime, the four main characters have different traits with each other but they when  it comes to food they all sync up.

There are even a few points where I was surprised by the SFX quality. Most character designs are fairly unique and not super out of place in the setting.The Negatives: All I will say is if you wanted to watch something with a story that makes sense and doesn\'t have you talking/yelling at the screen in irritation... maybe choose a different anime. The opening plot starts off strong but is quickly subverted by a subplot that would be better as a single episode background gag.Final Thoughts: There\'s much better fantasy...anime out there and I\'m sad we\'re still getting good ideas like this made poorly in the name of ""pumping something out so we rake in that Isekai Money"". anime out there and I\'m sad we\'re still getting good ideas like this made poorly in the name of ""pumping something out so we rake in that Isekai Money"".', 'Light-hearted show with a good mix of comedy and beauty topped with a secret but minor whip cream of serious lore.

My rating of the anime above mainly tells most of what I think about the show itself.1. Princess Connect! Re:Dive - Lost Princesshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foImVnHpZDII will be rating this intro on three different criteria:-Musicality (out of 15)-Visuals (out of ten)-How it relates to the actual show (out of ten)Musicality -14- This show has a beautiful theme. It blends jazz and pop into an incredibly upbeat and happy intro. The lyrics do a good job of capturing one of the main themes of the show with the line,...""Ah, every time I am reborn, I search for the layered warmth . . . I want to spend ordinary, but lovely every days"". This line drives in the point that Yuuki is most likely a standard isekai protagonist who was summoned to defeat an evil demon lord or some evil cult, but (partly due to his amnesia) chooses to spend his days in peace with the Gourmet Guild. Overall, it\'s a beautiful intro with a talented singer, band, and composer behind it.Visuals -10- If I\'m gonna be honest, this is definitely the most visually appealing anime and intro this season. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the animation is beautiful. I also want to mention how creative and appealing the character designs are. Even background characters only appear for one or two scenes in the show get their own unique design and style. Overall its a beautiful show, and with an even better intro.How it relates to the actual show -8- This show does a pretty good job of having an intro that relates to the actual show. The fight with the desert lizard is actually explained, and has a point to establish one theme of how the Gourment Guild spends most of their time fighting monsters for food ingredients. It\'s certainly a step up from other intros that just use fight scenes for no reason. I also liked how they showed some of the main characters\' personalities, like when Yuuki got eaten and Kokkoro making the trademark OxO face, but I feel that they could have done a better job of showing Karyl\'s personality. I also think they did a good job of writing the lyrics, as I said earlier in the Musicality section. While i do like that tye gave all of the background characters some attention, I feel like they could have made that a bit shorter to give the main four some more time to express themselves. Overall, while it is a little lacking in metaphors, and allusion to some of the themes of the show, this theme does tie nicely back to the actual show.Final Score: 32/35 ""Ah, every time I am reborn, I search for the layered warmth . . .

One big complaint I have is the main male (definitely not the main character) which I still don't understand the reasoning behind making him a 4 year old inside the body of a teenager, it was a big plot characteristic but, I would have preferred it to be a normal dude, I know that in a world of endless Isekai shows something different is nice but it came to an expense of the overall entertainment.It's a fun show, if you're down and want to have a good time I would definitely recommend it but, there are shows that do the same to a much better level, so much beautiful girls are a joy to the eye but if you plan to watch a interesting show you'll be kind of disappointed, overall I give it a 6/10 be so deep you need to watch it a hundred times to get Evey single detail, some pure wholesome fun is always nice but, a progression in the story is really important and a big selling point whenever a show is to be remembered.The art is beautiful as expected by watching the names of all the people involved, pretty much the reason I did not dropped it all of the characters are so cute especially if you're into some monster girl thing.The OP scene was ok, we get a glance at the majority of the characters and the music is as cute as the show itself but, it didn't really got me moving or anything, the closing scene was kind of a let down I had to skipped it most of the times.The characters are definitely another big selling point to this show, they are all cute and the voice acting is also pretty nice, by far my favorite was the Neko main girl which felt like she stole the spotlight of the protagonist.

After watching it, I got exactly what I expected - a lot of waifus , some stupid antics and minimal to no plot development.Story-wise, it is clear from the get-go that this isn't the focus of the anime. Sure there are hints regarding the pasts of the characters and indeed there were some scenes, particularly in the last episode that attempted to expound some character arcs, but nothing that really allowed you to really know and understand the characters themselves and their motives.This lack of...understanding between the viewer and the characters, was to me, the weakest part of Princess Dive. You have these interesting character designs, particularly the waifus, but there is not really enough substance that allows you to really love or hate these characters. Instead, you simply admire the characters based on how cute they are, and nothing more.The comedy, although not as spectacular as some of the other shows this season was alright - it was neither too boring and generic nor was it excellent.Overall, Princess Dive is the type of anime that you pick up when you just wanna put your brain to ease and simply watch something visually appealing, with just the right amount of humor to keep you invested, but not addicted.

Well done art, decent animation, OK jokes from time to time, a nice easygoing fantasy setting. But the story is horribly predictable, filled with cringe cliches we have seen done better hundreds of times. And yet even that could be...forgiven if the character cast had any personality. They don\'t. Princess connect has some of the most stale characters I have seen in an anime for a long time. There really is no way to emphasize how horrifyingly cliche and boring they are. There is nothing about any of them that stands out. This absolute failure creates a massive problem: Princess connect is essentially just Konosuba, but replace the wacky cast of interesting and relatable characters from Konosuba with the most boring and generic cast imaginable. Instead of Kazuma\'s selfish, fun, and unpredictable personality, we get a super generic nice guy self insert MC Marty-Stu with absolutely no self agency to speak of. Instead of Aquas multiple faceted ego, we get a total doormat female sidekick that checks all the boxes of amateurishly written generic puppydog sidekick who only serves a role of blind support and absolutely nothing else.In conclusion, Princess connect is an OK anime if you turn your brain off, but dreadfully boring otherwise. It makes for good ""background anime""( IE: anime that you have on a second monitor while doing something else ) due to the nearly nonexistent easy-to-follow plot and decent visuals. But it doesn\'t really have any real value beyond this.Verdict: Hard pass on this trash. There are better things to do with your time. forgiven if the character cast had any personality. They don\'t.

Instead of Aquas multiple faceted ego, we get a total doormat female sidekick that checks all the boxes of amateurishly written generic puppydog sidekick who only serves a role of blind support and absolutely nothing else.In conclusion, Princess connect is an OK anime if you turn your brain off, but dreadfully boring otherwise. It makes for good ""background anime""( IE: anime that you have on a second monitor while doing something else ) due to the nearly nonexistent easy-to-follow plot and decent visuals. But it doesn\'t really have any real value beyond this.Verdict: Hard pass on this trash. There are better things to do with your time.', 'I have never written a review of an anime before and I don\'t know if I will again. I can\'t believe that Princess Connect! Re:Dive, of all things, is the work that I felt I absolutely had to speak about, but here we are.First of all, I have not played the game this anime is based off of, so I could be completely off-base, but from a cursory exploration of the game wiki, this seems like an adaptation that had very little interest in its source material. This is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.One of the things you\'ll probably notice is that...there\'s very little isekai in this isekai anime. The protagonist has total amnesia, so his past in the real world doesn\'t affect his motivations, knowledge or beliefs. On top of this, he was already in the fantasy world of the story before he had amnesia, and lost his memory after having an epic fantasy battle. A backstory like ""the protagonist got trapped in a video game, then did epic heroic fantasy stuff, then got amnesia and forgot all of this, then had new tangentially related fantasy adventures"" is the kind of thing I\'ve seen western comic writers create for minor superheroes when they\'re trying to cobble together the four separate backstories imagined by four different writers in four different comic runs into something cohesive. The fact that this is (according to the game wiki) taking place in a video game is never mentioned in the series. It is only mentioned once, in a brief scene where the protagonist is shown to be able to write in Japanese, that this an isekai. It may affect plots of future seasons, but it does not affect the plot of this season at all. In fact, it detracts from it. Princess Connect! Re:Dive spends most of its episodes introducing new characters and showcasing their goals, dreams, and relationships. Some of the characters have backstories and connections with each other that go back to when they were children. If every character in the story is trapped in an MMO, then are characters who remember being in this world since they were children AIs, and thus not subject to the central problem in the show? Are they roleplaying? Are their memories artificial? Any way you look at it, having the world and history that shapes the characters lives and personalities be fake trivializes any issues the characters go through in that world. After all, when they wake up none of it will matter. This may be resolved in the game\'s plot, I have no idea. But for the anime, which focuses so heavily on making a world as lived-in and versimilitudinous as a fantasy world based on roleplaying logic can be, a twist of ""Surprise! None of this mattered!"" would be massively tonally jarring. And I\'ve been reading the Black Butler manga monthly for ten years, so I have a high tolerance for tonal dissonance.The lack of isekai-ness extends to our protagonist Yuuki, who has a bad case of generic isekai/harem protagonist face. Generally the purpose of these genres is wish fulfillment, with either a cool badass or a relatable everyman taking the lead. Yuuki is neither of those things. For one thing, although he does technically own a sword he doesn\'t deal any damage with it for the first twelve episodes of the show, only using it in the finale in a scene that technically involved training (by swinging non-magical blows at static targets) but still came out of nowhere. His main ability for most of the season is providing powerful buffs to the rest of his party so they can defeat the enemy. This is a very useful ability, but making your friends more badass so they can be the heroes is not the most common wish-fulfillment narrative.  More importantly, Yuuki has roughly the personality and intelligence of a labrador retriever. I don\'t think that a good-natured, near-silent amnesiac who buffs other characters and must be shepherded about to keep him from getting himself killed is a bad character concept inherently. I liked Yuuki: he was charming to watch and I thought a lot of the jokes around him landed. But when you\'ve got an incredibly generic-looking guy in a world where every other important character is a cute girl with a distinct design, you expect him to be the center of the plot to justify his presence, and most of the time Yuuki really isn\'t, which makes him stick out like a sore thumb.That brings me to my next point: as well as being an isekai show awfully short on isekai, this is also a harem show with a surprising lack of harem. Most of the cute female characters are just not that interested in Yuuki. They don\'t dislike him, but they\'re more invested in their relationship with their sister, the childhood friend they have a lifelong rivalry with, their employer, the vampire they\'re trying to resurrect, the woman they\'re trying to assassinate, the mad scientist they assist in performing dubiously ethical medical treatments, etc. Even two of Yuuki\'s core group, Karol and Pecorine, have a relationship with each other that\'s much more developed than their relationships with him. In fact, both Karol and Pecorine have their character arcs wrap up in the final episode with Pecorine declaring her love to Karol and the two of them embracing while the surrounding crowd cheers. I loved this scene, but ""two members of your harem would probably rather date each other than you"" is not a genre-typical choice. The only characters who seem actively interested in Yuuki, as opposed to just generally thinking he\'s a good guy who\'s nice to hang around with, are his sisters, a yandere, and an 11-year-old child. I guess it provides a good excuse for the protagonist not to be sexually interested in his harem when his options are either related to him, have kidnapped him, or are a literal child. Not that Yuuki seems romantically or sexually interested in anyone. In another unusual trait for a harem protagonist, his naivete and cheery, mute, go-with-the-flow friendliness make him come across as almost asexual. It\'s not a bad choice; it\'s definitely part of his likeability. None of these are bad choice alone. Emphasis on alone.All these factors come together to make it feel like Yuuki should not be the main character of this story. Pecorine has more of a connection to the world, more agency, more connections with other characters, and in the context of the first season, a more interesting story to tell. She gets more focus than Yuuki in most episodes. While cute, a labrador retriever just does not have the kind of personality that moves a fantasy epic forward. Yuuki should also not have the design he does. It doesn\'t fit with the aesthetic of the world and it also doesn\'t make much sense for an MMO character who can look however he wants. It\'s the convention of the genre, I know, but bucking so many other conventions make the ones they keep seem out of place. But Yuuki is the protagonist, and he does look like a generic Japanese teenager. That\'s how it has to be. That\'s how it was in the game.I don\'t know the creators of this show. I don\'t know the game. But to me it felt like the creators weren\'t interested in creating an isekai/harem show. They were interested in all the cute designs from the game, and they stretched the game as much as they could so they could tell a story that still technically fit within the rules the game had set up. The resulting show kind of feels like a hodgepodge. The more isekai/harem elements feel out of place in the world of the anime when they may not have been in a game focused around those elements. The climactic moment of the season where the hero slays a monster with a sword shouldn\'t feel as jammed in as it does. And yet would I like the show more if it stuck closer to isekai/harem tropes? Of course not. I liked the characters. I liked the rich web of relationships they have with each other.  I liked the world that they lived in which, largely due to that web of relationships, genuinely felt like a world worth protecting. I liked the extremely pretty animation. I liked the designs. I liked the jokes. I liked a lot of the individual episode plots. I liked the private struggles of Karol and Pecorine. I don\'t think that any of it was exceptional, but it was all really solid. The main problems were the overarching plot and the worldbuilding, most of which was a real mixed bag. It felt like they were trying to do two different things and those things just didn\'t mesh super well. But if they had just stuck closer to what the tone of the game appears to be, I probably wouldn\'t have liked it all.I really wavered between a 6 and 7 for this. Ultimately Yuuki\'s part of the final episode and the obsessive pseudo-incestuous interest Yuuki\'s sisters had in him dragged it down to a six. But I did genuinely enjoy a lot of the show! I just think it was pretty messy, and the good wasn\'t enough to fully redeem its problems.And now that I\'ve written an essay to come to a conclusion of ""eh it was okay"", I\'ve hopefully put my feelings about this show to rest. there\'s very little isekai in this isekai anime. The protagonist has total amnesia, so his past in the real world doesn\'t affect his motivations, knowledge or beliefs.

I had heard good things about it (people compared it to Konosuba, which I love), and a lot of the people I know seem to love this anime. Additionally, the art itself looks nice, and the character designs are great. It started out well enough: I liked the first two episodes (though I found Yuuki VERY annoying, and the jokes were a bit overdone), and had a favorite character by then, Karyl.8 episodes later, I felt done with this series. I dreaded watching it, and actually added another anime as a distraction so I only...had to watch one episode of this mess a day (incidentally, I ended up loving the other anime). I only finished watching it because I was really close to finishing it at that point, so I figure I should. Why did I hate it so much that I dreaded watching it? Keep reading on to find out.First, I absolutely HATE the MC, Yuuki. He\'s annoying, useless, and those one liners get really old, really fast (I\'m so sick of him just going \'mm!\' and giving a thumbs up for everything). He never gets any character development, he never even tries to regain his memories, and that joke about him getting eaten because he\'s so useless is NOT FUNNY. Luckily, he doesn\'t carry the show (the show favors Pecorine, Karyl, and Kokkoro), so I would be able to overlook him if it wasn\'t for the fact the rest of the show.. sadly, isn\'t much better. The plot doesn\'t seem to go anywhere, even after 10 episodes. It\'s just kind of more of the same: Fight random monsters or hang around town, cook weird food, and introduce guilds from the game without any proper introduction other than a name drop. Remember that ad from Johnsonville where the lady states ""___ shows up, and says ""Johnsonville brats are made in the USA""? That\'s how the series introduces the other guild members. These random girls just show up, the series name drops them, they do something minor in the episode, and then they\'re GONE. We\'re somehow supposed to somehow remember their names or care about them, even though they only say la few lines. There\'s only one exception (they show one, Rima, twice), but for the most part, each episode just randomly introduces like 3 new characters, and THEY DON\'T COME BACK. If they came back, I\'d get their point. If they had characterization in the episode that made them memorable despite only appearing in one episode, that\'d be fine. But they don\'t. They just appear, they tell their names, they\'re there for a bit, then are GONE. And this goes on for at least 6 episodes. It\'s very frustrating. And the main female cast? They\'re not much better. Kokkoro doesn\'t change since episode 1. We do learn some things about Pecorine after her initial appearance (such as she can also make furniture), so she\'s not completely skipped over in terms of characterization, and Karyl goes from a bad character to \'good\' later on, and seems to start to value the group she travels with. So she has some development as well. But as the show has like 20 characters, having 2 of them actually change is just a drop in the bucket.Additionally, the bad characterization isn\'t the only flaw: It\'s VERY formulaic. It goes like this for almost every episode: The characters want to get food or something stupid, these random girls appear, and there\'s a battle of some sort, usually involving food. And nearly every episode, Yuuki gets eaten by some animal and Kokkoro does the X face. It\'s REALLY repetitive, and almost unwatchable.That isn\'t to say everything is bad, though. The series does have good art, and the designs are really good for the main characters. The other girls designs are also OK, but not as good as the main cast. The acting is also good, and the OP and ED are OK. And as much as I dislike the formulaic plot, bad MC, and poorly introduced characters, I still like Karyl. I find her an interesting character, and I do want to know who she\'s working for, and why she can\'t/won\'t dump working for this person. I hope the last three episodes address this, but I somehow doubt it.It\'s really sad when there isn\'t a lot of good things I can name about this anime. I definitely would recommend skipping this. It is NOT Konosuba. That actually introduces its new characters properly and isn\'t formulaic.Edited upon finishing episode 13: Now that I finished it, I can say that I still feel most of my previous points are valid. Episode 11 was more of the same. Episodes 12 and 13 were FINALLY good. These episodes finally discussed some lore again, and there\'s an interesting revelation involving Pecorine. If the rest of this series was like episode 1-2 and 12-13, I\'d give this series a 7 or 8. But it isn\'t. I\'m torn whether or not to watch the next season (and whether or not to recommend you do as well), as I found the last two episodes interesting, and figure maybe the next season will be like those. But as a whole, I still have to give this series a 3. I liked 1-2 and 12 and 13, but 4 episodes that are good of 13 isn\'t very good. And those bad episodes ruined this series SO much for me.

Idk if you collect them or whatever, but anime wise, it translates to a whole bunch of characters being there, some getting very little screen time as a result.This also affects the story because it makes it feel very badly structured and the motivations and logic can be...quite vague and not the best. The story overall? Pretty lackluster, more of a fantasy slice of life really. Entertainment value? Decent, but nothing special, its like a watered down version of konosuba, REALLY watered down in some parts.The only outstanding quality this anime has is in its production value, which seems to be through the roof, which makes it very pleasant to watch and impressive to look at...But would i actually recommend it?

Then by all means, have a look."", 'Before we begin, let me tell you that i have never played the game. With that in mind, let\'s dive in (pun intended).Story: 5I\'m afraid that there isn\'t much to the story. I mean, most of the time, the main characters are trying to cook new kind of cuisine, which isn\'t odd at all, considering they are gourmet guild, after all. They do this by taking quest from locals. Sometimes they find monsters along the way, but the monsters aren\'t interesting and usually kind of weak enough so they can easily beat it.The story uses ""monster of the week"" type of formula for each episode...(most of the time). It takes the route of semi slice of life with some development along the way, but it seems that the development is quite shallow that only the last two episodes have a great impact on the story as a whole. I\'m actually kinda stumped because in a way, this story is the kind of story with slow progression and filled with bunch of adorable and light-hearted moments, but the story also want to be something bigger which is evident by some backgrounds to our characters and a cliffhanger in the episode finale. But i decided to give this story a 5.Art: 8The background is very beautiful and it feels like you\'re living in fantasy world where everybody has happy lives. After all, how can you not like world which is filled with lots of trees, plants, medieval looking houses, nice palace, friendly people, and most importantly, DELICIOUS-LOOKING FOOD!Now for the characters. Almost all females are beautiful, whether they are loli, ara ara onee-san, tsundere, and somewhat psychotic villains. The males look okay. The problem is, the art has the very typical syndrome where all females look beautiful, but their face is all the same. If you tear their hair, clothes, etc, you would get indistinguishable faces. Just like usual, the males have more variation in terms of face, body size, and skin colour. I hope this kind of syndrome would be dropped by astist because honestly, it\'s kind of annoying to see the same beautiful girl almost everytime.Sound: 6I don\'t have much to say about the sound. The background music is quite good. The opening is catchy and i like it, while the ending is an okay for me.Character: 6The protagonist is kinda hard to tell. If you look at first episodes, or rather the very first one, it seems that Yuuki is the protagonist. But later on, Pecorine takes the spot. Well, Yuuki is kinda dumb and a silent person, so Pecorine takes the wheel quite easily. It\'s nice, actually. Rather than focusing to only one protagonist, this story HAS TWO.Yuuki is unique because you don\'t have many fantasy protagonist who is a silent and seems absent-minded. But that probably happens because he lost his memory and then he needs to recover in order to be his true self. Other than that, he\'s kinda cliche. He\'s a teenager boy, has the look of Kirito, scrawny, actually a badass (according to megane red haired girl explanation).Pecorine is your usual happy-go-lucky type. She REALLY LIKES to hug people and often have cheerful smile. She also has big appetite which is the result of wearing her suit. Her suit gives her a number of benefits, but it makes the user to be constantly hungry. She is a princess, actually (you can tell it easily if you pay attention). She also has a nice jug (IYKWIM) which is conveniently exposed a bit. She\'s not only beautiful, she\'s also super strong. I think she\'s the strongest one in her party. SPOILER: the reason as to why she is always cling to her friends is because she was forgotten by her parents and the people in the kingdom and then her role as a princess was replaced by a girl (i guess she will be the main villain if there would be season 2).Karyl is your typical tsundere. As a tsundere, of course she acts like she hates your guts, but actually care about you. She\'s a nekogirl, so you can expect her behavior. She is constantly conflicted with her task from her evil master to monitor pecorine and yuuki as she develops personal feelings for her friends. She gets the most character development than the other MCs.Kokkoro is your sweet little elf girl. She seems to be the youngest in her party. She is very obedient with her father\'s mission that she needs to care for the dumb Yuuki and support him in anyway she can. She also has a lot of faith in Yuuki in particular. She also act the most mature, despite being the youngest of them all. And that\'s it. She is a bland character that gets little spotlight and doesn\'t really matter if anyone replace her.Aaand some other background characters. There are 2 guys who only serve their purpose as comical characters. There\'s also a bunch of cute and gorgeous girls they help along the way who you will forget in a relative short amount of time, mainly because there are many of them and they are only interesting in looks.Enjoyment: 7I enjoy the gorgeous girls, especially the ones with big breast and exposed clothings. The beautiful girls are the main drive that can suck people who haven\'t played the game to watch this. The set is also very beautiful and makes you enjoy every bit of it. And we can\'t forget about THE DAMN FOOD! Delicious!Overall: 6The story drags the score down. (most of the time). It takes the route of semi slice of life with some development along the way, but it seems that the development is quite shallow that only the last two episodes have a great impact on the story as a whole. I\'m actually kinda stumped because in a way, this story is the kind of story with slow progression and filled with bunch of adorable and light-hearted moments, but the story also want to be something bigger which is evident by some backgrounds to our characters and a cliffhanger in the episode finale. But i decided to give this story a 5.Art: 8The background is very beautiful and it feels like you\'re living in fantasy world where everybody has happy lives. After all, how can you not like world which is filled with lots of trees, plants, medieval looking houses, nice palace, friendly people, and most importantly, DELICIOUS-LOOKING FOOD!Now for the characters. Almost all females are beautiful, whether they are loli, ara ara onee-san, tsundere, and somewhat psychotic villains. The males look okay. The problem is, the art has the very typical syndrome where all females look beautiful, but their face is all the same. If you tear their hair, clothes, etc, you would get indistinguishable faces. Just like usual, the males have more variation in terms of face, body size, and skin colour. I hope this kind of syndrome would be dropped by astist because honestly, it\'s kind of annoying to see the same beautiful girl almost everytime.Sound: 6I don\'t have much to say about the sound.

I love all kinds of isekai harem shows and this one started out fun and interesting with a fun premise....at first. I\'ll try not to spoil anything but The MC lost his memory.....which apparently makes him mentally handicapped. By episode 10 he gets in the water, says ""salty"" and starts playing around in it like a kid, and that\'s the only thge he realy says in the entire episode. Later in the episode a repeatedly squeezes a sea cucumber till it spits it\'s guts out and has no reaction to it. They legit...made him someone who is mentally handicapped and not just someone who lost his memory. He never says a full sentence EVER.  The most you get out of him are grunts, thumbs up, and stupid single words like ""salty"" As if he was a baby. It is beyond frustrating once you realize he doesn\'t ever grow out of it and he will always be like that. Half the plot points are his dumb a*s just wandering away like a mentally handicapped child it\'s not only boring but when you realize oh the resolution is that he just wandered back and nothing happened of any consequence.The other characters luckily take up most of the screen time and they are fun characters. But the absolute stupidity of the MC realllly knocks this show down a quite a few pegs. Hopefully season 2 will stop this stupid gimmick and actually give him a personality. made him someone who is mentally handicapped and not just someone who lost his memory.

I have no idea what a Princess is other than someone who possesses power. Additionally, I have no idea why there are Princesses. In fact, I have no idea about many things that I thought I would at least somewhat understand by now.I can usually get by this type of stuff if other parts of the show maintain my interest. And especially with this...one, I was truly hoping that the characters could carry me through until I got to where they will dive into the plot better, but even they are all lacking. Not a single one has any redeeming qualities at this point. Even more so, the main character - Lord (Idk his name), doesn't speak enough to be likable. I understand he lost his memories, but people usually can still talk after something like that happens, and he's nearly mute. How can I care about someone I know nothing about, and when he chooses to speak, it isn't significant enough or character-defining?I mean, seriously, he could not be any less irrelevant as a main character thus far.Overall, I didn't hate this, but I got to a point where I was enjoying it less than I was not.

The show itself is a relatively simple slice of life comedy within a fantasy setting, the girls are cute, the comedy at the very least makes me smile.Story and Writing:There’s not much I can say about the story, since there is not much story to begin with. The first few episodes are spent introducing the main cast, and the formation of the gourmet guild. After that each episode is mostly about the gourmet guild screwing around having fun.There was an arc where the...story does attempt to be more serious, but the arc itself felt out of place and rather uninteresting for the most part since I did not feel any emotional attachment to the characters.The show is at its best when it leans into more of a slice-of-life story. Watching the characters goof around leaves warm and comfy feeling similar to that of K-On and other moe based shows. Although there was some semblance of a main plot, it was rather uninteresting and the slice-of-life episodes were the real stars of the show.As for comedy, personally it was hit or miss for me. There was not any scenes that were laugh out loud funny but, I found that every episode would at least get a chuckle out of me. The jokes can get a bit repetitive after a while. Personally by the time I finished episode four, I was watching the show more for main cast doing cute things rather than the comedy anyway.Characters:The two stand out characters from the main cast by far are Kyaru and Pecorine. Pecorine’s naïve and bubbly personality brings a lot of needed life and excitement to the main cast, while Kyaru is often bratty and whiny, basically she’s Aqua from KonoSuba but not stupid. While a bit repetitive at times, Pecorine's gluttonous attitude is very versatile and often earns a chuckle or two from me. While Kyaru also has tsundere like tendencies with the other members of the guild, it is nice to see how here interactions with the guild change over time.The other two members of the guild, Kokkoro and Yuuki, are very boring in comparison to Pecorine and Kyaru. Yuuki often says a maximum of ten words per episode and feels more like a background character rather than a main character. He also is not very smart, but I do not think that it has been utilized effectively. While I think it's interesting that Kokkoro acts mature for her age it's usually really boring and even predictable when you see her character interact with others.Although I did not enjoy the cast of characters in the first few episodes, they grew on me the longer I watched the show. As mentioned before, I just really enjoyed watching the cast be cute.The side-characters introduced all have their personalities based around their own personal gimmick. For example, one character that was introduced in the sixth episode whose entire gimmick was being lonely, and her entire personality was based around, wanting to make friends and being kind of socially awkward. Usually these characters are only around for an episode or two so their gimmicks never get too annoying or tiring.Art and Animation:The series’ art is what will happen if you give the KonoSuba an unlimited budget. The animation is fluid and the art style is cute, and each of the characters look and feel very distinct from one another. Overall the animators did a pretty job. The use of CG pretty meh like most shows.Music:Soundtrack is really solid. I do not what else to say other than it feels like a fantasy setting and it does its job pretty well.Conclusion:This is one of those shows where once you watch the first episode you will know whether you want to continue watching or not. If you are looking for something simple and cute this is the show for you. If you are looking for plot, depth, and complex characters you are better off watching another show.

Kaiko sareta Ankoku Heishi (30-dai) no Slow na Second Life,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52446/Kaiko_sareta_Ankoku_Heishi_30-dai_no_Slow_na_Second_Life,"['Chillin in my 30s is the latest in the Banished from the hero’s party style of show and it’s probably my second favourite of the bunch. A simple, yet rewarding and comfy story that I really enjoyed.So story wise, chillin in my 30s follows the basic formula of an OP assistant to the Demon King’s army getting kicked out due to jealousy and taken in by a small village in the country side. What sets it apart from some of the other shows in this style like Beast Tamer, is that 1:There’s no harem, so the MC’s relationship with the main female lead takes priority...and develops naturally. It’s not like one episode they’re together. It is a slow build-up and really rewarding when it happens. 2: The MC being a middle aged guy brings a level headedness to the story that a lot of these fantasy shows lack. None of the usual fan-service and perverted antics, it’s nice to get a mature MC who just wants to go about his daily life.The story’s first 6 episodes or so are pretty slow paced, usually revolving around the MC accomplishing some task to support the people who have been kind enough to take him in. But I found these tasks to be really satisfying. There’s a little bit of world building and some backstory hints for the MC, but they don’t really begin to pay off until episode 8 or so. Once the new characters get involved in the story is where things really picked up for me. The past 4 or 5 episodes were the highlight of the series for sure. I loved how everything came full circle from Dariel’s past. I will say the big twist with Dariel’s origin story was pretty predictable and kind of boring for me, but at the same time it was consistent with the overall story, so can’t be too mad. Again, I am really glad they didn’t go the harem route, instead actually giving us female supporting characters with a little bit of personality.The art style is really nice in this, Encourage films have done Gochiusa and also Deaimon and this show is up there with those for me. Solid animation, banger OP, no complaints in the technical department. Fights are on the generic fantasy side, but not everything has to be ufotable to satisfy me.Chillin in my 30s is not the most original show in the world. It does have a lot of the usual fantasy tropes. MC who doesn’t realise how OP he is, girl who instantly falls in love with MC for no reason other than him existing and being nice to her, etc. But, it still manages to be enjoyable because of the MC’s maturity and the interactions between characters. I would not call it a must watch, but it’s certainly one I enjoyed and I think if you liked Banished from the Hero’s Party or Beast Tamer, you will like this.Chillin in my 30s gets 8 out of 10. and develops naturally.

If you\'re not into the story, then I will be a ""bad"" anime in your eyes.For me, I love fantasy animes and the idea of someone strong learning to live a normal life. I get curious about how they handle the story and characters. I will state that the show is very predictable. I...was able to predict what would happen after watching a scene almost all the time. So, I think it\'s a cliche show with nothing new to offer. Again, this isn\'t a knock on the show, but it means that the show isn\'t good either. It is not one I can give above average because there isn\'t one aspect of the anime that I particularly liked more than other animes that follow this type of plot.Would I recommend this show to anyone? Not really, but if you like these types of shows like me, give it a watch. Personally, I watch it at 1.5x speed to make it more bearable and to make the pacing better for me. I may drop it later down the line if it gets too repetitive. was able to predict what would happen after watching a scene almost all the time.

This was an easy, but incredibly satisfying binge.The start is a bit rocky, but the more of it you watch, the more it grows on you.This takes the ""seemingly"" classic; expelled from army/party set-up, and executes it on the highest level I\'ve seen to date.This is a great show, with almost no drawbacks. Can we give it a 10? No, it doesn\'t take enough risks and is the standard 12 episodes.Started it, and couldn\'t stop until it ended, I was completely immersed, you can tell it was written with...a lot of thought.Usually, with this type of anime, I need about 3 sittings to finish them. This isn\'t your average anime fantasy, the likes of which are cringe, cliched, filled with worthless fanservice, harems and other box-ticking garbage. Rather, it takes some of those familiar elements but uses them more sparingly to ensure the experience isn\'t overwhelmed by these tack-on tropes.The MC is a breath of fresh air , something different, which also bolsters the experience. He isn\'t some giga-simp, self-insert, pathetic, ""relatable"" or on the other hand, omni-benevolent, pure-soul, dense, etc. He fits in well with the story his character is very consistent with his upbringing.Later on in the story, you\'re rewarded with a very interesting, but foreshadowed plot-twist which creates a healthy paradox.Everything is quite well balanced in the show, most of the characters are used masterfully well for the plot.  Some manage to receive a decent amount of development in these very short, 12 episodes.There is very prudent writing here, though at some parts perhaps this show is too idealistic, but at the end of the day we watch these shows for enjoyment, and it certainly passes on that.

(this is my first review so I don't really know how to do one)The fantasy setting is of course overused and there is also got the humans against demons for hundreds of years. It uses tropes like that in the anime but the anime shows the views of both the demons and humans (I know its been done before but its still not done as often).There are fight scenes and they are nothing new however I think it is more character/story driven but I can't tell but seeing the characters interact and the story being told is personally why...I like it.There really isn't a reason this anime seems good it just feels good to watch and there isn't a real reason why. However there is one negative and that is of course as you get in any fantasy anime, the big titties, they just get in the way of enjoying it but overall the fanservice can be ignored and it is a good anime as long as you go in thinking you would like the premise.

It just hits right and is not too much and any aspects at all. It has a great running story with stuff you would not expect.

It’s just really, really, really nice. I honestly haven’t got much to say. The title pretty much says it all. Dariel is a soldier in the Demon King’s army, but gets fired because his inability to use magic makes him useless. After aimlessly wandering through the forest, he encounters Marika, a...beautiful village girl, and saves her from a pursuing monster. As thanks, she invites him to live with her family in the village. There he finds out that he is in fact not a demon, but actually a human, which explains his inability to use magic. Thus, Dariel’s slow second life begins.Perhaps the most gratifying aspect of Chillin’ is its romance. Aside from the fact that the main heroine is so hot that she is on the knife’s edge of what can still be considered tasteful, she is impossibly wifely. What’s more, you get a wholesome love story in this anime! Rejoice! You might experience some minor frustration with off-screening, which I can’t really explain without spoiling, so I won’t, but you’ll understand when you watch it. It’s not a big deal – more of an “Aw, man!” type thing.Mind you, while Chillin’ is mostly a fantasy slice-of-life show, it does in fact have an overarching plot. It’s certainly not a story you could ever accuse of moving quickly, but a story nonetheless. There’s plenty of decent action, too. However, if you expect that to be the meat and potatoes of the series, you will be disappointed. There’s a fair amount of Talk no Jutsu going on and plenty of dangerous and risky situations will resolve themselves fairly softly and elegantly without much ado. Things will just have a way of working out. If you feel like that would detract from your experience, fair enough, to each their own, but please do not for a moment think that just because conflict resolutions do not come down to Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha clashes or Game of Thrones-esque complicated political schemes, that somehow detracts from the objective quality of the anime. It’s just not that kind of show.All of that being said, what I respect most about Chillin’, as well as other shows of its kind, such as Misfit at Demon King Academy, is that they’re not isekais. This is not a huge deal at a textual level, but I consider that what the authors are doing to be the Lord’s work at a metatextual level. While they tick pretty much all of the isekai boxes – dude who comes from a different kind of place, different kind of life, now has to adapt to this new place and life – they’re not actual isekai shows, because they don’t need to be! Like Anos, Dariel is a dude who was born in the universe’s fantasy world and grew up in it. Whatever makes him special is borne of the fantasy world itself. Both Chillin’ and Misfit are bona fide high fantasy stories. Tragic as though it may be that I find myself in a position of praising a show for not forcing an isekai trapping, given the state of the medium, I cannot praise it enough!The show’s got everything you could want from feel-good media, decent action, loveable characters, good humor, emotional stories, and wholesome romance. If you ever find yourself in need of something to soothe your soul, by all means – this might be one of my warmest recommendations. beautiful village girl, and saves her from a pursuing monster.

Don\'t take this the wrong way though. The kind of plot this show has is probably something you have already seen before many times: assuming you are already familiar with the slow-life isekai types. Yet, out of the many shows who have tried, none of them even come close to this one. In terms of storyline, characters and its faithfulness to its themes, Chilling in my 30s undoubtedly stands above the rest. These are the traits that can elevate an anime from a trope filled cliche mess already done...a million times to a\xa0 diamond in the rough that manages to keep viewers engaged.However, despite its many positives the show is nowhere near perfect. As it is true for many other anime with 12 episodes the problem boils down to one question: ""is there enough time?"" Unfortunately, for a fantasy story with many complicated characters and fight scenes the answer is ""no"": that much is inevitable. Hence why this show suffers from many small gaps and skipped content, which only manage to make the story feel rushed and the characters incomplete.To dig into this a bit deeper, I\'ve noticed that this is mainly an issue with the studio behind Chilling in my 30s and not so much about the source material. Encourage films tends to overhype characters, which leads to viewer anticipation growing, only for them to never shine at all. Gaps prompted by those ""missing"" characters are probably the show\'s biggest detriment. Removing them entirely would have definitely made for a much more complete story. I would give examples here, but I would rather keep this review relevant and spoiler free.Apart from all of the that, it is pretty distinct that the positives greatly overshadow the negatives. From its compelling and well-written story that remains interesting until the end all the way to the comedy that rarely missed its mark, Chilling in my 30s had a bit of everything to offer to that table. It had all of the elements you would expect from a writer that knows what they\'re doing, including a fairly unexpected plot twist and fight scenes with balanced power scaling that genuinely made them exciting. The show also never failed to give us a few moments to relax from all the action, keeping its slow life and pacifist theming consistent, leading up to the climax. Even the brief ecchi moments which normally are quite distracting, didn\'t feel as forced. Instead, they were added benefits to solidify the comedy and lighthearted nature of the show.As for the characters, it was really fresh to see a protagonist (namely, Dariel) that doesn\'t constantly act like an oblivious child and is, on the contrary, mature and empathetic. The female characters too had uses besides being the love interest. Not to stress this more than necessary but is especially rare for female characters in anime to have complications and goals of their own that don\'t always mingle with the MC\'s.\xa0 This applied to the rest of the supporting cast as well. They all had coherent roles that complimented the Dariel\'s general goal in the story when needed. Likewise though they didn\'t fail to provide points of plot progression of their own and maybe a bit of comedy relief too without taking too much of the spotlight. For its entertaining supporting characters and likeable protagonist the show already earns full marks.TL;DR - All in all, Chilling in my 30s After Getting Fired from the Demon King\'s Army earns my full approval. Despite the gaps in the story due to some characters missing out on their arcs, the show managed to stay enjoyable throughout all its run time because of its excellent supporting cast and compelling storyline. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for lighthearted slow-life anime that doesn\'t lack in the action department either.As a note I would like to mention that writing this anime off as ""cliche"" or ""I\'ve seen this done before"" and moving on is a mistake. Keep an open mind and think of it as the first slow life show you have ever seen.

That’s it.From the Beast Tamer-like start of having our Mediocre Protagonist fired from his job that he’s good at in the mediocre Demon Kings army by a bunch of mediocre higher ups who will come to regret it later, to every other fantasy/isekai light novel anime you could think of having a love interest sporting plunging cleavage barely held in by tissue paper clothing, who immediately want’s to jump of the protagonists rod as soon as he said anything, there...is literally nothing in this anime you haven’t seen in similar shows of it’s type.Even with how thoroughly pedestrian it is on the whole, I will admit there are some things I like about it. I like that the demons are basically just humanoids who can use magic, making them a bit more relatable that your usual demon king army, and I like that the protagonist takes a pacifist approach to resolving conflict. It would be really easy for main protag-kun Dariel to just wipe all his enemies off the map because, y’know, it’s a male power fantasy light novel anime. Of course he’s secretly overpowered in some convoluted way thanks to the human side of the power system. However, he does his best to resolve conflicts through talks and reasoning, bringing both the demon and human sides together to mutually benefit from each other without the need for bloodshed. It’s a nice message.Unfortunately, whilst Dariel is good at solving problems, he's dense as fuck and it’s get annoying quickly. You’d think being constantly grabbed and openly flirted at by the giant pair of breasts called Marika would tip him off to the feelings she has for him for some undisclosed reason. But nope, not Dariel. He is a member of the 24/7, 28-31/12, 12/1 no-nut-november club, and no mommy milkers are getting his way, no matter how plunging the cleavage is when you push those melons together (as of episode 4). He’s also just not very interesting as a character to follow either. Another protagonist with barely any personality so the viewer can live vicariously through him. That can be said of all the other faces in this show. There is nothing here you haven’t seen before.What really seals the mediocre deal on this show for me is it’s below average art and animation. The art looks like a quick rush job, it’s barely animated and when it is it looks cheap. I’ve seen a few pages of the manga because I like to read along with new shows when they’re airing, and the artist style for that has way more personality and character than this cheap looking imitation of something like Sword Art Online.In conclusion… I get kinda see way people would like this show. Despite it’s glaring flaws and rip-offs of other fantasy light novel concepts, it is nicely paced and I like the over-arching theme of the story. I probably would’ve kept watching it if I had the time, but I don’t and I’m not wasting it on another cheap, mediocre light novel adaption of a mediocre story I’ve seen multiple times before, containing somehow less interesting characters.

Sure it starts off with one of the well-known tropes but the story works because it\'s not about OP characters doing OP things collecting a harem and such, not even about defeating the ultimate evil. It really is a story about character growth, reflection and how when you have proper humans interacting in a story who are not meatheads, you can have proper dialogues and outcomes.It can be generally light hearted with decent jokes and gags and while it doesn\'t explore some deep philosophical idea, this show is fun to...watch, it\'s kind in the core and brings a positive message.The pace of the show is really good and 12 episodes are packed with lots of events happening, it doesn\'t waste your time as a viewer and keeps bringing in more and more characters throughout the season. It has enough for 1 Season and it doesn\'t feel like any cliffhanger happens to make you feel forced for a probable Season 2.With many shows that end up just resolving conflicts with xplosions this one feels like going a different way all together with what the goal of the Demon King actually is and what the possible resolution of the story will be. It\'s definitely nothing new but it\'s well done, characters are likeable, they behave properly, they don\'t drop down to some hardcore cliches and it\'s fun to tag along.Some may not like him, but MC is relatable. His thought process makes sense and his behavior is humane. Like a proper person who is not a maniac or a psycho he doesn\'t wish to see any bloodshed and conflicts while just being a decent person to others. As he is given ""somewhat"" op powers which is logically explained later on they are not what defines his character.Marika was a surprise, as the show starts with a typical waifu harem bs (which you suspect by some tropes), story eventually moves away from it, shows proper development between her and MC with a correct outcome, where again, character behave as actual humans.I believe as you do grow older, you start appreciate this type of story more for specific reasons.Opening by Hinano is great and I mostly never skipped the song, which is impressive.I hope there will be a Season 2 and the story develops further it was a nice ride. watch, it\'s kind in the core and brings a positive message.The pace of the show is really good and 12 episodes are packed with lots of events happening, it doesn\'t waste your time as a viewer and keeps bringing in more and more characters throughout the season.

Even in the face of Marika, who I'm sure the great Satou Kazuma would describe as just being boobs, Dariel remains respectful. Not even Tits McGee bodyslamming her mountains into Dariel's face practically every episode is enough to squeeze a single drip of nosebleed...out of the guy - Dariel's just some guy, and there's just something so refreshing about that. out of the guy - Dariel's just some guy, and there's just something so refreshing about that."", ""The Review Y'all Aren't Ready For.

It\'s everything the title promises, really. The protagonist is chilling, and the pace is slower than a sloth with a hangover. This is the latest entry in what I like to call the ""iyashikei isekai/fantasy"" genre. You know the drill - horny protagonist, hordes of girls, and enough fanservice to make your eyes pop out. But fear not, for this show is a tad different. It steamrolls everything and focuses on the slice-of-life scenes.Our protagonist is a laid-off demon army soldier. How original. And surprise, surprise - a girl comes along...to save the day. But wait, they actually progress their relationship beyond the usual formula. It\'s almost like we have a slice-of-life anime here, folks. Except, there\'s an over-the-top rebellious antagonist, of course.The production quality might be a little hit-and-miss, but the emotions in the story are still conveyed decently. The voice acting is respectable, although the characters are not particularly interesting. The main characters do stand out, though. We get a lengthy look into Dariel\'s past, which salvages the show in many ways.Unfortunately, this show suffers from an overused setting and a lackluster execution. The author tries to cram too many things into this supposed ""healing"" type of show. But hey, who needs healing when you have fanservice, right? to save the day.

But that is completely wrong. This is a very very generic isekai show with plenty of action and drama. I wouldn\'t recommend this if you wanted a relaxing show like the above mentioned examples.PlotThis is fantasy and not an isekai. Humans use something called Aura (and weapons) to fight and Demons use Magic.  MC works as an assistant to the four generals of demon army. He is really really good at managing office work and is the favorite of everyone in...demon army. But he cannot use magic for some reason. and he is fired due to jealousy. As he is roaming in a forest aimlessly, he happens to save a girl from a monster. our female lead who is also the daughter of the nearby village\'s mayor. The rest of the anime is him settling into the village, learning that he is a human and using the Aura to become strong. The story mostly deals with how he tries to make peace between demons/humans, because despite being human, he cannot turn against demons who raised him. The plot is driven by family drama and/or jealousy. Ofcourse, things get resolved by talk no jutsu multiple times.CharactersMCbecomes really OP after learning Aura. says ""I don\'t want anyone to die"". Honestly, it is kinda embarrassing for a grown 33 year old soldier to say unrealistic dialogues like that. He\'s been working in the army literally since he was a baby, and saw many many people die all these years.

Anyway, everyone loves him. there is a main female lead, but there\'s also some sparks between 3 other female characters. It didn\'t become a harem in this season, but there is a strong possibility of it becoming a harem in the future.Every other character is more or less there to be impressed by MC. The most interesting character by far is the demon lord himself.Demon LordHis appearance is a reflection of oneself. So, to a weak person, he looks like a child. to a strong person, he looks like an absolute demon dragon with horns and everything. He speaks like he sees through everyone and knows everything. he only appears 4 times and does nothing but sit on his throne and speak, but still makes us feel his presence.The Art/Music are good enough to not distract you. Although, there seems to be a large focus on breasts.

The anime doesnt get good until past what those people have seen.It does start pretty typical. But then it diverges and actually tells a very interesting story. Dariel is not the virgin MC most of these types of animes have, which means the usual virgin behavior isnt a major focus for once.  he bangs the girl, gets married, and has a kid in 1 episode and then they just move on with the story. He WANTS to be the average village guy and the show actually lets him...do it. His goal in the show is mostly him trying to make people more chill - quite the opposite of most fantasy animes that have the clueless MC becoming the great hero and defeating the big bad. Its basically the reverse plot of the genre. The side characters are pretty entertaining, though there are a few who i hope will get more fleshed out as the show continues.I would not say this is very deep or incredibly unique anime. It is firmly within the tropey fantasy anime genre. Once you make it past the first few episodes it does show that it isnt ""just another"" one of these shows and has some more original ideas. if you enjoy chiller, happier animes and/or fantasy settings, I\'d highly recommend it do it.

Only after settling in a remote and peaceful human village does the man begin to believe he has value again; only after his noted absence does the demon lord's army realize how valuable he was as an asset to them.Seemingly just another ridiculously named fantasy story, this one has better execution than average. The main character has some backbone and nerve, not conforming to overtly juvenile or goofy behaviors that are rampant in the genre. There is a romance subplot and it does not...take all season long to develop - that very neatly wraps itself up by episode six and with a family to show for it. It is not a thematically grounded story, as it shifts from elements of slice-of-life to introducing periodic plot elements, but it does take the time to do this from as early as episode 1 and so the developments that occur towards the end of the season are not unforeseeable nor are they unbelievable.The writing is fine, weakest towards the end of the story. The characters are not particularly memorable, but they are also not bad in how they present--there are plenty of stock-character traits present, but the execution is fine and works for the story. There are several subplots that occur throughout the story that are intended to set up some form of reconciliation between the protagonist and the demon army, or more specifically the demon army's acting generals that dismissed the protagonist in the first place. These subplots are also fine, wanting in execution perhaps, but serviceable. The powers of the characters are nothing that has not been done before and the power system in general is unremarkable.The animation is also fine, sloppiest towards the end of the show where there is some reliance on CGI to finish the job.This is a seasonal feel-good fantasy anime.

I just want to make sure my future self understands a bit of how I felt about it and why I gave this mark.Review start:A very cute story, basic in terms of plot, but it was well executed in my opinion. I feel like the beginning...of the story is strong, but the later parts are kinda rushed a bit, but it was still a really nice watch. Liked how sometimes, when there were cringe moments, even the MC complained/called them out. Finally an anime where something actually happens between the MC and the heroine of the story...Story: 7Pretty basic, can't say they did something out of the ordinary that I didn't kinda see already.Art: 8Okayish, but it does start losing its touch at the end. I kinda knew that would happen tho, seems pretty common with these types of anime.Characters: 8Really loved the MC and the heroine is the best. The other characters aren't that much flashed out, the background stories not that complex or anything, but it was still nice.Enjoyment: 8Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I would have binge watched it? I split it in 2 days, last 4 eps being watched in the second day. The last parts were kinda rushed imo and a lot of stuff were kinda plot armored into existence and some stuff just didn't make much sense at all at the end... and why did they forget about the general female that is part of the four generals that was searching for him at the beginning???

I was begging for this anime to do fish out of water things or to explore how he was discriminated against as a human in the demon relm or for him to use organizational skills and not raw strength to help the village he ended up in. This anime does not do that bare minimum and in fact seems completely uninterested in any of its characters emotions...besides the all important mutual crush that he shares with the main heroine.

The main character at some points does things based on his own understanding of the situation which do not paint him in the most flattering light. I also liked this version of the mutual crush where it slowly develops and then, instead of having some level of misunderstanding or never committing so the all important waifu collection can grow, the two of them admit their feelings to each other and move into a long term, committed relationship.

It was truly much better than I would have expected from the rating and the cover art. Perfect for light viewing, it felt like a shounen show for seinen folks. All of the discussion of interpersonal relationships without (too much) pain and tragedy, all of the fight scenes without the overused shouting one-hit KOs.In a sea of isekais and isekai-esque fantasy shows Kaiko Heishi is a simple show with an easy premise and no delusions of world-saving grandeur, either...now or later. We have an extremely competent yet humble MC who is just on this side of completely overpowered, and a group of side characters that get around one episode of development each but are contribute to the general focus on emphasizing caring and compassion, even those that start out as antagonists. Kaiko Heishi has managed to walk an extraordinarily thin line of having believable bad guy origins and subsequent redemptions without letting the tone get too heavy or shallow.In between these sort of therapy session/fights, we get enjoyable content of cute village life or quests with lower stakes. And while there\'s quite a bit of fanservice one refreshing trait of this show is that the harem size is one. Slight spoiler but not really since the love interest is introduced 5 minutes into the show. This is also part of the reason I would characterize Kaiko Heishi as a shounen for seinens. It\'s a kind of happy story that encourages and indeed vindicates being a good person above personal gain, and has a calmer take as far as the protagonist is concerned in regards to romance and combat.I wholeheartedly recommend this show.

Thought until the concluding 2 episodes this was a really solid show. I appreciated this not being an isekai fantasy show, and how it felt like the whole “unlikely hero” storyline wasn’t gonna be apart of this show, which I appreciated as a good chance of pace.Also like how there is so little unnecessary drama elements and they’re really played for comedic effect. This is done well with dariel’s inner monologue which they use sparingly to good effect.Thought it was a mistake having the whole series end with this basrabalaza...fight, it felt much to over the top and not with the flow of the rest of the season fight, it felt much to over the top and not with the flow of the rest of the season', '""Chilling in My 30s after Getting Fired from the Demon King\'s Army"" is a lot like ""Banished From The Hero\'s Party"" lots of the same plot tropes with around 40% of it feeling like it has been copied.

Humans and demons look the same but the only difference mainly is demons can use magic while humans use a version of something else to compete.You have the main protagonist which personally like most male mains are slightly dimwitted or dense in a way. He has his moments both good and irritating but overall I like his character. Majority of the characters you are introduced to aren’t bad some are just mildly annoying.All in all it’s...an anime that’s good as long as you can get past the first few episodes.Big ish spoils aheadI do have some gripes with this anime. The main one that I had to force continuing watching to get past is the character start for Marika. It’s the stereotypical trope of girl falls in love with mc. I just couldn’t stand her because of the clingy and obsessiveness she had. And yes I know most anime on this category have something similar. The good thing is though I didn’t like how quick but after the sixth episode I was fine with her. This however leads me to another character it seems I just didn’t care for.That is sadly the hero…. She ups and fights him when he doesn’t want to and finds out he is the person she was looking for to join a party as final member. And practically demands him to even though he stated no to both the fight and going with him. She has a one track mind if you will to present herself justly to defeat the demon king. This is just me being picky since if you see what I have watched/watching I watch this genre normally I wish just for something that’s not following the same thing as others. an anime that’s good as long as you can get past the first few episodes.Big ish spoils aheadI do have some gripes with this anime.

She ups and fights him when he doesn’t want to and finds out he is the person she was looking for to join a party as final member. And practically demands him to even though he stated no to both the fight and going with him. She has a one track mind if you will to present herself justly to defeat the demon king. This is just me being picky since if you see what I have watched/watching I watch this genre normally I wish just for something that’s not following the same thing as others.', ""If you're looking for a loving-caring MC without disgusting polygamy harem type of shit, this anime is for you! I highly recommend you to watchIt doesn't countain something special, the plot is just like ordinary fantasy anime, but it's still a good show to killing sometime. I give it 7/10 for the MC who focus on one heroine even though there's Yuusha (hero) and a few people who are looking on him.(A little spoiler)One thing i don't like is the ending, it's not kicking in my heart because no one is die. If someone die or at least seriously injured, maybe the villain can...learn how precious his previous life is. It's just fighting with talking-no-jutsu and everything is happy ending.

He doesn't have any ill will towards the demons, they took him in and he worked and lived with them. However, now that the demon general's son is in charge he's making some questionable decisions and mismanaging things. This show is more about mediation between humans and demons than fighting.They have some gags like the love interest being afraid of fighting but being incredibly strong, to the point where she casually...throws fallen trees around like it's nothing. She sometimes accidentally hurts the main character, but she's treated like a character because she actually feels bad about it instead of pretending it didn't happen. There's also a love interest as one of the generals, so he's sort of torn between the humans and the demons even in that regard.Dariel isn't the strongest physically, and he can't use magic, but adventurers use aura to fight, which has four different types related to attacking and defending to enhance the use of weapons and shields. Aura is what Dariel excels at after becoming an adventurer, so he is a bit overpowered but he isn't so powerful he can do everything. The main character isn't a pushover, he actually has a spine, he'll stick up for himself, but he also isn't a psychopath. It's refreshing to see someone act like a normal human being.It's a relaxed mostly average fantasy show, some of the humor may not be what you're into but it's not painful.

It was mildly fun garbage, kinda like finding a really messed up sofa thrown out by the curb, but at the end of the day, still garbage. The best compliment I can give this series is that I didn’t actively hate it by the end, just felt kinda indifferent to it. Not memorable, but I wouldn’t say it was boring enough to forget. I will remember Malika (Marika?) at least.Tomokazu Sugita [Gintama’s Gintoki], the voice of the main character Dariel was fighting for his life trying to carry this series, but his voice acting alone couldn’t pull it off. I...did enjoy his performance though I wouldn’t say it’s his best, or one he’ll probably remember five years from now. Felt a bit like a paycheck show.The title for this series is total BS. There is virtually nothing “Chill” about this series. Dude goes from one conflict to another and gets absolutely no rest, because the girl of his dreams hits like a truck every time she runs in for a glomp. And glomp she does. So even in his down time, he’s dealing with broken ribs every times he catches a hug.The BETTER title for this series would be “Nobody will let me chill, even in my 30’s”. Dariel gets expelled from the Demon King’s army’s only to end up busy as hell even in his early forced retirement. The characters here were all pretty standard; same tropes we’ve seen a million times before. Demon King, Four Heavenly Kings, overenthusiastically-here-to-train hero, big-boobie oneesan waifu (that would be the aforementioned Malika). Etc. Etc.In the end, I found it pretty boring and repetitive, but not in a way that made me fast forward, or skip episodes. Not entirely sure why I stuck it out with until the end, but I think it had something to do with Malika. I just can’t quite put my finger on which part.A year from now, I doubt I’ll remember this series, just like Sugita won’t, but, that’s ok. Not every anime can be Mushoku Tensei, even if Tomokazu Sugita is in it. (Have I mentioned how much I like Tomokazu Sugita? Is that coming across?) We need 1’s in order to really appreciate the 8’s and 9’s. They make the 10’s feel even more incredible. This show wasn’t THAT bad though. The art-style and animation were cookie-cutter and manufactured, but they weren’t dreadful, or copy-pasted, like an ExArm or TanMoshi. I did get a couple laughs out of it; plus… Malika.

Very disappointing even compared to the other ""Kicked out of x"" anime\'s.

Naturally she is a waifu with massive boobs on display because of course she is. He then proceeds to be emotionally and physically manipulated by her into staying in the village despite conveniently discovering his massive talent...immediately after arriving. Whenever he decides to leave she either cries or honey traps him into staying - it\'s ridiculous and makes her completely unlikeable. Oh and btw she\'s ridiculously strong, stronger than the MC but because she\'s ""scared of fighting"" she remains a housewife the entire time. It\'s literally only used for comedy and its dumb.Antagonist is standard spoilt brat. Plot begins so wildly swing at concepts like world peace and trying to understand your enemy but completely ruins any kind of drama and suspense with the worst clichés and plot devices. Example - the final fight is our MC against the mail antagonist who has literally said he is going to kill his wife and child, burn his village and then kill him. During the ensuing fight the MC is constantly asking after the well-being of this guy. Imagine how trash a fight is where one guy hits another and then asks if he is ok.This ranks alongside some of the worst 1 dimensional garbage I\'ve ever seen. immediately after arriving.

That\'s my retired 2nd life, with the only regret being in my 30s.I can\'t believe my eyes to tell you that authors will keep trying to hem the exact same premises that does too similar to other works, with the only difference being that of how fast the progression will take that affects the enjoyability...as a whole. Such is the case for novelist Rokujuuyon Okazawa\'s Kaiko sareta Ankoku Heishi (30-dai) no Slow na Second Life a.k.a Chillin\' in My 30s after Getting Fired from the Demon King\'s Army, which is just Fall 2021\'s Shin no Nakama in a somewhat alternate storytelling setting that at the end of the day, is a rather mediocre retelling and is inferior on the heartwarming charm that said series has that I still remember to this day, even almost a year later. And all of this makes me want to re-watch Shin no Nakama again, that\'s how subpar average Kaiko Sareta is.I am not going to beat around the bush: the story plot and setting is the exact same as Shin no Nakama, only if you replace the MC with someone that\'s much older, that happens on the opposite side of the spectrum with the same aftereffects verdict of getting fired from the group, and everything from then on is how it would be dictated the same for a 1-to-1 refresh. Seeing the same storyline twice now, NGL that I got a little bit of hesitation that it would turn out to be what I remember from Shin no Nakama, but let\'s persevere on. The MC, 30-year-old Dariel, is actually a pretty decent helper on the Demon Lord\'s Army\'s side, aside from the same OP-ness that LN series like this love to extrapolate that fact. The stepson of Granverza, one of the four Demon Kings, unanimously gets fired from the somewhat incompetent stepbrother Bashverza, just for one insanely stupid reason: Dariel is magic-less. Down but not out, the encounter with a woman in the forest fleeing from a monster attack, Marika, provides Dariel with the second life that supplements his ""new"" journey of wandering aimlessly, of being the protector of their small but sizable Lux Village. Since then, Dariel has never looked back at the second life that he feels was graciously granted from a trivial decision made, because he is actually the servant (or aide rather) that holds the Demon Lord\'s Army altogether as its dependable secretary, that getting fired from there and spending his time chillin\' in his 30s, isn\'t an entirely bad prospect at all. If anything, the Demon Lord\'s Army stands to lose one capable and talented demon (that for the longest time, is actually human, that explains his zero compatibility for magic), and the person to blame for that mishap is the General himself: Bashverza.Being voiced by Tomokazu Sugita (which he has done the role for Mushoku Tensei\'s Rudeus Greyrat), I\'m sure that you can already tell that there is some level of ecchi involved, especially with the lead female Marika herself, being the typical large boobs girl that\'s the closest to Dariel\'s level as an adventurer if he simply didn\'t exist to begin with. That, with his sudden appearance, Dariel slowly beginning to get a foothold of Marika\'s Lux Village and identifies his role for being there, both as an upcoming adventurer and having a major role progressively as its official mayor, this second life was what he wanted and more, seemingly at first glance. But this becomes clear that the conflict between humans and demons is a never-ending battle, and his inclusion earns the disruption from fellow people around him in many ways.The next probable up-and-coming adventurer to protect Lux Village, Gashita is a young man that\'s jealous of Dariel when he first appeared onto the scene that immediately, his position as the protector of the village gets compromised with the obvious jealousy. Knowing this, Dariel simply confides that he isn\'t there to compete with him, but rather with the patience in teaching him to become a dependable adventurer, earns the reliability and assurance overtime that results in a win-win approach. As do to the one adventurer that gets on his nerves fast, Fitbitan and his guild band of teammates don\'t like the fact that Dariel is suddenly taking over the operations of Lux Village faster than intended, so much so that Fitbitan\'s over-inflated ego causes them to begin the infighting, until the matter is resolved with the typical duel. But more so than others, it\'s the venerable colleagues and family relations that Dariel has always worked together with: the demon aide Rizet, the Demon Kings of Granverza and Zebiantes, heck, even the Hero\'s Party with its former hero Alantsil, that got to see firsthand of Dariel\'s transformation in the village, being more suited to the average commoner\'s life than one of servitude, and it shows that when he was kicked out by Bashverza, there is no turning back towards the Demon Lord\'s Army to have a better second life altogether. They may be picky about the choices that Bashverza has made to oust Dariel, but this I feel tied the bond much closer and better than ever before.But of course, how can I talk about Dariel without talking about Marika, the woman who single-handedly changed his life all around. Remember last season\'s Noumin Kanren with son Al Wayne and his over-tender loving mother Lucia? This is exactly the same thing with the two here, which barring from all of the obviousl romantic interests made, is actually also a decent adventurer herself. But she\'s mostly known for being the support character towards Dariel, maybe too often with her loving tendencies for Dariel, especially with the huge Knocker boobs that Tomokazu Sugita himself displays his inner Rudeus of wanting more skinship and affection so badly, to the point of marriage and raising a family together. It\'s not all bad for the two of them, and what happened in all of this, I think it came out decent, but nothing surprising since this trope has been played too many times over.The production of this show is also unsurprisingly average. Spearheaded by studio Encourage Films and its in-house director-cum-president representative Fumitoshi Oizaki, there is nothing that screams ""Sakuga!"" in the slightest sense, and for a 3rd-rate studio, I\'ve probably expected this much, as opposed to the show that the studio produced before this (Deaimon) that is surprisingly wonderful to watch. I always held back on the belief that Encourage Films is trying to branch out to many genres and finding something that works, but while it has clearly worked for Deaimon, action shows like these are unfortunately the size of grated cheese that doesn\'t slice just as nice. It\'s just to be expected, that\'s all.Even the music is average. Hinano and Akari Kitou\'s songs are surprisingly good...if you take into the context of the OP and ED respectively as a whole. Other than that, it\'s just average and forgettable as heck.I would be lying if I said that I\'d rather re-watch Shin no Nakama than this show, but the obtuse fact is that really, Shin no Nakama is much grounded and better than Kaiko Sareta in every other way. There\'s just nothing magical about this show, other than it being a copy-paste alternate variant of the same sub-genre that it came from, and it\'s forgettable at best. If you want to try this show, just try once, and never look back at how much time you\'d lost at watching something that\'s perfectly mediocre, when you could be wasting time watching other better series instead.

Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6974/Seikimatsu_Occult_Gakuin,"['One of the biggest problems with anime is that all too often what you\'re watching just doesn\'t hit the mark. There are a number of shows that have been great conceptually, but when it comes to execution they simply do not fulfill their potential.

Whatever the case may be, there are far too many anime out there that simply do not cut the mustard because they don\'t do enough with what they...have.And then there\'s the shows like Seikimatsu Occult Gakuen (End of Century Occult Academy).Originally developed as part of Anime no Chikara, a project run by TV Tokyo\'s anime department in conjunction with Aniplex, Seikimatsu Occult Gakuen is the third release from that stable (the previous two being Sora no Woto and Senkou no Night Raid), and marks the full directorial debut of Itou Tomohiko.Set in the fictional Waldstein Academy which sits atop Mount Minakami in Matsushiro, Nagano Prefecture, the story begins with Kumashiro Maya disembarking from the bullet train. She is the daughter of the academy\'s principal and founder Kumashiro Junichiro, and has returned to the city to attend the funeral of her estranged father. Along the way, her taxi driver tells her about some of the strange rumours surrounding the academy because of its focus on all things supernatural.On the surface Sekimatsu Occult Academy has a fairly reasonable set up. The plot is, initially, pretty straight forward, and there even seems to be some signs of an intelligent story at certain points during the first episode. Unfortunately, all of that promise quickly goes out of the window during the rest of the series.For some reason the writers thought there wouldn\'t be enough going on in an academy that focuses specifically on the supernatural, so they decided to add other things to it. In a sense, Occult Academy has pretty much everything in it that Suzumiya Haruhi wanted, from ghosts and witches, to time travellers and dimensional aliens.The problem is, it\'s simply too much for the series to handle.Occult Academy starts off reasonably well, but the rapid addition of so many threads to an already burgeoning plot ends up giving the series less focus, and it seems that this was simply too much for a rookie series director to handle. The numerous and disparate aspects of the story all begin to come together towards the end of the series though, but the story has an inherent predictability that seems to be an offshoot of adding too much.In all honesty, if the series had added one or two more supernatural aspects, then it may very well have collapsed under its own weight. The plot has a certain fragility because of the amount of information in the anime, and this makes it difficult to take the story seriously (especially with those little comedy scenes thrown in for good measure). That said, some people may find the show enjoyable because of the oddness surrounding Maya and her crew.Talking about odd, while the series looks pretty good overall, one can\'t help but wonder at some of the designs in the show. A-1 Pictures and Xebec have made Occult Academy look pretty good for the most part, but looks are only skin deep. The characters are designed reasonably well and have their own individual attributes, but there\'s a certain amount of stereotype at play in this department. The short haired girl is a jock, the glasses girl is a geek, etc, etc. It would be nice if the creators put more thought into the character design as personally I\'d like to see some of those stereotypes finally put to rest. One other problem is the level of fanservice involved in the show as it really isn’t necessary, and it makes one wonder exactly who the target audience is supposed to be.That said, the facial expressions are usually pretty well realised (althought it is sometimes difficult to tell if Maya is tense or constipated).In addition to the design, the animation is of a pretty decent standard as well, except for certain occasions where the character movements seem ... odd. Thankfully these occasions are fairly few and far between, but they are noticeable when they occur. One also has to wonder if Maya likes the short dress she generally wears as she has one with exactly the same design during the flashbacks to her childhood.Another aspect of the show that\'s odd is the acting. Hikasa Youko and Mizushima Takahiro are pretty good as Maya and Fumiaki (or Bunmei, whichever name you prefer to call him by), and the rest of the cast deliver some perfectly decent performances throughout. What\'s odd though, is that even with some decent acting the characters just don\'t seem to work. The audience is given nothing to sympathise or empathise with, and while some may believe this to be due to poor acting, in actuality its down to a poor script.The sound quality is decent throughout the series, but one of the problems with Occult Academy is the music, or rather, the choreography. The tracks on offer are well chosen but there are several scenes where they just don\'t seem to mesh with the on screen action. In addition to this the OP, which is a fairly typical J-rock track called ""Flying Humanoid"" by Nakagawa Shouko, works well as an opening theme, but the opening sequence itself doesn\'t seem to work with the music. As for the ED, ""Kimi ga Iru Basho"" by Takagaki Ayahi is a decent enough song as well, but again the ending sequence makes no sense (unless images of a girl and boy lying in grass are your thing).It\'s not that the music itself is bad, but rather its implementation is a bit strange.As I mentioned before the acting is decent enough, but the characters lack any real depth for the entirety of the series. One of the biggest problems with Occult Academy is that there is simply too much going on at any one time, and because of this the characters seem like nothing more than by-products of the plot. The overly complicated storyline precludes any real growth or characterisation, especially for Maya and Fumiaki, and it\'s not until the final few episodes that they actually start to develop. Even then the storyline gets in the way, which is a shame as some of the characters, especially Fumiaki, had some very interesting histories which really warranted more of a look.Sekimatsu Occult Gakuen is a decent enough series that toys with some interesting ideas, but doesn\'t really go any further than that. The problem is that the story is far too complicated for its own good, and because of this everything else in the show seems to have been thrown off course. It may have seemed like a good idea on paper, but like so many other things like that, the result is nothing more than a decent looking anime with no real substance.That said, there are several interesting plot points that even I found distracting, but they\'re not enough to support the weight of an entire series and all its characters. Granted there may be viewers who don\'t mind that the plot seems to have been hammered together from one of Haruhi\'s delusions, but it just wasn\'t enough for me as there is little in the way of justification for anything that happens in Occult Academy.It\'s a shame really, but the quality of releases from Anime no Chikara seems to be dropping by degrees, and Sora no Woto remains the best title from that stable so far. have.And then there\'s the shows like Seikimatsu Occult Gakuen (End of Century Occult Academy).Originally developed as part of Anime no Chikara, a project run by TV Tokyo\'s anime department in conjunction with Aniplex, Seikimatsu Occult Gakuen is the third release from that stable (the previous two being Sora no Woto and Senkou no Night Raid), and marks the full directorial debut of Itou Tomohiko.Set in the fictional Waldstein Academy which sits atop Mount Minakami in Matsushiro, Nagano Prefecture, the story begins with Kumashiro Maya disembarking from the bullet train.

Well, Occult Academy for 13 episodes is looking for something, but it isn\'t the the highest priority. Time Traveler Fumiaki ""Bunmei"" and Prinicpal Kamashiro Maya are looking for the illusive ""Nostradamus\' Key"" in order to prevent the world from ending in 1999.Anime no Chikara is a project designed to create ""original"" anime series. Which, they have no problem in doing. The major fault of these series is that everything building up to the climax has little to nothing to do with the actual story. Taking example of Sora...no Woto, in my opinion the best of Anime no Chikara\'s projects (not because it was K-ON! with guns). But it had this same ordeal, but the earlier episodes always had that looming threat of war just beyond the border. Most people we\'re too distracted by the cute. But Occult Academy suffers greatly from this problem.The show isn\'t terrible, it\'s enjoyable. But other shows have done the occult idea better and have expanded upon what this show only touches. I know when people usually see my reviews the show is usually terrible. But this show also lacks some common sense in the way the story is played out.Onto good points. The art of Occult Academy is something I love. It\'s this nice, crisp, refined style that is truly original. It truly matches every character\'s traits.Which lead me into characters. The character traits are just kind of blasted at you the moment they come screen. Maya\'s character is the only character that truly jumps out at me when I think about Occult Academy, all the other characters are enjoyable, but I was kind of hoping for some more. Some characters are just kind of there for the ride and to fight things. Which is ""all right"", I suppose.Music. Music is sometimes occult stuff and sometimes it\'s not. When it\'s not something chanting or something dark or spooky to get you into thinking ""occult"" you get this nice traditional folk to bring you away from everything occult. I couldn\'t handle this show if everything was occult. That\'s an overload.There\'s some issues with how the story plays out though. There\'s that ten episodes of introduction and build-up and it\'s swiftly all explained in about five seconds? Oh. Kind of a bummer, I was hoping it had a greater purpose then just being an obstacle.The biggest thing that will bother most is the search for the Key itself. Maya and Bunmei will purposefully hold off looking for it. Let\'s go over what the characters don\'t know. They don\'t know what the Key is. They don\'t know where the Key will be located. They don\'t know what will happen with the Key when they find it. They don\'t know any of this. Yet, they hold it off until a couple of weeks before the world ends. You can\'t just put that off to solve over things. I don\'t get it. They could\'ve made this series one long adventure to finding the key. Instead you get this? It\'s kind of disappointing. The storytelling was alright, but it had so much potential.Maya\'s spell book bothers me. In one episode, Bunmei says that she has her father\'s spell book on her person all the time. If that\'s the case, why doesn\'t she ever use it? It\'s a book full of spells and they use it twice. Her father left her the spell book to protect her from evil and to use against evil. The most she uses against evil is a crossbow and she doesn\'t use the spell book to figure anything out; or learn about her father. Just some important things that would\'ve been better if used correctly. Maybe Maya was afraid of getting tongue tied in the middle of fighting. That would be embarrassing to the viewers.Also, disregard for the fact that other humans might be in the same situation as Akari. They never look for anyone else that might\'ve been captured. Just a ""grab your friend and run"" deal. It\'s sometimes obvious too, because there are bones and cocoons and stuff. Yeah, it\'s just something stupid, right?If you like occult stuff, you should give this a try. It\'s a neat concept. It\'s just average. no Woto, in my opinion the best of Anime no Chikara\'s projects (not because it was K-ON! with guns).

We don\'t know that much yet but from what I\'ve seen it\'s pretty good so far.Art 8:I love the animation in this series. It\'s very smooth and I can\'t spot many mistakes. Character designs are simple but I still like them a lot. I also really like the art style. The opening is very well animated is very nice to look at....Sound 8:It\'s really hard for me to comment on the overall music of a series since I don\'t really notice the BGM until I listen to the OST. The reason I gave this an 8 though is because of the opening and ending themes. I have had both of them stuck in my head for days now and often catch myself singing them. The opening really gets you pumped for the episode. The singer really puts a lot of emotion into both of the songs and I can\'t wait until the full version of the opening is released.Character 8:Like the story, we don\'t know much about the characters yet but I still love them. I like the fact the Maya downplays the Tsudere trope and is a pretty likeable character. Uchieda is also pretty likeable but we don\'t know much about him. The side characters (Ami, Kouze, Chihiro, JK etc.) are also great and they\'re all very funny (especially Chihiro xD I burst out laughing at her scenes).Enjoyment 9:I love this series so far. It manages to make you laugh and scare you at the same time. At the end of each episode I always say ""I don\'t wanna wait another week!"" because I really want to know what happens next. The comedy is great and you\'ll find yourself laughing every episode.Overall 9:So far Occult Academy is a great series.

I\'m not saying that is the best thing out there, but it\'s actually pretty good on his own way. Please, read everything, is worthily!Let\'s start with some probable obviously things. Bunmei is coming from the summer of 2012, like we all know in the moment that I\'m writing that this is the very famous ""end of the world"", on 21 December. And where is going Bunmei? In 1999, to stop the prophecy of Nostradamus for 21 July. Actually till now there was many endings of the world, but 1999...together with 2012 are really big ones. The prophecy of Nostradamus was something real in ""our world"" and many people believed in it, but we are still kicking asses as ever...Let\'s talk a little about the best writer right now, Steven King. Did you read his book ""The Dark Tower"". It\'s a strange adventure horror with a lot of strange things like cowboys and shits. In this book he use many things from movies, other books, songs and shits... Not only like parody, but actually he create an complete other thing from them. Actually many people believe that the prophecy was for King. Near 21 July King almost die in incident, but he didn`t. This people think that the ""The Dark Tower"" is like a reflection of an other world, probable parallel to our. They think that King is important  connection  between the worlds and if he couldn`t write the book the balance of the universe would brake and the world would end. One of the bad guys in the book come in our world trying to kill King, but he was stopped from the good guys and the prophecy of Nostradamus was stopped and King finish his book.Why I\'m writing all this? Because in ""Occult Academy"" they use things like that too! For example, the future that they show us is like something that is come from ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Terminator"". They didn`t just use movies things, but a lot of anime stuff, like some typical anime characters and even things like magic girls. But it\'s maybe kind of hard to take everything like parody? This is because not everything is parody, but there still there is a lot of from it, but it use in other way too (kind of confusing xD). So... For exaple think about all shity animes that you watch... Now thing about ""Occult Academy""... Isn\'t it something kind of wrong? All of the characters in this anime are actually maturate people! Yeah! This animes is good exactly in this, by using many stereotype things making something complete new from it that actually is even full of philosophy, but it\'s not easy to find.In many animes the names of the heroes have some meaning, but here they are really, really important! They are include in every name of the episodes and if you switch there place with there meaning they make something new! I will give you there meaning replace them on your own, Bunmei - civilization, knowledge; Maya - illusion; (ka)Mikaze -  divine wind, Kozue - treetop(check on google for more info); Ami - net, friend; Akari - light.I\'m an assohle so I will give you many keys, but I will not told you which one is for the door and which door, because this way is more good and more interesting. Think well about the name of the episodes and what happen in them, and  while doing that, remember ""What important are the things you can`t see with your eyes"" and try to see the things that it one to tell us about the humans, the occult and the society.But still i give him 8/10, because I\'m fan of the real goods scary/horror storyies and that wasn`t horror at all, but it\'s not even on the genres even. Still they could do it way more seriously and to use the occult for really scary things and to can say to us the same thing. And the ""not seriously"" seriously of the anime in some moments was going a little to far and was even a little annoying.P.S. Sorry for my poor writing skills on this language, and of course you always have the right to think about me like an idiot, because i believe that this animes is actually good. But you are human too, therefore you are an idiot too.P.S.2 The end was kicking fucking asses all over the place! together with 2012 are really big ones.

But you are human too, therefore you are an idiot too.P.S.2 The end was kicking fucking asses all over the place!', '\'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin\' (Turn of the Century Occult Academy) is the third and final installment of \'Anime no Chikara\' (Power of Anime) Project by TV Tokyo and Aniplex, following \'Sora no Oto\' and \'Senkou no Night Raid\'.Story: 5/10As the title suggests, the setting is in an Occult Academy in 1999, a school notorious for study of the pseudoscience. Series of paranormal incidents have been observed in the academy in recent months, including the one where the dean was killed. Soon after the dean\'s daughter returns, a psychokinetic \'time agent\' descends from the sky, and together, the duo seeks Nostradamus\' Key, which supposedly was the cause...of the apocalypse as predicted in the prophecy.The show started off very strong, quickly introducing the main characters, the premise, and the mission.The story gets episodic after a while. It seems the producers are more interested in introducing occult trivia than actual development of the story.The team encounter various paranormal events, so much at one point that it bothered me how they so conveniently and easily came across occult mysteries, which by definition should not be so easily found. To my surprise, all was explained by a dark magician as the culprit. At first, I was turned off by seemingly rushed sum up, but after a second thought, it was extremely appropriate since magic is the most well-known occult mystery.There were still a whole bunch of plot holes though... why does Ramachandran-Fischer conjecture result in alien invasions anyway? Not to mention all the time travel paradoxes of the ending.The story overall was nothing out of ordinary and sometimes even predictable, but the pacing was good enough to keep me interested throughout the series.Character: 6/10Maya is a tsundere, oh wait, that word didn\'t exist yet... she\'s just another girl who\'s not honest with her feelings. Toward both Fumiaki and the occult. Fumiaki on the other hand is a typical loser whose incompetence knows no limit, and easily gets carried away. In fact, he\'s practically Nobita from Doraemon series. Despite this, both characters come with a dark past that they eventually learn to overcome through their adventures.All the side characters though, are grossly underused. We know absolutely nothing about their pasts, and their characters were flat to the end. Perhaps they gave the leading couple more screen time to develop, but I can\'t help but feel they existed simply to advance otherwise impossible plots.JK pops up whenever someone goes missing and needs to be found. Smile just follows JK and beat the crap out of bad guys. Mikaze turned out to be a villain behind all the occult incidents around the academy, but it was never explained what she had to gain by letting aliens rule the world...Animation: 7/10Background art was extremely detailed, just like in \'Sora no Oto\'. It was also noticeably lacking motion, but had far better texture and engaging.Unlike \'Sora no Oto\', character design this time was very original, with unique faces, hair, and signature stockings + heels, suits + ahoge, and accessories (dowsing rods, wrench, glasses/blindness etc) that made each character memorable.Characters really lacked details, especially compared to the awesome backgrounds, but made up for it by incredibly realistic face/body expressions that seemed to flawlessly convey their state of mind.Animation in general was decent, but occasional 3D-CG-assisted camera movement was absolute disaster.Sound: 7/10I really liked Mikaze\'s voice. It sounded like an ordinary cute girl voice, but there was a certain cold, eeriness in her speech that worked very well for her character. Rest of the cast was average.BGM was nothing remarkable and sometimes even hard to notice. Although the sound effects were pretty good.OP/ED were catchy songs, though ED animation was a head-scratcher... Mannequins? 3D-CG? Photoshopped picture?Enjoyment: 8/10The message of this show was great, that we should always keep an open mind, that we should stand on our own feet and walk our own path.I feel this series would\'ve been a huge success to younger audiences if they made skirts couple of inches longer, toned down Mikaze\'s seduction, and broadcast in daytime.\'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin\' is a horrible show if you watch it as an occult anime because it attempts to deal with too many occult mysteries in too few episodes and technically filled with flaws, but it\'s fascinating if you watch it as a fantasy/adventure anime. It\'s got dreams and shows the allurement of existence of the supernatural.I dropped \'Senkou no Night Raid\' after 2nd episode, but I think it\'s safe to say that \'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin\' is the best series in \'Anime no Chikara\' Project, because well, it\'s the only one that shown me the power of anime.""[The Occult] do no exist in reality...

As long as you don\'t believe in them."" Watch this series with an open mind.', 'About this show there are 2 things: 1. the main girl is hot (I love white one-piece) but 2. everything is RANDOM and UNIMPRESSIVE.This show is a failed mix of supernatural, comedy, and slice of life, revolving an UN-CUTE (even though hot) girl Maya and a super-PATHETIC ex-esper time-traveling-by-force young man Bunmei (which literally means ""modern"") in their journey to search for the ""Notradamus\'s key"" to break the prophecy about the End Day in 2012 and solve the mystery behind the school principal\'s death.The show is meant to explore occult mysteries which, in common knowledge, consist of objects, monsters, phenomena, and spells. A supporting character...called Haruse develops an obsession of searching for occult things and she did nothing but spontaneously popping out and bringing up some random occult OBJECTs (e.g. OOPart) or phenomena (e.g. poltergeist) which had nothing to do with the story. So far unrelated MONSTERs appeared randomly without any reason. The only notable PHENOMENON in the storyline is 2012 apocalypse, which is alien invasion in this case. Finally, there was only one silly SPELL that turns the corpse into an undead. The spell book which Maya coincidentally discovered and inherited from her father was never used...Story: 5The foundation of the universe in this show is not consistent. Most objects and phenomena brought up by character Haruse are not real and based on her imagination and obsession, which implies that this universe is just a normal world where ""occult"" literally means ""hidden secret."" But then those MONSTERs just showed up like they should have always been there to show up...Also, there is completely no flow because a lot of unnecessary details (some for comedic purpose) get in the way, e.g., vice-president\'s crust, Bunmei\'s affair with the landowner\'s daughter, Ami(Maya\'s close friend)\'s dad\'s affection toward Maya and his silly occult prank.Such slice of life scenes are too bleak and unnecessarily long.Art: 8Good anyway. Maya looks hot, white one-piece is hot...Sound: 6Voices and soundtrack score are good but the OP and ED are totally out of place with the show\'s content: OP is so-so and can be used for any anime. ED is a common piece about love while there\'s completely no romance in this show. I wouldn\'t regard Bunmei\'s affair with the landowner\'s daughter as a romance because when they were separated in a dark cave and even after the whole cave was detonated, he didn\'t give a darn about his girl and kept acting loony until he found her outside, mysteriously safe and sound.Character: 6No depth, little background. Main girl is uncute, main guy pathetic, the occult-obsessed Haruse shallow, and Ami the close friend unreasonable. Even the save-the-Earth committee in 2012 are a bunch of idiots because they picked Bunmei the beggar on the street to travel time and take on the mission of finding the ""Notradamus\'s key.""Enjoyment: 6Great disappointment.Overall: 6For one-time watching and cheap entertainment. called Haruse develops an obsession of searching for occult things and she did nothing but spontaneously popping out and bringing up some random occult OBJECTs (e.g. OOPart) or phenomena (e.g. poltergeist) which had nothing to do with the story.

At this point (episode 7) it tries to keep story steady, but it\'s more like drama with scars from past and trying to overcome them, with some occult elements that aren\'t impressive.Art: Average in my opinion. Backgrounds are made well, but characters are somewhat plain and facial expressions can only show basic. Coloring is rather depressing with more darker tones that light.Sound: OP isn\'t the kind I would like, it\'s like most of anime OP\'s wihout any thought on the anime it\'s used to. ED is good as standalone song and...again not suited here.Characters: Tsundere, wimp and other friends. Rather mainstream setup for best anime sales. They can be more hated, than loved and it concludes it.Enjoyment: Well, I started this anime with no great expectations so i\'m not really disappointed. It\'s watchable and you can find something interesting, but there won\'t be the feeling - ""What\'s next? CAN\'T WAIT TO SEE!"".

This concludes my first review, which is rather poor.', 'The problem with writing reviews is in the categorizing of the actual text being reviewed. In this case: supernatural, comedy, sci-fi, etc etc.For an anime of its genre, I feel like Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin might have missed the mark in some respects. The premise is interesting of course, but what really made this anime special for me was the characters --specifically the mains.Let\'s break this down shall we?STORY: 6/10I love the premise. It\'s interesting, engaging and has enough unique elements here and there to keep us relatively intrigued about what is to come. However, what really irks me is the overwhelming amount of content...crammed into 13 episodes. I feel like alot of this was far too rushed. You have aliens, witches, ghosts, demons --practically every supernatural being imaginable, which I don\'t really mind, but they\'re all crammed together into some kind of nonsensical mush.I feel like this anime was designed for a much longer duration but forcibly cut down --badly at that. I would have loved to see a deeper exploration into the 2012 future scenario. It would have been nice also to have a few strange plot holes filled...HOWEVER, don\'t push this anime aside just yet.In my opinion, the plot holes here and there don\'t take away from the original premise of the story. This whole idea of the Nostradamus Key, the alien technology, the magic --there\'s something about it. If you just suspend reality a little more than you would usually, sit back and really try to feel the anime, the story is still very enjoyable.Why? Well, pretty much because everything BESIDES the bad story progression (and I stress PROGRESSION, because the actual story isn\'t really that bad), makes this anime worth watching.ART: 10/10Rarely do you see an anime with such outstanding quality. The character designs are elaborate, clean and unique. The backgrounds are gorgeously detailed, and the colours are really engaging. I can\'t rave about the art enough. I absolutely adored it. Seriously, you could probably sit through all 13 episodes just for the art.SOUND: 8/10Shouko Nakagawa\'s ""Flying Humanoid"" is a great opening theme for this show. I particularly liked the way they integrated it into the opening sequence. Typically you\'d probably think there would be heaps of action montages attached to this kind of song --but they went for a far more abstract expression, which I think is extremely refreshing. It really highlights the unique aspects of this anime.Ayahi Takagaki sings the ending ""Kimi ga iru basho"" (The place where you are). The ending sequence is really different. No, really. They use real actors. It was really uncanny how they found two children that looked almost exactly like Bunmei and Maya. The song itself is sweet and very fitting for an ending theme. Definitely no complaints.CHARACTER: 8/10If it was a review on the main characters alone I would give it a 10, but unfortunately I have to include the others as well. Don\'t let that discourage you though. The only failing in the supporting characters is that there is very little development for them. Probably because there were only 13 episodes.The main characters, however, were the primary reason I kept watching. The chemistry between Maya and Bunmei is addictive to watch. Sure, they may seem like your typical useless guy x tsundere, but stop. Just stop right there. Because in just 13 episodes, we see remarkable character development on their part, especially for Bunmei.As much as they were a little stereotypical, there was someone very human about Bunmei and Maya\'s relationship. You\'ll find yourself watching the show just for them, and in doing so, their relationship will probably leave a very lasting impression on you. Again, it\'s just such a pity that there were only 13 episodes, because I feel like the producers had alot more planned for their character developments. Still, something must be good if it leaves you craving for more.ENJOYMENT: 7/10The first five episodes were a little slow paced for me, character development-wise, but really that\'s to be expected. I think it\'s more that the contrast between the pace of the first half of the series and second was a bit of a shock. It may be because the series ended so quickly that it leaves you with a sense of wanting so much more that takes away from the general enjoyment.Still, again, a sign of something good right? Besides...the manga is currently being serialized so it\'s something to look forward to. lolOVERALL: 8/10The only thing that holds me back from a higher score for this is the length of the show. If they had just stretched it out to maybe five or six more episodes, I feel like this could have been fleshed out so much better. That said, I still recommend this for anyone who enjoys watching anime with a little action, a little mystery and great character development.Honestly, the relationship between Maya and Bunmei has me so smitten I keep going back to watch episodes 6-13, just for them. But don\'t get me wrong! They\'re not very sparkly-lovey-dovey --if anything, the romance element is a little downplayed, which makes it all the more wonderful to watch. There\'s nothing worse than being smacked over the head with sparklings and bad music, and there is NONE of that here. It is a genuine, human, and beautiful kind of relationship we get to see here, set in a story that is interesting and relatively different.Oh, and don\'t get me wrong. There\'s alot of ass-kicking as well. I\'m not one for romance-only animes --just read my other reviews. If the idea of love turns you green, then the action scenes will settle you for sure. crammed into 13 episodes. I feel like alot of this was far too rushed.

This story is a combination of that and the movie Ghostbusters.  Although, it combines them separately.  It\'s as if two separate entities have been born within one anime.--  An anime that turns into nothing more than the daily adventures of the ghost club was actually meant to be a well-thought out flow of events.--  Imagine you watched a movie, now then, have a 12 year-old go back and fill in 4 and a half hours worth of screen time.--...There were so many plot holes that I\'m amazed the developers aren\'t cripples yet.--  Now include, the most forced romance since Edward Elric and Eren Jaeger.Art = 6--  The characters and scenery fit the setting quite well.--  Each individual pretty much adds his or her own flavor to the series and only enhances the scenes.--  There are a few lazy looking moments throughout the anime, but nothing that can\'t be overlooked.Sound = 4--  There were times where the music would just kill the mood.  At other times it was a good addition.  Most likely a result of the on-going identity crisis that went on throughout the anime.--  The character voices were pleasing.

They were honestly ridiculous and not in a comedic way.--  The two main characters did develop, but it felt like a rick-roll.Enjoyment = 2--   Some very good things were here.  Sadly someone bought a lot of screen time and suddenly didn\'t know what to do with it.--  Enough good scenes and developments to have made two separate anime.

There are simply too many superior choices in whatever genre one wanted from Occult Academy.', 'Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin, aka: ""Occult Academy"", is fairly new, with only 2+ episodes aired. And because it is so new, I can\'t say I have much to base the storyline on. I gave it a ""10"", mostly to show my high hopes for it. Having said that, they managed to fill the void of two episodes with enough plot twists to drive me crazy (in a good way). And they managed to fit in a lot of background without having to resort to a narrated picture show that explains. Nope, instead, they did it the better way. Through hints and scenes and flashbacks; very entertaining....And I love the Mystery/Suspense-Thriller feel to the show (it just made me want more!).Art: The art was really beautiful, I have to say. I hadn’t expected its attention to detail to be so well done. In most anime’s all you get is plain, standstill images behind moving characters, but in Occult you had very detailed settings complete with an overgrown forest and the palace-like building in the center of it. The characters themselves have a very realistic way of walking, not the usual bouncing-and-moving-legs you see in other shows. I was impressed, to say the least. 10Sound: The music was very beautiful, setting you up for suspense or awe, Tanaka (sound director) did a great job picking out the music. The sound-effects weren’t bad, but they weren’t drop-dead amazing either. They resembled a computer game actually, with the echoing footsteps and sounds that disappeared when you change camera angles (birds, fountain, etc). 8Characters: They wasted no time in introducing the tuff-love protagonist, Maya Kumashiro. And after only the first episode you have a clear look at her persona: intelligent and resourceful, with a deep hatred for the Occult, easily irritated and could care less about what other people feel or think. And while her fashion sense is a little too riskay for my taste, she’s still an interesting character. 8Enjoyment: You wouldn’t think there was much that could happen in 2 episodes, right? Wrong. Already they’ve thrown you into ‘Occult Academy’, tossed in a time-traveler, thrown in two near-death experiences and a possible conspiracy,  and none of this is even the driving storyline of the show (if that was considered a spoiler, I’m sorry). Very fun. While it IS on the perverted side, it’s not filming something awkward every minute of the episode. The humor is somewhat serious, but it’s enough to hint that the comedy will get better through the anime’s progression. Definitely a Mystery/Thriller with SOME (slight understatement) blood and gore, and tons of suspense. 10Overall, I enjoyed it. I recommend Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin, and while I normally can’t say I recommend animes to guys (I usually watch Shouji), this should have everyone glued to their computer screens. And I love the Mystery/Suspense-Thriller feel to the show (it just made me want more!).Art: The art was really beautiful, I have to say. I hadn’t expected its attention to detail to be so well done. In most anime’s all you get is plain, standstill images behind moving characters, but in Occult you had very detailed settings complete with an overgrown forest and the palace-like building in the center of it. The characters themselves have a very realistic way of walking, not the usual bouncing-and-moving-legs you see in other shows. I was impressed, to say the least. 10Sound: The music was very beautiful, setting you up for suspense or awe, Tanaka (sound director) did a great job picking out the music. The sound-effects weren’t bad, but they weren’t drop-dead amazing either. They resembled a computer game actually, with the echoing footsteps and sounds that disappeared when you change camera angles (birds, fountain, etc). 8Characters: They wasted no time in introducing the tuff-love protagonist, Maya Kumashiro. And after only the first episode you have a clear look at her persona: intelligent and resourceful, with a deep hatred for the Occult, easily irritated and could care less about what other people feel or think. And while her fashion sense is a little too riskay for my taste, she’s still an interesting character. 8Enjoyment: You wouldn’t think there was much that could happen in 2 episodes, right? Wrong.

How did I noticed it? I typed 'Yoko Hikasa' on Google and this title immediately attracted my attention. Normally anyone would expect an anime series with such a cool title to have a plot that also lives up to its name...STORY:... But no.The one lesson I learnt after completing this anime series was 'do not judge a book by its cover'. You have your academy which focuses on teaching its students all about the occult rather than normal textbook knowledge, interesting setting. You have your tsundere heroin and time-travelling esper...hero, a plus point. You have great setting-up, with a few hints here and there in the first few episodes that indicate this might turn out to be an awesome series.But, no. The audience was treated to a hell load of fillers after the first few episodes. While the fillers themselves look good independently, once tied into the very few plot-related episodes, you get a fail anime series with lack of proper planning and bad pacing.The one reason I hesitate to give the STORY part lower than 6 marks is because I enjoyed the many plot twists at the last episodes of the series. It was surprising that the writers could rush the final battle so 'well' despite terrible pacing throughout the show.ART:Now here's where Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin shines. The character designs looked good, and the animation throughout the run of the series were pretty smooth. Made me wonder how well the series would have done if they had devoted a bit more budget on hiring better writers and a bit less on the animation.SOUND:Ugh... no. Both the OP and ED are not something that I myself would look out for. Except for the first one, I basically skipped the OP and ED for every other episode. The soundtrack was also not memorable, something that you would not find in a thriller series like this.Moving on to the voice acting, somehow I felt that there was a lack of personality injected into the characters. Even for our main protagonist, Maya, I just felt that she lacked the 'tsundere'-ness that she was supposed to have.CHARACTER:Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin had great backstories for the characters, but failed miserably at developing them well. Maya and Bunmei hardly had any growth throughout the series, but instead we have the side characters, those that appeared one-shot for the fillers, who received the most treatment. Even the last episode failed to provide for them any form of development.OVERALL:The series had such great potential, but just lacked a coherent plot, which would have been achieved if the writers had done proper planning. Hope that the writers would learn from their mistakes and do a better attempt at such genres next time. hero, a plus point.

The story has a great basis, and arguably too much potential to squish it into 13 episodes.Despite this, I am largely of the opinion that, while they usually lack a singular plot-driving focus, the first ten episodes are QUITE enjoyable. The 'problem solving crew', while made up of your average cliches, makes for a good laugh, with exemplary facial expressions, and Maya, and sometimes Bunmei, find ways to make each episode interesting enough.After that however, it becomes glaringly obvious, in my opinion, that...the writers were scrambling to reincorporate the driving plot of the series, end of the world and all that, and they got more than a bit desperate/sloppy in tying off/together loose ends, jumping into new genres here and there.As a final note; I have several problems with the final episode, mostly preferential and logic based, what with the involvement of time travel and affecting the future and all, but that aside, I found the particular way the series ended to be very original and interesting.All in all, the series has many faults and, who knows, might leave you feeling a little disappointed like me, but I'd still recommend it as a series worth watching. the writers were scrambling to reincorporate the driving plot of the series, end of the world and all that, and they got more than a bit desperate/sloppy in tying off/together loose ends, jumping into new genres here and there.As a final note; I have several problems with the final episode, mostly preferential and logic based, what with the involvement of time travel and affecting the future and all, but that aside, I found the particular way the series ended to be very original and interesting.All in all, the series has many faults and, who knows, might leave you feeling a little disappointed like me, but I'd still recommend it as a series worth watching."", ""Let's start off with the basics.Art's on the cover, music's pretty mediocre, protagonists are slightly developed while everyone else is really shallow (but still hilarious).NOW ABOUT THE STORYThe ending to an anime is usually either good or bad. This particular series is more of an in between, only because the ending didn't give enough of an ending. It's too subtle. The loose ends that should have been tied up nearly choked me to death. I was very confused and bothered. Time traveling in anime does that.You could easily cut out the middle episodes, middle meaning 3 to 11. While there was some character development between...the two protagonists, that's about it. They're nice but they're irrelevant.In certain spots there's a touch of dramatic irony in that you know it's going to happen and the poor sap on-screen doesn't. There's also a sad episode, as this is about the occult which naturally leads us to ghosts which then leads us to a sad ghost story.It's definitely worth the time. But keep this in mind. if you over-analyze a magic trick and figure it out it sucks. Same with this show. Don't think about it too much, you'll just facepalm later either way. the two protagonists, that's about it.

I hope it goes well.I felt compelled to write this review on the Occult Academy because, I thought that this show would have great potential. I expected action, mystery, supernatural occurrences, a little romance and even a little history ... blah blah blah ...  I was so sadly mistaken.My expectations as previously mentioned were mixed in but diluted.  I honestly think the writers took a safe route.  I guess I just wanted more because the potential is truly there.The one thing I did like about this series is the artwork....It was clean and had a pretty realistic feel.Long story short...  I felt that this probably could have been a multi-season series.  The writers jammed way too much in and left out quite a bit for it to end the way it did.  The ending by the way without giving it away was one of the worst.  Who knew the key to the whole saga would be such a complex instrument?

It almost feels disrespectful towards the fans the way some endings are presented.Among the over 150 animes I\'ve watched the general feeling I got in 90% of the endings was ""Lalala, it\'s so nice doing an anime! Oh, wait, we have to finish it! Just come up with anything and let\'s call it a day!""Seriously! It\'s not that difficult doing an ending that goes along with the pace of the anime for pete\'s sake!When it comes to Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin, it\'s...not only the ending that makes no sense. Don\'t get the wrong idea, the anime is good, but they simply  proposed on doing something, to completely forget it during the series and remebered to pick it up again on the ending in a completely nonsense way.If this was simply an anime to tell the story of a group of teenagers facing supernatural occurrences it\'d have been an amazing one. After all there wouldn\'t be any kind of commitment to a larger story.And that\'s where Occult Academy went wrong. They offer you an interesting premise only to abandon it afterwards , and, even worse, to ""suddenly"" remember it on the very ending.This mistake has been repeating itself in SO many animes that it\'s getting on my nerves. If you don\'t know how you want to end a story, don\'t even get started!:@All that aside, this show can offer you an enjoyable ride if you\'re expecting little commitment to the plot. The side stories are very good. It\'s just the way they are told to be related to the larger story which is not very convincing.The art is the best part on this animation. It\'s really beautiful and well done. It\'s noticeable that some effort was put on this area which helps making this anime bearable til the end.The soundtrack on the other hand, has nothing special to it. Sometimes it felt kinda out of place, but nothing that would hinder the anime.The characters were cliches overall. Very few development, except for Maya, your typical tsundere, but at least with an interesting background.As I said before, it\'s an enjoyable ride if you focus on the side stories. After episode 11, however, I wouldn\'t even mind watching it. All I could get from episodes 11, 12 & 13 was a big WTF? not only the ending that makes no sense.

Also, you would tend to think that both Maya and his father were dead, again it all Chihiro's magic that deceives both friends and foe alike. So basically this anime really keeps your curiosity as to who really is the Nostradamus key is until in the end you find out that it was Bummei who all along is the Nostradamus Key and it was Maya's father whom unintentionally brought the Apocalypse to mankind, so for the story it really deserves an 8.For art, I'm very disgusted with the illustrator's fashion sense, especially when it comes to Maya's outfit, now c'mon, Maya in a white dress wearing long socks and white shoes? man! That's a big fashion NO, NO. What about Fumiaki's (Bummei) olive green suit? let see, it doesn't show any authoritative figure in it as a teacher and it can also be classified as a fashion disaster  especially when his trousers is too short and exposing his white socks that does not give any professionalism. As for the school uniform, I hate the way it's been drawn it makes the female student look dorky, but not for Maya who also wear a school uniform but with a different design  that distinguish her from the rest of the students. As for the 2 witches at first they both look dorky only to be hot in their true form.For the character, at first you'll think that Fumiaki (Bummei) is a useless chicken only to redeem himself in later episode, you'll also think that Maya hates all things that were supernatural but in later episodes she's seen helping a restless spirit who just wants a memorable Christmas and in the end she didn't close down her father's school, and she had a sotacon relationship with the younger Bummei.Over all I think that it just fair to rate this anime a fair as in fair enough to be watched.Occult Trivia: The Church of Satan was founded in April 30th 1966 in Walpurgisnacht, San Francisco California by Anton Szandor LaVey, he was also been seen with infamous criminal Charles Manson. the school is located.

When i read over my review i  just had to smack myself, literally. Reading what i wrote 2 years ago was just plain wrong, i was such a what? An anime lover? but i have come to judge more on that.Story:GOOD 7Why? I really enjoyed the plot of this anime, different and sophisticated and fulfilled my joy in watching this anime all over. It wasn't over-powered  by too much kind of shounen kind or shouji. But sometimes it might be too much to take in?! Not when you've already got a lot to take in from the 1st ep...but very consistent which made each episode detailed and very presentable.Art:GREAT 9I actually thought the art to this was very impressive, some bits of it gave off a Gantz kind of feel to it, the opening is which i loved, (For some strange reason), the colours and the textures and the way they present the angles and camera scenes was very much enjoyable to my entertainment. What i like about this is that it's not like Naurto style or Bleach or One Piece. Mostly that everything seems real and *puffs a air of laughter* sustainable xDSound:GOOD 7hmmmm not much i could really talk about here to be honest... With the ops and eds i really liked both of them. The opening was very enjoyable at the beginning with an upbeat 1,2,3,4 and a very talented singer, what's not to like? and the smoothing ending song that slowly drifts you away.I like the background sounds which makes it casual and it really fits in with anything. Whenever the tension rises the music keeps you tense too.Characters:GREAT 9I love each and every character's personality, the producer tries to make each and everyone unique i believe so... but to be honest they are just your average characters truthfully said wise. From a typical bossy lady to your typical shy guy that gets bossed around. Nothing special here really but they do tend to give you a twist.Enjoyment:VERY GOOD 8I don't see what's not there to like here and there. I seriously do think people are criticizing too harshly for a really good and entertaining anime that i would too like to watch again. The plot is planned out good, the anime is colourful, eye-catching and full of surprises packed into it. Each episode does sometimes keep you on suspense, wondering 'what's goning to happen next... will they be able to find the key?' that is the main question.Although everything did happen a bit too fast and i actually wanted more xDOVERALL:VERY GOOD 8I was judgemental at first.

You know, something like ghosts, aliens, and the whole ""end of the world"" conspiracy?   Well if you watch Occult Academy, then you will believe in more than what you expected.  If you love it or hate it, then this is the series just for you.  This series will keep you at the edge of your seat of what\'s going to happened...CharactersYou have a daughter of the Waldstien\'s Academy\'s headmaster, Maya Kumashiro.  Her appearence is a strict type female who has a huge...hatred towards the supernatural anything to do with it. After the death of her father, she hated the occult.  When a mysterious time traveler drop in front of Maya, Fumaki Uchida, within his mission is to find the Nostrodamus\' Key, which will open the gate way to hell and cause a huge damnation to the entire world.  Both of them have their different characteristics, Maya, she\'s strong-willed, stricted, and have zero-tollerance with anyone\'s bull crap, especially Fumaki\'s bull crap, when she discovered that Fumaki isn\'t a man that she think he is.  Fumaki was a major coward, yet a liar just to hide his true self, as a gutless unreliable loser.  When Fumaki was little, he has a huge psychic powers, yet his mom is forcing him to use his powers through personal gain such as fame and fortune, yet when he\'s grown, his powers are obsolute.  Also you have other supporting characters in the series, like Kozue, a long time friend of Maya and a huge occult otaku.  Ami, also a long time friend of Maya, and always keep Kozue in line before talking about the supernatural in front of Maya.  Also you have two best supporting characters who are extremly epic,  JK and Smile.  JK is the chubby guy who uses two metal bars just to locate anything that are paranomal and out of the ordinary.  Smile is a mechanic who always hangs around with JK.SettingThe setting takes place in 1999, where you had major consipracy theroies and predictions, such as the Y2K threat, the end-of-the-world theroies, but the process of armedgeddon would take place in July 21, 1999.  This was a perfect setting actually, due to some crazy theroies and consipracies through the time about when the world is going to end in a new milleninium.  Some people back then will think the future, we will be living in a cryptic world of machines dominate us all or the whole planet is in ruins thanks to World War III...  I say it was genius.PlotOk, I will like to say is the plot of the story is normal compare to other anime series I saw.  A male and female protaganists, situations to take care of, and a mysterious atagonist which will surprise you near the end of the series.  Speaking of suprises, the plots are very VERY surprising at times.  Needless to say, the ongoing of the surprises will keep you at the edge of the seat of what\'s going to happened next, or what\'s going to become an outcome of the story.  That\'s another thing I love the most.DownsideThis is where the nit-pick comes into play.  the ONLY thing that I hate the most in this series is Fumaki...YES the older version of Fumaki, Abe-sensei, Bunmei, Numbuh 6, whatever the heck his name is! I did mentioned earlier that he\'s a coward a liar.  I have NEVER seen a protagonist with such personality like that in my entire life!  He runs away from danger, he mostly leaving others behind during action, he\'s un-reliable at some sort, he never participate in anything that will help Maya out!  I know they are times he have helped out a few people, but SERIOUSLY!  All he wants is to hang around with that Mikaze character...and for some odd reason, Mikaze isn\'t effin\' right!  How can one guy fall in love so quickly?  Oh yeah...the boobies never lie...Other than that, the guy is weak, pathethic, and I just wish that Maya can do more than just beating the living crap outta him...Final VerdictThe anime is fun, breath-taking, and full of suprises.  They are other characters that I\'d enjoy the most, with the exception of Fumaki.  If you wanna see how the anime ended, I advise you to watch the anime itself.  If you already watch the anime, be sure you support it by buying or renting the DVDs.  If you love the occult like Kozue, and hate it, like Maya, then this series is defently for you. hatred towards the supernatural anything to do with it. After the death of her father, she hated the occult.  When a mysterious time traveler drop in front of Maya, Fumaki Uchida, within his mission is to find the Nostrodamus\' Key, which will open the gate way to hell and cause a huge damnation to the entire world.  Both of them have their different characteristics, Maya, she\'s strong-willed, stricted, and have zero-tollerance with anyone\'s bull crap, especially Fumaki\'s bull crap, when she discovered that Fumaki isn\'t a man that she think he is.  Fumaki was a major coward, yet a liar just to hide his true self, as a gutless unreliable loser.  When Fumaki was little, he has a huge psychic powers, yet his mom is forcing him to use his powers through personal gain such as fame and fortune, yet when he\'s grown, his powers are obsolute.  Also you have other supporting characters in the series, like Kozue, a long time friend of Maya and a huge occult otaku.  Ami, also a long time friend of Maya, and always keep Kozue in line before talking about the supernatural in front of Maya.  Also you have two best supporting characters who are extremly epic,  JK and Smile.  JK is the chubby guy who uses two metal bars just to locate anything that are paranomal and out of the ordinary.  Smile is a mechanic who always hangs around with JK.SettingThe setting takes place in 1999, where you had major consipracy theroies and predictions, such as the Y2K threat, the end-of-the-world theroies, but the process of armedgeddon would take place in July 21, 1999.  This was a perfect setting actually, due to some crazy theroies and consipracies through the time about when the world is going to end in a new milleninium.  Some people back then will think the future, we will be living in a cryptic world of machines dominate us all or the whole planet is in ruins thanks to World War III...  I say it was genius.PlotOk, I will like to say is the plot of the story is normal compare to other anime series I saw.  A male and female protaganists, situations to take care of, and a mysterious atagonist which will surprise you near the end of the series.  Speaking of suprises, the plots are very VERY surprising at times.  Needless to say, the ongoing of the surprises will keep you at the edge of the seat of what\'s going to happened next, or what\'s going to become an outcome of the story.  That\'s another thing I love the most.DownsideThis is where the nit-pick comes into play.  the ONLY thing that I hate the most in this series is Fumaki...YES the older version of Fumaki, Abe-sensei, Bunmei, Numbuh 6, whatever the heck his name is! I did mentioned earlier that he\'s a coward a liar.  I have NEVER seen a protagonist with such personality like that in my entire life!  He runs away from danger, he mostly leaving others behind during action, he\'s un-reliable at some sort, he never participate in anything that will help Maya out!  I know they are times he have helped out a few people, but SERIOUSLY!  All he wants is to hang around with that Mikaze character...and for some odd reason, Mikaze isn\'t effin\' right!  How can one guy fall in love so quickly?  Oh yeah...the boobies never lie...Other than that, the guy is weak, pathethic, and I just wish that Maya can do more than just beating the living crap outta him...Final VerdictThe anime is fun, breath-taking, and full of suprises.

The only downfall is that 13 episodes was a bit too short. There was not enough time to develop and build on the story line, its as if the writers either did not plan it out or forgot it was only 13 episodes. The story progresses each episode then in the last 3 episodes it takes a sharp left turn and rushes to get everything in for an ending. Some predictability and some unexpected twists.The concept of the story is great especially since it isnt an adaptation of a manga or novel.Art is great and very fitting...of the genre.I like both the OP and ED and the sound through out the series is well done not overbearing but not lacking or unfitting of the various events.The characters are not uncommon Maya who won't admit her love for the occult, Bunmei's uselessness, Naruse a featherbrained girl, whom strange things always happen to, yet they are memorable and their own.I feel if it had been 24-26 episodes instead it would have made it better. More adventures, occult occurrences and building on the characters along with the story leading up to the ending. Still a great watch despite abrupt change in pace, up to and after the feeling of being hit by a truck goes away. of the genre.I like both the OP and ED and the sound through out the series is well done not overbearing but not lacking or unfitting of the various events.The characters are not uncommon Maya who won't admit her love for the occult, Bunmei's uselessness, Naruse a featherbrained girl, whom strange things always happen to, yet they are memorable and their own.I feel if it had been 24-26 episodes instead it would have made it better.

Despite everything else the main plot is...still so original.The characters are not that memorable.

While it is somewhat complicated, most things make sense until the end of the show. However, I do agree that there were some things which could have been improved. At first glance, the show has mystery, horror, some funny moments, even a bit of romance. Seems to be great right? Unfortunately, the short number of episodes really seems to have hindered this anime. While the show does ""conclude"" the main plot, it seems to do so in a rush. For most of the 13 episodes, the show is a paranormal...mystery. The first few episodes of the show were done quite well, in my opinion. The middle episodes seemed to expand on the premise started. And while some episodes may be seen as a digression from the main storyline, they aren\'t unenjoyable in of them self, and most do have a hint of mystery every now and then, even in scenes where nothing seemingly out of the ordinary occur. However, as the episodes neared the end, I began to worry about the ending as there weren\'t many episodes left. I was left disappointed as the show suddenly used plot devices consistent with \'magical girl\' anime to wrap up the ending. If I wanted to watch a show with magical girls, I would have. It felt like the writers ran out of time to come up with a convincing ending, and chose to do so for plot convenience sake.Overall, I think this show would have been better if it were given an extra 4-5 episodes for character development and a less rushed ending. mystery.

Slice of life, friendship, and good vs. evil are some of what you\'ll find with this anime. Love it or hate it, that\'ll depend upon your personal tastes. Elements of sci-fi, magic, and the occult are what you\'ll experience.Story: 7/10The story starts and ends with a great bang. Everything in the middle may be slow to some, which is quite typical of having slice of life. Given the fact that the series is only 13 episodes, the story would not be very detailed. Certain things may not be answered, certain...things may simply be answered through implications. If given a bigger budget, perhaps extending the anime to 24 or 26 episodes would enable the series to achieve a more detailed story. Thus, pushing the score to 9/10.Art: 9/10Not much need to be said here, you\'ll see with your eyes. The animation is quite good. Everything is animated pretty well. The facial expressions of the characters are done well. Maya\'s annoyed and angry faces made towards our male protagonist, Fumiaki. Given the short length of this series, one major focus should be its animation, and it has done well.Sound: 9/10First off, the OP/ED songs were great. I especially loved the ED song, ""Kimi ga Iru Basho"". The seiyuus were great. Emotions were heard. The BGM hits the mark, to give an ""occult"" feel of eerie and mystery.Character: 8/10Similar to story, if given more episodes, characters would have been more fleshed out. But, still job well done. Maya is a strong, independent, young woman. Fumiaki was a coward, but eventually steps up to the plate. Between the two supporting characters Smile and JK, JK stands out more. Smile is your usual tough guy, who has a soft spot. JK is an overweight goth, who seemingly isn\'t very dependable. But of course, looks can be deceiving. JK is quite dependable as it turns out. He not only helps out his friends in need, but even has his unique skill to ""point"" them in the right direction. Vice principle, Chihiro is another character that stands out. She is usually serious and professional. But when it comes to her love life, she gets very girly.Enjoyment: 9/10Only those that like this anime for what it is, will enjoy it. It\'s an anime that showcases friendship, magic, time travel, and various problems that people deal with in real life. Many viewers mull over the aspects of time travel used in this anime. Time travel will not be the same in every setting that it\'s used in.

Nice animation, reasonable storylines, amusing characters and a nice twist for one. The ending gets my approval for taking time-travel seriously. But I felt confused at the end - I had gone in expecting tsundere+supernatural action somewhat like _Fate/stay Night_ but got a Miyazaki-style tale about the importance of relationships. I think?

The writers of this show were clearly capable, as even repeated gags within the anime are not overused or exhausted even by the last episode.Of course, all the wonderful animation and beautiful music in the world mean nothing if you don't care about the characters they follow. Fortunately, this is far from the case. Each character is wonderfully developed and fleshed out, and all have their little endearing quirks that make them all too easy to fall in love with.

Visuals are very nice, and character designs are interesting, plus there is nice music here and there. The story, however, has huge plot holes in it, ridiculous story turns, and characters, despite being nicely drawn, believe in completely nonsensical, unbelievable fashion. Detailed breakdown below.Story: 2/10.The anime really can\'t decide what it wants to be. It starts with an interesting premise, then forgets about it for several episodes, devolving into pretty much disconnected string of events, then near the end it freaks out, and makes absolutely insane...nonsensical story turn that doesn\'t make sense. The anime also seriously has trouble deciding on magic level in the world, or power of ""occult"". In several episodes characters act in completely ridiculous/unbelievable fashion as well.Art: 7/10.Visuals are really nice. I really liked character designs and their art style. It is more realistic style with proportions that are closer to real life, and frankly, i\'d love to see more anime drawn this way. There are few visually awesome scenes as well.

They can\'t be really called stereotypes, but they aren\'t believable. On occasion characters slip into some sort of comedic stereotypes, but this isn\'t really well done. When they snap out of stereotypical behavior, they don\'t really behave like real people, relationships between them develop in abrupt and unrealistic ways, and occasionally they have disturbingly low level of concern about their close friends/relatives/etc. Male lead is annoyingly spineless, and Female lead is pointlessly violent. However I liked character of Kuroki Ami and her family - those were more interesting than leading characters.Enjoyment: 4/10.Around 5th episode or so I realized that show makes less and less sense as it goes own, and it only went downhill from there. Didn\'t really enjoy it much, although I really liked the visuals, plus there was a visually awesome scene involving Kuroki Ami.Overall: 5/10Good art, nice music, horrible story.

It's not down to any single factor why Occult Academy doesn't work, and it has its share of strengths, though to be fair there are plenty of weaknesses to pick on.  However, the way all the pieces go together makes the show overall one I can't recommend.With the exceptions of the two leads, the characters are essentially one note each... but they play their notes well enough that I don't really hold it against them.  A season of anime...doesn't have all the time in the world, and the secondary character tier in this one is big enough that trying to give them all independent growth arcs just would have made the whole thing muddy and drowned out the plot.  It still would have been nice if we got a little more out of the friends themselves, or especially the Vice Principal character, but of the show's sins, this is really the least.The leads are another story.  Maya is one of the high points of the show.  She has a very well-defined character and a strong arc.  She's not amazing, though – many shows as have been saved by getting a truly jaw-dropping character or two, but Occult Academy is not among them.  I dare say, despite being pretty good, she could have been a lot smarter in a stronger production.  More on the vast depths of 'could have been' later.  Bunmei, on the other hand, is one of the weakest parts of the show for most of its run.  I get that he's kind of like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo, the random dude thrown into mysterious nonsense who is possibly rightly terrified of everything, but Shaggy (in most incarnations at least) may be a coward, but he's not a blowhard or otherwise unpleasant.  Bunmei, straight out, doesn't come off as a very good person in the first half of the show.  And even later, when he has one or two redeeming scenes to put him in a better place for the climax, he's still not very fun to watch.I find myself somewhat disappointed as well that the show doesn't really look like anything.  It's got a great theme for visual wonder – the Occult!  This is begging for a lot of dark shadows and tricks of cinematography to create a pervasive mood in the scenes, and really bring out the mystery and fear.  Or if you want to see things clearly, it practically demands some creative design for creatures and effects.  Occult Academy never does any of this.  The designs aren't utterly uncreative, but they don't have any touches to make them memorable or distinctive in any way.  For a subject that should be trivial to make memorable, I think I'm pretty much going to forget all of it, and that's just sad.  The overall style, too, isn't very distinct.  Most of the scenes, this could be just about any show.  Except where the characters slip off-model and end up not looking very good, there's nothing that would make this stand out from any other show with a more every-day sort of setting and theme.  It doesn't leave a mark, doesn't make an impression, and a lot of the time doesn't really look good either.With the sound, there's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing right either.  Everything is either bog standard or easily forgotten.  The voice actors didn't fail to sell their characters, but didn't really leave an impression either.Then we come to the biggest stumbling block, the story line.  The plot of this show is all over the place.  Few are the shows that can work in Aliens, Time Travelers, Psychic Powers, Ghosts, Cryptids, Demons... yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's painfully not consistent.  And you might ask yourself “Why should it be?  The theme here is 'the occult' not a subset of it!”.  And you'd be right, but that doesn't mean it's good.  And it kind of highlights what I think is behind most of the elements of Occult Academy that don't work.Put simply, the creators behind Occult Academy had some ideas about what they wanted in their show, and what they wanted their show to be, and they went for all of those without taking a moment to understand what it would all mean for the big picture.  For instance, the creators decided they wanted this to include everything and the kitchen sink – an approach that might have worked in an X-Files sort of  “monster of the week” setup, but which doesn't pay off when there's a time limit and climax, and an overriding goal that our heroes should be paying attention to.  And there's a moment, towards the end of the show, where we get the big “Future refused to change” moment.  And it's a good moment, but it's not in a scenario where it really makes sense.  The reveal of the villain is in a similar space: I get what they were going for, and why someone would have said in abstract “I want this to happen”, but there wasn't enough care taken to actually have the moment land; it was both too easy to guess because huge amounts of run time would have failed to be germane to anything otherwise, and impossible because there were no in-character hints or clues as to the outcome of the mystery.  There's yet another scene in the final sequence, and it's supposed to be a touching scene, but it falls flat because the character involved never got enough earnest development, they were treated as a joke so when they try to get used for heavy drama it doesn't land.  The climax as well is a good sequence, probably one of only two action sequences in the show (along with the fake-out climax) to be worth watching even if it still wasn't amazing in the pantheon of anime as a whole, but it happens so quickly that you can't really enjoy it.  When a big, climactic fight comes out in a show like Shakugan no Shana, or even a generally weak show that knows a little better about what to do here like Star Driver, the show works to get you excited for the action, building up what's coming before actually delivering.  Occult Academy just throws you what it has cold, because someone really wanted that moment, or that scene, or that theme, and didn't care how it went together.As a result, the pacing of the show is terrible, even if the pacing of scenes or sometimes even episodes is good.  How and when major parts of the show are addressed or, more often, not addressed is just plain wrong.  Even if all the parts were good (and most are just serviceable, really) the result would still be bad just because of the incompetent assembly.There is a part of me that wanted to like Occult Academy, and gave it more than a fair chance.  I love the subject matter (though it doesn't go into it much after the very start).  I like the fact that it's original, when so many shows are adaptions.  But none of that saves it from a presentation that really needed a round or two of rewrites, at multiple stages in the creation process, before reaching the viewer at last.  With more effort, it could have been a good show.  But it needed to either be a kitchen sink affair with no harsh deadline or obvious end, or else it needed to tighten its focus and tie things into the main threat.  It needed to either tell a better mystery with clues and suspense as well as an unsurprising surprise, or it needed to drop the forced twist and tell a more straightforward story.  No show can be all things to all people, and, as a writer, if a scene or a moment or even a theme doesn't work, you cut it out for the good of the whole.  Nobody went back and edited Occult Academy, and that is why it failed.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 3Art: 5Sound: 6Character: 5Enjoyment: 3Total: 5 (4.4)Final Verdict: Even for a real nut who'll get all the little references to occult phenomena, this show just isn't worth it.

This is begging for a lot of dark shadows and tricks of cinematography to create a pervasive mood in the scenes, and really bring out the mystery and fear.  Or if you want to see things clearly, it practically demands some creative design for creatures and effects.  Occult Academy never does any of this.  The designs aren't utterly uncreative, but they don't have any touches to make them memorable or distinctive in any way.  For a subject that should be trivial to make memorable, I think I'm pretty much going to forget all of it, and that's just sad.  The overall style, too, isn't very distinct.  Most of the scenes, this could be just about any show.  Except where the characters slip off-model and end up not looking very good, there's nothing that would make this stand out from any other show with a more every-day sort of setting and theme.  It doesn't leave a mark, doesn't make an impression, and a lot of the time doesn't really look good either.With the sound, there's nothing wrong with it, but there's nothing right either.  Everything is either bog standard or easily forgotten.  The voice actors didn't fail to sell their characters, but didn't really leave an impression either.Then we come to the biggest stumbling block, the story line.  The plot of this show is all over the place.  Few are the shows that can work in Aliens, Time Travelers, Psychic Powers, Ghosts, Cryptids, Demons... yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on, and it's painfully not consistent.  And you might ask yourself “Why should it be?  The theme here is 'the occult' not a subset of it!”.  And you'd be right, but that doesn't mean it's good.  And it kind of highlights what I think is behind most of the elements of Occult Academy that don't work.Put simply, the creators behind Occult Academy had some ideas about what they wanted in their show, and what they wanted their show to be, and they went for all of those without taking a moment to understand what it would all mean for the big picture.  For instance, the creators decided they wanted this to include everything and the kitchen sink – an approach that might have worked in an X-Files sort of  “monster of the week” setup, but which doesn't pay off when there's a time limit and climax, and an overriding goal that our heroes should be paying attention to.  And there's a moment, towards the end of the show, where we get the big “Future refused to change” moment.  And it's a good moment, but it's not in a scenario where it really makes sense.  The reveal of the villain is in a similar space: I get what they were going for, and why someone would have said in abstract “I want this to happen”, but there wasn't enough care taken to actually have the moment land; it was both too easy to guess because huge amounts of run time would have failed to be germane to anything otherwise, and impossible because there were no in-character hints or clues as to the outcome of the mystery.  There's yet another scene in the final sequence, and it's supposed to be a touching scene, but it falls flat because the character involved never got enough earnest development, they were treated as a joke so when they try to get used for heavy drama it doesn't land.  The climax as well is a good sequence, probably one of only two action sequences in the show (along with the fake-out climax) to be worth watching even if it still wasn't amazing in the pantheon of anime as a whole, but it happens so quickly that you can't really enjoy it.  When a big, climactic fight comes out in a show like Shakugan no Shana, or even a generally weak show that knows a little better about what to do here like Star Driver, the show works to get you excited for the action, building up what's coming before actually delivering.  Occult Academy just throws you what it has cold, because someone really wanted that moment, or that scene, or that theme, and didn't care how it went together.As a result, the pacing of the show is terrible, even if the pacing of scenes or sometimes even episodes is good.  How and when major parts of the show are addressed or, more often, not addressed is just plain wrong.  Even if all the parts were good (and most are just serviceable, really) the result would still be bad just because of the incompetent assembly.There is a part of me that wanted to like Occult Academy, and gave it more than a fair chance.  I love the subject matter (though it doesn't go into it much after the very start).  I like the fact that it's original, when so many shows are adaptions.  But none of that saves it from a presentation that really needed a round or two of rewrites, at multiple stages in the creation process, before reaching the viewer at last.  With more effort, it could have been a good show.  But it needed to either be a kitchen sink affair with no harsh deadline or obvious end, or else it needed to tighten its focus and tie things into the main threat.  It needed to either tell a better mystery with clues and suspense as well as an unsurprising surprise, or it needed to drop the forced twist and tell a more straightforward story.  No show can be all things to all people, and, as a writer, if a scene or a moment or even a theme doesn't work, you cut it out for the good of the whole.  Nobody went back and edited Occult Academy, and that is why it failed.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 3Art: 5Sound: 6Character: 5Enjoyment: 3Total: 5 (4.4)Final Verdict: Even for a real nut who'll get all the little references to occult phenomena, this show just isn't worth it.  The good ideas that are in there needed to be in a production with a lot more polish, down to the basic level, in order to show any strength."", 'I’m in the afterglow of binging this series, and so my overall score reflects that. That said, my scores are based mainly on the first 3ish and last 3 episodes of the series. The 7 episodes in the middle are almost pure filler, only necessary to establish evidence for the rapport between characters before going into the climax.I actually started this series something like 6 months ago, got stoked on the first 3 episodes and dropped it in the middle of the fourth. I’m glad I came back to it while home sick from work. If you’re gonna get invested in this show, binging...is a good way to go- savor the first and last episodes and get the rest over with like taking a pill with a glass of water. There are only 13, so it’s over pretty quickly.I love that this series takes place right at the end of the 90s, as someone who grew up at that time. There’s time travel- you might think of it as kind of a poor-man’s Stein’s Gate in that sense. All the characters seem to live in this world where magic and occultism clearly exist, but are still on the fringes and not taken very seriously by society as a whole, which is a pretty interesting balance to strike.Maya and Bunmei are great characters, and the sole reason the show gets an “8” rating on that count from me. Maya kicks ass, without being too powerful or flat as a character. She really changes over the course of the show, and the connection between her and Bunmei by the end is perfect and kind of bittersweet.The plot hangs together as well as anything with time travel AND magic AND aliens, etc. can be expected to and the last three episodes were so much fun to watch.I also awarded this show my special extra star, for Maya. It’s true that there’s some fan service but I feel like it was animated really well and done in an adult way instead of an immature way, which I’d honestly like to see more of. Nothing wrong with some hot ladies being hot.So for my breakdown:2/3 stars for characters- Maya and Bunmei specifically2/3 for story and plot- minus 1 star for all the filler3/3 for art and music- really well made, the short length keeps the quality high1/1 special award for Maya and her female friendships, and also that one character with the dowsing rods who I actually thought was hilariousP.s.

It has a decent enough story, but some of the characters are all over the place and some things don't make any sense. This became unwatchable for me because the female lead was always angry and physically abusive. I don't like watching abusive characters and female ones always seem to get a pass in anime, and I don't understand why. If the situation were reversed the male character would be hated, but if a female is abusive it's seen as humourous and acceptable. I really was interested in the story but after 4 episodes of watching a guy get punched and...have things thrown at him just because the female lead was angry, it is unacceptable. have things thrown at him just because the female lead was angry, it is unacceptable."", ""Clumsy is the word I would use to best describe Occult Academy. I'm not going to lie, it hooked me decently well with the first episode. The setup isn't bad, as there's a a good driving force for the plot and already several threads to explore. I took a pretty good liking to some of the setting and character design too. However, it then goes on to fumble the execution at almost every turn.Character writing, jokes, story beats, and world building are all wonky. I have never before seen a show where it feels so clear as to what they're going for, and yet where...the execution feels so incomplete. Nothing is so bad as to be obnoxious, as is the case with most bad anime, and yet it feels almost like it's literally missing scenes at many points. It's the oddest thing, the pacing is so jarring when it comes to these areas. Characters are treated as if they've been well established when we've barely met them, and wild concepts are introduced out of left field while characters show almost no reaction to the life-changing implications. Central aspects of the setting and characters are either never set up properly at all, or are set up more than halfway through the show, which ends up leaving a massive black mark throughout the viewing experience.So what we're left with in practice is a show that sets up a main hook real fast before spending 10 episodes on frivolous bullshit that in hindsight forms a complete picture, but in the moment is terribly bland, poorly directed, and not very entertaining to watch. There's a lot of wasted screen-time with repetitive character moments that advance nothing and are grossly predictable and transparent. I called one of the main twists of the entire show in the second episode, and all the episodic storylines in-between the main plot are no better. The world's mechanics are pretty terrible too, as most of the supernatural aspects of the show display wildly inconsistent behavior and illicit head-scratching non-reactions from the main cast.It's hard to even structure a sensible explanation for just how much the show is lacking, because every facet of the pacing and directing is tripping over something at every turn. I'm talking fundamental screw-ups, down to even basic failures at establishing the space the characters inhabit or how they enter and exit a scene. There's some pretty lame fight choreography to that effect as well. To convey the disorganization in my thoughts here, I think it's fair to say that the show is just overall poorly directed, and it affects absolutely everything negatively, in ways both big and small.All that said, the finale is a fairly entertaining watch, at least relative to the rest of the show. It quickly wraps up the main story threads and reincorporates the few character developments that were covered in a fairly standard but at least correct and satisfying way. Mechanical errors notwithstanding, although I had already given up on the show putting any effort into that by this point.On paper, this show has a decent setup, setting, and story beats, but the pacing and execution is just grueling at times. If not for the positive impression left on me by the ending, I would've landed it closer to a 3 than a 4. As such, I really don't recommend anyone watch this. Most of the runtime is spent waffling around not delivering on the main premises implied by an either an apocalypse prevention scenario or an occult academy, and the things it does spend its time on are done pretty poorly at that. I only kept watching it because the more unconventional and slightly baffling moments in the show intrigued me enough to want to know where else it was going to end up, but most of it came up thoroughly disappointing. the execution feels so incomplete.

Kanojo mo Kanojo Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53040/Kanojo_mo_Kanojo_Season_2,"[""When ‘Kanojo mo Kanojo’ aired two years ago, I saw two types of reviews . Some of the watchers were praising it for its new type of approach to a harem comedy , on the other end some of them took this show so seriously that they complained about how over the top it was or how every character of this anime acted out of ordinary. I liked the first season a lot . Not only for its unique premise but also how it made me laugh every episode. So, I am one of those who liked this ‘trash’ back then and now feeling...glad that it has got a second season.So, this season will probably cover Shino’s arc from the manga. This is one of the best arcs to cover as Shino has always been fan favourite among manga readers. The comedy of this show still is top-notch and fan service is there from episode one as well. The major difference is how Shino gets herself involved and manages to add herself in the harem as well and some drama regarding Mirika's issue. All the characters are still ridiculous and do not act normal at all.This show is still a good watch if you can accept the fact that this is a work of fiction and there is no chance of these events happening in real life. There are plenty of scenes in this to make you laugh.I noticed that the production studio has changed for this anime. That is possibly the reason behind the slight change of color  tone which looks nice. Having some of the most prominent VAs means nothing to complain about voice acting either. Their voices matched the characters really well. The opening was catchy enough to make me listen on two occasions out of three episodes I have watched so far. ( I usually skip openings in most cases)Harem animes have come a long way. At some point of 2010s every harem anime started to have a fixed story with some commonly used characters. Add some cliché fantasy school setting to that, and that is how we got harem animes that were so predictable that watching two or three episodes were more than enough to tell the rest of the story. But 2020s have brought a lot of changes to that trend so far and that’s the reason we are seeing ‘Bokuben’, ‘Kanojo mo Kanojo’ and ‘100 girlfriends’ getting anime adaptations. If you like questioning fictional characters of a harem/comedy on how they could be more realistic, stay away from this. And if you are one of those people who had mixed feelings about it and can’t decide whether to give it a try or not, then do not  watch it. This anime is a good watch only for those who had absolutely no problem with how the story progressed in the first season and this is still a good recommendation for them. glad that it has got a second season.So, this season will probably cover Shino’s arc from the manga.

Despite all of the above, the second season, albeit with less impact than the first, was also a success.The animation, despite the difference in studios, remains virtually unchanged, the main characteristic of the characters\' appearance remains the eyes, which was emphasised by the artists (the first season is also not lagging behind in this respect), and the skill of drawing shadows and lighting in some moments is even higher than in the prequel.The opening splash screen ""Dramatic ni Koi Shitai"" by Hikari Kodama, in my opinion, was more colourful and concise than the first season splash screen ""Fuzaketenai ze"" by Necry Talkie. As for the ending, again in my humble opinion, the situation is the opposite, even though the ending of ""Forira"" by ClariS was pretty good, I like the ending of the first season better.Even though the second season of Kanojo mo Kanojo sank in the autumn season of 2023, unlike its prequel, SynergySP did a good job with this one.

The art style is bright and colorful, and the characters are all very well-designed. The storyline is full of funny and heartwarming moments, and it does a great job of portraying the complexities of being in a harem relationship.Best Intro and Outro ScenesKanojo mo Kanojo Season 2 also has the best intro and outro scenes of any anime series that I have seen in a long time. The intro song is catchy and upbeat, and the visuals are simply stunning. The outro song is also very good, and it...does a great job of setting the tone for the next episode.Annoying Male ProtagonistThe only downside to Kanojo mo Kanojo Season 2 is the male protagonist, Naoya Mukai. Naoya is a very loud and obnoxious character, and his loud voice can be quite grating at times. However, it is important to remember that Naoya is supposed to be an annoying character. He is a parody of the typical harem protagonist, and his loud voice is part of what makes him so funny.Intense JealousyThe jealousy between the four female characters in Kanojo mo Kanojo Season 2 is quite intense. However, this is one of the things that makes the anime so entertaining. It is always fun to see how the girls react when Naoya pays attention to another girl. The jealousy also leads to some very funny and heartwarming moments.Short Episodes with Many ScenariosEach episode of Kanojo mo Kanojo Season 2 is relatively short, but they are all packed with content. Each episode typically features multiple scenarios, including dates, romantic encounters, and comedic situations. This makes for a very fast-paced and entertaining anime series.Mixed FeelingsWhile the jealousy between the four female characters is one of the things that makes the anime so entertaining, it can also lead to some mixed feelings for the viewer. On the one hand, it is fun to see how the girls react when Naoya pays attention to another girl. On the other hand, it can also be frustrating to see the girls fighting over Naoya all the time.Overall RecommendationDespite its flaws, Kanojo mo Kanojo Season 2 is a very entertaining anime series that I highly recommend. It has great art, a funny and heartwarming storyline, and well-developed characters. The only downside is the loud and obnoxious male protagonist, Naoya Mukai. However, Naoya's loud voice is part of what makes him so funny, so it is easy to overlook this flaw.Overall, Kanojo mo Kanojo Season 2 is a must-watch for fans of rom-com anime.

Your trash mangaka connoisseur for a harem so stupid and aloof that\'s as enjoyable as heck, is back for Round 2!We\'re now in the current days where the harem genre has pretty much evolved into its own subservient themes, with the current biggest hit being the currently airing Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo a.k.a The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, REALLY Love You (mangaka Rikito Nakamura and illustrator Yukiko Nozawa are chads), but did you know that the manga for Hyakkano actually started earlier than Hiroyuki\'s series? That\'s right, the former started...in December 2019 while the latter started in March 2020, a mere 4 months\' difference. And within the span of 4 years since then, the latter\'s premiere anime back in Summer 2021 has gotten lukewarm reviews (mine included), while the former has become THE new gold standard for harem AniManga series to follow, thanks to its huge fanbase and the riot manga that\'s only a fifth of the way of its total girlfriend-ish goal-setting avalanche.Season 2 of the anime, covering from the middle of Volume 5 to Volume 10, leaves us another final season of the anime to finish the manga adaptation and find out who is the final victor of Naoya Mukai\'s heart...at least for the anime-onlies (manga readers, please DO NOT spoil the fun!). Of course, the series expects you to be acquainted with watching Season 1 first (duh), and regarding this sequel continuation, it\'s more of the same with said chad MC and his 4 thirsty girlfriends, whose quirks and features make them desirable in some fit, form, and fashion for Naoya to (not) blind-sidedly date each and every one of them (well, except Mirika).If you\'re going to talk about who the real MC is in the sequel this time, it\'s gotta be Shino Kiryu. The childhood and best friend of Saki Saki; a rich family\'s lady connoisseur and a serious hardworking girl, Shino may be the hardest to please, but the easiest when she looks innocent, like subconsciously falling in love with her best friend\'s boyfriend. Even though she has a one-sided crush on Naoya, her many ""classic pervert"" tropes back in Season 1 (and even in Season 2 here) have cemented her status as not just a clumsy girl, but someone who\'s in dire need of love, and yet someone who also understands not to trespass the fine line between friendship and being lovers, which I really have to commend Shino for standing her ground. Yet at the same time, I also feel sad for her that Naoya will not reciprocate his feelings for her...or will he, in the future? Also, while Mirika also got her spotlight this time as well, she\'ll always be known as the girlfriend stalker that Naoya has attempted so many times before, but ""giving up"" sure is NOT in her vocabulary being the possessive and obsessive ""potential"" girlfriend.The one aspect that I don\'t really understand is the tonal shift of the show\'s production. I\'d thought that director Satoshi Kuwabara and Tezuka Productions did a good job on the premiere season back in Summer 2021, given the in-house director\'s capability directing the much popular harem rom-com series of Negi Haruba\'s Gotoubun no Hanayome a.k.a The Quintessential Quintuplets at the time. Maybe the production committee felt that it looked too cheap at the time, so they switched hands to Takaaki Suzuki and SynergySP for the sequel season here. In the same way, given the latter\'s experience being an episode director for yet another popular harem rom-com series of Miki Yoshikawa\'s Kakkou no Iinazuke a.k.a A Couple of Cuckoos back in Spring 2022, Takaaki Suzuki being promoted to a director (much less his debut role), I think he did a good follow-up job to whatever the former staff team has left behind for him, save for the rather new staff team (with some returning for assistance). In my mind, as long as it looks good, it should not be a cause for concern to arrange a new staff team just for production consistency contingency.Season 2\'s OST, despite having both Miki Sakurai and Tatsuhiko Saiki as returning music composers, was fairly well-kept consistent, which is a good thing. But the OP and ED songs, as much as I want to say that both Hikari Kodama and ClariS have produced decent follow-up songs that sound as catchy as Season 1\'s pairings, to me, they\'re just not as memorable overall. In fact, I pretty much preferred the prequel over the sequel, in terms of music alone.Still though, it\'s the same wacky, unhinged harem rom-com series that Kanojo mo Kanojo a.k.a Girlfriend, Girlfriend is known for, a direct, if not an intense follow-up from 2 years ago. The question now is: Will the series be able to sustain this for yet another season to wrap up the entire manga?

If you found the pacing of the S1 to be a bit slow, this installment is worth looking forward to.This particular series features content where Saki and Nagisa date with Naoya simultaneously, as can be seen in the PVs.

Before i share my take on this anime i want to tell how and why am i watching this, back when KnK still new with season1, i was curious about the premise of having 2 girlfriends story, a bit new to me and i don\'t read the manga, so i come in blind. The result? ""EWWW"" i can\'t watch the season 1 seriously due to frequently i found myself cringing, hard cringing to the point...where idc about the story anymore and just skip. I have a pretty low bar on anime, im easily entertained by typical isekai anime and bland harem anime like this but this one is just on another level. This Anime makes me (who have very low bar on anime quality) cringe so much to the point where i will find myself telling other to avoid this series.

Shino\'s hard carried the whole season\'s storyline (not even that great) but still a better story than s1.2. Less cringe moments, comparing to s1, there is less cringe (where i want to skip and forget about what i just saw) moment in s2 (but there is still some)3. I fell into the s1 rabbit hole and got curious about Shino\'s feeling.

My cringe bar is really low, but even this anime still make me shiver in cringe and want to brainwash and delete what i just watched2. Lame storyline, the one who have character development in this series is Shino. The other just act like you have never been in a social relationship3.

The build-up is what made it specially exciting as both parties accepted the harem aspect as they try to conciliate their emotions.Season 2 on the other hand focus more on the 'drama' aspect. The comedy is still there, but it´s not as funny as it was since it keeps repeating itself over and over, nor it blends well with the 'drama' as they suddenly shift from drama to comedy and vice-versa.I have dropped this show after episode 7, but out of curiosity I checked...out episode 12 as I couldn´t believe the WHOLE season would be about about Shino trying to mess up with their relationship (and thus everything season 1 built up). Yes, you read that right.Shino´s excuse is that she wants to help her friend Saki with her relationship since she (Shino) does not agree with the two-timing or that they are into a harem relationship. Turns out that she was just using that as an excuse to be close to Naoya cause in deep she -obviously- liked him.That bugged me cause I liked Shino but unfornutely the route they (author-san/producers) had in mind for her wasn´t a nice choice.Amazed me that even though Saki caught Shino in the act almost making out with Naoya (for example: almost stealing Naoya´s kiss as he was asleep), she didn´t get that Shino was interested on him, for a moment I thought she was just pretending to not have noticed, but nop... turns out that it´s worse than that, she´s so one-dimensional that her character wasn´t able to process/understand that scene right in front of her. And similar scenes like that occurs throughout the anime. It wasn´t good not even as a comedy scene. But that does not resumes to Saki only, every character here is very one-dimensional.As for Rika, at least in the 1st half, she keeps getting rejected even after all her effort, and that wasn´t funny anymore and I started to feel bad for her.As for Nagisa, she doesn´t has any remarkeble scene as far as I remember. At least in the 1st half.That pretty much summarizes this season, at least the first half of it - I don´t believe though that it changed much in the second half. Probably either Shino accept their relationship or joined the harem.In the end, I couldn´t stand much since everything got unfornutely boring, annoying and repetitive.Now it´s up to you.

The second season is more of the same. It adds more fanservice and when it does, it goes even further than the first season (within tv ratings of course). It adds more drama towards the end that’s surprisingly well done. Having a bunch of stupid characters become serious and surprisingly competent makes those moments even better. Approaching this anime with any form of logic or reason is just going to make you be...turned off by the anime. You have to turn off your brain and just enjoy the ride.

S2 starts off strong with introducing the ethical question on whether two-timing is right for the MC or not, and whether there are consequences in stopping or continuing the said relationship.Plot:Throughout the first 3 episodes, it tackles the complicated background between Shino and the MC. The plot with her contemplating on what she should do with her feelings and what she considers is the most ethical and safest way to get out of that situation. The usage of her characterization, as she is...the top student in her school and considered very highly praised and a prodigy in everything she does, shows how she feels the sense of pity towards her best-friend Saki Saki even before they got close. The feeling of fixing and improving someone else's 'miserable' life from not having the skills and intellect that she has, is something that drives her to give up her own wants and help someone that she considers is less capable than herself. The plot of episode 3, with her fully influencing the MC to see how much her bestfriend has sacrificed her feelings deep down for their relationship to work on a two-timing level, and him not giving her the relationship treatment that she deserves for starting their relationship first shows the level of commitment she has into supporting their relationship while also suppressing her own feelings for the MC and attempt to let that go for the sake of her best-friend.Characters:The characters include the Saki Saki, considered to be the main girl throughout the whole story and the first one to introduce the idea of dating towards the MC. Minase is the timid and calm character that can give wholesome seems for any type of audience. She uses her naivety to show her cute and innocent side to any of the characters, she also uses her looks and cuteness in order to be treated lightly by the MC and her rivals in the chaotic relationship dynamic that she is in. Rika is a generic one-sided love character, she commits towards trying to show her love to the MC, but the way she does it is through self-improvement as well which gives her character more depth into saying she will do whatever she can to get the MC's approval. Lastly among the batch of girls is Shino, she has been a focus character in the start of S2 where it tackles how complicated her feelings are for the MC. Her pitying Saki Saki and trying to 'fix' her relationship so that Saki Saki can keep the MC to herself, is her way on saying that it is not fair that other girls get attention when she sacrificed her own love for her friend's happiness.Art:Art style is aesthetically appealing and very enjoyable to watch. The colour contrast reflect on the light-hearted stories, conflicts and events that unfold in the story. The character designs are designed perfectly for the story as well. The op and ed for S2 is absolutely amazing, S1 was personally my favourite with the songs being very good as well, but S2 is definitely delivering on that aspect as well.Enjoyment:Throughout 3 episodes, my enjoyment had peaked in many instances (basically even got me off my feet). The ridiculous and comedic situations the characters get to is light-hearted and funny which really allows an enjoyable and positive sort of energy to be delivered from the show.Overall:With that being said, this anime is not for serious watchers and I do not recommend it to them, but for a light-hearted and just for entertainment type of story this anime just delivers to its peak with its characters, art style and storyline. I can highly ensure that a casual watcher for something fun will get enjoyment and be entertained throughout the stories that these characters go through and how they handle the ridiculous concept of their chaotic relationships. the top student in her school and considered very highly praised and a prodigy in everything she does, shows how she feels the sense of pity towards her best-friend Saki Saki even before they got close.

I recommend watching the Subbed version, don't go near the Dubbed, it's not the worst anime I watched in terms of the harem stuff but, I have to say this anime is pretty darn messed up, I don't remember season 1 being this exagerated, I guess at the very least at certain points it makes you laugh, I gues if I rate this anime out of 10, I give it a 6. "", ""When you click on a show like this one you can't expect it to be smart. It's just a dumb funny anime, with a lot of fanservice and stupid situations.With that said, this second season was not as funny as the first one. You find way more situations that only exist to build drama in a show that should not focus on drama. There was drama everywhere and I watched it all just because Shino is my favorite, but even then there where funny things  on every episode.I'd say it's still entertaining, but can't blame anyone disliking it. "", ""I prefer this anime when the characters are still filled with three women.Saki, Nagisa, Mirika.However, in the second season, a disturbing character named Shino appears, I think this character is very annoying.There are no tsundere elements but hypocrisy, talks about other people's relationships, and says it's for the sake of his best friend, but actually has hidden intentions.Compared to the other three female characters, Shino always expresses his opinion so that his friends' relationship becomes closer, but basically she also likes MC.This is made worse by the many accident scenes between Naoya and Shino, which always happen at certain times.Makes this annoying character...Love  Naoya even more. Love  Naoya even more."", ""Ah, the perplexities of this season left me pondering—why persist with this anime? For those in need of context, the protagonist harbors an enduring affection for Sakisaki, a Tsundere who eventually succumbs after a year-long requests from the MC. Then, enter another girl, a Dandere, who propositions the protagonist. To add to the curious love tale, the protagonist, in a fit of empathy, seeks permission from his original girlfriend to date both—surprisingly granted. But hold on, the saga doesn't cease there! A well-known streamer, a Goudere, harbors fervent feelings for our protagonist, despite his reluctance. And rounding off the quartet, Saki's best friend, a Kuudere,...joins this convoluted entanglement.Season 2 ventures deeper, albeit in an entirely unrealistic manner—heed my warning, do not take it seriously.

Kikoushi Enma,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1556/Kikoushi_Enma,"[""*This review contains spoilersIt begins like this: A woman, covered in blood, is walking through a dark maze of alleyways. She's pursued by a little boy in a dark cloak, and a ghostly young girl in a white kimono. As the boy and girl corner the injured woman, they're momentarily obscured by a patch of shadows, and when they step out into the light on the other side, they've somehow become older; the little boy is now a tall, intimidating man, and the young girl is now a striking silver-haired teen. None of this is particularly new for the horror genre, but it's executed well...enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented.That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest. The man in the black cloak used a magical staff to blast it with fire, burning it to death and searing off the front of his companion's kimono in the process. The scene then changed, but not before zooming in for a sexploitive close-up of the female lead's bare breasts. Real classy. I imagine all of this might be somebody's cup of tea, but for me, the fun had ended.What is this “interesting” creation that I've described? Well, it's Kikoushi Enma, a four-part OVA that tries like hell to successfully weave together elements of psychological horror, fantasy, and sexual humor into something worth watching. And if it had a decent story, or characters worth mentioning, it might have even succeeded. Unfortunately neither of those elements are present, and while there's a good artistic effort from Brains Base, and an acceptable musical score, ultimately this OVA's writing drags the entire thing down.The first episode doesn't waste any time laying the groundwork, and we quickly learn that the man in the black cloak and the woman in the white kimono are Enma and Yukihime, respectively. They've been placed on Earth to destroy demons who possess people. Together with their magical hat friend Chapeauji and their toad-duck-monster friend Kapaeru, they pose as a “supernatural detective agency” to draw themselves closer to possible demon-related events.Two episodes of the OVA are self-contained; one is about a vampire prostitute, and the other is about a doll who kills people. Clearly points for originality are not to be awarded here. I'd also consider it a mistake to place these two episodes back-to-back; they're so incredibly similar, so formulaic, that it feels like the same story being told with a slightly different supporting cast. Discoveries are made at the same rate, the same conversations occur, and plot twists and violent confrontations happen at exactly the same points in each episode.The third and fourth episodes are paired together, telling the story of a group of people trapped in a house which seems to taunt them with reminders of their checkered pasts, picking them off one by one and turning them against each other as it does so. Again, we're treading pretty familiar ground for horror, and the execution here isn't strong enough to make up for the lack of anything truly new; it's predictable, without suspense, and altogether pretty darn boring to watch. In addition, the shift from violent, gory fare to a sudden unforeseen attempt at less in-your-face psychological horror is totally without tact or subtlety, and it gives the OVA even more of an identity crisis than it already had. These two episodes also make an effort to create tie-ins with the first two by bringing in several recurring characters and attempting to stitch them into the plot. The overall impression is of something crude and clumsy that desperately tries to create continuity when in fact there is none to be found.The biggest problem with the story as a whole is the lack of not just an overarching plot, but even a basic explanation of what happened to lead us to this point in time. Several “minor” details, such as where the demons are coming from, and why it is the job of the dynamic duo Enma and Yukihime to destroy them, are left out. It's tough to care about what is happening, or be intrigued by the actions of the cast, when we're not given any context to work with. In the rare cases where the writers see fit to give us a clue about the nature of the situation, it's normally an outright cliché. For example, we learn  that the demons “feed on the darkness in the human heart” and that “all humans have darkness within them.” There are also massive plot holes. I won't spoil it, of course, but suffice to say that at least one major plot point revealed at the end of the fourth episode (which is clearly supposed to be some sort of mind-blowing twist) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the scheme of the OVA as a whole. This is an adaptation, and whether flaws this serious are present in the source material or not is beyond me, but they're definitely present here.The characters are a perfect match for the story; they're also paper-thin and without any background. By the final roll of the credits, we still don't know who Enma, Yukihime, or any of their supernatural companions are, much less how they know each other or why they're doing what they're doing. They're clearly supernatural themselves, so it would be interesting to know what their motivations are for killing other supernatural beings, and how they feel about it. Unfortunately the OVA never answers these questions. None of the cast members have a single identifiable character trait, so it goes without saying that none of them really develop or have any meaningful interactions with one another. There is some weird unrequited romance between Enma and Yukihime, but it's tough to give them a thought as a couple when they don't even have a leg to stand on as individuals. Helping the main cast's problems along is the fact that they're barely even present in the third and fourth episodes, essentially turning them into a minor sideshow act in their own circus.The supporting cast isn't much better. The series has a weird habit of throwing random characters into the mix with no introduction or previous knowledge of their existence. For example, in the third and fourth episodes, five characters are trapped in the haunted house. Two of them—a cop who investigates the doings of Enma and company, and a reporter who does the same—were present in the first couple episodes. However, the remaining three, a creepy perverted teacher and two young girls (go figure) are just suddenly tossed in for what seems to be no reason other than “we needed more characters.” The most interesting character in the entire span of the show is the aforementioned reporter, and several scenes involving her are the closest this OVA ever gets to being genuinely engrossing or suspenseful.Brains Base as a studio has a good artistic track record, and while this isn't the best I've seen from them, it's more than suitable for the purposes of the OVA. The character designs for the main roles are generally strong and distinctive-looking. The supporting cast members are a little more generic, but certainly not offensive. Where the art really works is in creating a setting and atmosphere; the use of lighting, combined with the backgrounds, is effective in giving the impression of a dark and slummy city district that's the perfect home for modern-day demons to take up residence. The lighting does sometimes cross the thin line between “atmospherically dark” and “too damn dark to see anything,” as is a common problem with this type of setting in general, but the damage is mostly kept to a minimum.Music is generally used to a good effect in this OVA. It typically consists of ominous orchestral tunes, spearheaded by traditional Japanese stringed instruments and booming drums. The use of an older style of music in a modern setting works surprisingly well, given the sense that the conflict of Enma-and-company vs. demons is an ancient one. Sometimes the soundtrack hurts for variety, as most of the songs sound pretty similar to one another. However, the music is used sparsely enough that this doesn't hurt my impression of it overall. In the grand scheme, it's not a great soundtrack by any stretch, but it's a much better one than the story really warrants, and along with the art, it's definitely one of the stronger aspects of the OVA.In terms of the spirit of the whole production, the best thing I can compare this OVA to is not other anime, but live-action films in the vein of the “Friday the 13th” franchise. There's lots of bad jokes, mindless gore and violence, and a pointless emphasis on sex that might entertain the more animal part of the human brain. If that sounds good to you, then pick this one up, because it won't disappoint you in those regards. But anyone seeking a strong story or memorable characters would be better served looking elsewhere. enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented.That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest.

So interesting that I didn't notice each episode was 40 minutes long until the last episode.StoryI guess you could say the story is pretty typical. A group of people exterminating demons to keep the town at peace [or because it's their job], but it has a more, how should I say this, natural feel to it. Most of the time an anime with this kind of story tends to be a little too supernatural. Sometimes even making totally impossible things seem possible.ArtThe animation was beautiful the whole way through. It was really detailed, yet sometimes so detailed it...was disgusting. I just wanted to skip over some of those deformed faces. There is also a problem with some scenes being too dark. I know this is supposed to be horror, but it made it hard to see what was going on.SoundI didn't pay too much attention to this, but the reason may be that there was barely any BGM. It sounded as natural as possible when in the city or a bar. The only time there was some music was during an action scene to make it more exciting.CharacterThe main characters made this fun to watch, but there wasn't much to them. You were never told why Enma has to destroy these demons, how he met Yukihime or how long they have know each other, and what Kapaeru's true form is. All of the character development was spent on the minor characters. Which in this case is important to better understand the situation they face.EnjoymentThe comedic scenes created by Enma and his group were always entertaining. There were some nice fights as well, but they never lasted any longer than maybe 3 minutes. Some scenes, on the other hand, felt like they were longer than they should be. I'm sure each episode could have been 30 minutes or a little less if they wanted to make this more enjoyable.OverallIn the end this OVA receives an 8. There isn't really anything else I can say except if you have time and this interests you then give it a shot. I enjoyed it and maybe you will too. was disgusting.

It was a little short, but still a great OVA to watch.Story:A great little story to watch, It may seem like the classic: Demons appear and all of a sudden a team shows up to combat them, and i guess in a sense that\'s true, but there is more to it than that. It has a down to earth feel to it. Although you may think pssh superpowers and demons.... how can that be down to earth? Well Although there are superpowers involved, nothing is overly dramatic and over the...top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them. All in all, everything is wrapped up pretty nicely and closes off with a somewhat dramatic finale.8/10Art:Probably the best part of this entire OVA was the artwork. it builds so much of an atmosphere that pulls the viewer into the environment, experience the emotions of the characters, and the thrill of watching what is unfolding on screen. One thing that was lacking a bit was the artwork of the characters. Don\'t get me wrong, the characters were decent looking but they weren\'t anything special. It seems to stand out a bit more when you compare minorly detailed characters with the highly detailed backgrounds.9/10Sound: My first impression on this OVA is that probably where this OVA is lacking the most in is sound. I meant that quite literally, there didn\'t feel like there was that much sounds going on. Actually looking back on it, and re-listening to a couple segments from the episodes i noticed how wrong i was. There is sounds throughout most of the way, but it feels like it has been incorporated so well into the scenery and what is happening that I didn\'t actually notice. I was drawn so deeply into actual going ons of the scene. The dramatic ominous music, was used throughout, but never overused, and was always changing. the other sounds generally consisted of things like characters breathing loudly, screams, and the scenery. I thought that this just added to the dark and ominous atmosphere that was created throughout. Although you could argue well.... there is not too much background music, and there isn\'t even an opening. I would agree with most of that. There isn\'t much background music, but it is well placed. However the lack of an opening, and the kinda lousy ending song were a bit of a disappointment. Ranking this OVA purely based on sound, its kind of low, in that it although it builds up the atmosphere very well, stand alone the sounds are quite generic.6/10Characters:One thing about this OVA that i was not overly fond of.  The main three characters seemed somewhat one dimensional, and we barely learned nearly anything about them. Little to no character development. Motivation- nada, backstories- nada, how they got their powers- nada. Those characters were a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand however the ""mortal"" characters whom the stories revolved around,we had a little bit more information about them. The characters were a bit better introduced and we  learn more about them, but even then, we still only scratch the surface. Overall the largest flaw of the OVAEnjoyment:I found this OVA to be very enjoyable. I found myself constantly leaning forward towards my computer screen just being engrossed into the story. I honestly didn\'t notice the 40 min time of each episode until i finished it. Well worth the watch9/10Overall:I do recommend this to most people. Although there is a slight bit of nudity, and ecchi scenes, nothing is over the top and it really doesn\'t take anything away from what the storyline does so well to build up. If you can find the time (and i am sure you can) i suggest you to check it out.8/10 top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them.

There is one main character, a man not from the human plane, on a mission to destroy these demons. The leader Enma is a red-headed man who is constantly draped in a black cape, a black hat that is similar to a witch\'s hat, and uses a staff that produces fire. Though he is considered the ""main character"", his other companions play big parts too. There is Enma\'s witch hat, Shapoji, who...can talk and smell the evil auras demons give off. Kapaeru, the Japanese creature Kappa in a human-like form, is the information gatherer for the group. Last is Yukihime, another hunter like Enma, but uses the power of frost or ice. The first two episodes show how Enma\'s crew handles a couple situations where people are possessed and killings occur, but by the third episode, the show takes a complete 360 degree turn, showing five individuals placed within a house that kills them off individually, using each character\'s problematic past as the way to kill them. Only within the last five to ten minutes of the last episode does Enma show up and save the day...or does he?I gave this OVA a 6 for story due to the lack of a cohesive story. The first half follows the beginnings of a decent plot, but the third episode had me scratching my head, wondering why these people were in a house being killed, followed by an even more confusing fourth and last episode. The reasons why these events were occurring were never explained, leaving the viewer to ponder the connection to the rest of the story. The last gripe I had was the extensive amounts of naked breasts being flashed throughout the four episodes. I do not mind nudity being used if it benefits the story in some way, but the usage here was for nothing more than looks.A warning to those of a weak stomach, this anime is full of blood and gore of all sorts. With a demon baby being born and crawling from the victim’s private area, to a mother trying to stab her young daughter. It is very graphic in content.Animation: The animations used were a little above average. The better animations were used for the blood, gore, and any other parts involved with the killings, while the rest was just plain. Even the main characters were done with minimal effort. If the production company had spent a little more time and effort on this project, it could have been very well done. These are the reasons I gave this a 5.Sound: The sounds used were actually decent, in most cases, though as before, the best sounds were used during the most graphic parts, such as a knife cutting or a person being possessed by a demon. The rest of the anime\'s sound was very basic and could have used more work. These reasons are why I gave it a 5.Characters: This was the worst part of the anime, for me, given these episodes are about 40 minutes each. While Enma and crew are very humorous through the majority of their time on screen, there is almost nothing known about these characters. No background on why they are killing demons, no background on where each character comes from, and no idea on their philosophy of the human race, just to name a few. All that is really known are the characters kill demons and Enma is a pervert. Their comedy was funny enough to warrant a 4 from me, but that is cutting it close.Overall: This anime had the potential to tell a great story with excellent characters to develop. Being an adult anime, this OVA also had the potential to take this story to a whole new level of intensity, but did not capitalize on the opportunities. I would only recommend this anime to those hardcore fans of demon anime that enjoy highly graphic storytelling, but otherwise, ended up turning into no-man\'s land, which is where this anime belongs. can talk and smell the evil auras demons give off.

I would only recommend this anime to those hardcore fans of demon anime that enjoy highly graphic storytelling, but otherwise, ended up turning into no-man\'s land, which is where this anime belongs.', 'wow, lets start this out by saying i will never forget this anime and i dont think i will be the same after watching it. this anime started out good, and you dont know where its going. but it takes a strong psychological turn and by the 3rd ova it  takes it in a direction i never expected, its not the violence even though it had some decently violent scenes.that did not bother me so much, but it was a psychological headf**k on the darkness of the human heart. and it was quite scary in the last 2 episodes not for the fact of...anything but the emotions and thoughts it evokes in the watcher... i loved it and i wanted to give it a 8 or 9 overall but i had to give it a 10, just for the fact it is very good, but also one of the very few anime i have seen that evoke such strong feelings and thoughts, i will never forget this anime and i dont think i will be the same after watching it. a must see for anyone into the psychological animes and also for those into anything GOOD... anything but the emotions and thoughts it evokes in the watcher... i loved it and i wanted to give it a 8 or 9 overall but i had to give it a 10, just for the fact it is very good, but also one of the very few anime i have seen that evoke such strong feelings and thoughts, i will never forget this anime and i dont think i will be the same after watching it. a must see for anyone into the psychological animes and also for those into anything GOOD...', 'Despite several interesting ideas presented and the potential of the story this anime fell flat. In the end it tried to do too many things and consequently did not of them very well.StoryMy biggest problem is with the story/plot. Kikoushi Enma wanted to be mystery, horror and psychological anime while being deep, funny, touching, scary and a touch sexual all in 4 forty minute episodes. The idea of the darkness in all of us is good but it wasn’t really developed until the 3rd episode. If that was the “meaning” of the OVA it was not a fully formed thought. The demon hunting was...again an interesting tease but not really explained. Despite the lack of development the OVA was not confusing – just missed potential.CharactersAgain there was potential for interesting and enjoyable characters, but the character building was abandoned to try and save the plot. The ""main"" characters had personality, although not all ways consistent with the tone of the show, and I would have really liked to see more of them and how they were related which is not explained.Art/MusicBoth the art and music where pretty decent. The art looked a tad dated/generic, but overall it was solid and little sexy. They made good use of dramatic light and dark contrasts and overall it fit the darker mood of the anime. The music didn\'t strike me either way really. Overall neither was good enough to compensate for its other short comings. again an interesting tease but not really explained.

Possessing both human bodies and artifacts alike, the demons are inconspicuously forcing people to commit grotesque murders. The task of exterminating the offenders lies with Demon Prince Enma, snow wielding Yukihime, an information gathering kappa, Kapaeru, and the talking witch hat Shapoji. This is the darker adult targeted version of the Prince Enma animated series. It hits a lot of the same morbid tones with tinges of lighter banter between the trio much like Requiem from the Darkness and the 1996...Black Jack: The Movie.

The story starts in one direction then takes an unexpected oblique turn, a WTF? moment. The voice acting is fine, it\'s everything else that is wrong. First the MCs are one dimensional, second the background images are not quite right, they are some sort of combination of drawn and CGI, it looks odd. The character art is just lazy. And this is not erotic, just because womens breasts are exposed does not make it erotic. Because of the gore, subject matter and nudity it is 18+. While the characters have some of the character traits of the original Dororon...Enma Kun (1973?), they just don\'t pull them off here. There are some time skips that are mentioned but no reason is given for them. The characters are also out of place and make no effort to modernize.

This series is OK but could have been better.', ""Kikoushi Enma wastes no time letting you know what it is; A tween's idea of a 'grown-up' anime. It comes right off the bat trying way too hard, and failing to stick the landing even a little bit. Insofar as it is 'baby's fist seinen', the viewer is subjected to campy gore, gross body horror, and boobies almost immediately, but their presence isn't the issue here, it's how they're used. It is as if these things, which are constant and unceasing, are thrown in cheaply by middle schoolers just for the fun of it. Even the most shameless of ecchi series have the self awareness...to not take themselves too seriously. This whole ordeal (and what an ordeal it is) feels like listening to a kid brag about how he drank his dad's beer once, and saw a naked girl. It's like the whole production is just trying so, so hard to be dark and edgy while failing miserably, then demanding to be taken seriously on top of it all. Beginning with the story, it is pretty mediocre. The first two episodes are almost insultingly bad, and were it not for the short 4 episode run this anime would have been dropped an hour in. The last two are marginally better, and though that's a relative term here, the point still stands. As a whole, the plot is generic, and there's not much else to say. There are a couple of creative ideas, but they manage to wring them out for everything they've got, and the rest of the conflicts seem contrived, present simply for their shock value. The art is generally pretty good, with an interesting art direction and shot composition. The character designs are also visually engaging. However, a notable exception to all this is the God awful CG. Yeah, it came out in 2006, but that's no excuse for the long, panning shots of that dumpster fire. They could have simply not used it at all when they saw how bad it was, but instead they laid it on thick towards the second half, like they were running out of time or something. An additional note concerning the art is that sometimes the characters suffer from the dreaded 'mask', where an anime fails to convey emotion through the faces of its characters by way of failing to animate it properly. The sound is fine and there's really nothing to speak of regarding it. The characters themselves are perhaps the worst part of the show, as they're shallow as puddles of dog piss and make decisions which manage to conflict with what little characterization they do have as well as common sense itself. Enma is an aloof cool dude with a magic staff and he's also a pervert, there is nothing else to his character and he does not develop further. Yukihime is an aloof kimono-clad waifu who has a secret crush on Enma, as well as problems expressing her emotions. Kapaeru is a pervert and that's the joke. His closest thing to a redeeming plot arc is his regular email correspondence with a little girl, and while that certainly doesn't sound very good at all, mercifully it is the only thing about him that is not somehow tainted by his debauchery. Every other character is pretty much a paper bag, to be puppeted about so the story can happen. Overall, Kikoushi Enma felt desperate to be cool, and this desperation reeked the whole time.

Koro-sensei Quest!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34389/Koro-sensei_Quest,"[""This is a very cute show.  It's a well done parody of Assassination Classroom that manages to parallel the original plot while not taking itself too seriously. The characters are all well reimagined and stand firmly on the line between characterization of themselves and a person with actual depth, leading to some pretty funny moments.  The underlying plot unique to this story is pretty clever too as it both makes perfect sense and is absolutely absurd at the same time.It's definitely not a show to watch if you have't seen the original, however, as it requires background knowledge and would probably not...be all that funny without it.Overall, if you are looking for a cute, lighthearted show, this is a must see! be all that funny without it.Overall, if you are looking for a cute, lighthearted show, this is a must see!"", ""Warning possible SpoilersAfter I had finished both Assassination Classroom series and absolutely loved them I was surprised to see this happen (then again AoT did it) and I thought it was unnecessary until I watched it.The story is basically parody events of both S1 & 2 of Assassination Classroom, but set in a Chibi Fantasy setting.Honestly a retelling of the AC series, but in a Chibi fantasy setting was actually more enjoyable than I thought it was going to be, it was absolutely funny seeing the tropes being turned into jokes like Karma's name literally meaning the definition of karma, Kaede's short breast size was...a very common joke used here and of course Nagisa being dressed up in feminine clothing because he is a trap, but these jokes worked really well in the show and it was just a fun ride seeing these characters try to kill Koro-Sensei all over again even if it ended a little different this time.The characters in their Chibi form was adorable and funny it worked surprisingly well despite the fact it was parodying a show that was serious well mostly serious and it was hilarious seeing these characters joke with each other on their tropes that pretty much defined them from the main series.It was great seeing moments from the main series be turned into something really comedic and it did work, but I did get tired of seeing the School's mascot being used as constant enemies because I really hated that guy, but seeing it get beaten and burned was actually a delight to see.The artstyle fitted the Chibi and fantasy aspect of the show and the poorly drawn backgrounds like the class 3-E building and some other areas really reminded me of Mobpsycho 100 even though these are two completely different anime's.The comedy was gold though there was times that the jokes slowly got repetitive for me, but I enjoyed them none the less plus there was a lot of 4th wall breaking which was always a fun site to and seeing the other characters question Yuzuki whenever she pointed this out was classic , also the way some characters were showed in this series really fitted their personas like for example Professor bitch turned into Seductive Witch which was a clever play on words.Overall I think this was a very enjoyable parody series and for anyone who is a AC fan you'll definitely find this enjoyable to watch though for someone who isn't really into chibi stuff or didn't get into AC then I would consider missing this. a very common joke used here and of course Nagisa being dressed up in feminine clothing because he is a trap, but these jokes worked really well in the show and it was just a fun ride seeing these characters try to kill Koro-Sensei all over again even if it ended a little different this time.The characters in their Chibi form was adorable and funny it worked surprisingly well despite the fact it was parodying a show that was serious well mostly serious and it was hilarious seeing these characters joke with each other on their tropes that pretty much defined them from the main series.It was great seeing moments from the main series be turned into something really comedic and it did work, but I did get tired of seeing the School's mascot being used as constant enemies because I really hated that guy, but seeing it get beaten and burned was actually a delight to see.The artstyle fitted the Chibi and fantasy aspect of the show and the poorly drawn backgrounds like the class 3-E building and some other areas really reminded me of Mobpsycho 100 even though these are two completely different anime's.The comedy was gold though there was times that the jokes slowly got repetitive for me, but I enjoyed them none the less plus there was a lot of 4th wall breaking which was always a fun site to and seeing the other characters question Yuzuki whenever she pointed this out was classic , also the way some characters were showed in this series really fitted their personas like for example Professor bitch turned into Seductive Witch which was a clever play on words.Overall I think this was a very enjoyable parody series and for anyone who is a AC fan you'll definitely find this enjoyable to watch though for someone who isn't really into chibi stuff or didn't get into AC then I would consider missing this."", ""When I first they were doing a spin-off of assassination classroom I was fairly excited but as I began to watch this unnecessary Trainwreck I had to retract that thought. Sadly everything in the show is subpar  with the exception of how all of it is RPG themed now honestly I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone because all it is  a regurgitation of assassination classrooms story and terrible RPG jokes, I mean every single character in the show is a one-dimensional joke about RPGs in short these are the reasons why i will not be recommending it to anyone "", 'If you crave more Assasination Classrom or want to revisit the story once again, this is the thing for you. Koro-sensei Quest provides a fun and unique take on the story, where all the characters are put in a fantasy RPG-like setting. Koro-sensei is the big bad, a dungeon boss pretty much, the students are heroes in training, trying to level up so they can beat him, and the rest of the cast are the sterotypical RPG classes: paladins, witches, warriors and such.*Slight spoilers for the original anime and this one. Prepare for a lot of comparing*The story is a retelling of the one from...the original series, just with some twists on it. For example, every student has a ""bug"" - Karma\'s luck stat drops drastically when he looks down on somebody, Isogai can only wear the front of his armor because he\'s poor and so on. There\'s also the fact that all the events are presented accordingly to the setting. One of the episodes revolves around recruiting Karma to the team instead of him being forced to join the class like in the original. The story is episodic, so the overall plot is only an excuse to provide the fans with constant array of fanservice. What really helps with that are all the references to other anime and to the original, the self aware humor and characters breaking the fourth wall at all times. The story could use some more time and effort, but for a little fanservice series it still did a good job to feel special. It can really stand on its own when necessary, a couple of episodes were entirely new, without any resemblance to the ones from the first anime. If I could have a complaint, it would be that I\'d like to see other events being adapted, or at the very least set in a different order.The characters were mostly the same as their original counterparts, with some small exceptions here and there. They wouldn\'t work too well if I wouldn\'t know how they act normally, but that\'s not a bad thing, it actually helps the episodes flow faster without unnecessary exposition. Nobody should watch this series first anyway. There\'s no big development throughout, maybe sporadically, but that doesn\'t affect anything in a big way. The show could benefit from giving more screen time to some of the side characters, but they all got their fair share of the spotlight. If you thought there wasn\'t enough time spent on characters in the original anime, then you\'ll most likely think it isn\'t enough here. Personally, I was satisfied with both.The art is pretty poor, the buget clearly wasn\'t the highest, so most of the backgrounds look like they were drawn by a bunch of middle schoolers in their art classes, talented ones, but still learning. The close ups look good, but when there is a wide shot, the characters turn into white blobs. The designs are really nice, I\'d say those were the best part of the art style. The animation consists of a lot of still shots, but the movement is there when it\'s really required.The music is the same one from the original show. If you liked that one, it\'s back, there\'s less of it, but it\'s there. I can\'t remember an original track besides the opening, that\'s once again sang by the seiyuus, only girls this time, and the 8-bit remix of the first opening from the original series as an ED (which is bloody marvelous by the way). However, at the very least, the fantastic voice cast is back, and they\'re noticeably happy to return into their roles. They all came into with the same energy that made them sound so great in the first place. The series wouldn\'t be the same without them.All in all, this series was worth it from the beggining to the end. Definetely expected less from a little side series, and while by no means did it blow me away, it truly exceeded all of my initial thoughts that I came into it with. Ask yourself a question: ""Do I want to watch more Assassination Classroom?"". If the answer\'s yes, then you should pick this up. It\'s only 120 minutes of fanservice, but it was as fun as it sounds, and that\'s how it should be.As always, this is purely my opinion and I encourage you to develop your own. the original series, just with some twists on it.

The original manga I hold in considerable high regards for a shounen manga in that it was often more well thought out and interesting than many of its peers. Does this gag manga adaptation hold the same standard of writing? Well...Koro Quest takes the main storyline of the anime and filters...it in a fantasy-world gag sort of show that works about half the time. I could understand the main ""plot"" of the show and what was to come just fine, although if you\'ve never seen or heard of AssClass before you would be twelve kinds of lost in this short series. It definitely feels like a spin-off series but one that packs a ton more detail than one might initially expect, leaving the plot mostly fill in the blanks for those who have already watched or read the series.The gags themselves are ultimately what makes or breaks this series and for the most part they feel standard in a way that they\'re taking the baseline jokes of the original manga and stretching them out into absurdity. Sometimes this works, like with Karma constantly getting hit because he looks down and people, while others are just as irritating as in the first iteration, like Nagisa being forced into girl clothes for a joke. How much you like some of AssClass\' original jokes will largely determine how you like the gags here.The two things they do well that work more than poking fun at the actual story is the fantasy/game world ideas and the meta instances. Both of these show a level of actual humor often way more interesting than anything about the actual story. I think the spin-off benefits from being a fantasyeque show as opposed to just the regular story but in a gag manga form.Overall, I\'d say that if you had read/watched AssClass previously and enjoyed it, you\'ll probably get enough entertainment out of this short series to justify a watch. For anyone wanting to get into AssClass through this, just read the original manga.

outcome possoible, it personally took me days to recover, and then I stumbeled accross this, show I give it a try I said, but the fear of it screwing me over again kept me from stepping in, several months after, I was scrolling down my to watch list, and this picked my attentions, a really strange nostalgic feeling filled me instantly, I really wanted to get some memories on the main series bck, it has really been a...long time since I watched it, but this time, I never gave in to the fear of being screwed over yet again, I prepared myself mentally and hoped for a better outcome, and that's what I got.- Story (7.5/10):At first, it's just blunt episodic events that were very unrelated, but as I got into the show, it really wasn't strange, seeing how the original series was similar, as the episodes go, you will most definitely notice the massive shift of the focus of the story, a lot of plot points are being parodied into a more lightweight comedic approach, which is what I loved, I got enough sad stories at my disposal I guess.The students, now at a more RPG setting are forced to kill this monster called the Demon King, which is their teacher, as they keep finishing several quests, they gain XP, that will allowed them to kill Kuro-sensei one day.- Art (7.0/10):Not the best, but I'm not complaining, the animations are rigid and sluggish  at times, but the way everything is drawn, in a more of a hybrid chibi way, it makes the animation on point honestly, the colors are as vibrant as ever if not more, and surprise, surprise, Kuro-sensei has never been this yellow before.- Sound (8/10):Seeing how I watched the DUB version of the original series, it really was no other choice for me to see this one DUBed too, and I gotta say, I've never been happier to hear familiar voice before, there was some mastery voice acting in this, with of course some cringy ones, that aren't that relevant anyway, I loved to hear the opening and ending so much, with the latter being a cover of the original one anyways, so win-win I guess!The old soundtrack was phenomenal, has it always been this epic?- Character (8.0/10):I enjoyed seeing all those characters again, they are so many, that I'm surprised that I was familiar with all of them, that was a huge effort to remember all of their names, they are so diverse and unique, you really get the feeling of going and watching the main series just so you can see them, and explore them even more.Of course, Nagisa is still sexually abused, can't they cant him some slack?- Enjoyment (6.0/10):Aside from a few chuckles here and there, there wasn't really much to bring on, the show is basically a huge meme of the main series, it doesn't go to any serious topics, and I gotta say, this is surprisingly over sexualized for this type of shows, I mean, there is some really adult content in here.- Overall (7.3/10):I hoçnestly would still recommend this, but only to a more adult audience, because some of this stuff is not PG-13 at all.It's great for a couple of laughs, and an amazing refreshed of the parent story. long time since I watched it, but this time, I never gave in to the fear of being screwed over yet again, I prepared myself mentally and hoped for a better outcome, and that's what I got.- Story (7.5/10):At first, it's just blunt episodic events that were very unrelated, but as I got into the show, it really wasn't strange, seeing how the original series was similar, as the episodes go, you will most definitely notice the massive shift of the focus of the story, a lot of plot points are being parodied into a more lightweight comedic approach, which is what I loved, I got enough sad stories at my disposal I guess.The students, now at a more RPG setting are forced to kill this monster called the Demon King, which is their teacher, as they keep finishing several quests, they gain XP, that will allowed them to kill Kuro-sensei one day.- Art (7.0/10):Not the best, but I'm not complaining, the animations are rigid and sluggish  at times, but the way everything is drawn, in a more of a hybrid chibi way, it makes the animation on point honestly, the colors are as vibrant as ever if not more, and surprise, surprise, Kuro-sensei has never been this yellow before.- Sound (8/10):Seeing how I watched the DUB version of the original series, it really was no other choice for me to see this one DUBed too, and I gotta say, I've never been happier to hear familiar voice before, there was some mastery voice acting in this, with of course some cringy ones, that aren't that relevant anyway, I loved to hear the opening and ending so much, with the latter being a cover of the original one anyways, so win-win I guess!The old soundtrack was phenomenal, has it always been this epic?- Character

classroom'!I like the graphic style and the fact that the students have magical powers.This anime seems like  a very funny video-game.The chibi version of the charas is amazing, they're all cute, while maintaining their personality and their characteristic traits. .I like the fact that Karma in this version of the story is 'the red demon', because I find that this appellation is perfect for him.I like the music and also the opening/end songs are really great.It is a pity that the episodes are short and only twelve.Prepare to laugh from the beginning to the end! "", ""Koro-sensei Quest is a pretty good parody which retells the story of assassination classroom in a different and less serious setting. The anime is very self-aware and makes sure not to let things get too serious or get stuck on one trope for too long which makes it enjoyable to watch.The story in Koro-sensei quest is mostly the same as in Assassination Classroom but instead of a normal school it's a magic school and Koro-sensei is a demon lord. The order in which events happen is reminiscent of Assassination classroom but some events are switched around, some are left out and some didn't appear...in the main anime but appeared in an ONA instead. Watching season 1 and 2 of Assassination Classroom is necessary to follow the story but the ONA isn't required. Overall the story is mostly lighthearted and is completely about comedy.The characters are the same as in Assassination classroom but adjusted to fit in this alternative universe. The character traits however have been taken to extremes for a comedic effect. In most cases this is pretty funny and works well enough but there can always be a few you dislike.The animation is pretty lacking since it's chibi characters. You could argue that it helps with the comedy but it also felt like it detracted a bit from the experience. Voice acting is okay and music is used well enough, it even has its own opening.Overall this parody can be fun to watch if you really liked Assassination Classroom and its characters and want to experience the story in another way; as long as you're prepared for a 100% switch to comedy. in the main anime but appeared in an ONA instead.

This anime is a comedic parody of Dragon Quest. The story is the same as the main anime, but adapted into a fantasy RPG. The comedy is the same as the main anime, but with 4th wall breaks. The art is cute, and perfect for parody mini anime. The animation isn't that smooth, and the background is just lazy. But it's understandable. The sounds aren't really memorable, this anime also uses the same OST from the main anime. The opening theme for this anime is new and original,...it's perfect for this anime. The ending theme is just the 8-bit version main anime's 1st opening with 30 seconds cut and no vocal, they should've created a new song for the ending theme. The characters in this anime are perfect, but their screentime are messy. I'm not a comedic person however this anime is perfect to kill time, i really enjoyed the 4th wall breaks.

Expected it to be somewhat dumb but funny, but apparently, expectations weren\'t low enough.Minuses:- This show is VERY dumb and it feels like a mockery of original- Where original Assasination Classroom was funny - this show mostly was just retarded- Where original Assasination Classroom was dramatic or epic - this show tried to convert that into positive\\comedic moments and that appeared to be as horrible mess- Characters in original all had more or less depth, i liked that show trait. Here they are mostly turned into ""crowd"", and only some stand out a bit - mostly repeating same stupid...jokes. For example, an erotic-loving guy who constantly comments about boobs or want to undress girls, or Kayano (green haired girl) - constantly regretting that her boobs are small, etc- Too much fanservice and erotic humor. And it wasn\'t funny (so it is a clear minus to me)- There is some shadow of a story going on here, but it is just a mess (they took some noticeable story points of original show, twisted those, compacted them into 12-ep small show and made it like that- Nice music, completely ripped of from original and placed however they wanted around the show. It made atmosphere confusing (sometimes giving out-of-place dark tones to this ""light"" show)Pluses:+ Some jokes actually were fun (those were kinda rare as for a comedic anime)+ ...i guess opening and ending were nice. Is that a plus?All in all, it felt this was like ""an artist challenge"" - show, where animators tried to create something without a script and just thrown in all the jokes they could create at the moment. Joke about small boobs 10th time in 2-3 episode window? Goes in. Nagisa turning into girl by force every other episode? Goes in. Screaming fanservice guy overshadowing even main characters of the show? Easy!Maybe if you like chibi anime with a lot of dumb fanservice jokes it will work for you, for me it mostly didn\'t jokes.

Like most bonus content off-shoot series, Koro-Sensi Quest! takes our beloved cast of characters and transforms them into chibi versions of themselves as they go on adventures that parody the original events of the show. What\'s interesting about this approach is that it takes the AC world into this RPG style kind of game. However, instead of being ""the undesirable class of students"",...they\'re a motley crew of heroes with quirks and glitches. There\'s only 12 episodes and they\'re about 10 minutes each, so it\'s super easy to binge through in a day. I found the show to be enjoyable and adorable and I\'m glad I stumbled upon it, though I think we could\'ve gotten more out of this in terms of content. As a word of caution, you really should watch the original series before watching this as you won\'t get most of the jokes that are being made. There\'s also spoilers for both seasons sprinkled in that I\'ll get into below.The production value of the show is good. It stays true to the original style of the show and seeing characters like Nagisa, Karma and Kaedae in chibi form casting various spells and swinging swords was truly an adorable sight to see. The intro song Re:Quest! was fun to listen to and was sung by Kaedae\'s Japanese VA which was a very nice touch. The Outro, Seishun Satsubatsu-ron Remix, is the first season\'s first intro in 8 bit form which was ironic and very funny to listen to.The plot is pretty straight forward: much like in the original series, E Class is tasked with taking down Koro-Sensi, who is the ""the big bad"" in this RPG themed story. Koro-Sensi is the evil Demon King and has decided that he\'s grown bored in his position and as such wants to train a band of heroes to take him down. However, his class is full of defective and glitchy characters who probably wouldn\'t last 5 minutes in an actual RPG game. Karasuma is the Royal Knight Commander in this universe and tasks E Class with taking him down. Much like in the first episode of the original story, E Class starts off trying to take down Koro-Sensi by attacking all at the same time, but Koro-Sensi wrecks them. He then takes them out to a field to slay some easy slime monsters so that they can git gud.As part of Koro-Sensi\'s efforts to train E Class into a force that can take him down, he takes the party to recruit 3 leader characters to help take him down. They are Karma (who has bad luck every time he gets cocky), Jelavic (A seductive witch), and Ritsu (Advanced Magic). E Class goes on an adventure recruiting each of these heroes, which also parody the events of the real show. For example, in Ritsu\'s case she constantly petrifies her teammates so they\'re unable to level up, which frustrates them. Koro-Sensi then alters her personality to be more cooperative. In Jelavic\'s case, E Class has to climb a tower where she ends up seducing all the boy characters into fighting for her (save for Nagisa and Karma, who\'re able to escape), and they journey to a far off cave to recruit Karma.Koro-Sensi Quest! Also brings back some of the jokes from the original show (Kaedae\'s small bust size is a routine joke and trap Nagisa is brought up in a couple of episodes. In one episode they venture into a dungeon in which the characters swap bodies. Karma swaps bodies with Nagisa and as such, immediately dresses Nagisa in a femboy outfit). The show also brings up some stuff in Season 2, such as the Nagisa-Kaedae kiss scene when Nagisa has to kiss Kaedae to wake her up from Takaoka\'s poisoned pudding, but in a funny twist, she turns into a green octopus.The show then brings in the younger Asano and his underlings who\'re called the 5 Paladins that E Class has to deal with, and also get to deal with preventing one of their own, Takebayashi, from defecting to A Class after he didn\'t receive a Valentine\'s Day Present (buddy, I\'m with you there).The show also does its own telling of how Koro-Sensi came to be, though being similar to how he was in the original show. Koro-Sensi was originally an OP hero, but got bored and decided to become a villain and after getting bored from that, he decided to train a crew of heroes that were worthy of taking him on.In the show\'s finale, E Class storms through Koro-Sensi\'s castle, with many of the students sacrificing themselves so their comrades could advance. Eventually only Nagisa, Kaede, Karma, Itona and Takebayash remain and get to the throne room to confront Koro-Sensi. It\'s then revealed that Koro-Sensi was actually fired from his job by Principal Asaono. Terasaka, who got trapped in one of the dungeons earlier in the show, comes back and saves the other students after having raised his strength level to 99. As the castle begins to crumble, Koro-Sensi asks Nagisa to use his glitched power to save everyone. He complies and it ends up restarting the game all the way back at he beginning, with their memories in tact. Koro-Sensi ends off the series with how it began: challenging his students to attack them and with E Class rushing forward.There\'s honestly not a whole lot to say about Koro-Sensi! Quest, other then that it\'s a cute and fun watch. They parody the events of the show and the characters well. They added their own little twists to make it interesting with the new RPG world that was constructed. I personally wish we got more content with this as it was entertaining and funny to watch. Having 12, 10 minute episodes definitely felt too short, but it\'s not like they needed to parody everything that happened either. If you enjoyed watching Assassination Classroom, I would certainly recommend watching this as well! It\'s not the original show, but it\'s still worth the quick watch. I would caution you, however, to watch the original series first as Koro-Sensi Quest! does have spoilers for both seasons! they\'re a motley crew of heroes with quirks and glitches.

Overall the original Assassination Classroom was meh with its rare good moments and bland characters, but this takes the cake on what I hate the most. This is just a cash grab to earn extra money on this dog water anime with a chibi version.Story wise:3/10You wouldn’t expect much from a cash grab spinoff but this is laziest work I’ve seen put into an anime. The Plot is just a comedic version of the original...plot in Assassination Classroom. The problem with the story is that the original anime was already a comedy so there was no point in making a comedic story,more comedic.Art:1/10With these lazy cash grabs (chibi spin-offs) nine times out of ten the animation is piss pour and same thing counts with this one too. The art looks like paper slate characters with 3 frames and mostly stay stagnant.

The original anime had your fair share of one dimensional characters but also had deep characters like Karma or Irina but in this spinoff all the characters are dumbed down for the comedy aspect of it. I am extremely disappointed how Karma never learned how to overcome his ego and just stayed as your typical delinquent side character.Enjoyment and Overall: 1/10Overall I didn’t enjoy this anime. From dumbing down characters to unfunny and bad art and animation I will never come near this trash ever again. I highly recommend to not watch it or else you will waste your time on some trash. plot in Assassination Classroom.

When the producers decided to send KNT to America, they either didn\'t send the original scripts or they were translated badly before being sent.The result?Samurai Pizza Cats.The dub isn\'t a translation at all; in fact, the English scripts were made up based on what the characters seem to be doing as interpreted by the English crew. An ""interpretation"" is probably the only title you could give this show that links it to it\'s Japanese side.  No names were kept, and some characters...didn\'t even end up being the animal they were supposed to be. The characters are insanely flamboyant and exaggerated. Fourth wall shattering jokes abound, along with re-used animation sequences and humor that is clearly geared to an adult audience, despite this show having been shown on children\'s cartoon blocks.Samurai Pizza Cats definitely isn\'t for everyone, and is barely an anime in the common sense. Overall, this show feels like its a bastard born from America and Japan\'s relations in the early 90\'s, and if you have any appreciation for the culture that arose from that union, you will likely enjoy what you see here.

Usually the anime I get requests for are for a more teenage audience, if not older. Enter Kyattou Ninden Teyandee, an anime from the early 90s. It was brought to us by Tatsunoko Production. You may remember them from my review of C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control. You may also know them from that game they partnered with Capcom to make. It was written by Sekijima Mayori & Akahori Satoru, the man behind Bakuretsu Hunters. If the pink cat girl strips into bondage gear to fight I'm going to be...very unhappy but not surprised.Story:In the great city of Edoropolis, a bunch of animaloids go about their everyday lives. Unfortunately for them, part of that life is mecha attacks from the crow ninja faction in their ceaseless efforts to overthrow the shogun and install the economic Minister Korn as the new shogun. Fortunately, they have the secret Nyanki ninja trio on their side. The Nyanki trio, comprised of Yattarou, Pururun and Skashee, shows up to wipe out the darkness and ensure another fine day in Edoropolis. The episodes generally follow the basic pattern of Korn and his right-hand crow, Gennari, sending their crow ninja and some variety of mecha under the command of Karamaru to execute some plan to overthrow the government only to have the Nyanki show up to foil their plan. The episodes do have an order to them, but it's largely unimportant since most of them are pretty self-contained.Let's start by discussing one of the odd things about the series. It's not really bad, it's just strange. Mainly, Edoropolis would probably be better off if the villain won. Here's the thing, Korn is transparently evil but the shogun is a blithering fool and Princess Usa sends people away to prison island because they mildly annoy her. If Korn knew how to use PR he could probably get the public on his side pretty easily, even while still being obviously evil. Something like: “Hello, Citizens. Our fair city has the potential to be one of the greatest in the world. Are you tired of being held back by an incompetent shogun? Are you tired of having to be on guard so that you don't get arbitrarily sent to prison island by his daughter? Edoropolis deserves better. We deserve a leader with a strong intellect. A leader who can't be bothered to send people to prison island unless they actually commit a crime. Support Ktulu in overthrowing the government. He may be an evil, eldritch genius, but he's also mentally stable and a genius. Ktulu, because evil is better at leading than stupid.” The point her is, it wouldn't be difficult to make yourself look like a better choice than the brat who sends people away on a whim and the village idiot. Plus, acknowledging that you're evil would be refreshingly honest for a politician.Let's talk about the things that the series doesn't do well. I'm not going to criticise it for being simple or even formulaic, given the target audience, however, there are still problems with it. First we have the narrator. Basically, he chimes in almost every episode to explain the obvious and repeat the same titbit about Yattaro's special attack. Hate to break it to you, but kids are not that stupid. They don't need this character. Admittedly, there are some funny fourth wall breaking scenes with him, but they're few and really not worth his dragging things out. Moving into the subject of humour, there are two reoccurring “gags” in this that really don't work. The first is that Korn cross-dresses. There are circumstances in which cross-dressing can be amusing. The “Some Like it Red” episode from Due South, and the whole Bob scenario from Blackadder but if you look at those you'll notice that there's more to the scenario than just a guy in women's clothing and that's the entire joke in this. Maybe they were trying to dumb it down for children, but in doing so they also lost the potential for humour. Let the dude wear a lady's kimono, it's not a big deal. The second is the dirty old man joke. After a while, the Nyanki go to enlist the aid of a “great scientist” named Nekomata and, it turns out, he's just a dirty old man. It's funny because he... gropes women and makes them uncomfortable? There are also way too many recap episodes in this. Why do they even need recap episodes in a series where there's no over-arcing story?On a positive note, the comedic aspects of the series do mostly work pretty effectively. I also like that they can make fun of themselves and that they try variations for most of their reoccurring jokes in order to keep them fresh. The series is pretty entertaining too. If I were watching this as a kid I'd definitely like it more, but even as an adult they have some clever and entertaining parts. I appreciate that every single member of the Nyanki group, including their non-combatant support, Otama, gets their own chance to shine and act as the hero for at least an episode.Characters:There's not much to most of the characters. They follow basic tropes or, if they're a side character, they might be used for a running joke or two. To be fair, that's adequate given the target audience. The major exception is Karamaru who, surprisingly, gets a story arc where he legitimately develops and grows as a character. Even the main heroes don't have that. When they need to power up they just go a place and acquire a thing. Their characters stay the same. I also like that Karamaru shows hesitation over what he's ordered to do and questions whether or not it's for the best. Honestly, it makes him the most compelling character in the series.Art:Let me start by acknowledging that the art is really dated by today's standards. Now that that's out of the way, let's try to look at it more from the perspective of its time. The biggest flaw is just that the studio is kind of lazy. There are a lot of recycled scenes in this series, and not just the transformation and special attack sequences. Maybe they just thought that kids wouldn't notice. In spite of that, however, there is a charm to the art style and a lot of the enemy mecha designs are pretty creative. The character designs are pretty interesting too, although this is one of those series where the characters don't bother hiding their secret identities except by slightly changing their clothes and that works, somehow. I'll still give them credit on those counts.Sound:They got a pretty decent cast in this. Yamaguchi Kappei, Orikasa Ai and Kosugi Juurouta take on the roles of our main trio and they all do well. The best performance comes from Yamadera Kouichi as Karamaru. He gives quite a splendid performance, but that's balanced out by Sawaki Ikuya's performance as Korn. It sounds like he swallowed something and its kind of stuck in his throat. I'm sure he was told to sound like that, but it's still pretty grating. The music is decent enough.Ho-yay:There's a little bit. It's implied that Korn has romantic feelings for Gennari. Especially towards the end of the series. This is largely treated as humorous, for some odd reason.Final Thoughts:Kyattou Ninden Teyandee is a pretty decent series. There are certainly parts that don't work and are kind of problematic but it's still a fairly enjoyable series overall. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. Next week I'll look at something a bit darker and more adult, Gankutsuou. very unhappy but not surprised.Story:In the great city of Edoropolis, a bunch of animaloids go about their everyday lives. Unfortunately for them, part of that life is mecha attacks from the crow ninja faction in their ceaseless efforts to overthrow the shogun and install the economic Minister Korn as the new shogun. Fortunately, they have the secret Nyanki ninja trio on their side. The Nyanki trio, comprised of Yattarou, Pururun and Skashee, shows up to wipe out the darkness and ensure another fine day in Edoropolis. The episodes generally follow the basic pattern of Korn and his right-hand crow, Gennari, sending their crow ninja and some variety of mecha under the command of Karamaru to execute some plan to overthrow the government only to have the Nyanki show up to foil their plan. The episodes do have an order to them, but it's largely unimportant since most of them are pretty self-contained.Let's start by discussing one of the odd things about the series. It's not really bad, it's just strange. Mainly, Edoropolis would probably be better off if the villain won. Here's the thing, Korn is transparently evil but the shogun is a blithering fool and Princess Usa sends people away to prison island because they mildly annoy her. If Korn knew how to use PR he could probably get the public on his side pretty easily, even while still being obviously evil. Something like: “Hello, Citizens. Our fair city has the potential to be one of the greatest in the world. Are you tired of being held back by an incompetent shogun? Are you tired of having to be on guard so that you don't get arbitrarily sent to prison island by his daughter? Edoropolis deserves better. We deserve a leader with a strong intellect. A leader who can't be bothered to send people to prison island unless they actually commit a crime. Support Ktulu in overthrowing the government. He may be an evil, eldritch genius, but he's also mentally stable and a genius. Ktulu, because evil is better at leading than stupid.” The point her is, it wouldn't be difficult to make yourself look like a better choice than the brat who sends people away on a whim and the village idiot. Plus, acknowledging that you're evil would be refreshingly honest for a politician.Let's talk about the things that the series doesn't do well. I'm not going to criticise it for being simple or even formulaic, given the target audience, however, there are still problems with it. First we have the narrator. Basically, he chimes in almost every episode to explain the obvious and repeat the same titbit about Yattaro's special attack. Hate to break it to you, but kids are not that stupid. They don't need this character. Admittedly, there are some funny fourth wall breaking scenes with him, but they're few and really not worth his dragging things out. Moving into the subject of humour, there are two reoccurring “gags” in this that really don't work. The first is that Korn cross-dresses. There are circumstances in which cross-dressing can be amusing. The “Some Like it Red” episode from Due South, and the whole Bob scenario from Blackadder but if you look at those you'll notice that there's more to the scenario than just a guy in women's clothing and that's the entire joke in this.

Ninkuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/912/Ninkuu,"[""In the glorious 90s, when Disney Afternoon and Cartoon Network were enjoying the peak of their existence, anime viewing was few and far between. However, when the newly launched AXN channel decided to put an hour block exclusively for anime, I couldn't help but take a peek.As a result, Ninku came into my life. I'd venture so far as to say that Ninku (along with DBZ) introduced me to the world of anime. The story was never the show's strong suit. It's your average Hero's journey story.The art and sound are fairly well done for their time. In particular the slightly western themed...battle music which I found to be pretty epic. The characters are mostly unidimensional, you have your headstrong brawler, the idiot kid who's actually the most powerful of the lot and the somewhat balanced and intelligent fighter who keeps the team together. Add an annoying woman with a heart of gold and a flatulent penguin with superhuman strength, and you've got yourself the team of Ninku.The depiction of the fighting prowess of a Ninku fighter (especially the captains) is well executed. My only complaint would be that not all the Ninku captains are revealed. Even if they were killed, some background as to their whereabouts and their ultimate fate would have been appreciated. The side characters and villains are well balanced and keep the fighting and plot interesting (for the most part).Given that this anime was shown in the mid-90s. It came at a time when shows like Flame of Recca and Yu Yu Hakusho dominated the fighting anime genre. But still the lovable characters and well-executed fight scenes helps this show hold its own against the heavyweights of it's time. battle music which I found to be pretty epic.

So I'm just going to jump right into the review. This is going to be a long one. Strap yourself in.- PlotThe plot of this Anime is extremely straight forward and rather basic. Main character is on a journey to find his mother that was kidnapped when he was a a toddler, during his journey he meets up with old comrades and they embark on a quest to save his mother and take down the Imperial Army and liberate the Country. A long the way Challenges are...overcome, many interesting people are met, former Ninku companions are discovered. There are some neat things a long the way to keep your interest.So if you're looking for any plot twists or an intricate plot, you won't find this here. But what you will find here is a fun adventure, with good world building, fun characters and decent action.  The plot isn't complicated but it doesn't have to be because the main cast and the world are what really make this Anime enjoyable in my opinion.- PacingSince it is an adventure Anime a bulk of the time is allocated to side stories, so the pacing isn't going to be fast, but unlike other Shonen Anime these Side Stories are actually pretty well done and the outcome of them aren't always  happy endings. The thing that surprised me the most is how the writers did such a good job at building the world and people that live within it by using these side stories. You really start feeling immersed into this world and it makes you want to keep learning more and more about it.- CharactersMain CastFuusuke:  Rat Ninja and Former captain of Ninkuu's squad 1. His specialty is Air techniques. Pretty impressive resume for a 12 year old huh? He always has his good friend Hiroyuki Penguin by his side.Touji: Snake ninja and former captain of the 6th Ninkuu squad. He specializes in ground based abilities. He has a younger sister named Rihoko and has fought alongside Fuusuke and Aichou during the war and they have known each other since before then as well.Aichou: Rooster ninja and former captain of Ninkuu's squad 10. His abilities include being able to jump extremely high into the air and being able to soar in the sky. Not quite flying, but very damn close. He's hot tempered and is often brash and can be kind of a dick at first but he lightens up later on.Rihoko: The sister of Touji. She is not a combatant but she is shown to be able to use the substitution technique.Hiroyuki: Fuusuke's best friend. He is a Penguin with a lot of character.(which is expressed very well through gestures and the like since he cannot talk)Conclusion: The way these main characters interact with each other is probably one of the things I enjoyed the most about them. The interactions feel real and they talk to each other and act as friends would in real life. They are all able to express different emotions and characteristics  and it never feels forced or out of character. Overall their characters aren't deep or complex but they are fun, likable and ithe way they interact with each other and the world around them is well done.- VillainsI don't want to spoil the villains but I will list their names and give a basic description then talk a little about what I liked about them and what could have been improved on.- Kisumi (1 of the 3 colonel's in the Imperial Army, He has Long Blonde hair and has an Elegant, Feminine look to him.)His character was ok. His motivations made sense if not very original but I do wish they spent more time building his character. He is absent for a lot of the series and his character arc ends leaving a lot to be desired and falls kind of flat.- Ajirada (1 of the 3 colonel's in the Imperial Army, A big man with a sophisticated yet imposing presence)I really felt burned with Ajirada. They could have done so much more with his character. I really wish they expanded more on his back story, and there was a chance to give him a small character arc about half way through the series but for whatever reason they decided to not do it. He had the potential to be one of the most interesting characters in the show. Disappointing.- Mekira (1 of the 3 colonel's in the Imperial Army, a Red head with short hair and a tom boyish look) Again, Another villain that left much to be desired. (do you see a pattern here?) She had an interesting back story that they could have used to explore the world outside of the Country the story takes place in but they just choose to not do anything with it. They also chose to not do much with her character either. She comes into the show late and doesn't really do much of anything. Her character arc concludes okay, but they could have done more with her.- Kouchin  (Leader of the Imperial Army, Tall and wears garbs of a Priest)He also suffers from what the rest of the villains in this show suffer from. Not enough screen time to develop them enough. Kouchin however has even less time than the others and makes him the most boring villain of them all. His character is so text book, just like his motives. Yeah at the end we get a few reveals about him and why he's doing what he's doing but we're so disconnected from him by the end of the story that it's hard to care.Conclusion: The villains are by far the weakest part of this Anime. They aren't utilized enough. You have a 55 episode Anime and they don't do much of anything. Or have that big of an influence on the plot itself. They tend to show up then disappear for an extended period of time which I feel really shouldn't be happening.- MusicThe Opening and the 3 Ending songs are fantastic. I loved them.  They're all full of emotion and have a wonderful sound and vocals.The insert songs themselves aren't anything special but do a good job at fitting the tone of each scene. They also borrowed one specific insert theme from Yu Yu Hakusho. They could have used more from it that I missed but I doubt it.- VoicesThe cast here all did a great job with the voices. I have no complaints. For our Main cast we have Rica Matsumoto as Fuusuke who is known for the voice of Ashe Ketchum or Satoshi from Pokemon. Megumi Hayashibara as Rihoko, who is also Lina Inverse from Slayers. Jurota Kosugi as Touji who also has voiced Asuma from Naruto, Arlong from One Piece and Jonathan Jostar from Jo Jo. Then finally we have Mitsuaki Madono as Aichou who has voiced Kon from Bleach. They are all experienced and delivered their lines amazingly.- ArtThe character designs are nothing to write home about, almost all of them have the same kind of faces aside from Fuusuke, Mekira and Kisumi. I did like though how much effort was put into Rihoko's wardrobes though. Nearly every other episode she had a new outfit for the ENTIRE run of the show. Which is impressive. Character designs overall got the job done though. They were following the Mangaka's art, so no complaints. Oh yeah, there are literally no frames in which characters look off character or goofy, which is extremely surprising.The backgrounds, and environments  are beautifully drawn. Very Colorful and vibrant. Something that only hand drawn Animation cells can achieve. I really enjoyed looking at all the lush green countrysides and towns, snowy mountains, big blue oceans and skies. Just very nice to look at. I can't praise it enough.-AnimationThe animation is fluid and there were no reused animation sequences. You can clearly tell they had a good budget with this series. The fights are well done, regular movement is well done, Vehicle movement is well done. This is just a well animated show.- The settingThe story takes place in more of a Western setting. If I had to guess likely the early 1900's since there are planes, trains, automobiles, telephones and other kinds of early technology. The technology in this Anime is actually very consistent.You won't find anything that will break immersion here. In terms of locations you'll see everything from countrysides, deserts, islands,  snowy mountains, small villages, small towns and huge cities. There's definitely a lot variety here.- The World buildingThe world building is excellently done here. The people that live in it have real problems and feel like real people. We get to see how the aftermath of the War has affected these people through each episode and it really immerses you into the world and care about the people in it. Definitely the strongest point of this series was how this is handled.- Overall enjoymentI really enjoyed Ninku. The World was great, the main cast was great and aren't  preachy like in a lot of Shonen Anime. However I do wish that there were more fights but the fights it did have were well animated and didn't drag. I also would have loved if more time was spent on developing and using the cast of villains they had as well as made the plot a bit more tight.Overall I think this Anime is really underrated. For the World Building alone and Main cast I really recommend this. If you're a fan of Naruto it's also a treat to see where Kishimoto the author of Naruto drew a lot of his inspiration and ideas from.If you're a fan of Shonen give this a shot but be warned this is not a battle Shonen, Characters aren't going through training arcs, tournament arcs, or getting power ups and having long dragged out battles. So if that's what you are looking for you won't get it here. However if you want a different kind of Shonen that is different from the norm I really suggest you watch this.- Final ThoughtsIt's really a shame that a show that had so much money and effort put behind it just couldn't take off the way they expected it to. Cause this Anime had great production value for its time and even had several video games and other merchandise. I'm guessing kids couldn't really connect with some of the adult themes in this Anime like they could with other shows at the time.Ninku really is an interesting piece of work. I've never seen a Shonen Anime that made the world and characters all feel so.. well real. Truly a  lost gem in my opinion even with its flaws. overcome, many interesting people are met, former Ninku companions are discovered. There are some neat things a long the way to keep your interest.So if you're looking for any plot twists or an intricate plot, you won't find this here. But what you will find here is a fun adventure, with good world building, fun characters and decent action.  The plot isn't complicated but it doesn't have to be because the main cast and the world are what really make this Anime enjoyable in my opinion.- PacingSince it is an adventure Anime a bulk of the time is allocated to side stories, so the pacing isn't going to be fast, but unlike other Shonen Anime these Side Stories are actually pretty well done and the outcome of them aren't always  happy endings.

They're all full of emotion and have a wonderful sound and vocals.The insert songs themselves aren't anything special but do a good job at fitting the tone of each scene. They also borrowed one specific insert theme from Yu Yu Hakusho. They could have used more from it that I missed but I doubt it.- VoicesThe cast here all did a great job with the voices. I have no complaints. For our Main cast we have Rica Matsumoto as Fuusuke who is known for the voice of Ashe Ketchum or Satoshi from Pokemon. Megumi Hayashibara as Rihoko, who is also Lina Inverse from Slayers. Jurota Kosugi as Touji who also has voiced Asuma from Naruto, Arlong from One Piece and Jonathan Jostar from Jo Jo. Then finally we have Mitsuaki Madono as Aichou who has voiced Kon from Bleach. They are all experienced and delivered their lines amazingly.- ArtThe character designs are nothing to write home about, almost all of them have the same kind of faces aside from Fuusuke, Mekira and Kisumi. I did like though how much effort was put into Rihoko's wardrobes though. Nearly every other episode she had a new outfit for the ENTIRE run of the show. Which is impressive. Character designs overall got the job done though. They were following the Mangaka's art, so no complaints. Oh yeah, there are literally no frames in which characters look off character or goofy, which is extremely surprising.The backgrounds, and environments  are beautifully drawn. Very Colorful and vibrant. Something that only hand drawn Animation cells can achieve. I really enjoyed looking at all the lush green countrysides and towns, snowy mountains, big blue oceans and skies. Just very nice to look at. I can't praise it enough.-AnimationThe animation is fluid and there were no reused animation sequences. You can clearly tell they had a good budget with this series. The fights are well done, regular movement is well done, Vehicle movement is well done. This is just a well animated show.- The settingThe story takes place in more of a Western setting. If I had to guess likely the early 1900's since there are planes, trains, automobiles, telephones and other kinds of early technology. The technology in this Anime is actually very consistent.You won't find anything that will break immersion here. In terms of locations you'll see everything from countrysides, deserts, islands,  snowy mountains, small villages, small towns and huge cities. There's definitely a lot variety here.- The World buildingThe world building is excellently done here. The people that live in it have real problems and feel like real people. We get to see how the aftermath of the War has affected these people through each episode and it really immerses you into the world and care about the people in it. Definitely the strongest point of this series was how this is handled.- Overall enjoymentI really enjoyed Ninku. The World was great, the main cast was great and aren't  preachy like in a lot of Shonen Anime. However I do wish that there were more fights but the fights it did have were well animated and didn't drag. I also would have loved if more time was spent on developing and using the cast of villains they had as well as made the plot a bit more tight.Overall I think this Anime is really underrated. For the World Building alone and Main cast I really recommend this. If you're a fan of Naruto it's also a treat to see where Kishimoto the author of Naruto drew a lot of his inspiration and ideas from.If you're a fan of Shonen give this a shot but be warned this is not a battle Shonen, Characters aren't going through training arcs, tournament arcs, or getting power ups and having long dragged out battles. So if that's what you are looking for you won't get it here. However if you want a different kind of Shonen that is different from the norm I really suggest you watch this.- Final ThoughtsIt's really a shame that a show that had so much money and effort put behind it just couldn't take off the way they expected it to. Cause this Anime had great production value for its time and even had several video games and other merchandise. I'm guessing kids couldn't really connect with some of the adult themes in this Anime like they could with other shows at the time.Ninku really is an interesting piece of work. I've never seen a Shonen Anime that made the world and characters all feel so.. well real. Truly a  lost gem in my opinion even with its flaws."", ""In case you didn't know, Ninku was one of my first anime ever seen on TV as a child and is not that bad to be honest, the Male protagonist, Fusuke does look like a kid but he has skill, enemies tremble when they realize he is the captain of the first division, also known as Ninku No. 1By heart Fusuke is very kind and sweet and always fights to protect his friends and for the right cause, so you grow fond of Fusuke and the other characters very easily.the fights are quite good, comedy is well timed and overall the anime wont be a...let down if seen. let down if seen."", 'Ninku it\'s a really fun and incredibly underrated series. Well-choreographed fighting scenes, awesome soundtrack, a gorgeous and colorful animation, a simple plot and with some mistakes, but still very well written and a combo of friendly, goofy and captivating characters. Ninku is awesome, seriously, I really enjoyed this anime and recently watched it for the 2nd time lol.I think the strongest point of the series for me is the fact that they reinforce that Fuusuke is still just a little boy looking for his mother, and that even though he\'s strong, fights well and performs countless incredible feats, he still needs to be helped by...others. One of the things I like most about Ninku is how awesome the character design is, while Fuusuke and his friends wear normal and casual clothes (which something really cool), the villains are all stylish. The world building is also great, the 20th century Spanish setting mixed with a bit of feudal Japan is very good and original. The dictatorial post-war scenario is also very interesting and realistic, which leads to some very tragic moments. Much more happens throughout the anime and the best part is that we will not always have a happy ending at the end of each episode, which makes the experience even more immersive. When I watched Ninku for the first time I was really surprised that they covered these themes in an anime made for a younger audience. The interaction between the characters is very good, especially between our protagonists. Their conversation is something so natural that make it seem like we\'re in a circle of friends listening to some nonsenses.The anime\'s plot is completely different from the manga, where only a few chapters were adapted with some minor changes. Both are very episodic, but the anime has a focus, different from the manga, which the author himself admitted that he didn\'t really know what to do with his characters, and because of this he decided to start the story over again in the middle of the serialization, thus creating ""Ninku: Second Stage"". Kouji Kiriyama liked the anime so much that he even made a special chapter based on the OVA ""Knife no Bohyou"", which is also very good. Btw, if you\'re undecided about whether or not you should give Ninku a chance, I recommend starting with this OVA. It\'s really cool and has a awesome animation which remains consistent until the last episode of the anime.Despite having praised it so far, I need to talk about the series\' flaws and negative points. The plot has some HUGE inconveniences, with miraculous solutions that appear out of nowhere in the most crucial moments. Like characters that could have been introduced before and that only appear to help at that specific moment and nothing more. There are also some repetitive jokes that sometimes work, but more because of the reaction of the characters who are also tired of it. And we have the main villains who could have been used more, but were all left aside. Mekira, for example, had enormous potential for being a foreigner, they could have explored her past and homeland more. At least they\'re all cool and unique, with Kouchin being the most generic among them.Well, I\'m sure that if this had been broadcast here in Brazil along with Yu Yu Hakusho and Dragon Ball it would also have been a hit among kids. If I had watched this during my childhood, I\'d be playing as Fuusuke at school and my grandma\'s yard every day (the clothes I wore were exactly the same as his haha).Then that\'s it, I really recommend Ninku. And since my ratings are based on how much fun I personally had watching or reading something, I\'ll easily give Ninku a 9/10! It\'s one of those animes that makes me want to be a kid again. If you like a good fighting shonen, then go for it and give this series a chance, I\'m sure you\'ll be very well rewarded. others.

Sounds cool in paper but most of the time is about them going to one place and helping people. I like episodic/monster of the week shows like InuYasha, Ushio and Tora, etc. but unlike those, none of the minor problems felt very compelling enough to be memorable.The bigger story also gets very...predictible and boring with them trying to gather their other members and find some magic dragon or something. The only good thing here is the worldbuilding, with how the corrupt goverment's army is portrayed. Such a shame that this anime has nothing to do with the manga.Another problem when compared to other shows like this, is that the characters are very one-dimensional, Fuusuke is just the happy go lucky kid, like Gon Freecs or Naruto Uzumaki would eventually be, except he doesn't really have anything that made those two interesting. The other characters are very one note. Aichou is angry, Touji is laid back and Rihoko is one of the most annoying, useless female characters in any anime, all she does is scream, and Hiroyuki is sometimes cute, that's about it. Not to mention the kinds of jokes that are repeated over and over again get old very quickly and are very unfunny (Touji's plane breaking and Hiroyuki farting.)Being a Studio Pierrot anime, the opening and endings are amazing but that's about it. Overall it's a very bland anime that gets boring very quickly. Even Naruto, as poorly written as it is, is still more entertaining than this slog, despite being the show that inspired it. Or y'know, for something good just watch Hunter x Hunter. predictible and boring with them trying to gather their other members and find some magic dragon or something.

Most subs PT-BR who tried to revive this incredible anime don't know where to found more RAWs for it.There's nothing so much I can say about this anime, because I was too young when I watched this.

That line perfectly sums this whole experience, meaning this is a pretty mediocre remake allaround less focused on the typical giant mecha stuff of the original and more concerned of throwing at the viewer a series of fights in battle shounen/spokon fashion (to the point of looking more an Ashita No Joe remake with some sprinkles taken from Dragonball and Rupan Sansei part II than a Red Baron one) that are...watchable but don\'t go beyond the watchable part. Honestly, I sincerely don\'t get why the makers of this made such choice seeing that the dramatic angle of the original Red Baron tokusatsu had nothing wrong in it, the original Red Baron Tokusatsu is not a 70\'s Cutie Honey case of a series taking an angle (the Toku/pornographic one) and screwing the pooch so hard with the ending product that a remake like Cutie Honey flash (the best thing to come out of that franchise no questions attached) or even the entertaining but no more live action ones were needed from the get go but it was a good series enjoyable on its own, except for the typical tokusatsu tendency of starting a bit slowly and getting progressively better. Also, I must say the ending with the clone thingy mixed with (once again) stuff that reminds more of Dragonball than of a typical mecha show is really contrived and ridicolous, it makes the boring and overdone ending of the otherwise excellent tokusatsu Ultraman Cosmos series (the only Japanese Cosmos to my knowledge) look like a friggin\' masterpiece. What I personally save from this? the voice acting, the clean animation and the character of Marylin, because she reminds me of a mixture of two of my favourite characters (Fujiko Mine and Aphrodite Pisces) with some added fanservice to spice it up and the mechas she makes are indeed reminescent of female mechas from the 70\'s, but other than that I\'d say if you want a mecha anime show with elements taken from Ultraman like it was the original Red Baron toku series (that I recommend you to watch if you\'re into tokus like me) go with the Ultraman tribute going by the name of Evangelion (which also did the whole organic mecha thing better) and don\'t bother in the first place with this one, you\'re not going to miss anything special except the reiteration that the Tokus and animation medias on the longer run don\'t mesh well, some sparse and very rare exceptions permitted (see the beforementioned Cutie Honey live action tokus). watchable but don\'t go beyond the watchable part.

Seisenshi Dunbine,https://myanimelist.net/anime/929/Seisenshi_Dunbine,"[""This would be a masterpiece if anyone but Tomino made it. He follows the same stunted pattern of interpersonal drama in all of his shows. Prepare for criminal levels of autism from every character.Aside from that the fantasy world teeming with insect-like mecha and especially its relation with Earth are very interesting. As with all cel animation, watching the Blu-ray edition of this is a treat.Definitely one of the better mecha shows just by its concept alone. If you don't like medieval stuff you'll probably drop this before the focus shifts on anything else than big ol' ladybugs fighting each other for castles. "", 'This anime is based on a novel originally titled Wings of Rean by Gundam creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino who of course worked as the director of this series. If you&rsquo;re familiar with his work or the Gundam franchise in general, then you can recognize the approach and formula of how he does things, but in a different context in comparison to Gundam. And the original novel did not contain any mechs which was added at the insistence of sponsors such as Bandai. The pacing is appropriate for its length of 49 episodes and you&rsquo;re getting all kinds of characterizations of the cast, and each character acts...natural in their own way in relation to what&rsquo;s going on to a point you can consider realistic. And eventually other elements of Gundam are loosely transitioned to this anime that fans of that series can appreciate.The anime ends with some loose ends, not specifically the ending, but with some of the characters. And of course as you watch it, the characters have very unique names to the Japanese people in which American audiences would give a WTF reaction to. Such as the main antagonist and the rival is named Burn Burnings or whatever and the chief engineer of Drake&rsquo;s army is named Shot Weapon. Yes those are their names and that&rsquo;s the beginning of things to come.Well this anime was broadcasted shortly before I was born and while I was in the womb which was nearly 25 years ago, so the old animation might translate as &ldquo;bad animation&rdquo; for the stupid and close minded as some have reacted to the first Gundam series and Lupin III during their broadcasting on cartoon network. To me, this was the best that early 1980s TV anime had to offer. In tradition to that of Gundam, the design of the antagonists have a traditional but yet old military approach appropriate to the setting with their costumes and ceremonies. The hairstyles and costumes of the rebels on the other hand look like they are going to enter the battle of the bands. Hey, it&rsquo;s the 80s. So whether or not that is a good thing or bad thing is also up to you. I think in a rebel sense, that kind of design is appropriate.The character designer is Kogawa Tomonori who has acclaimed international fame on his own end as the character designer of Southern Cross, which would serve as part of the Robotech franchise that was started by Macross. Speaking of Macross, mechanical designer Miyataka Kazutaka was also the mech designer for this series as well and is truly in some ways the aura battlers in the tradition of the valkyries in their own right though they kind of look like insects. I&rsquo;m guessing they have a Kamen Rider influence. After all, Sho is a motorcycle driver and I&rsquo;m going to continue making that assumption based on this detail as well. I estimate the aura battlers are the same size as the valkyries and also share some of its unique engineering by transforming into a fighter jet. The battle sequences are breath taking and combine the elements of both Gundam and Macross and saying that alone should be enough to convince you how great and spectacular they are. Considering this is a Tomino creation, the concepts will of course favor more to the tradition of Gundam. If I elaborate on that, it would be somewhat of a spoiler.Well, I have yet to watch the dub. I have heard mixed things about it, and it is directed by Carl Macek, who is well known as the man who took some anime and meshed it together to make the Robotech franchise.  But I just personally don&rsquo;t feel any reason to watch the dub. Not really out of bad expectations of it, but simply I just don&rsquo;t want to and I&rsquo;m satisfied with the Japanese version. I&rsquo;m not discouraging anybody from watching the dub, it&rsquo;s just I don&rsquo;t feel any reason to watch it. Nakahara Shigeru is the voice of Sho, he would later become famous amongst anime fans as the voice of Trowa from Gundam Wing and Android 17 in Dragon Ball Z. His role as Sho in comparison to his more famous ones, he&rsquo;s of course on the lines of being like Camille from Zeta Gundam. He has issues and portrays being a teenager with them very well and sounding very childish. And my favorite seiyuu in this is Shimada Bin as the voice of the rival of Sho, Barn Barrings. His deep voice truly reflects the status and appearance of his character and it was truly tailor made for him. And of course, the presence of foreign characters, they do speak Japanese, but the anime has an interesting justified reason of why the characters can speak Japanese in this series. It&rsquo;s just that in Byston Well, people can somehow understand each other. Like if someone is talking to you in Chinese, you&rsquo;ll magically hear it as English and when you talk to that person, they&rsquo;ll hear your English as Chinese. And of course it&rsquo;s believable.The music is also excellent and highly intense which is appropriate for the action, and relaxing and mystical in appropriate for the middle ages setting. So you&rsquo;re getting all kinds of tracks appropriate for the atmosphere in terms of not just setting, but mood as well. MIO who would later rename her self MIQ sings both the opening and ending songs. The songs are also very kid friendly and are exclusively made for the show just like how the Macross and Gundam themes were. She has also sang the theme songs for Gundam 0083 and Area 88. I believe she also sang an English version of the theme song of Aura Battler Dunbine which I have yet to hear.After watching this review or if you had any prior exposure to this series, then you can take an obvious assumption that this anime could have influenced Escaflowne by Shoji Kawamori, the creator of Macross. I don&rsquo;t think that has officially been confirmed, but I say it&rsquo;s still a safe assumption to make. As much as I personally highly regard Aura Battler Dunbine, I do see it will not appeal to everyone outside of a dedicated fan base of mech or the staff members or old school anime in general, just like how lets say fan service and the sports genre isn&rsquo;t for everyone either. I say this is still a must see for fans of Gundam and Macross. But as I believe, if you appreciate excellent story telling, presentation and an approachable orthodox sense of originality, I say give this a shot. natural in their own way in relation to what&rsquo;s going on to a point you can consider realistic.

I don&rsquo;t think that has officially been confirmed, but I say it&rsquo;s still a safe assumption to make. As much as I personally highly regard Aura Battler Dunbine, I do see it will not appeal to everyone outside of a dedicated fan base of mech or the staff members or old school anime in general, just like how lets say fan service and the sports genre isn&rsquo;t for everyone either. I say this is still a must see for fans of Gundam and Macross. But as I believe, if you appreciate excellent story telling, presentation and an approachable orthodox sense of originality, I say give this a shot.', 'A true classic anime.  The series is over 20 years old so the art is going to turn some people off.The story, the characters and the unique approach to the world of the Wee-folk is very well done.  The Irish and Scottish lore that is mixed with the Japanese language and sense of honor and humanity is a cool blend.The mechanical designs are all based off of natural life forms (like insects).If you are a true fan of anime, love great stories and have a longing for something different then by all means watch this series. ', ""Aura Battler Dunbine, besides some stunted death scenes (I forgot one of the characters had died and was waiting for them to show up during my binge) is solid. The ending does come at you fast, and while it definitely delivers, Tomino has done some better endings (Controversial, but I liked how Victory's ending played out.)The concept, worldbuilding, characters and so on should be experienced blind by the viewer. Take my word on it and hop into Dunbine. It's an older, episodic anime but it's worth 'battling' through.This is probably the most unique fantasy mecha out there. I am actually glad Tomino wasn't allowed to...adapt this without mecha. Only because of how it plays into the story. Dunbine could work without mecha, but it would have needed another plot device to play with industrialized warfare arriving in a fantastical medieval-esque landscape. This dynamic seems to be born from the forced mecha (by the network) and while I normally hate networks forcing things onto creators, Dunbine would be boring without it. adapt this without mecha.

Being directed by famous Gundam director Yoshiyuki Tomino, Dunbine offers a good number of the director\'s trademarks with exploring the harshness of war, a cynical world view, and a high death count that affects even the show\'s major characters. The fantasy world setting brings about the applications of a mysterious power source called ""Aura""...that are utilized by a number of the show\'s characters in various facets, among which allowing mecha pilots and aerial warships to enhance the powers of their technology. The constant combat and abuse of the Aura power utilized through the technology does gradually lead things to be complicated by the presence of outside forces that attempt to remove or kill off anyone involved in the conflict between those using technology utilizing the power of ""Aura"".Outside of the focus on mecha action and war, Dunbine also does a solid job with its world building and character focus. The world of Byston Well adopts a number of medieval and fantasy elements to its world as outside of its ""aura"" power, other fantasy-based creatures like pixies and dragons exist within its world. The series also takes time to develop and flesh out a number of its major characters to offer a glimpse within their lives and how they are affected by Drake\'s machinations to control all of Byston Well for its residents or those who get transported to the realm from Earth. In addition, the series offers some surprising twists with its storytelling that lead the conflict between the resistance movement and Drake\'s faction to intensify, including some splintering of factions within Drake\'s own ranks.This said, Dunbine does have its faults. A good part of the show\'s second half does drag a bit at points where episodes are focused on battles between the factions, but offering little to flesh out characters or advance the plot in any capacity. Some enemy characters shown to be legitimate threats to Show and his comrades don\'t get much fleshing out and are limited in their characterization, reducing the impact their demises carry. Also, the visuals to the series haven\'t really aged with its rough character design work and subpar animation, though its mecha designs are rather unique among mecha anime with their bug-like features.Faults aside, Aura Battle Dunbine is still a solid entry in the mecha with its solid mix of fantasy and mecha action story elements while influenced under Yoshiyuki Tomino\'s direction for its storytelling direction. If 80s mecha anime grab your interest, Dunbine is a solid recommendation I would suggest checking out in spite of some of its issues. that are utilized by a number of the show\'s characters in various facets, among which allowing mecha pilots and aerial warships to enhance the powers of their technology.

It is also the first case of a dark isekai / fairy tale in anime that many seem to overlook these days and think there has never been such a thing before Rezero and Mushoku Tensei.The premise is cool, about people from Earth being forcefully transported to another dimension, where they become pilots of huge robots that work with aura, this world’s life source. It’s very similar to the Newtypes of Gundam in this regard. So similar that it’s actually… a complete copy of them,...forcefully added in the show. In the original story there were no mechas, but Sunrise added them because Gundam was “in” and the show would sell more plamos. Thus you get these bug-like huge robots that work like Gundams.The story continues with the lead pilot turning renegade after he sees how cruel his boss is and aids rebels and neighboring kingdoms in ending his dictatorship. Oh I said kingdoms, didn’t I? Yes, it’s because the setting of the world is like the Middle Ages, accompanied with unicorns, fairies and … flying saucers and bug robots. It’s a weird science fantasy setting, akin to He-Man’s Eternia. Most of the plot can come off as episodic missions, like transporting a princess to safety or battling enemy camps, and occasionally you get romantic sub-plots and turn-heels. Every decent strategy rpg needs those.The pacing will definitely feel slow for modern standards, as the need to have a mecha battle in each episode is crammed in by Sunrise and becomes an excuse to stretch the length of an event to at least 3 times its natural duration, because they needed to sell more plamos. This changes in the last two episodes, which go turbo and end hastily two dozen sub-plots at the same time, making the finale to feel sloppy.The story is not that linear or predictable, since you get the rare occasion where the isekai world bleeds in our world and you have an alien invasion of sorts. And there is plenty of genocide, so it’s not some Power Rangers defending Angel Grove situation. There is also a large death toll throughout the show, maintaining the feeling of dread that war leaves in its path. Remember, this is a dark isekai. The ending goes as far as killing almost all its cast, something which Tomino reused as a concept from his Ideon work. And just like it happened there, it was done in a rushed manner, as if the plot armor magically lifted and everyone could suddenly die now just because the show is about to end. It comes off as a cheap method to have a more vivid last impression.As far as the cast goes, there is variety in personalities and agendas that prevent the characters from becoming boring too fast. Plus, many of them eventually die or gain your sympathy along the way. But as far as personalities go, I only consider Chaum, the mascot pixie, to be the only memorable character for her perky looks and silly actions. She works as nothing but a comic relief but she is also a huge contrast to everybody else and as weird as it sounds, she is the only one I was cheering for. So ok, she is cute too, but that is not all I found in her. Tomino had another pixie in his later L-Gaim anime, yet that one didn’t manage to win me as much because she was mute and was used as a panacea for various problems. Not that the cast is otherwise bad; it is in fact a worthy bunch of idealists and scheming aristocrats. Their names are also so weird; a blend of mythology and engrish that vary from cool to silly. They all have their purpose in the story, which unfortunately wraps up in a hurry during the finale.The production values are bit hard to appreciate if you are accustomed to modern anime. There are a lot of jerky motions and still panels used, the background will usually loop too obviously, and the characters will look weird in many occasions. Other than that, the weird blend of sci-fi and fantasy create an interesting setting that can be captivating if you don’t expect another photorealistic Avatar. The music themes can be catchy and memorable.In all, this is one of Tomino’s best works after Turn-A and the original Gundam season. There are plenty of pacing issues and the animation suffers more than it should for its time, but it’s otherwise a good science fantasy anime with lots of dark twists. With that said, the similar in tone Escaflowne blows it out of the water and I highly recommend it over this one.Oh, by the way, keep the hell away for the sequel New Aura Dunbine as well as the spin-off The Wings of Rean. They are as shitty as shit can get. forcefully added in the show. In the original story there were no mechas, but Sunrise added them because Gundam was “in” and the show would sell more plamos.

They are as shitty as shit can get.', 'I went into this anime because of its connection to Garzey\'s Wing. So my standards were set pretty low from the start. The first third of the show isn\'t very good. The main character is thrown into situations that make no sense, mood whiplash occurs between shots (one second an army seems hostile, throws stuff at the characters, then suddenly start acting friendly for minimally explained reasons,) and I had to switch from subbed to dubbed because the script seemed mistranslated because of how random some things seemed. I soon learned that wasn\'t the case. I understand that our main character is bewildered and confused,...but for the audience, it isn\'t an immersive confusion.That said, things get a lot better around episode 16-18. We start following a much more interesting cast of characters, and they actually explain their motivations and the world around them. They are not flawless by any means. Some characters are annoying, but their struggles are at least understandable given the plot.And then around halfway through the series, the stakes get elevated, and things start getting interesting. As of this review, I\'m not super familiar with Tomino\'s other works, but this is when some of the stuff Tomino is known for starts coming into play. While it\'s not as intense as some of Tomino\'s other works, it still works very well in this setting, and with these characters. If you\'re really into 80s mecha, or a big Tomino fan, the second half of this anime is worth it for that alone.Story: 7Most of these points are for the second half of the story. The story of a regular guy getting whisked away to a magical world, where he is naturally stronger than everyone else is nothing new. And the fact that the first part of the show is so poorly written doesn\'t help. But once we start following a new set of characters, things start picking up. And after a certain event happens to our main character, the story becomes truly engaging. The last act of the story is very noteworthy. If the story had started around episode 16, the story rating would have been much higher.Art: 5This is not very good animation. The characters almost always wear masks in battle, so the animators don\'t have to animate lipflap (or much of anything during these shots.) The characters aren\'t very expressive, and really lean on the voice actors to emote. The mechs themselves are well designed (nothing groundbreaking, but still well executed.) There are many shots of big ships slowly flying towards each other, while bullet/beam animations loop over it. The monsters are nothing to write home about either. That said, there are some genuinely beautiful shots in here. Most of them involve the mechs. You can tell what shots received budget support, and which ones didn\'t.Sound: 4The music was inoffensive. It got you riled up when it needed to, and it gave you quiet moments when it needed to. Some of the soundbites sound archaic (stock baby crying and stock monster roars.) I do not think there was any voice direction for this dub. There are a few minor characters that are delightfully miscast. The voice actor who plays Show does a great job given what he had to work with. Some of the accents were distracting. My main gripes with the dub is that many of the female characters have extremely annoying voices (not helped by exaggerated accents.) The timing for these lines was also off, result in characters talking over each other. One character might say ""I agree"" before the other character is even done talking. It doesn\'t effect the story. But it is distracting.Character: 6The main character is a surprisingly logical. It\'s clear that all of the characters are intelligent on the battlefield. Off the battlefield is another story.This anime has some of the most poorly executed romances I\'ve ever seen. One couple, the guy just randomly asks if the girl has feelings for him with no build up that he was even interested. Then they kiss. And then a few episodes later they seem to forget that this conversation happened, and repeat the exchange all over again. There are some couples where they love each other ""just because."" There is an extremely clumsy love square that doesn\'t last long.Show seems to have the largest range of emotion. He reacts appropriately to everyone around him. He also has understandable reactions to the bad things that happen to him personally, and the things that happen to others as a result of his actions. Keen has some very good moments early on, and is believable as a kid with more guts than most people around her. Elle is a very good princess, and I wish we saw more of her as opposed to Emelie (one of the most annoying characters in the show.) I was pleasantly surprised by how well Elle\'s grandfather was portrayed. He was realistic while being reasonably flawed.Where this show shines is its villains. Emelie\'s mother is one of the most intimidating villains of the show, more so than the main baddy Drake. And she has a lot of competition for that position. It was a shame that there wasn\'t more focus on her machinations. Galaria was a great rival character. I\'d argue she was a better rival than Todd. Her character growth was interesting to watch, in spite of her status as an antagonist. There were points where I almost wanted Bunnings to win. His struggle was relatable, and had he not chosen the wrong side, he could\'ve become so much. I genuinely wanted him to switch sides, so he could have some well earned redemption. Jeryl was a delightfully ruthless antagonist. I was pleased with all of her appearances, her final appearance especially. And while not really an antagonist, King Elf did a great job of highlighting stupidity, the danger of said stupidity, and how that stupidity effects the battlefield. Most of the character points in this review come from the villains.Enjoyment:6If you like 80s mecha anime, you will probably like this. If you like Tomino anime, you will probably like this. If you like nostalgically bad dubs, probably you will like this (it\'s no Garzey\'s Wing, but there are some funny moments in there.)If you do not fall into any of these categories, you will have to get used to the low budget animation, and the low budget dub.You will have to sit through 15-ish episodes of not very good anime to get to the good anime that\'s buried under it. This anime is far from groundbreaking. But after the first 15-ish episodes, I found myself enjoying it. The last third especially was quite enjoyable. The ending is not as intense as some other Tomino works out there, but if you\'re just getting into Tomino anime, the ending will leave an impact with you.

I remember hearing about this anime about 10 years ago. The art looked out dated and didn't peak my interest. Then early last year I was checking out some of Tomino's non Gundam Works. After finishing Space Run Away Ideon I decided to give Aura Battler a go. After a bout a year I finally completed it. How do I feel about it? Well lets find outLets start with a synopsisIt's about a Japanese Boy named Sho that one night while riding his Motorcycle he ends up being transported to a land named Byston Wells. Soon after arriving he finds...out he's in Lord Drakes Kingdom(who is the main antagonist of the anime). Due to not knowing what's going on Sho ends up enlisting into Drakes Military where he meets another man from Earth named Todd Guiness. After a few fights in their Aura Battlers Sho ends up seeing that Drakes intentions are to conquer the land, thus defects and ends up meeting Neil Givens that's leading a group of freedom Fighters in which he joins.- SoundThe music used in this anime is nothing special. Nothing stands out or is memorable other than the intro which is very catchy and the ending which is also quite nice.- ArtAs someone that enjoys hand drawn shows, this one just didn't age well at all. Character designs are just OK. Some characters can look really weird at times. The Aura Battlers.. a lot of people have said their designs are one of the best parts of this series. I personally think they look kind of messy. Most of them use colors that don't make them pop so a lot of the Battlers come off as looking flat.Overall look just didn't click with me. Backgrounds are pretty well done. Didn't see much wrong.- Voice actingNothing much to say here. I saw the Japanese version. They all did a good job.- AnimationLike other mecha anime during the time. You'll find recycled frames here too. Animaton during battles are alright even though sometimes it can look janky. Character movement is ok for the most part too. It gets the job done-  The CharactersNot the best written characters Tomino has come up with. I didn't care for any of the main cast protagonists. They were likable. I just didn't care. The antagonists were a mixed bag. It was basically either them wanting to rule because they're power hungry. Or them just wanting to fight just to fight. The most promising one was Shot Weapons motivation and wanting revenge. Unfortunately nothing came of that. To be honest the most memorable thing about these characters are their names. Except Cham. Cham is the best.- Overall StoryIt's just decent. It starts off strong. Different from your average Mecha anime. After the first like 20 episodes the pace becomes terrible.  Pretty much every major player is introduced within those  episodes but instead of progressing the plot it decides to waste your time. Not much of anything happens again until around episode 30.The plot picks up again until around episode 40 in which it devolves into more battle of the week. Until the last like 3 episodes. I'd compare it to a race. Runner starts off strong slows down in the middle then picks up speed a bit again. Then in the home stretch gets second wind runs faster than the start but ends up falling on its face and crawls to the finish line.- overall enjoymentI wouldn't watch this ever again. It wasn't terrible but it felt like a huge waste of time in the end. I honestly enjoyed the first 20 something episodes the most. After that it was hit or miss. Had to push myself to finish this.- Overall thoughtsI really think this anime could have felt like less of a disappointment if it got one last episode to properly wrap it up and give us a real ending. Other issues I had were the Mecha battles. They were boring to watch. Recycled animation and just weren't interesting. The overall anime had great ideas but failed to execute most of it well. It took long for the plot to progress at times. During those times it was hard to keep my interest. Final thing is the subplots abruptly all end with subpar conclusions. I think if this series ditched the mechs it could have spent more time on plot and characters.Do I recommend it?Honestly unless you're a Tomino completist, not really. I also certainly can't recommend this to mecha fans either. This whole anime just felt like a huge waste of time due to the ending that essentially kicks the viewer in the nuts and gives them the finger. I'm serious. You spend all this time watching this poorly paced show and get rewarded with nothing. I can forgive a poorly paced show with a good or great ending but this is neither. Just stay away from this show. Not worth the time with that episode count. Yea Dunbine was ahead of its time and had some cool ideas but at this point theres nothing you probably haven't already seen here in modern anime. Bottom line. If you have expendable time on your hands and have the patience. Try it. If you have limited time and value it. Don't bother. out he's in Lord Drakes Kingdom(who is the main antagonist of the anime).

It gets the job done-  The CharactersNot the best written characters Tomino has come up with. I didn't care for any of the main cast protagonists. They were likable. I just didn't care. The antagonists were a mixed bag. It was basically either them wanting to rule because they're power hungry. Or them just wanting to fight just to fight. The most promising one was Shot Weapons motivation and wanting revenge. Unfortunately nothing came of that. To be honest the most memorable thing about these characters are their names. Except Cham. Cham is the best.- Overall StoryIt's just decent. It starts off strong. Different from your average Mecha anime. After the first like 20 episodes the pace becomes terrible.  Pretty much every major player is introduced within those  episodes but instead of progressing the plot it decides to waste your time. Not much of anything happens again until around episode 30.The plot picks up again until around episode 40 in which it devolves into more battle of the week. Until the last like 3 episodes. I'd compare it to a race. Runner starts off strong slows down in the middle then picks up speed a bit again. Then in the home stretch gets second wind runs faster than the start but ends up falling on its face and crawls to the finish line.- overall enjoymentI wouldn't watch this ever again. It wasn't terrible but it felt like a huge waste of time in the end. I honestly enjoyed the first 20 something episodes the most. After that it was hit or miss. Had to push myself to finish this.- Overall thoughtsI really think this anime could have felt like less of a disappointment if it got one last episode to properly wrap it up and give us a real ending. Other issues I had were the Mecha battles. They were boring to watch. Recycled animation and just weren't interesting. The overall anime had great ideas but failed to execute most of it well. It took long for the plot to progress at times. During those times it was hard to keep my interest. Final thing is the subplots abruptly all end with subpar conclusions. I think if this series ditched the mechs it could have spent more time on plot and characters.Do I recommend it?Honestly unless you're a Tomino completist, not really. I also certainly can't recommend this to mecha fans either. This whole anime just felt like a huge waste of time due to the ending that essentially kicks the viewer in the nuts and gives them the finger. I'm serious. You spend all this time watching this poorly paced show and get rewarded with nothing. I can forgive a poorly paced show with a good or great ending but this is neither. Just stay away from this show. Not worth the time with that episode count. Yea Dunbine was ahead of its time and had some cool ideas but at this point theres nothing you probably haven't already seen here in modern anime. Bottom line. If you have expendable time on your hands and have the patience. Try it. If you have limited time and value it. Don't bother.""]"
Red Garden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1601/Red_Garden,"[""It's funny that when I first started watching I thought the characters looked ridiculous and now I find it much more 'natural' than purple-haired, bug eyed smurf-sized lolitas. Maybe it's the fantastic characterization and development that has made me warm to them. Either way the glamorous look Red Garden is given really enriches my understanding of the very unglamorous conflicts, emotions and changes the characters endure. At times I feel that they could've made it just a little bit more filthy. In fact I get thirsty during the fight scenes for some unnerving material. The first couple of episodes where Rachel's nail is cracked, really...sold it for me. I love that sort of imagery, where it's such a noticeable detail that makes a vein character feel so ugly.I've never been to New York or a city as large but I definitely get the feeling in Red Garden of the girls being alone in a place packed with people. I love this element and I think it's portrayed so well through each of the girls reaching out to people they love and dealing with the social problems their condition creates. The relationships present in RG are so intricate and developed that they rival with Honey and Clover. The series really spends a lot of time encouraging the viewer to empathize with the girls and really understand all the realistic problems; socially, financially, academically and physically, they go through.There has not been one moment in the series where I've wanted to see more action, or wanted a plot twist. Everything is timed perfectly and I believe that pacing in a series makes a very big difference to the enjoyment. Each character cries for just enough time before they get annoying. We go through a cycle of the four girls and switch from problem to problem between them and not once have I hated one of them even though they have obvious weaknesses. This is because I understand their situations so well thanks to the magnificent characterization.The music is great too. I even liked the singing at the end of a few episodes, though unfortunately it stopped. I thought it was a little bit embarrassing and I still can't really figure out why they were singing but it was a little rest from all the emotional stress we had gone through in the first few episodes. The OP song is good, it's glamorous and does sound a bit 1920s American jazz-like. I think it suits the series well. I like the OP animation, it's subtleness is admirable and I prefer it to slow moving shots of the characters' naked silhouettes.Finally I think the most obvious strength in Red Garden is it's reason, it's restraint and it's sensible realism. Four girls given super-human powers and a chance to kill crazed cannibals sounds like a girl-kick-butt action packed saga. Instead Red Garden has realistically depicted it's characters being challenged instead of automatically displaying masterful martial arts skills. No leather-clad voluptuous cyborg vampire slayers here. These are emotional and quite normal teenage girls with different backgrounds. It's very impressive stuff and the ending didn't disappoint. sold it for me.

Each evening, at any time before midnight, a team of female students from a prestigious school in New York may be summoned by a mysterious woman named Lula to engage in a deathmatch against fast, vicious, zombie-like monsters. Surrender and nonparticipation are not valid options. The girls know nothing about why they've been chosen or who they're really working for, but they hope to find out before it's too late.Studio Gonzo's artistic work here is wholly different from the...norm. Red Garden's characters are tall and lanky, distinctly European-looking, mostly pale and thin, as if to emphasize their fragility and their proximity to death. Their hair and their hard, angular faces are rendered with an attention to detail that borders on obsessive. The backgrounds do a competent job displaying the ins and outs of a big city, from elegant party halls and bustling streets to half-vacant, slummy apartments; none of them draw the eye in quite the same way as the characters, but the effort is nonetheless appreciable. Shortcuts are taken in the animation here and there, but for the most part they're at least placed in such a way as to not be obtrusive, neither adding to nor detracting from the visual experience. The fight scenes are more about the emotional element than the actual combat, so I'll look past what could generously be described as uninspired choreography on that front. Red Garden is at its visual best during moments of calm, when its uniquely stylized character designs can draw a breath and do their job.The soundtrack is orchestral, almost exclusively low and atmospheric, sometimes rising with a subtle and foreboding crescendo during developing scenes of action. On its own two legs, it's humble, not what you're likely to remember as an awesome musical score, but it blends seamlessly into the show, quietly touching the right notes and enhancing the mood from its place in the background. That merits a certain amount of praise. It does its job, and does it well.Red Garden's biggest strength lies in its characters, who are drawn from different backgrounds and social circles to fight for their lives. We meet Rose, a shy and caring everygirl; Rachel, a rebellious partygoer; Kate, the daughter of a wealthy family who is held to high expectations in school; and Claire, a tough loner with few friends. In the past, they've all been passing classmates at best, and they have no common ground. They simply don't like each other. Their personalities don't mix. Two are meek and timid, two are strong and overly confrontational. They bicker, judge, and throw insults without considering the consequences, as teenagers are apt to do. Combat only amplifies these difficulties—how can you entrust your life to (or risk your life for) someone you don't even respect, someone who talked down to you earlier that same day? The end result, curiously, is that all of the girls are too hesitant. No one makes a move during a fight, out of fear that none of the others will come to their aid.But necessity's hand is at work. The girls soon realize that the choice between cooperating and dying is really no choice at all, and they begin to work as a team, slaying their opponents with newfound proficiency. In the process, they find their common ground: a strong desire to live. Trust in battle leads the group to new highs, and eventually the stilted pseudo-friendship turns into the genuine article. Interactions under the moon and those under the sun bleed together. The team meets in everyday life, and its members warmly help each other work through personal problems. The girls are well-written, well-developed, and believably frayed. Red Garden's drama can sometimes seem over-the-top, but it's usually justified. After all, its characters live each day on edge, trying to get through school while dreading the summons of Lula, never knowing what might happen at night, frequently haunted by what happened the night before. Anyone would be a nervous, screaming wreck in that situation.If only the story were handled so gracefully. Early in the series, the girls reach the realization that they're being forced to fight because of two ancient families who cursed each other, and the series takes it from there, delving deeper and deeper into a labyrinthine backstory about the two families and the set of rules by which the curses can be removed or applied. Now, that's a neat (if somewhat trite) idea in its own right, and it could have lead to something rather slick; it has a certain sort of dark, modern folklore appeal to it. But suffice to say that no matter how many ways I look at the dozens of details piled upon this story, they simply don't add up to anything coherent. Every time something is revealed, more inconsistencies and unanswered questions are revealed along with it. At almost any point, they could have (and should have) stopped adding to the top of the structure, and reinforced its base instead. But they don't, they keep stacking and stacking until the house of cards falls. It is a brute-force approach to storytelling which relies on the incorrect assumption that the sheer number of elements is what makes a story intricate and involving. It is dense but ultimately nonsensical, and it ends up serving as a vehicle to carry the infinitely more interesting character drama to us rather than serving as a strong addition to the show.One other thing: the characters sing. Much as I wish that were a joke, an exaggeration, or just a bad dream that I had, it really happens. Red Garden's characters sometimes burst into song at the drop of a hat, and it is every bit as awkward as it sounds. Where this idea came from, the world may never know; there is nothing else in the show that hints at it being a musical, and the songs occur once per episode at most, sprouting spontaneously out of normal dialogue like tonally-challenged tumors. The singing itself is mediocre (in both Japanese and English) and the lyrics are cringeworthy. I wish I could pass this off as just another little quirk in a series that's full of little quirks, and some might choose to look at it that way, but the truth is that even without this element Red Garden would be a bit of a confused experience, and the moments of song produce an even more heightened sense of unreality, as if begging the viewer to ask: am I really watching this right now? In fairness, they appear to have scrapped this idea about eight episodes in, and the last two-thirds of Red Garden are blissfully singing-free, but the “what were they thinking” damage is pretty well done by that point, and it's not easily forgotten.I don't see any of these as fatal shortcomings, though combined, they might come close. When Red Garden works, it works surprisingly well, with a unique artistic presence, fitting music, and a group of interesting characters serving as the high points of the series. It's certainly not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but if it sounds like it might be yours, giving it a try couldn't hurt. I can't sing its praises, but I'll give it a soft recommendation. norm.

It is still running in Japan, and has two volumes to its name.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.The anime itself ran on Japanese television from October 3rd, 2006 to March 13th, 2007, and was directed by Kou Matsuo (well-known for directing the Rozen Maiden project) and animated by Studio Gonzo (well-known for Gankutsuou and Saikano).  ADV has licensed the show Stateside, and...the third volume will be released on the twenty-second of this month.Story: Red Garden's focuses in on four girls -- Kate (the one who's rich and is on the student disciplinary council Grace), Rachel (the bitchy queen bee of her clique, you know the type), Rose (the sweet, quiet one with the little siblings) and Claire (the punk) -- who go to the same school (Roosevelt Academy, which is strangely Japanese-esque for being in the middle of New York) and, for whatever reason, can't remember the night before.  As the day goes on, they find out that a girl they all knew, Lise, was found dead that day.  After being let out for the day, each of the girls sees a bunch of red butterflies, and mysteriously wind up in the same place. A creepy lady and her male partner show up, inform the girl that they're their instructors, and before telling them to kill a man who turns into a freaky wolf-demon thingy with their bare hands, that they're all dead.Quite the first episode, huh?The rest of the series focuses on how the girls deal with the fact that they're dead and all and the fact that they now have to fight and kill these monsters in order to stay alive, and the mysteries behind all this unfolding bit by bit.One of the most frequent complaints that you will hear about Red Garden is that it's slow.  And I won't deny it; the series does overall focus more on the personal lives of the girls and how what's going on now affects that more than the actual how and why of what's going on, and it makes things seem painfully slow.  However, the latter does come into play, and when it does, it hits hard.  The first ten or so episodes lays the groundwork for what's going on, the next six develop the situation as things are revealed and the stakes are raised, and the final six shows all the cards and lays everything on the line.By the end of the series, you know everything that's going on in these girls' lives, and you feel like you've known them your entire life.  They did really well, developing them.  And even most of the bad guys and minor characters get some development, so they seem more human and less like cardboard cutouts.Oddly enough, there are a lot of references to American pop culture, which makes sense, as it's set in NYC, but it still throws you for a loop at first.It's not perfect, though.  The how and why of what's going on is never fully explained, which is mildly annoying, but not unexpected, seeing as this is the guy who directed Rozen Maiden (and could've resolved it quite nicely in Traumend, but NO!).  And there are random bits of song that are thrown in in the first half that many will find painful, but they're quickly abandoned by the second half, which was a good call.  And the ending and its vagueness (another hallmark from Rozen Maiden) will probably piss some people off, but know that there is an OVA called Dead Girls that is available raw, but not subbed, and some group should really pick it up.Art: Red Garden has an interesting style in how they design their characters -- more like the Korean style that I've seen in manga, really, than what I consider manga. The necks are unrealistically thin, the noses are really weird, and the lips are huge.  But you get used to this by the third episode or so, and it grows on you after a while.  And they use gradient shading here and there, and it really looks nice, but only because it's not overused.  They also had the budget for outfit changes at least once every episode, which is nice, but the fashion sense was a bit lacking at times, and resulted in painful outfits.Otherwise, fairly decent animation.Music: The background music for this is very heavy on strings and piano, and it's really done well.  It does seem a bit overdramatic at times, but those times are few and far between, and for the most part, it adds to the scenes quite nicely.JiLL-Decoy Association does the OP, &quot;Jolly Jolly&quot;, which is a lighthearted bit of J-Jazz, and seems a bit out of place with how dark the rest of the series is, but is still pretty nice.  LM.C does the two EDs; &quot;Rock the LM.C&quot; for the first half of the show, which is a blend of hard rock and rap, and &quot;Oh My Juliet&quot; for the second half, which is more rock-oriented and a bit more of a love song.Seiyuu: Red Garden is unusual in that the dialogue was recorded before the animation was created (when it's usually the other way around), and you can tell the difference in the quality of the acting, which is top-tier.  They've also got three of my favorite seiyuu (Rie Tanaka, aka Suigin Tou; Takehito Koyasu, aka Ilpalazzo and Hotohori; and Daisuke Ono, aka Koizumi), which just adds to the awesomeness.Voice Actors: However, as normal, the awesomeness of the seiyuu does not translate to the VAs for the English version.  Most of the VAs perform their lines like robots, and/or are painfully fake-sounding/high-pitched where they shouldn't be.Acting like this is the reason I've gone to subs and never looked back.  Also, this is why America should just stick to subs.  Fail, ADV.  FAIL.Length: 22 episodes is just the right length for this series.  Yes, it drags a bit in places and probably could have used more development in others, but any shorter and it would've gotten the shaft, and any longer and it would've gotten painful.Overall: An excellent series with an unusual art style, beautiful music, and excellent story and seiyuu.

At first, I thought it was too complex, but then again, not really. Everything was pretty much explained during the last episodes, except for the butterflies. I think &ldquo;weird&rdquo; is a more fitting word to describe the story of Red Garden. You know what&rsquo;s weird? The girls&rsquo; enemies. Why did they have to move like rabid dogs? I also thought the plot was moving really slow. During the...first episode, Rachel seemed to have gained a new ability, but they didn&rsquo;t talk about that again until the second half.The whole plot wasn&rsquo;t confusing though. I love how there are dramatic parts in between the episodes, those that are about the four main girls&rsquo; relationships with the men they encounter in their life. I especially love it when the focus is on Rachel and Rook&rsquo;s relationship. That&rsquo;s why I call Red Garden action shojo.The four main characters were great. They all had different dynamics, but they were great with each other. I liked every single one of them. I liked Claire&rsquo;s independent personality, how Rachel isn&rsquo;t afraid to speak her mind, Kate&rsquo;s gracefulness, and Rose&rsquo;s cute pout. I also like how they&rsquo;re made to live to kill, or vice-versa. The supporting characters were great too. The boys were really dashing, and the villains were horrific. I didn&rsquo;t get Paula though, the leader of Grace. She seemed like she was in love with Kate. I also didn&rsquo;t get the two policemen who kept following them around &ndash; were they even necessary to plot development? I kept thinking those two were some sort of filler characters.I wasn&rsquo;t really a fan of the voice acting. Sometimes I felt that the characters didn&rsquo;t have any emotions in their words, and sometimes they sounded like they were eating their words. They all seemed to have weird accents. Out of the four main characters, Rose&rsquo;s voice actor, Ayumi Tsuji, is probably the best. I loved her cute voice and it really brought out Rose&rsquo;s moe personality. Other notable names on the cast list are Rie Tanaka as Lula, Takehito Kowasu as Herve, and Daisuke Ono as Nick.Gonzo really did a good job in animating Red Garden. The colors were really great and vibrant. Normally, what I notice in most of the series I watch is that the colors are of the same hues. What I mean is it&rsquo;s usually all pastel, or all the colors have to be really loud. It wasn&rsquo;t like that in Red Garden &ndash; the color coordination had a nice contrast. The character designs didn&rsquo;t look like the usual designs you&rsquo;d find in anime. I&rsquo;d say it was American influenced, and I would say the same for the clothes that the characters wore. I would love to have Rachel or Claire&rsquo;s clothes in real life. Also, everything was detailed, which made good eye candy.I really loved the music. All the opening and ending themes were really catchy and contemporary. I don&rsquo;t have a favorite among the three, because I like them all equally. Background music was also good. What I had a problem with was the creepy random singing of the four girls. Thank God they only did that for the first few episodes.Another good thing to note about Red Garden is the mixture of different story telling elements that you will witness in watching the series. Of course there&rsquo;s some action, some drama, some horror, some mystery and even some comedy. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s interesting and definitely a must-see. first episode, Rachel seemed to have gained a new ability, but they didn&rsquo;t talk about that again until the second half.The whole plot wasn&rsquo;t confusing though.

An unusual combination in creating a show, however, it is one that manages to pay off. Red Garden manages to take each one of these genre's and mix them together for a highly original anime experience.Red Garden thrusts you right into a story about our four main female protagonist and their struggles with trying to adapt to there new lives and as recently deceased high school girls living on borrowed time. You might think this show would take a very straight forward action oriented path. Given the shows premise and the fact that the girls are ordered...to fight to stay alive, but this is far from the case. There is action, but it's not the main focus of the show in any way, shape, or form. Instead we follow our girls as they try to balance there new lives while solving the mystery around there death. The show, because of this has a very sophisticated feel to it.Red Garden is an anime about survival, but about mentally surviving. It's about trying to get your life back together when everything you have ever known is flipped upside down. You will follow these girls as they try to adapt to there new life, and because of it change, grow and in some cases become completely different people. Which is what makes this show so enjoyable, is watching these girls go through just a tremendous amount of growth. Each character learns more about themselves then they could every had previously hoped for. As they become acquainted with one another, as there view on the world opens up from there previous narrow view point, as they learn the truth about there lives and there future, all of it leads to some of the best character growth in anime television, ever.You will hate some characters in the beginning because of how the act and grow to love them as they change. Which, to the show's credit is something they handle very well. The writers of this show know how to make the viewer feel compassion and sympathy for each character. Rose, Claire, Kate, and Rachel all end up changing in some way, and it's damn powerful. How much these characters grow will just leave you speechless. You even end up feel sorry for Herve, while at the same time hating it. It's a show that isn't black and white, it's Grey, everything they deal with is Grey. The overarching plot does have some problems and unanswered questions, but at the end of the day they are forgivable. A series such a Red Garden is not about the mysteries surrounding these girls, rather it's the girls handling these mysteries and growing upon them.I hated the art style of Red Garden, and I still kind of don't like it, but it has grown on me. I definitely prefer the character models, and setting of Red Garden then most anime. The characters and backgrounds look incredibly realistic, but the character mannerisms always annoyed me, right up to the end. They are on the brink of being realistic, but at the same time not being quite there, leaving me in a somewhat confused state. It's pretty then 90% of the generic anime that comes out today, but it is still rough around the edges.I, for one, never really like the musical aspect that Red Garden tried to approach in the beginning of the series, which is why I was glad when they dropped it. I think trying to add a musical layer into a show is a good idea and has the potential to really add to a show, but I feel as if it hindered this series. It was like the creators of this show were going for some type of realism where each of the girls was just a horrible singer. Which, in real life they probably would, but it isn't real life, it's fiction. I don't really like listening to off-pitch singers, it annoys me, and it annoyed me hear. Maybe if they had gotten some voice actors that could also sing then it might have worked out, but sadly they didn't. Which, again I am glad they dropped it for the second half of the series(Somewhere around episode 9).It's a highly mature anime that will leave the viewer in a very sombre state as they pray for the safety for the main characters. You will become attached as each character grows as people, you will feel sympathy for those you once hated and hate those you once liked. It's a complex anime of mixed feelings and genre's. It's a slice of life show through and through, you will follow these girls on there daily life as they simply try to survive, as they adapt to there new lives while trying to cling to what they know as reality. So please enjoy as you embark on this very sophisticated journey. to fight to stay alive, but this is far from the case.

It is also been a while since I watched this anime, but I'll try to remember certain aspects of the anime worth mentioning.Story: It centers around four girls, who all go to Roosevelt Academy in New York and all four girls have very little common with each other except they were all friends with a girl called Lise, who is now dead. They also realise that they can't remember the day before, which was the day Lise died and also the...day they died. The series continues how they deal with this and other problems which arise from their new found undead-ness.What I liked about Red Garden in particular and I think which made it all the difference is that it was set in New York. The main cast was nearly all female, and there was something feminist about it, in my opinion, they weren't looking for a male to solve all their problems or save them or whatever else, they got on with it.But to be completely honest, I didn't really like the story, it was interesting up to a certain point, but after a while I just didn't care, especially since they rushed at the end with the last four episodes.Art: I loved the art! It suited the anime really well. It was unusual and not typically manga style, no big eyes, tiny nose or nose and it had a sort of American comic-ness about it, which I liked.  I also liked the change in outfits between episodes, since I like fashion and it was nice to look at, although at times questionable....The setting were drawn very well, giving it a feel that it was really taking place in New York. I was in New York once, four years ago for a couple of days and I felt, especially if the animators themselves have never been in New York.Sound: The opening and ending suited the anime unlike some others *cough*Satashi Kon*cough*. The music was nice, nothing all too memorable, but nice. The only thing that really irked me was the break out in song by the characters, I hope the seiyuus don't ever think about embarking in singing careers.Character: I stated beforehand how the story didn't really intrigue me, what made me want to watch this show is the character development. The girls were realistic, you felt that you may have known people like them back when you were in school ( or if you're still in school.) They didn't just agree with what was happening with them and each of them deal with their problems each in their personal way, nor was becoming friends an easy thing for them and they didn't already isolate their existing friends (when people get super powers they seem to like doing that). The other minor characters were also fleshed out, but not as much as they could be and could have been developed earlier in the show.Enjoyment: I enjoyed watching this anime, and like I said the character development  really made it for me and all the trials and tribulations I went through.Overall: All in all, a series with a drawing style I really liked and wonderful character style, but a story which I didn't find all that intriguing (this really is completely personal taste, the story was not weak just not of my taste.) I think you should give it a try, although people may say it's a shoujo anime, but I think the way they executed it make it accessible for both men and women. So give it a try, alone for the character development and in my opinion a lovely and different art style. day they died.

Being a fan of Seinen animes, I decided to rewatch the series. It's fairly underrated and obsure, but I had recalled that it was somewhat intriguing. Having  gone back to rewatch the series, I realised I did not remember anything of it. So this review is from a fresh mindset.This is the first I have ever written a review on anything, so I am not going to spoil the series or say anything negative about it.The series revolves around four high school girls. Normally, I don't like high school animes, but this...takes place in New York, rather Japan, so I found the setting and characters far more relatable. Also, much of the series take place outside of high school life and I found the characters to be mature adults, rather than reckless teenagers.The first half of the anime was well paced, though it is a little slow in the way of character development, the protagonists do grow on you. The anime does a good job of making you empathetic to the characters and wishing for them to resolve the mysteries surrounding them. This anime does a great job in creating an aura of mystery surrounding characters and plot. And does nearly as well in making the characters  somewhat unpredictable. This was different experience for myself and I thoroughly enjoyed the unpredictable nature of the characters and their progression.The second half of the anime is fairly different though. Much of story starts to come together and the mystery begins to fade as we begin to understand the whole story. Unfortunately, for myself, the mystery was the best part of the anime and what kept me watching. The later half became difficult to watch and I found emotionally enthralling and actually somewhat depressing. I could be the only person, but be that this anime touches on serious topics and can be fairly disturbing in how blunt it is.Overall, it's a unique anime. Far different the other anime I have seen. This is an anime, that I may rewatch in the future, but it was not without its difficulties. For myself, I found the later half far too depressing and consuming, but I believe others will come to enjoy this series. For myself, it has become one that I cannot forget.If you can find it, I highly recommend Red Garden, whether dubbed or subbed. takes place in New York, rather Japan, so I found the setting and characters far more relatable.

Part high school drama, part supernatural thriller and part musical, it deals with four very different young women who find themselves with superpowers, forced to work together to survive, thrown into a centuries old conflict and dead into the bargain! However for the majority of the time there isn't much action, Red Garden takes its time fleshing out the four girls, watching them attempt to adjust to their new predicament and at the same time solve their own private problems with their families/friends/love lives etc....Its slow paced for the most part and then kicks into high gear for the finale where all the underlying mystery element surrounding the whole ancient conflict aspect and Herve’s (the main antagonist) true motivations come out of the woodwork.But for the majority of the time its all character development and this, for me, is a very good thing. We get to know Kate, Rose, Rachel and Claire extremely well – we know what motivates them, see their backgrounds and watch them struggle to maintain the balance of their everyday lives and their nocturnal battles with the Awakened. The fact that the four are all from very different social circles and that they don't even like each other to start with is also very realistic given we're dealing with teenage girls.It's satisfying to get so much character development in a series, but the draw back to this is that the early episodes can seem fairly dull. The limited action scenes aren't overly impressive as the girls do not have instant control over their powers – much of their time is spent attempting to figure out how they do things, and the action is therefore chaotic, clumsy and repetitive. They do get their act together for the finale though and its much more impressive.I don't want to go too much into the technicalities of the plot because that spoils the mystery element of the show – but I will say that the conclusion isn't entirely satisfying to all as its very open ended (avoid the OVA Dead Girls BTW – its complete and utter rubbish). We don’t get a lot of answers to all the questions in the fallout of the final confrontation – everything is left very up in the air, but since this series has always concentrated on the experiences of the four main girls I didn't mind all that much. Kate, Rose, Rachel and Claire don't get all the answers they were seeking and neither do we – Red Garden is all about the characters drama rather than the ancient struggle they get embroiled in.ANIMATION: Another GONZO production and it is an absolutely gorgeous anime. The art-style is wonderful! Red Garden is set in New York city and the characters are drawn in a different style – slightly taller with more defined noses; a bit more realistic rather than the traditional stylistic anime style. Each episode is like a fashion parade – the girls wardrobes are varied and unique, reflecting their personalities backgrounds and the social circles they move in – very little is recycled. Each character is highly individual – no two look alike and you can tell that a lot of attention has been paid to detailing. As I mentioned the action scenes are few and far between, but there are two memorable and excellently choreographed action sequences that stand above the rest. The background animation is also something special – fabulously rendered depictions of actual NYC locations and lots of attention to detail – overall I think GONZO did quite a good job at giving Red Garden a very unique feel.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: I mentioned there was a ‘musical’ aspect to the show – it shows itself when the director decided it would be a good idea to have the girls break out into song at particularly emotional times…….I personally don't think this was a good idea.  The seiyuu are not professional singers by any stretch of the imagination and these spontaneous musical moments are just uncomfortable to listen to.  Thankfully they are very occasional. On the whole the music is very good though – quite liked the OP and the EDs in particular. The seiyuu are excellent (when they are not singing ) – the dialogue was recorded prior to the animation so the actors had more freedom with their interpretation of the script – it comes across very well and the four main characters have excellent chemistry.I personally really liked Red Garden – it has its flaws and may not be to everyone’s taste; but I love character based drama and this show has it in spades. The plot may not be completely solid, if it was paced a bit better Red Garden would have been a masterpiece – as it stands its still a very good series.

Admittedly, when I first started watching the series, the music, the art, the story, and the voices freaked me out a bit (I can't take horror one bit), but if I could get over it, so will you. The story develops slowly in the beginning but picks up pace somewhere around episode 12.For a good background on the story and brief episode summaries, check out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_GardenIf you do plan on watching this series (which I recommend you do!),...be prepared for several things:1. The Crying - this will not go away. Get used to it or skip ahead like I did. Especially Rose...omg...just thinking about it is grating on my nerves...2. The Bitchiness - Claire and Rachel have a bit of a mean streak in them. You'll grow to love them, but they have moments where they are so cruel to the boys that love them and other girls. But, as you'll see when you're watching the anime...they have a very good reason to act the way they do!3. Creepy Random Singing - So, I don't remember what episode it started in...maybe even episode 1...but I found myself confused when the anime turned into a musical...albeit a few minutes...but all the girls just started singing. Then in later episodes other people sing too! And the singing is downright creepy! But also kind of pretty. be prepared for several things:1. The Crying - this will not go away.

Then in later episodes other people sing too! And the singing is downright creepy! But also kind of pretty."", 'This anime was pretty different from what I expected based on its synopsis and in this case it wasn\'t in a good way. There actually isn\'t a whole lot of combat or mystery or drama. The anime is actually probably closer to a slice of life than anything else. The main characters, a group of four girls, die very early on in the anime and one would think this would be a pretty monumental, life-changing event but instead, upon the girl\'s ""revival"" if you will, almost nothing changes. They go to school, work their jobs, go on dates, worry about bills and do all the...normal things they were doing before as if they\'d never died. It is extremely difficult to believe and it makes their death seem almost inconsequential, which is just silly.Perhaps this was done intentionally, as it could be how Japanese animators perceive Americans, but I didn\'t care for the art style at all. I found the show outright ugly sometimes and the character models, in particular, left a lot to be desired. There were a couple of characters that looked as if they\'d undergone seriously botched plastic surgery.The show also lacked cohesion. Randomly in a few of the early episodes the girls would break out into song. The anime suddenly becomes a musical without warning. But then, just as abruptly and without warning as these things began they then stop and they never happen again. Why? What was the point? I have no idea why this decision was made, but it felt very random and out of place.The ending felt very rushed too. If you\'re going to just have an us versus them winner take all battle royale, why wait until the final episode? This could have happened at any time during the two side\'s longstanding, ongoing feud. It waited until the final episode to happen because the plot wanted it to, period.The one strength of the show is probably the character development, because we spend the large majority of the show following around the four girls as they live their day to day lives as if they hadn\'t died and we get to see their interpersonal relationships and individual life circumstances. That\'s fine, but it doesn\'t fit with the whole ""Oh by the way I\'m dead"" thing.It wasn\'t sleep-inducing, but it often felt slow and on the boring side. The entertainment value here isn\'t all that high.Overall I found this anime pretty disappointing. It wasn\'t awful, but it didn\'t do much for me. I\'d advise those of you on the fence about watching this to know what you\'re getting into. It\'s slow, it\'s character focused, it has underwhelming and infrequent action and it\'s about the girls and their personal lives first, everything else a distant second. I didn\'t dislike it enough to regret watching it once but I have zero interest in watching it again.OBJECTIVE RATING- 6PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 5.5-6 normal things they were doing before as if they\'d never died.

Its characterization, art, and music are phenomenal, so the main reason people may not like it is because the plot and lore aren’t well thought-out. And the singing isn’t very good.Red Garden works by juxtaposing supernatural horror elements and life or death stakes alongside the realistic everyday struggles of four girls, who have to go to school by day and fight zombies by night. Normally, I am highly adverse to high school slice of life melodrama, but in this case the infusion of the outlandish elements enhances the dramatic...aspects.Even by itself, though, the drama is well written, propped up by three-dimensional, sympathetic, and realistic characters in a grounded New York City setting. We follow Kate, Claire, Rachel, and Rose as they struggle with issues like negligent fathers, financial troubles, academic duties, and social pressure--- all staple tropes of slice of life/drama stories. The girls themselves also follow well-worn character archetypes--- Claire is a tomboy, Rachel is a vain popular girl, Rose is spineless, and Lisa is reserved. This could easily have fallen into a pile of trash like all the other teen melodramas, but the tender care with which the girls’ struggles are rendered makes their stories incredibly endearing.One way Red Garden accomplishes this is making some of the most visceral fight scenes I’ve seen in animation. The fight scenes are notable not because of any well choreographed action, but precisely because they capture the messiness, desperation, and paralyzing fear of having to fight for your life against a monstrous creature. The girls’ individual reactions in these fights are realistically understood by the writers and poignantly conveyed by the animators. The fight scenes not only succeed in immediately grounding us in the world and making us feel for the characters, but also in precisely conveying the personalities of each of the four girls.What’s really interesting to me, is how those personalities then play out in regular everyday life as the girls face more mundane yet equally compelling problems. During the first fight scene, we all root for Claire because she’s the bravest and strongest of the four--- the only one not reduced to a whimpering mess frozen in fear before the zombie. Rose is easily the most unlikable in the fight scenes because she’s so scared she can’t even hit a zombie that the others are holding down for her. Yet, later we see how Claire’s bravery under duress is also the same quality that makes her confrontational, irritable, and stubborn with those around her, which causes problems with her boyfriend, employer, and family. Conversely, Rose enjoys the best relationship with her family and is an excellent caregiver to her elementary school age siblings in place of her hospitalized mom.If Claire and Rose are the two extremes, then Kate is the middle, the glue that keeps the group stable. She functions as a reprieve from the more turbulent storylines of the other three. As such, she is the least dynamic of the group, but just because her reactions to her struggles are more subdued doesn’t make her arc any less interesting to watch.Lastly, Rachel starts out as the typical peacocky popular girl plucked from her clique. Her initial conversations with her friends expectedly sound like, “Totally… Oh my god did you hear what Ashley said to Josh at the party? I am SO jealous of those nails…”--- typical airheaded high school girl talk. Her storyline has a Gossip Girl feel to it, which would normally make me turn the channel, but I got the sense that Red Garden was self-aware of how superficial Rachel’s life was.Rachel’s arc exemplifies the role of the supernatural elements in this story. Because if you wanted to tell a story about the mundane struggles of four high school girls, why not just make it any other high school slice of life? Why not make something like the Breakfast Club, where these teens come together from opposite ends?The supernatural elements are important for presenting life-or-death stakes into the otherwise ordinary lives of four students. This tackles the primary reason why I avoid all high school dramas and dramas in general--- I usually don’t care about the problems faced by the characters. The high school experience is just overdramatized and overemphasized to no end. They play up those happy endings where the student supposedly achieves self-actualization after smoothing over his relationships and/or accomplishing some club achievement like it’s a happily ever after, complete with falling cherry blossoms and all. On one level it might be because I don’t find any of that shit important at all, not the social life, not the clubs, and not the achievements. But the root of the matter is that the way it’s portrayed is idealized, commercialized, and plasticky. It’s looking at life through a TV, like conceptualizing romance through rom-coms (yes, all media is looking at life through a screen, technically, but the best art is supposed to force us to look at life).Though I think Red Garden’s drama avoids doing this, it is the life-or-death stakes that knock down this entire issue. The life-or-death stakes force the girls to seriously contemplate what they really value in their lives and what they actually live for. There’s actually little on-screen fighting in the show, but the raw, non-glamorized way the fight scenes are presented are more than enough to instill a grim undercurrent throughout the story. Back to Rachel:SPOILERS Rachel’s experiences with the zombies distances her from the superficial lives of her clique and she finds better conversation with one of her teachers instead. She begins taking an actual interest in learning things. ENDSPOILERSIt’s certainly not a new arc--- every ordinary school girl who becomes an action girl can be said to experience a similar thing. However, in this context, where the focus on how the action impacts the personal life of the character rather than the action and save-the-world plot itself, it’s a welcome piece of character growth that deconstructs popular drama tropes. At the same time, rather than take the focus away from the mundane slice of life stuff, the life-or-death stakes only reinforce their emotional weight. By forcing the girls to find what they really value in their lives and having them fight for it, it increases the viewers’ investment in their struggles.Applying this to real life, personally I would’ve lived life differently if I had been forced with the same situation. Being locked in on doing well academically, I would’ve had to reconsider what was really important to me and what I really lived for. I know because I did. Physical problems forced me to ask these questions just like they did with the characters of Red Garden.At the same time, it’s more than a simple “How would you live your life if you only have a month to live” situation. It’s also about the struggle of living itself, of living with pain, of living in spite of impending doom.The struggles alone would not have been engaging if the characters didn’t have the personality to support them, but the aesthetic elements greatly contributed as well. Despite everything I said about the writing, I don’t think I would’ve given half my praise for the show if it had been drawn in the typical nauseating style of most high school anime. Red Garden's lines are drawn with such tenderness and delicacy, bringing out the sensitive, vulnerable human core from the characters.This feeling is captured by the heart-wrenching yet lovely music (excluding the ED, a rap song which clashes sharply with the tone of the series). Yes, that includes the singing. The voice actresses in both dubs were unable to hit their notes, but the intended melodies of the songs were good. You can look up one of the songs as sung by an actual singer--- Kokia - Shiro ~ Watashi Tachi no Hibiki--- and tell me if that isn’t deeply resonant with dire moments in life when you’re struggling to keep your head above the waters of sadness.So it’s not only the hectic, horrifying fight scenes, but also the moments of calm where the girls pour out their sentiments in song and face their individual struggles in solidarity, that provide such an immersive experience. Though some may find the singing out of place, but I think it fits both the sophisticated, curvey aesthetic and the emotional current. If only the singing was better.The setting of New York City itself and the colorful way it’s drawn is appealing, a breath of fresh air from all the Tokyo streets. As a native I’m quite pleased with how well they captured some aspects of the city, down to the interior of the subways.I think I’ve said enough positive things about the show. It is only rated 7.12 after all. The biggest issue is that the backstory behind the whole killing zombies thing was not well thought out or well presented, as it takes a backseat to the character drama. Combined with the ending, there are several things that don’t make sense if you think about it for more than a second. Furthermore, viewers expecting this to be a supernatural action show will be disappointed, as most of it is following how the girls cope with the aftermath of their fights rather than the fights themselves. Some may find this boring, and it can be argued that Red Garden just invokes daddy issues x2 and boyfriend issues x3 for the girls’ stories. In addition, there were some instances where Red Garden walked the line between being realistically dramatic and soap opera melodramatic.All in all, if you can focus on Red Garden’s strengths in character over its weaknesses in plot, and the singing and art style appeal to you, you’re in for a good experience. aspects.Even by itself, though, the drama is well written, propped up by three-dimensional, sympathetic, and realistic characters in a grounded New York City setting.

Retaining a consistent bittersweet mood throughout its 22 episode run, Red Garden explores four American high school girls coping with the shocking fact that they are now dead and forced to fight against humans who become monsters. The show explores the psychological states of the girls as they adjust to this new experience and find themselves having difficulty mixing their everyday routines with their not-so-normal predicaments. The series does enough to flesh-out the different lifestyles and upbringings of the four girls so you get...enough sense of how the girls learn to cope with their undead status while dealing with personal issues and strain in the relationships they had while still alive. This depth also extends to some of the antagonists confronted by the girls in the series who are fleshed out enough to be tragic villains due to their personal desires and the closeness one of them has with one of the girl's families.In terms of plot development, the supernatural element to the series is slowly explored as focus is also put on the everyday activity of the girls. The girls come to learn that whomever brought them back from the dead is in a rivalry with another faction and learn of some shocking and tragic developments concerning those connected to the conflict, especially as some of it concerns their own fates. This flows along well with Red Garden's bittersweet mood and adds some suspense to keep one hooked on what will be unveiled next with both factions in the series.However, the show would have been better off running for several more episodes as it lacks the time to fully flesh out its supernatural elements and the final few episodes got fairly rushed in resolving the rivalry. Much of Red Garden's pacing was fairly smooth as it took its time with building up events and exploring its major characters. But once the later episodes rolled along, the series quickly gets things heated with the mentioned factions without much background provided as to how things escalated between them and knowing more of their personal histories. As a result, I could care less about whatever happened among the characters of both factions (particularly Lula and JC) because of Red Garden being largely focused on the tragic situation facing the four high school girls and main baddie Herve. Also, I couldn't really understand what drew all four girls to their so-called close friend Lise considering all four belonged to different social cliques and the series doesn't bother focusing on how each one interacted with her. Not to mention the occasions where the girls sung felt like a waste of time to even have as the moments didn't seem to symbolize anything within the series.The presentation of Red Garden is a mixed bag. Settings of the various New York City locales were vast and highly detailed being quite a sight to see. Character designs are a bit unconventionally drawn as facial designs are seemingly simple yet clothing designs have a good amount of detail applied to them. Animation is clearly Red Garden's weakest area as action sequences tend to get a bit sloppy and I could spot some apparent shortcuts. As for the show's soundtrack, Red Garden makes use of some dramatic musical pieces for insert music that flow well with the show's mood. However, the show's upbeat and energetic OP and ED musical choices, while unique, feel out of place with the serious and tragic developments of the series.While Red Garden does have some glaring flaws, it is still an effective character drama focused around four girls finding themselves forced into a supernatural conflict of the unknown as they slowly come together as close friends and struggling to retain whatever normalcy they had in their lives while still alive. It's not a perfect series, but it is definitely worth watching if you crave supernatural and/or character-driven dramas. enough sense of how the girls learn to cope with their undead status while dealing with personal issues and strain in the relationships they had while still alive.

', 'THIS IS A HIDDEN GEM! READ THIS REVIEW SO YOU DON\'T MISS OUT ON WORK OF ART!Summary: From the first episode I knew this series was something special (in the 1st episode each of the 4 girls sing part of a sad and heartfelt song, reminding me a bit of a musical). The initial look and feel comes out of a 1970\'s cartoon... these girls could fit in perfectly with Scooby Doo and the gang. That being said, the art was refreshing. Dark where it needed to be, bright in other instances. I really enjoyed the unique perspective. The music also enhanced the mood. One...thing to note is the intro song and outro song are so uncharacteristic of the anime, it just added to the perfection.The story is dark, no doubt about it. It has death, murder, violence and ""monsters"". That said, unless you are strongly against that, I suggest watching it. Despite being dark, it is touching and heartwarming that each character is given deep development (most of which amount to understand the meaning of life only after death and what each girl really treasures and what friendship really means). Each of the girls comes from an extremely different background and coming together to relate to each other is something really special. Since the only common link between them is a friendship with the dead girl Lise, they have little to tie them together and thus there is internal turmoil that adds to the plot. There are twists and turns, and you are given glimpses of an overall dark plot slowly enough so that you want to keep pushing forward. Really, what is funny is the murder, mystery and sci-fi fighting elements of this anime are just drops in the bucket of what this anime really is: a deep and thoughtful character study.The one fault with the anime is that there are several plot points that aren\'t really explained. A lot of the super natural elements are glossed over and the ending is ambiguous. That said, I didn\'t care at all. Unlike tons of other anime where that was a glaring problem, I didn\'t notice or care at all because I was too busy engulfed in the characters. In fact, normally I would complain and say that background information that comes at the price of character development and a strong conclusion isn\'t worth it; this is a prime example.In summary, this is a murder/mystery anime that is extremely unique and thought provoking. It will put you on an emotional roller coaster that will leave you feeling satisfied and questioning what is important in your own life. This is a MUST SEE for anyone who doesn\'t have strong objections of some violence and gore.Story 10 / Art 8 / Sound 9 / Character 10 / Enjoyment 9 / Overall 10 thing to note is the intro song and outro song are so uncharacteristic of the anime, it just added to the perfection.The story is dark, no doubt about it.

Its a shame. This show is a very good one. While some people might be thrown off because of the art the story completly makes up for it. You are thrown into their world where as the four main characters, you have no idea what is going on or why its happening to the girls who seems perfectly normal and dont not share anything simlilar nor are they in the same social pool, but yet they are all drawn together by something dark and by a friend that each of the girls knew that...mysteriously dies...As the story progesses so does the bonds these girls make together and so does the mysteries of their friends death that leads to everything bizzare happening to them.Dont pass this show up! Its a good one! mysteriously dies...As the story progesses so does the bonds these girls make together and so does the mysteries of their friends death that leads to everything bizzare happening to them.Dont pass this show up! Its a good one!', 'Well, I\'m a fan of Seinen type anime, and this one looked great, only for the first half of the series. What I found very weak was the character development. The series delves into progression of the lead female characters and how being dead changes their perspective and how they mature. But then it stops, and you see the vice-versa in the Hervey Character. In the end- it doesn\'t matter which side wins or loses, and the 4 girls knew that, regardless, they had no problem eliminating the other faction. In the end, the most suffered person was Hervey, watching all people he cared for...turning into monster. So instead of giving him a victim persona, Kate was victimized and Hervey was demonized! After watching this show for 22 episodes, you don\'t see any ""real"" character development, and only side drama stuff! turning into monster. So instead of giving him a victim persona, Kate was victimized and Hervey was demonized! After watching this show for 22 episodes, you don\'t see any ""real"" character development, and only side drama stuff!', 'Red Garden starts off with an intriguing premise that screams mystery. Yet while its initial setup is what draws viewers in, the general plot doesn’t carry on at a particularly fast pace. It takes some time for the main four girls of the series to figure out their situation entirely, along with what they must do and the consequences of the burdens they bear. While some people may consider the anime too much of a slow burn, important character moments are interspersed among the main story; and honestly it’s the characters that are the big focus here.Each member of the main cast, which consists of...Kate, Claire, Rachel, and Rose, gets a great amount of time in the spotlight throughout the show’s runtime. Much emphasis is put on their personal struggles alongside their coming to grips with their roles in the story. Moments of denials, rejections, and acceptances are present within each of their narratives, and each girl has a series of character arcs which they progress through at a steady rate. You could consider this to be like a mini ensemble cast in regard to the main characters. However even the side characters get some time in the limelight as well, whether it be a solo focus or supporting the main girls as a group or individually.The character writing itself is also something to be admired. In addition to dealing with their ongoing situation, the main four also face the obstacles present in their daily lives in ways that are very grounded and relatable. For just one example of how the character writing is handled, there’s one scene where two characters get into a big argument over family matters. They repeatedly talk over each other as things escalate, which is something you would often see in a heated argument in real life, but not so much in the average anime. It made me curious about who was in charge of the writing, and I found it was none other than the famed Mari Okada, who has done scriptwriting work for series such as AnoHana, Toradora, and Nagi no Asukara, among others; now it’s not so surprising to me as to why the characters of Red Garden are so good.Before I digress too much, I just wanted to reinforce the point that none of the characters feel flat, and because of this each character moment was gripping; this made me really care about each scene whether it directly pushed the plot forward or not. Going back to the main plot, it isn’t anything truly amazing, but put simply it works. At first I was hoping certain plot points would be more fleshed out, or others made more apparently clear, but later I realized this story especially was more of a vehicle to drive the characters forward. The way that the story pushes the characters to deal with their problems and progress their arcs was done so in a suitable way. If the overarching story beats had been a much bigger focus here, it may have taken away from the development of the characters in other areas. So for those reasons I can’t fault the story itself.Now as for the soundtrack, it may be a bit of a mixed bag depending on who you ask. I feel that the opening is great and matches the series perfectly. The theme is very jazzy and lyrics encapsulate the tone of the show. Endings-wise, the songs performed by visual kei band LM.C are a bit harder to consider fit for the show. But I personally enjoy these songs and they do (lyrically) match the themes of the show to an extent. The rest of the music I would say fits the show appropriately, and the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about it is “classy”. One point I didn’t mention earlier is that the characters occasionally break out into song at certain points in the anime. Some may consider this jarring and breaking the pace of the story, but I personally didn’t mind it. At any rate these “singalongs” are mostly in the beginning episodes and not a constant presence. Another thing in particular I really liked is the intermissions at the halfway point of each episode, complete with the classy tunes and nice intermission frames featuring artwork similar to that found in the opening.Speaking of art, the art style of Red Garden is quite unique among anime. The character designs in particular are far more grounded in realism compared to the standard anime look. This made each character unique and their appearance memorable. Overall it may take some getting used to but I found the character designs very pleasant to look at. Admittedly the art itself can look a bit muddied especially in far off shots, so not everything is perfect. But as this is a Studio Gonzo anime I can forgive this, since they’re not exactly known for peak production values. I can say similar about the animation, which I feel is fine even when it comes to the action scenes; it is acceptable in that it doesn’t affect enjoyment or the quality of the other elements.With all that said I greatly enjoyed Red Garden and found it engaging all the way through. It isn’t among the most technically impressive in the anime medium, and it may not win any awards for story (although it isn’t a bad one). However, the characters and their writing in general is phenomenal. Along with this the style, tone, and overall feel of the show is unlike anything else I’ve seen in anime. With this in mind I’d give Red Garden a 9/10 for being so different yet also succeeding incredibly in its strengths.On one last note: the Red Garden: Dead Girls OVA is a bit of a curveball. You may love it or hate it depending on how you perceive the series proper. I personally really liked its concept and approach!

I personally really liked its concept and approach!', 'I rewatched this anime recently when it was added to Crunchyroll and remembered having the same thoughts when I first saw it a decade ago. It’s like... a zombie musical?STORY: Such a mish-mash of themes, like the writers and producers couldn’t decide what feel they wanted it to have. There’s typical high school drama while the characters try to deal with being undead, as well as the permanent death of a friend, and they’re all from different high school cliques. Interesting enough, I guess. When you watch it, don’t forget the epilogue OVA. It changes the character personalities completely (reminded me of Mnemosyne).CHARACTERS:...This is one of the only anime that I feel is a good representation of American characters. They’re all very different, none of them over the top “Hullo, I am from Texas and am super rude, tall, busty, and love basuball!”ANIMATION: Well. There were good intentions had, I’m sure. The character design is great, if not exaggerated. Do all Americans really look like this to non-Americans? Besides that, at least there is variety in the character design. But beyond that, it’s one of those anime that has coloring issues. The sky is a big, flat, neon blue with zero dimension (think Ouran Host Club). There’s a weird gradient over most things, including our characters’ hair, like the sun is just so damn bright that it is fading them from the top down.SOUND: Like I said: zombie musical. Sad? Sing a song. Dead? Sing a song. Really confused about this plot? Hey, let’s sing a song. Other than that, the characters’ voices can be grating, especially when they freak out (which is often).

The concept of life after death is something that people really think about. I LOVED that all the main characters were girls. Nonetheless their are certain flaws that I noticed. Questions like why did these girls die in the first place? This question was never answered in the first place. Also certain times I felt like the story was being dragged out and slowly became bored with it.Art- The art was modern with a pinch of...vintage. It was nice how the illustrators blended these colors together.Sound- The sound was also modern.Character- There was some character developments within the story. As viewers we noticed certain personality traits within each main that any person could relate to. I believe that each character really compliments the other with the certain aspect of their personality. Nonetheless, I did not become attached to any particular character.Enjoyment- Overall I really did enjoy this anime. Some moments were filled with laughter and others with despair and drama.  There were concepts of romance, drama, comedy, gore, horror and thriller in this anime. I liked how no one concept over shadowed the rest. vintage.

There were concepts of romance, drama, comedy, gore, horror and thriller in this anime. I liked how no one concept over shadowed the rest.', ""Even tho this review is very late, I'll just give out my thoughts anyway. MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.~Story:This is kinda tricky. At first I thought the anime was gonna tell it's story and let you observe and think, but around the end it ends up explaining certain topics of what the heck is going on. Which would make the story feel incomplete because there are so many questions unanswered and some stuff not explored enough. Though, the story itself and how it's presented is very interesting, but not much is explored which made me feel kinda empty and unsatisified around the end.~Art:I really love...the art style in Red Garden. The use of colors and gradient is very pleasing and the art itself gives a mature feel. I love how defined or detailed the features of some of the character's face is. Such as different nose shape.Sound:Just like the art, I loved the soundtrack in this anime. It matches the tone of the anime well enough. The opening is so nice to listen to along with the visuals. The endings I enjoyed a bit, but felt a bit out of place for the anime, in my opinion.~Character:The characters are a mixed bunch for me, both side and main, but I will discuss the main characters first: Kate, Rachel, Claire, and Rose. If I had to rate them it would go Rose->Claire->Kate->Rachel. The reason why Rose is top for me, despite being not very useful in battle and shown crying most of the time, is because I enjoyed her development and Rose herself. She is shown to be timid and shy. But other times she has shown to be hardworking, determined, puts her family first, and does get angry at times. Like I mentioned, most episodes Rose cowers in fear, but she does get called out for it (tho a little late) and she does try to improve herself after that. I did wish the anime showed more of her fighting in confidence because the only time we see her kicking some ass is around the very few episodes. Which is such a letdown. Rose being very family oriented is very nice to see, I found it admirable to see her look for her father despite him leaving the family.Now Claire is second because there are times where she is a jerk towards her guy freind, Yuane, when he's shown to try to be there for her most of the time. But she does show to be regretful of her actions and does try to make it up for him at least. The moments of Claire and her boss and family was so nice to see. Especially that small argument between her and her dad. Which makes it a bit satisfying and sad to see her finally reconnect with them again. Though, not much is explained about her dead mother. But her character development is one of the better ones. Kate is not the most interesting one tbh, but she's not a bad protagonist. I just can't think of anything that makes her stand out to me. The scenes of her and Herve does show a different side to Kate which I liked to see more of because she does not interact with other characters like the other three girls do. Despite there being some kind of history between her and Paula, another Grace member, yet they don't hang out much. Like seriously Paula is shown to be either this big sister figure or in love with Kate.Rachel is fourth because of how much she frustrated me lol. Though, I do not hate her, I did like her at first. What made her last is because of her unfair treatment towards Luke, her bf then ex. The scenes between her and Luke was just hard to watch. Every time Luke wants to do something with her, she just seems so unwilling and somehow can't think of an excuse which makes her look even more suspicious. Even on a date they went to she doesn't seem like she's his girlfriend. Yet she's shown to hang out with the teacher for some reason, who is married thank GOD the anime didn't go the love triangle route, which gives Luke misunderstandings. And rightfully so cause she seems like she doesn't want to clear anything and just leave him in the dust. To the point I'm glad they broke up. YET Rachel is shown to have feelings for Luke which makes everything so confusing because of her actions. Funny how she explains what she'll be doing to a guy friend we barely see, but not Luke :/The side characters will be short because the anime does not give much time for them lmao. There is a lot of side characters yet not a lot stick out to me cause some are either pointless (The Cops and Nick the teacher) or don't get proper development. The most interesting one would have to be Herve. Just like Rose, he's family oriented and would do anything for his family even though he ended up failing at the end. Lise was the least interesting one despite being an important one in the anime lol. We just don't get much out of her except she was well loved but I never cared about her because we don't get much.~Enjoyment:My enjoyment was mixed. Some episodes I really enjoyed, but most episodes were so slow and not the good kind because it's not like they were showing much. Which made watching some epiosdes feel like a chore because not much is happening even though the anime could've explored something else that isn't the main plot. Such as Kate and Paula, Lise herself, Rachel's mom, the other girls involved, and so on.~Overall:I would recommend this anime. But more like if you're looking for something different to watch and got nothing. The action is decent, the main characters aren't bad, the soundtrack is great, and the art is so nice to look at. The story is interesting but might make you feel empty after finishing if you wanted answers on certain things. Since the anime ends up explaining some of the plot at the end anyway. Red Garden would have been a 9 or 10 for me if most of the epiosdes didn't feel so slow or used better time such as showing character development. But I rated it a 7, thanks to the art and soundtrack, without those it would be a 5. the art style in Red Garden.

Maybe this is just a way for me to process my own thoughts on what I've been watching last weekend, or maybe I would simply like to tell you about one of the more extraordinary shows I've seen in a long time.Let's talk about the art style first. Red Garden is set in New York, and it clearly tries to show this by adjusting its art style to match a more western vibe. It really is a hit or miss; you will either appreciate the art style...or hate it. Personally, I loved how unique it felt. Direction is excellent, and it continually sets up scenes in unusual ways that manage to add to the atmosphere of the show.Music is another theme where the creators clearly dared to make interesting choices. The intro of the show feels strangely out of place for the choice of song, yet it does much to make clear that we're not in Kansas(Tokyo) anymore. Throughout the anime, there are even clear references to Broadway culture as some of the characters occasionally break out in song.Speaking of characters, this is where Red Garden truly shines. The main characters of the show were richly developed, all with their own unique arcs and real-life problems that needed solving. The manner in which they did so (or did not manage to do so) were realistic and engaging. By the end of the show, I genuinely cared about some of the characters while loathing others.In the end, Red Garden is booked as a horror show. Its overarching plot was the only weak point of the show, and it sometimes felt like an actual distraction from the real-life problems the characters were facing. Development of the plot is slow and sometimes confusing, and in the end the creators try to force information on you that should have been shared much sooner. This unfortunate experience keeps me from rating the show a perfect 10.With a bitter-sweet ending, characters to love, and daring art choices however, I wound up greatly appreciating Red Garden. I would recommend it to anybody who doesn't mind a slow-burning story, enjoys strong character development, and is intrigued by the darker side of our humanity. or hate it.

It might not be the best in terms of having a 'solid' plot, but it has everything else you'd want in a supernatural horror show in spades: distinctive artstyle, intelligent characterization, and enjoyable soundwork.[Story - 7]The initial premise /is/ a bit generic admittedly - four teenage girls are forcibly recruited into a supernatural war against their will, and have to train themselves to be the best they can be. However, with the various plot twists and character analyses done throughout the show, it's clear...that this isn't another Girl Powah anime. With an emphasis on examining the psychological states of (almost) all involved parties, and showcasing each of the girls' personal stories, it's clear that this show merely uses the 'war' as an excuse to see how people like these girls would cope with this situation. Other themes explored include what defines friendships, the impact of death upon others, and so on.However, the reason this isn't a 9 or 10 is because of its third act. It starts out fine enough, but the final episode is a minefield of confusion. We're left on a REALLY huge cliffhanger, with many questions left unsolved (some arising from these final scenes). I guess this is supposed to be part of the 'horror/mystery' aspect of the show, but it's really frustrating to me.[Art - 8]The show's artstyle is probably the reason this show captured my eye. While it can be a bit rough on the eyes when it comes to super-intense action scenes, it stands out really well amongst the stereotypical animes of the season. It's definitely influenced by western animations (because it's set in NYC, LOL), with a lot of more grounded character designs and backgrounds. It has a very 'moody' and cold feeling to it, even during some of the more heartwarming scenes. I honestly adore the fashion used in the show; it's a bit timeless (ha!), but it is most certainly from the time period of the mid 2000's.[Sound - 7]The soundwork is alright for the most part. The SFX are serviceable, and the OST is pretty suitable for a show this dark (if a bit generic). I LOVE the OP and the second ED, as they both contrast and complement the show's content, but I'm not a huge fan of the first ED.....it feels a bit /too/ edgy.The voice acting is where this show shines in this aspect though! God, the voice acting is really......human. It never really feels forced, and the way each seiyuu delivers their lines feels really believable. This is what voice acting should be.[Character - 8]While the artwork is what drew me in, the characters are what made me stay with this show. God, I just.......love the writing for them so much.I'll start with the negatives because that way it can better balance out my positives: There are a few characters who deserved more of the spotlight. Namely, the antagonist's relatives, some of the girls' friends, the Token Cops, etc. etc. I also wish there were more visible people of colour (I guess Claire qualifies but it's too vague for it to count in my books). That's it, really.However, the way our 4 protagonists are explored is just......so beautiful and tragic. They all come from 4 separate walks of life, yet they form such a realistic dynamic with each other despite the paranormal situation. I can't really pick a favourite honestly, they're all just SO intriguing. Seeing how Rachel struggled to maintain her image of Calm, Collected, Popular while slowly slipping through the cracks is just too relatable; Claire's antagonistic relationship with her father (or life in general) compliments this beautifully. However, Kate's struggle with living up to societal expectations of perfection while being told how boring she is really struck me, along with Rose having to struggle as a stand-in parent while vying for her own life.Our antagonists and supporting cast are decently fleshed out as well: Hervé is a rather relatable man, with his disarming personality accompanying rather noble goals. His methods are unsavoury, of course, but I really do feel for him. Lula and JC may seem to be just exposition machines at first, but they soon start to show their personalities, along with their own pain.[Enjoyment/Overall - 8]This was a fun ride! Although I do have /some/ issues with its execution, it's definitely one of the more memorable animes I've watched recently. I would recommend this to anyone really! Whether they be a complete noob or a seasoned veteran, you're sure to find something enjoyable about this show :) that this isn't another Girl Powah anime. With an emphasis on examining the psychological states of (almost) all involved parties, and showcasing each of the girls' personal stories, it's clear that this show merely uses the 'war' as an excuse to see how people like these girls would cope with this situation. Other themes explored include what defines friendships, the impact of death upon others, and so on.However, the reason this isn't a 9 or 10 is because of its third act. It starts out fine enough, but the final episode is a minefield of confusion. We're left on a REALLY huge cliffhanger, with many questions left unsolved (some arising from these final scenes). I guess this is supposed to be part of the 'horror/mystery' aspect of the show, but it's really frustrating to me.[Art - 8]The show's artstyle is probably the reason this show captured my eye. While it can be a bit rough on the eyes when it comes to super-intense action scenes, it stands out really well amongst the stereotypical animes of the season. It's definitely influenced by western animations (because it's set in NYC, LOL), with a lot of more grounded character designs and backgrounds. It has a very 'moody' and cold feeling to it, even during some of the more heartwarming scenes. I honestly adore the fashion used in the show; it's a bit timeless (ha!), but it is most certainly from the time period of the mid 2000's.[Sound - 7]The soundwork is alright for the most part. The SFX are serviceable, and the OST is pretty suitable for a show this dark (if a bit generic). I LOVE the OP and the second ED, as they both contrast and complement the show's content, but I'm not a huge fan of the first ED.....it feels a bit /too/ edgy.The voice acting is where this show shines in this aspect though! God, the voice acting is really......human. It never really feels forced, and the way each seiyuu delivers their lines feels really believable. This is what voice acting should be.[Character - 8]While the artwork is what drew me in, the characters are what made me stay with this show. God, I just.......love the writing for them so much.I'll start with the negatives because that way it can better balance out my positives: There are a few characters who deserved more of the spotlight. Namely, the antagonist's relatives, some of the girls' friends, the Token Cops, etc. etc. I also wish there were more visible people of colour (I guess Claire qualifies but it's too vague for it to count in my books). That's it, really.However, the way our 4 protagonists are explored is just......so beautiful and tragic. They all come from 4 separate walks of life, yet they form such a realistic dynamic with each other despite the paranormal situation. I can't really pick a favourite honestly, they're all just SO intriguing.

It does a good job of drawing four distinct and interesting main characters together in an intriguing and suspenseful supernatural mystery, wrapped in an atmosphere of melancholic melodrama.Around its midpoint, though, it becomes too mild and drawn-out in its attempt to show the evolution of relationships as a result of violence. Nothing unexpected happens. Frowning friends fret over the girls being ""Not the same,"" a boyfriend is tearfully dumped for his own good, fathers are...forgiven. And, for all this show\'s concentration on dialogue and emotion, it really only ever explores one or two conflicts per each character. Claire is tired, apathetic and angry at her father. Rose is meek and self-sacrificing for her family. Rachel is brash and selfish. Hervé is driven by his overattachment to his little sister in traditional, quasi-incestuous anime fashion. There are too many scenes establishing and re-establishing these dynamics, not enough that actually challenge or explore them. What relationship or personality developments there are don\'t really need supernatural, life-and-death battle as a catalyst, making the interpersonal elements of the show seem incongruous with the Dolore-fighting.While the show spends all this time focused on interpersonal relationships, it misses big opportunities to explore its more interesting supernatural elements, like the two warring groups, the Dolore and the Animus—90% of their scenes consist of groups standing around talking in hospital rooms and the headmistress\' office. It\'s too bad this show couldn\'t ties its elements together more cohesively. forgiven.

These take something special to send the undead back to the grave basicallyThis one could have been a lot better, A LOT better.  Most of it is the leading teenage girls coming to terms with the fights with monsters they have to fight for reasons not revealed until nearly the end of the show.  I’m fine with the delay in answers. But the leads are such basket cases for sooo long it goes beyond my tolerance.  The fights eventually get pretty...cool. That why I say this show is worth online viewing…Theme Songs 8/10This series has some interesting kind of catchy music. I never skipped.Ending 8/10NO spoilers, the end was pretty solid.

Reikenzan: Hoshikuzu-tachi no Utage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32094/Reikenzan__Hoshikuzu-tachi_no_Utage,"['Hey folks, this will be a review for Reikenzan: Hoshikuzu-tachi no Utage. I\'m really surprised to see many people scoring this so highly. It wasn\'t terrible but it definitely wasn\'t anything impressive by any means.The story revolves around our male mc Ouriku, and his journey to becoming a sage. The beginning of the story flows rather nicely, showing the characters and placing them in the trials that would determine whether or not they gain entry into this clan, which seems to be the best clan to be in. However after the first few episodes of being able to follow the story we are given massive...time skips(years of time). Most of the middle and end of this anime is Ouriku hearing about a new word or power then saying ""I want to learn that"", then time skip, or simple quick 1 day montage until he gains the power and tells us some fuzzy description of what he felt and what he can do. It was honestly hard to follow.The art felt a bit dated, which shouldn\'t be the case as this just finished airing. The art isn\'t terrible by any means but its just ok. Soundtrack didn\'t jump out at me either.The characters had some interesting elements but nothing gets explored. We have some character development early which builds up into nothing. Our only developing character is Ouriku who again is flat as a board personality wise. Sometimes serious, sometimes comedic/arrogant, but all around bland. The character I was most interested in was Rei the inn owner, however she seems to be a convenient master of things to teach Ouriku occasionally and gets little time for progress.I didn\'t hate this anime, but I didn\'t like it either. This really felt like a time waste as nothing really happens the entire time, I didn\'t care at all about the characters, and the comedy was mostly Ouriku\'s arrogance in one or two episodes. If there was more back lore, or if your someone who can follow all of those crazy names, symbols and martial arts then you may enjoy it more than me. I however felt it was a confusing waste of time.TLDR: Nothing happens, no personality characters, small and lame comedic elements, and hard to follow dialogue and martial art skills.

Originally this is an anime that was a collaboration between japan and china, making the Japanese voice over harder to understand because of all the chinese idioms.This review is more of a comparison than a review of how good it was. This is because it really does depend on whether or not you can understand or relate to chinese culture.Story:This anime will be very different for those who love anime. The plot pace will be different and more chinese paced where the whole...back story is presented before the main problem of the story appears. To make it more simple the story is about the efforts and life of a character who is growing up as they face many different life choices (like a saga or biography), instead of the (mostly seen) japanese action battles packed episodes that make a character grow as they continue to peruse the problem of the story.-The comedy will also be different and so will the behaviors of the characters.- The plot will span over many years (so # year later will show up a lot)-There is more scheming and mental process within this anime-And characters will be overbearingly powerful (aka too perfect)Also this anime, whether they deiced to make another season or not, will depict the main character training to become stronger. So their will be no awesome plot problem until the very end of the last episode.Why you should watch:If you'd like to try watching something different and away from all the usual product anime, you might as well give this anime a go. Japanese and Chinese culture are very different and may just interest you just by how different they are.To be fair chinese manhua/ china in general never get this type of attention, getting their own anime with a full 22-24mins long ep (most are reduced to online airing of short 5-15 mins). My opinion of this anime maybe be slightly biased for being good. But i'll be truthful that it's not the best story i've come across, but its one of the better ones. back story is presented before the main problem of the story appears.

Storywise, this anime isn\'t that great. It has the typical storyline of a main \'hero\' who is special in some way and quite OP and who shows everyone else that he\'s not just a loser. The story is quite clichéd but I do give the show some credits for keeping the difficult explanations of everything at a fast and understandable pace without getting too much into detail but in a way you can still kind of understand everything.Art: 9.

Normal scenes had nice and clean drawings but what really made me love the art (and in fact the whole anime) was how it switched from a normal perspective to the funny chibi scenes and other comedic stuff.

This isn't to suggest the show is bad, although there are things i find particularly lacking about it, just be aware that it doesn't have the usual format and will take a little getting used to as a result.I've marked the story as fair because i feel although the show itself was fine it did waste a lot of potential with its constant time skips. The show has a habit of introducing a problem, skipping the build up which can last months or even years and getting straight to the solution; so we don't really get the human element of struggle which allows us to relate to the people inhabiting this universe. The show seems to focus on the less interesting and somewhat arbitrary socio-politics occurring between such moments of interest. Characters squabbling over arbitrary rules to determine how something might be achieved, if it can at all. Here, it would seem, is a continued cultural reference unique to China's sociology that is lost on anyone unfamiliar with it.The thing that is most peculiar about the show is that it always feels like you're viewing it at arms length. You never really feel attached to anyone because nobody stands out (partly because you never find out anyone's agenda and/or motivation) and you never feel any connection between the characters themselves either, characters who come across like soulless pawns moving across a chess board. Even the main character doesn't really want for anything but strength for the sake of strength after becoming aware of his latent talents. There's no real obstacle or challenge presented, certainly no distinctive antagonist. So it all feels really wet. But the show isn't really all that bad, so it feels like we're waiting on something to happen to trigger the missing dramatic elements we enjoy in this medium.After watching both this and the second series i was left wondering what it was i had actually watched because there are so many aspects of the story that go unexplained or merely implied or suggested. We really only get presented with the results of the main characters growth which we don't really care about because we don't know what he aims to do with it. notice this more as the story progresses.

The first episode just showed some random things and expected the watcher to understand what was being showed to. Although i find flying on swords pretty cool, it does not tell me why i should invest...my time int this anime!!As the anime progresses, i think what we are meant to focus on is just the comedy because other than that, everything is confusing, and just briefly explained through a narration after something has happened.Cultivation ranks are confusing and all we know is that the character is meant to train the body and absorb ki and eventually he would have a chance to become a deity... the time skips dont help as they happen out of nowhere and then briefly explained what has happened during those time skips...2nd side; I have read similar kinds of novels, although not this specific one that got adapted to this anime, usually those novels, are more dark, the competition to enter the sect is not that light hearted but ruthless murdering of other disciple and even within the sect the competition cannot be taken lightly. So when i started watching this, it took me by a suprise how light hearted it is and how much of comedy and it has so i asked around forums and learned that although the characters are the same, the novel doesnt have any comedy and is much different and cultivation is explained somewhat more in detail. So the fact that i who have read Xianxia novels am somewhat disappointed with the first and probably last adaption of this genre. Unless it was done as a 50 or 100 episode series with a darker tone and better explanations and the like other than that this anime will not have a huge popularity from both only anime watchers and xianxia fans like myself.Art; 7/10Art is good looking and nothing, can be complained, the reason i am deducting 3 point from the perfect score is because the story forced different kinds of actions on the characters, for amusement and comedy which sort of destroyed a bit of the good art.

The comedic banter between Oriku and Obu was funny, as well as some of the other charcters. This first season set the basis of the plot and some light character development. I am looking forward to some additional plot/character development in the second season, which according to the...end card of the final episode was approved. end card of the final episode was approved.', ""Chinese xianxia. The point is for MC to reach enlightenment and become very strong.What's great about this anime is the really down to earth but still uplifting comedy and perspective towards life. For example the MC is the one that bullies at some point some secondary characters, multiple times, for the fun of it and the out of convenience and it's all in a very lighthearted manner. The anime won't tell you what to think about this event, it's neither bad nor good, just funny and convenient, but usually one can also find a moral.The main character is overpowered in the sense that he never...loses, but in every episode he needs to find a path to become better or work towards his goal. Most of the times he needs to interact with his fellow clan members, teachers or other clan members in a more complex fashion than just quid pro quo or being opponents. I'd say this anime is a great picture of humanity while also tackling the inherent inequalities of life as well as various ways to live your life.One significant issue is that some parts are really rushed or left unexplained, or the writer had some glorious idea that he couldn't quite accomplish in writing.The animation is not on par with what is being done now, or 10 years ago.

Did I miss something big?"" and went to search around, and here we are.Now, quite honestly this anime is something of an abomination. The thing is, this is a japanese anime made from a chinese novel in some form of a cooperation. This is the part where it becomes something of an abomination. You can easily see how they mutilated the novel to fit in with the usual fast-food japanese crap(the low-level crappy animes that they send on a conveyor belt for the addicts)....Hell, they even changed the small parts of the novel that you do see, they changed A LOT of the dialogue, jokes and story, now it\'s pretty much like any other japanese anime... The good stuff is gone and we have yet another generic junk-food anime that pretty much only differs in its setting. Honestly, it\'s pretty much a completely separate story from the anime with how much they changed everything. Well, it\'s somewhat interesting and a few of the jokes hit home, so it\'s not a trainwreck, just average.Not only does about 90-95% or more of the content get left out with only the absolute bare minimum to keep the story going, almost all the jokes are either destroyed or not included, which also makes the included jokes feel out of place. Seriously, I felt quite bored watching it, if anything it was a bit interesting to see the ""xianxia"" world animated.Of course they use japanese, and I\'m fine with that even if names are changed and everything looks more like a western magic animation than a xianxia chinese one, but a lot of the funny parts are lost due to translation or perhaps the japanese didn\'t feel the rougher parts that are more in-line with chinese culture were funny.So, you get a husk with almost no comedy(at least I hardly laughed at all while watching both the seasons) and all and tons of scenes to make you cringe because it\'s f**king horrible in almost every way possible. No, sorry, it\'s not horrible, it\'s average. Really, it\'s one of those animes that shouldn\'t be compared with the novel at all. If the novel is a 10/10, the anime is a 2 or at most 3/10.It\'s pretty sad, but what was I hoping for? It\'s similar to all the manhua\'s(or manga\'s) which also completely screws up a novels good points. Just that this might be even worse because they japanized it, trying to force the novel into a japanese format that has a very similar style and animations to the japanese stuff(like the reactions, especially in the joke scenes but pretty much everything is the same). Seriously, it\'s not even the same novel anymore when not only does most of the events get left out but almost every single scene and event is changed up along with adding new jokes that just aren\'t that good(the standard cliché jokes you\'d find in japanese stuff).So... Really, it\'s barely worth watching unless you\'re bored and have nothing better to watch or read. Or maybe you loved the novel so much that you want to watch this anime that is pretty much like a japanese parallel story set in the same universe with different stories. Read the novel instead, it\'s f**king awesome. ""Once Upon A Time, There Was A Spirit Sword Mountain"", you can find it on qidian (webnovel.com) for free. The novel is hilarious, this anime can pretty much be considered an insult to it, but that is often the case with adaptations into anime or manga from novels since it forces things into a smaller format with almost no content. Only that this was even worse than the usual adaptations because of the differing cultures and that chinese novels really doesn\'t fit in anime\'s since you can\'t compress an xianxia to such an extent and still have something good left. All the good stuff is in the long text, compressing it makes you lose almost all of it.

That is, if we set the bar at a low level.It was written as if a fan, upon watching a lot of shounen anime, suddenly had an idea about a story and then went off on a writing spree. Of course he\'ll include an overpowered MC - an intelligent one with great physical ability on the side. And then a sexy woman who acts as if she\'s a good-for-nothing but is actually really strong and would be the MC\'s master. Ah, and then another woman who is...also very strong but in another sense, it would be good if there are two masters. ""Not sure what that other sense would be, but I\'ll probably have an idea of her background later on."" And then a whole bunch of other cliched characters that would serve to make the MC look stronger.As for the story, he had this one concrete idea for the start, until a little of what\'s after. And then, he suddenly got lost later on because there\'s literally nothing going on aside from the training. He got no more idea on how to push the MC to become stronger, most likely because he hadn\'t established anything beforehand as to what kind of major conflict (e.g. villain) would there be just like in other shounen anime. ""Ah, I messed up."" So he started to consult fellow fans for ideas and also watched other anime for references. In one way or another, he managed to sew up all sorts of ideas until the anime ended. (And there\'s even a sequel ugh but that\'s for another rant--- I mean, review).It really was a pretty decent watch at the start -  it helped that I didn\'t have any expectations. I was willing to forgive the lack of a concrete story framework and dismiss it as a new writer\'s fiction. My curiosity got the best of me and I wondered how the MC would master the technique he\'s studying, how it would be when he meets up again with his long-distance friend who seems to also grow stronger and stronger, and how he would use his techniques on a real battle. But no, I didn\'t get anything. Somehow, other characters really were just written to make the MC look stronger and then they got forgotten for the next scenes. Potential rivalry and camaraderie were abandoned, and no characterization was established. Even the MC and his masters are inconsistent. Obu (the good-for-nothing but strong master) would be the most consistent of them all, but I lost interest when she got into a fight and then there\'s no battle choreography at all, even special techniques to show that okay, she\'s powerful. Somehow, she was also granted the ""OP spell"" at this point.Moreover, the last episodes really just looked like a tangle of external ideas that didn\'t go well with each other. The characters are at their most incoherent at this point and there are sudden developments between characters at the last episode which I really wouldn\'t call as such since there are no build-up or hints beforehand. It looked as if the editor just noticed that the anime\'s going nowhere, so they suddenly put together something, whatever it is. Heck, I watched some episodes of the sequel and it differed a lot from this first series, and that is a major proof of the anime\'s inconsistence.So there. Nothing went on, and if you\'re ever gonna watch it, best expect it to be just a time-killer. It\'s a good past time if you don\'t bother yourself with the details. But well, I don\'t really recommend it.  The only merit I probably got in this anime is the great opening song by Soraru and Mafumafu.

Sure there was a lot of exposition in the book too, but usually when bringing it to an anime adaptation a lot of that gets condensed and put it a bit more subtly. The same with the jokes.

I found it was really similar to My Hero Academia, in the sense that the MC is always training. A major theme in the show is that the MC is always training, so if...you like anime like that then you will enjoy this. Im not sure why, but Reikenzan had a similar vibe to Demon Slayer as well.

All I can say is that you watch one episode. If you liked it, you\'ll like it all, if you didn\'t, then move on.Just one thing to clear up. There\'s a persistent opinion in various reviews that this show has got ""no plot"" (lol). Indeed, there\'s no new villain every episode, no ""hot springs"" OVA or any other cliched bullshit, however I don\'t understand how should it varrant a point deduction in grading this show. This isn\'t a shonen mecha superpowers anime, and if you want to watch one, there\'s a fuckton of them gathering metaphorical dust on the internet.Here, the plot is about self-growth and deification. The End, Fin, Thank You For Watching. And, personally, I think it\'s a wonderful thing for anime to do, especially when it can only air a measly amount of 12 episodes, because it can concentrate on interactions and personal growth of the characters.Personally what hurts me most is that this anime is quite unique, with its plot progressing at slice of life pace and overloaded with fantasy.P.S.

The thing is, original story (novel/drama) takes place in an Ancient Chinese Fantasy world filled with Taoism sects, and I can say that one does need to know about the setting to make sense of what is going on in this first season as explanations are about some...specific topics/techniques and not the world itself. And even then, I can't say I got the feeling that I was watching this particular fantasy genre (xianxia).Everything was so all over the place, and problem was, most likely, limited time and episode count; we did not see characters being characters they were supposed to be; almost no thought process or whatsoever to observe, main cast's interaction with each other was very limited and it just generally failed to make me feel anything about the characters; we, as the audience, were supposed to just understand all their personality traits and their relationships from tiny bits of information splattered around, and that is just impossible if you don't actually know the characters.This series does have some worldbuilding but they just couldn't show anything of worth in the anime. Honestly, I can go on and on but well. I will probably end up angering myself, so, the point;This series can be watched to spend your free time, OP and ED are so-so, voice acting is not bad (even if I think main female's voice could be less... 'classic'), animation is nice; don't expect well developed story/characters/world and just... try to enjoy, I guess. specific topics/techniques and not the world itself.

Its just really 2 people, falling in love with each other slowly through daily occurrence and some workplace drama without realising it. There's no blatant hint, the show doesn't even acknowledge it with some sound effects / animation effect about the love, its all just feelings. {Btw, episode 4 is very important to this show, that's why I hold off this review till now, and if you give this anime a try, watch till the end of ep. 4}Recommend for: Drama, Feels, romance, Yuri,...Voice actingNot Recommend for: ComedyAs I said at first paragraph, the show is very subtle with the romance, but also very progressive toward the aspect. There's no in your face sparkly love styles, nor acknowledge of it. This can be good or bad up to you, but for anyone that at least watched some romance shows, this can be a breath of fresh air. So this bring me to my first point, the Directing. The directing doesn't stand out that much, but also subtle about everything. Sometime this show got so much drama it can forget what it is at time, but will always bring it back masterfully and in a meaningful way in the romance plot line. The OST, animation, and especially the VOICE ACTING support this FULLY as well. [Directing 9/10] [Production Quality 7.5/10]The voice acting tho, MWAH, perfection. This anime is one of the anime that have that MASTERPIECE voice acting scene. The quality also prolong through as per industry standard, but damn that one scene in one of the episode is VERY good, the sheer feelings radiate through my screen directing to my brain, and I love. (ofc as expect from an anime about VAs, it should be good, and it is) [Voice acting 10+/10]The drama is one unexpected good thing from this show. Even though the show isn't listed as a drama in its genre, means this probably will be a not recommended thing since its out of the scope its selling at, but well if you enjoy some drama (its not that much, at longest the drama only lasted like 1.5 ep). So if you enjoy irl relatable drama, it's very fun. [Drama 8/10]Lastly the com in the rom-com. What should I say, it's mid at best. The comedy barely exist in this show, or at most not that good that I already forgot all of it. [6/10]IN CONCLUSION:The yuri? good, the character? good. What's phenomenal about it? the realism directing and the voice acting. The unexpecting drama can be good if you enjoy it, its not that long nor prominent, but there to spice up the romance of course. So, definitely reccomend.My rating as a romance anime: 9.5/10 (-0.5 for comedy)My rating as an anime: 8.15/10 Voice actingNot Recommend for: ComedyAs I said at first paragraph, the show is very subtle with the romance, but also very progressive toward the aspect.

The characters say a lot, without saying anything of substance. It's very much: expositionary dialogue the anime.Let's start with the setting and premise of the story. It isn't bad by any means, and in fact, voice actors competing as rivals, but slowly form a bond that may or may not turn into something more, is quite unique. The issue is that none of the content of the plot, nor the growth of the characters, and even less so the story, are done in a way that's interesting. In...fact, it's quite dull. Sure, there is the theme of lack of confidence and inadequacy that we all struggle with in our day to day lives that is protrayed here, but it's not presented in a way that's poingnant or makes you think deeper about those things. It's just blurted out by the characters and that's it. Next scene.The characters are nothing short of run of the mill and boring, much like the plot itself. Shy and talented, outgoing and motivated to work hard to get better. Even if both of the female MCs have a 'rivalry', it not like it results in them growing stronger because of it. They flip flop between friends and rivals without true purpose. There's no rhyme or reason to their growing relationship, and so far, truly nothing to show for it.The art is fine, it's nothing amazing but it's pretty enough. Not much more to say here. Same for the music and sound. All dance along the lines of 'eh, fine I guess'.The romance, if you can even call it that, is pretty tertiary in this story. To me, this anime feels like it has no direction and I truly don't need to watch anymore than 9 episodes to know that ultimately, it'll leave me feeling unsatisfied and unimpressed. I guess, if you want to watch something as background noise to clean, work, do homework, or to fall asleep to it's perfect.

It works for what the show is trying to do.The main characters are likable both visually and personality wise. Their characters contrast with each other yet care for each other in their own unique way. As Seiyuu Radio\'s genre is Comedy and Girls\' Love, the characters fit...the bill in what makes this show works. The other characters exist but are not particularly memorable. They serve their purpose fine.Soundwise, the show is not memorable, I don\'t particularly remember anything good nor bad about it. Again that makes it fine.Storywise, the show is about two underage girls in the voice acting career who coincidentally end up as classmates and they both do not match the image of the characters they portray. They have different levels of success in their career and have different opinions on the industry at least initially. They learn to reconcile those differences as they work together. Given that 4 episodes have aired and each episode has its bit on another aspect of voice acting industry as well as dealing with how the main characters feel about one another, the pacing is great making good use of its time. However while the show addresses the themes, it does not promote thought provoking discussion on said themes taking the ""tame"" route out of the challenges of the Voice Acting Industry.Overall fine show, it is worth a watch as long as one isn\'t expecting a masterpiece. the bill in what makes this show works.

This preliminary review contains light spoilers and implications. Read at your own discretion.]Girls Love? Two-faced characters? The inner workings of the seiyuu industry?We have ourselves a winner!Seiyuu Radio no Uraomote has a lot going for it. This compelling anime explores the relationship between two high school girls who work together as seiyuus and are also classmates. At first, their contrasting personalities create tension. But as they get to know each other, they grow closer and start to see each other in a different light. I am currently 1/3 through the anime, but boy there\'s a lot I\'d like to say.This viewer and...occasional reviewer here does not often watch Girls Love anime. That being said, I loved that the premise centers around seiyuu work and that our main characters got depth and interesting relationship dynamics. Despite being totally different, the two bridge differences by communicating in a genuine manner. If they want to cuss each other out, they would. If they want to have an open heart-to-heart discussion, they would too. Seeing the main characters put on their personas and interact is also fun in itself. Us, the viewers, get to spectate their facade while knowing how their real selves really feel. It\'s a very fun experience.As for the characters themselves, they are beautifully flawed. One is a girl is impulsive and tends to think before she acts, but she has a kind heart and a cheerful personality. The other appears disagreeable and has a sharp tongue, but her passion, her dedication to her work, and her little quirks make her an endearing character. This anime doesn\'t shy away from character flaws at all. What\'s more, these girls change bit by bit with every interaction. That, too, is a fun experience.So far, it\'s all positive. It is story where I\'d like to put my critique. To put it more accurately, it\'s not the story but rather the adaptation and pacing. The story alone has interesting developments that\'d make viewers stay for another episode even after having said ""this will be my last for the day"". Viewers can find themselves immersed and intrigued by the turn of events. This is thanks to the ideas and the writing of the original source material. It was enjoyable to see this ""secret life"" concept with our two girls who are very much different from their work personas. Shows with this premise tend to focus on concealing this secret life, but it\'s played off quite casually here.I expected these early episodes to focus solely on the main characters\' interactions and how they navigate the seiyuu industry, but surprisingly, the drama gets introduced and develops pretty early on. And that\'s where the problem begins. What\'s unfortunate is the poor execution of this story arc. Starting around episode 3, the anime starts to rush the series of events and dialogues. Had these turn of events taken their time, the impact of the big reveal would have been much better. It wouldn\'t have left thoughts like ""they were friends a second ago and now they\'re going through bipolar mood swings"" or ""what\'s with the name drop of this side character?"".Overall, it\'s still a pretty enjoyable show, and all the more if you are in search of an anime that tackles the seiyuu industry and/or has Girls Love portrayed in a more natural way.

With that being said I really want to write a review for this anime because I love Seiyuu Radio and was looking forward to the anime adaptation.I actually have been reading the manga for this for quite some time and the story is really good and I love the characters. The adaptation has been very disappointing and underwhelming though which sucks because...it was one of the main anime I was looking forward to this season.They skip over quite a lot of material, the ost is terrible when there even is any, and the animation is a looot of still shots. The characters are very watered down too. The manga is far better. Wish this anime had the same love put into it as the adachi to shimamura adaptation or a recent anime original release ""Jellyfish can\'t swim in the night.""For lovers of Yuri or the romance genre in general I don\'t want to dissuade them from checking the series out so I will leave it at a 5 and mixed feelings, however I definitely recommend reading the manga or light novels instead. it was one of the main anime I was looking forward to this season.They skip over quite a lot of material, the ost is terrible when there even is any, and the animation is a looot of still shots.
