Dog Signal,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54294/Dog_Signal,"[""I honestly don't know why this anime is so underrated. The animation isn't very good but it's totally watchable. At the same time this show can be funny and super informative about dogs it's also a very emotional anime that connects us with the feeling of love for our pets. I believe anyone can enjoy this show but it definitely hits different on someone who is or was a pet owner. During the episodes we are presented different stories and problems between dogs and their owners and have the opportunity to follow them up to their solutions. Every story in this anime is so beautiful...on its own way, and you'll want more and more. I recommend this anime to anyone who wants to laugh, cry, learn about dogs or simply have a good time with an amazing show. on its own way, and you'll want more and more.

Even though the graphics of this anime are quite poor, the story is so good!You cannot find much anime that gives you knowledge together with fun. The story of each episode is almost like the case of Detective Conan. You need to find out why pets do this thing, that thing. But after the protagonist solves it, you will understand the whole story.I don't have a pet so I did not have much experience with that but after I watched this anime, now I think I understand pets quite good even give advice to the pet owner (I...believe :P)So I think you should try to watch a few episodes. If you still don't like it, just drop this one. But I really recommend you try it!One of the problems of this anime is Marketing. I did not hear anyone mention it at all, it's my luck to find this anime. believe :P)So I think you should try to watch a few episodes. If you still don't like it, just drop this one.

I think it's very clear since all reviewers before me said the same thing. Certainly this anime deserves higher rating than 6.90. This anime has it all except one thing, great animation. It's not the best, but not the worst. I'd say decent. This is not action anime, so I don't really care much about that part. What I care is story and character. And this anime delivers. Relatable characters, heartwarming stories, great moral messages, very educational especially if you have or want to have a pet. Or even if you don't. The humans in this anime has their own stories and...we get to see how they overcome their struggles in life. So it's not just about pets. If you like slice of life especially the heartwarming one, like Natsume Yuujincho, Deaimon, Gakuen Babysitter, Koutarou wa Hitorigurashi etc, try this anime. You gonna love it. we get to see how they overcome their struggles in life. So it's not just about pets.

The animation is nothing to write home about (in fact, it can get comically poor in many scenes); however, it's the overall story, well-researched information, emotionally-driven plot lines of the episodes, and 3 main characters that carry the anime.As a Malamute mama, former dog foster parent, and breeder, I can attest that the information packed into this anime is not only incredibly accurate, but very entertaining for dog lovers! There have been so many times I finished an episode feeling quite impressed at not only the anime's ability to get me emotionally invested in the...plot, but also with how in-depth the writers go into explaining a dog's ticks, insecurities, conditions, etc. Out of the 14 episodes I've watched, the information presented has all been correct and well-researched, making Dog Signal not only an enjoyable experience, but also a very educational one. The challenges presented in each episode have been naturalistic and plausible as well (albeit a bit melodramatic on the part of the dog owners at times, but it IS anime), and have even made me reflect on how my actions/reactions to issues with the dogs in my care could have been improved upon.Each episode (except for the main story episodes) almost put you into a puzzle-solving mindset to make you think about what is causing the dog in question to behave a certain way, and the fact that it's usually *humans* causing the behaviors makes one try to decipher what the owner may be doing wrong, knowingly or not, to adversely affect their pup. This is a large contributing factor to Dog Signal's charm (aside from the dogs, of course)!The fact that all of the dogs are portrayed realistically and with respect to their breeds is also fantastic, and really reflects positively on the writing team.I hope I've convinced you to give Dog Signal a chance; if you're a dog lover (or general animal lover), I highly doubt you'll come away from this anime disappointed.Additional information:-Music within the episodes is not memorable, but the opening is a nice tune. The ending is a bit weak.-Pacing is great in each episode; no one episode's plot overstays its welcome, and issues resolve in a satisfying way.-The main character, Miyu, can be loud quite frequently (I think it's supposed to be reflective of his naivete), but does learn, mature, and develop, which doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence like other main characters can. Episode 12, in particular, seriously made me love Miyu's character and his dedication to the animals in his care!-The side characters from many episodes stick around and continue to be in the background as trainees, which is a nice touch to show how the training business continues to grow, and how situations with one client end up educating the others. plot, but also with how in-depth the writers go into explaining a dog's ticks, insecurities, conditions, etc. Out of the 14 episodes I've watched, the information presented has all been correct and well-researched, making Dog Signal not only an enjoyable experience, but also a very educational one.

Walking audiences through these methods with step by step instruction! The story and plot moves forward with realistic scenarios that many dogs and their owners have experienced.The characters are well rounded, in the sense that their personalities and emotional depths are properly explored and we come to understand each of the main cast. At times, their sense of canine justice may have been overly exaggerated, but audiences...understood the value of speaking and caring for an animal that cannot speak for themselves. The side-characters were never neglected, nor written off, each dog and customer are made to feel important. Their issues were not judged, but properly evaluated.While the soundtrack is nothing special, and the animation itself is not overly flashy, nor vibrant. The attention to detail on the individual dog's features, movements and behaviours was impressive. This held true to the 'Slice of Life' genre, with each episode having uplifting tones and had proper resolve for each 'problematic behaviour'. More then that, audiences could feel the loving relationships and genuine empathy the owners experiences with their dogs.It is surprising that this series was not given English Dubbing, since there was so much condensed information, you'll find yourself reading and re-watching the same scenes till it all sinks in.It may feel slow passed at times, but every episode is a 'treat' (haha).This anime truly brought me back to the early days of training my own puppy, and acted as a helpful reminder in the many ways a dog-owner can contribute to their dog's happiness. They will always be there for us, so we need to do our best to care for them and cherish the time we have together. understood the value of speaking and caring for an animal that cannot speak for themselves.

The dialogue and characters are trope-y, caricature-y, and very anime-y. but when they...pull the right threads by realistically depicting experiences that many dog owners face, the series actually weaves through some really touching moments. while most episodes are standalone, the occasional two-episode stories are so strongly written that if not for these, Dog Signal might not be worth wading through. and i must say as a russell terrier (mix) owner, that eps 16 was waay too real heheven then we watch it as a cozy filler show between better seasonal releases. i can't quite rank it higher for the general MAL user, but it is nevertheless a special and quite instructive show despite some flaws. pull the right threads by realistically depicting experiences that many dog owners face, the series actually weaves through some really touching moments. while most episodes are standalone, the occasional two-episode stories are so strongly written that if not for these, Dog Signal might not be worth wading through. and i must say as a russell terrier (mix) owner, that eps 16 was waay too real heheven then we watch it as a cozy filler show between better seasonal releases. i can't quite rank it higher for the general MAL user, but it is nevertheless a special and quite instructive show despite some flaws.""]"
Densetsu Kyojin Ideon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/930/Densetsu_Kyojin_Ideon,"['Let\'s be honest here.  You\'re probably interested in this series because of the movie\'s reputation, and you\'re wondering if the TV show is worth watching.  Let\'s get this out of the way first: you CAN skip the TV series and just watch A Contact (the compilation movie) followed by Be Invoked (the new and improved ending).  This may be fine for you: you\'ll get skip some of the repetitive bits of the series, but you\'ll also skip characterization.  While the TV show is a bit slow at times, A Contact and Be Invoked try to cram everything together... things develop a...bit too fast.The problem with Ideon becomes apparent as soon as you watch the first episode.  At its core, the show is a series of 22-minute commercials for toys which haven\'t been sold in decades for a country on the other side of the world.  Animations are reused heavily, early plots mostly follow a predictable formula (land on new planet, aliens attack with new strategy, mech pilots save the day), the characters can be hard to like, and you get tired of the revolving door of villains.  But there are also episodes where the show takes itself seriously.  Tensions between the main characters are handled with respect, and most of the main cast develops quite wonderfully, even if it seems a bit slow.  The plot is sometimes stitched together with crude seams, but at other times it flows quite well.Once you get to episode #23, the tone changes, and the series discovers its purpose.  Remember how the conflict in episode #1 seemed almost accidental in origin?  By episode #23, the conflict has grown so large that no matter what anyone says or does, the fighting will continue, and the consequences are always serious.  Even if you save the day, you can\'t save everyone.  Even if you surrender, you can\'t stop fighting.  Even as you work towards the same goals, you can hate and betray each other.  The plot picks up the pace, characters develop and break down quite spectacularly (they don\'t cope with things by whining about them, thank goodness), and even the deus ex machina that saved the day in the first half of the series gets turned on its head.  Everyone gets a moment before the end to show their true depth.Episode #39 should be skipped, just watch ""Be Invoked"" instead, since episode #39 was recut, improved, and made into the beginning of the movie.  It is a great episode, but the movie gives you a better version.All said, I would give a 5/10 or 6/10 to the first 22 episodes, with the acknowledgement that a few of those episodes are fairly good.  I\'d give the last 17 episodes a 8/10 or 9/10—again with the acknowledgement that there are a couple stinkers, such as episode #34.  I might rewatch this someday, but I\'d skip over most of the episodes. bit too fast.The problem with Ideon becomes apparent as soon as you watch the first episode.

Later revealed to the characters that Ideon is more than a robot.i loved the idea of both factions thinking of each other as ""Aliens"" while both are human beings just fell into misunderstanding which lead them to their doom later. that also can be a good ""Anti-Racism"" message. the Love story between two characters from different sides, both loved each other despite the hate of everyone around them, One lost the trust of some people, and other lost her entire family and homeland for her love.there are also many twists and surprises for everyone in the series, things i love most in anime.And something i should not forget, how the series alone showed how filthy and corrupted the humankind can be amazed me, it\'s sadly true, mankind just lives to kill each other and rule each other....9/10=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Characters\' Development:one of strongest elements of Ideon is that it has great development for each one.the interaction between characters, the trust and betrayals, the fear and revenge and the hatred.it\'s like a bloody theaterIt\'s nice to see that all the characters acting realistically, unlike the typical super robot animeeveryone worried, cautions, nerves, depressed,jealously, etc...In a typical super robot anime, the main heroes all acting hot-blooded and ready to kick some bots ass because they have a powerful robot, it isn\'t the same in Ideon, which all the characters keep suspicious and in fear of it.8/10sound: there are some good and lovely pieces, but the problem here is the transition between BGMs sometimes get noisy and annoying. for example, a BGM played and eruptly changing the tone to entirely different tone and mood, that happened so much unfortunately =/6/10Animations: Nah, i don\'t care much about animation, i\'m fine with any, as an old anime fan that grew up with many 70\'s animei consider Ideon\'s animations is one of the best in its time. what grabbed my attention more is the art of the galaxies and planets, the art shows how the scary the ""ruined planets"" can be, some arts was scary,  giving a good image of a ruined world.8/10Final Words:I Enjoyed the series so much, there are many messages to humankind in Ideon, the series was good to show solutions to end wars and hatred from people towards each other.almost a perfect depiction of mankind..I can\'t really recommend Ideon to anyone, only those mecha-maniacs like me can enjoy it, unlike most modern anime which famed by its fan-service and naughty girlsIdeon has no fan-service if anyone seeking.... still a great show in overall, has good action and good characters set..8/10 of your chair wanting more and more.Ideon\'s sometimes  considered to be the prototype of the modern dark and twisted science fiction anime such as Evangelion, Akira and others. and been an inspiration for many directors and anime such as the just-mentioned and well-known Evangelion.It\'s draggy though, very slow paced which can be unpreferable to many.The titular mecha, the Ideon a massive giant robot resurrected when he felt that the people is killing each other again and now he must stop it.

I don\'t mean that in the sense that this is a perfect anime by any means. But it is trying so much. All of his ideas are laid out plainly here and wrapped up in a very final way by the movie afterward. I would say Tomino spent the rest of his career chasing after the ideas and themes laid out over the course of this series. There is more of this in Zeta Gundam than 0079. You can see a lot of different aspects of things in this series very plainly being expounded upon in Zeta, ZZ and Victory Gundam...going forward.For starters, I don\'t believe you are supposed to like any of these characters exactly. Not on a personal level. Unlike a lot of Gundam where the main cast is kind of just supposed to be ""the good guys"", these are a bunch of petty people who don\'t have any reason to like each other, stuck in this messed up situation where they can do nothing but flee for their lives. I ended up liking them, but for reasons that have to do with how they are portrayed as events continue to unfold. The giant robot that is The Ideon\'s mystery slowly being unveiled over the course of the series while actually becoming sort of horrifying as the characters realize they have no control over what comes next.And as far as Tomino themes go, this is it. The inevitability of mankind to fight over cultural differences and circumstance no matter how similar they actually are. The connectedness of us all and can we ever truly understand each other? Do we have to understand each other to love each other? The overall tone of this show is bleak but I don\'t believe it ever crosses into pure nihilism. This is a work that is asking the question and positing what we do in the face of the unknown, and total annihilation. I would never in my life believe Tomino thought he had the answer, that is like the one solid silver lining in his politics for me that cuts through the cynicism and a few other rather problematic things he believes. It\'s why I think this show is so interesting if you are willing to really dig into it.And then just as a structure, I think it\'s just good sci fi. Yeah it falls into a bit of a formula but that\'s okay when what\'s there is being presented well. This is a very specific kind of show from a very specific era of anime and I think that is only a positive. I would not think to dismiss it for being so.Ideon also has some really good sound design. I am no expert in the field of course, but I really dug the soundtrack. I can sing that Ideon Theme song by heart because I watched it every single episode.Some things to keep in mind if you watch this, you sort of have to let go of your seriousness to enjoy something like this if that makes sense. This is a show that takes itself super seriously when it wants to but is also still very much a Tomino show and is extremely goofy when it\'s not being serious. It is also a Super Robot show way more than a Real Robot show. A lot of theme overlap but the big super robot is gonna be the big super robot. Be Invoked is essential to watch when you are finished the TV Series. Don\'t watch Contact. Anyone who tells you to watch Contact is full of it, it cuts out everything good about the series and barely makes sense.Now if you want to talk about space battles, and mecha combat, Ideon\'s got that too. There are some really ridiculous and interesting designs for the Buff clan\'s robots and I always enjoyed seeing what they had next to throw before the might of the Ideon. There are scenes from inside of cockpits in Ideon that put most of Gundam and other mecha to shame. Just for the sheer tension and the sense of helplessness that you would have in some situations. I give this a 10 in story because it is such a wonderfully interesting mess and is lowkey responsible for inspiring lots of things that came after it. It is really going for it and because I enjoyed it so so much as someone who has been moving through mecha anime for the last year.

This really felt like a high point.', 'Being an adventurous anime watcher, I decided to embark on taking on anime that appeared to be interesting from reading a summary of it. At first I did not realize that it was an old anime but I decided not to let that deter me from giving it a go.STORY - 5/10The story begins with the discovery of the Solo ship and the giant mecha Ideon by the Logo Dau. At the same time this discovery was happening, the younger daughter of the most important person in the Buff Clan happens to crash on the same planet that the discovery is made. Fate is...what pits her and Jordan Bes together supposedly in the hope of uniting the both clans. The Buff Clan is looking for the legendary Ide as well, which is said to possess limitless powers and they attack the Logo Dau when they realize that they have found it. It is during this raucous that the Logo Dau is forced to use the Solo Ship as well as fight using the Ideon which is how they referred to the giant mecha. From this point onwards, an endless battle begins between the Logo Dau and the Buff Clan, fighting to take control of the Ideon, which grew stronger with every battle fought, thereby causing all efforts made by the Buff Clan to obtain it futile.ART – 5/10Giving consideration to the time the anime was released, which was in 1981, for people of that time it would have been fantastic.  But, given the time span and the quality of anime that is done now, it’s a little too grainy with not so much detailing given to characters and the setting of the anime. Nevertheless, the costumes of the Buff Clan were original and tastefully done.SOUND – 3/10The sound effects in this anime were pretty awful. It didn’t have much musical pieces and the audio was really bad in some episodes. There was even an episode where it appeared that there were other voices besides the anime characters that could be heard in the background, which killed it for me.CHARACTER – 3/10Wow. Where do I begin. Most of the characters in this anime were static throughout the course of the series.  Yuuki Cosmo is the only memorable character in this series that happened to be a well rounded, well developed character. The main pilot of the Ideon, he displayed courage, spirit, a high level of maturity in such a short amount of time and the ability to make important battle decisions, make him stand out in the series as the most extraordinary character. Also, there were lots of characters who did not last even two episodes well until they died so it did not make much sense to even want to get acquainted with them.ENJOYMENT - 4/10With regards to my personal satisfaction in watching this anime, I struggled to get through it. At times it would be very engaging but then at times it became a bit repetitious because of the realization that the battles between the Buff Clan and the Logo Dau were pointless because no matter what tactics or measures the Buff Clan employed, they would never be able to defeat the Ideon simply because it was the source of limitless power and it got stronger and stronger with every battle fought. The ending was rushed and did not give any explanation about the people of the Sixth Civilization, who was the ones to create the Solo Ship and the Ideon, the purpose for which they did it, and it lacked any true closure.OVERALL – 4/10After listing everything above, I gave this anime a rating of 5 simply because I believe that the story did not develop at all. There were too many battles that did not make much sense. No explanation was given why the people of the Sixth Civilization created the Ideon and the Solo Ship; too many characters came and died almost instantaneously and the other characters that were involved in the anime could have been developed more. what pits her and Jordan Bes together supposedly in the hope of uniting the both clans. The Buff Clan is looking for the legendary Ide as well, which is said to possess limitless powers and they attack the Logo Dau when they realize that they have found it. It is during this raucous that the Logo Dau is forced to use the Solo Ship as well as fight using the Ideon which is how they referred to the giant mecha. From this point onwards, an endless battle begins between the Logo Dau and the Buff Clan, fighting to take control of the Ideon, which grew stronger with every battle fought, thereby causing all efforts made by the Buff Clan to obtain it futile.ART – 5/10Giving consideration to the time the anime was released, which was in 1981, for people of that time it would have been fantastic.  But, given the time span and the quality of anime that is done now, it’s a little too grainy with not so much detailing given to characters and the setting of the anime. Nevertheless, the costumes of the Buff Clan were original and tastefully done.SOUND – 3/10The sound effects in this anime were pretty awful. It didn’t have much musical pieces and the audio was really bad in some episodes. There was even an episode where it appeared that there were other voices besides the anime characters that could be heard in the background, which killed it for me.CHARACTER – 3/10Wow. Where do I begin. Most of the characters in this anime were static throughout the course of the series.  Yuuki Cosmo is the only memorable character in this series that happened to be a well rounded, well developed character. The main pilot of the Ideon, he displayed courage, spirit, a high level of maturity in such a short amount of time and the ability to make important battle decisions, make him stand out in the series as the most extraordinary character.

I don't think that people give it enough credit because of the clunky first few episodes and the famous Yoshiyuki Tomino-isms (side note: a prime example of his character interactions can been seen in Mobile Suit Zeta Gundamーwhich I love, but I can't deny that the characters are written like maniac depressive psychos).• I was initially turned off to this series because of how weird it was and how characters kept referring to themselves as samurai for a reason that I didn’t completely understand.

I give it an 8/10."", 'The Ideon franchise is one of my favorite in the mecha genre and is something I’ve been a fan of for a very long time. Originally created as the follow up to director Yoshiyuki Tomino’s most well-known work, Mobile Suit Gundam, Ideon never got the same play that the Gundam franchise eventually got, although it is definitely something worthy of attention in its own right.Ideon takes place far in mankind’s future. Mankind has searched throughout the stars, finding many long dead alien civilizations. On the planet Solo, they find the sixth such civilization, which left behind various relics such as the three trucks that make...up the Ideon and a giant spaceship, incidentally called the Solo Ship. At the same time, humanoid aliens known as the Buff Clan suddenly appear. Karala Ajiba, daughter of the military commander of the Buff Clan, Doba Ajiba, heads down to the surface of Solo and in their pursuit to find her, a war between the earth settlers and the Buff Clan begins. Our heroes, led by Bes Jordan, and teenagers Cosmo Yuki and Kasha Imhof board the Solo Ship and head throughout the universe, under pursuit of the Buff Clan, who are seeking the power that the Ideon holds.The general plot of Ideon is very similar to Mobile Suit Gundam, which had come before it. Our hero’s settlement is destroyed by an attacking force, everyone boards a ship and escapes and is under constant pursuit throughout the series. Also like Gundam before it, the heroes in the show are principally civilians who need to learn how to cope with their circumstances. Although whereas Gundam is a war drama, Ideon has more similarities to their predecessors; it comes off more as a space opera-type show, and there are many giant robot show elements here including the three part main robot of the show, Ideon, and the alien enemy.At the same time, much like Gundam, Ideon is not the traditional robot show, in many ways. For starters, the show does not flinch in displaying death, often times gruesome ones at that. This isn’t the type of show where everyone gets to return from each mission alive. The humanity – Buff Clan interplay is an interesting one. Both races look identical and may even share a common root, but they get into a giant war with each other over a misunderstanding and their cultural differences are often unique. An early episode presents a great example; the heroes bring out a white flag, hoping for a cease-fire, but this makes the Buff Clan fight even more viciously as a white flag in their culture means fight to the death. This is also a show where there often isn’t that much hope for our heroes. They are under constant pursuit, and even when you expect they would get a warm welcome, they don’t. Having arguably the most powerful force in the universe is not all it is cracked up to be. The show also features an interesting mystery in the power source for the Ideon, the “Ide”. The Buff Clan have their own legend surrounding it, but there is a lot more to it than just that. What’s really behind the Ide is one of the more interesting parts of the show.Character-wise the show has its mix of both likable and unlikable characters. Cosmo, the main hero is a bit of a jerk, and if anything one may find it better to consider Bes and Karala the main characters as both are extremely likable. Kasha is a blood thirsty and aggressive girl, much like a certain red haired character from Evangelion, and similar to said character isn’t that likable either. Sheryl Formosa, a linguistic scholar (a rather unique profession for mecha anime, ain’t it?) plays another key role. On the Buff Clan side, the show unfortunately isn’t as strong as its predecessor, Gundam, in providing a lot of interesting, sympathetic characters, although there is at least a few of them worth sinking our teeth into, in particular Karala’s former fiancé, Gije Zaral, and her elder sister Harulu.The show shares several flaws from the era that this type of series were bound to have. The giant robot elements are in heavy force throughout much of the show. The Ideon is made up of three transforming trucks, and most episodes feature them fighting on their own before combining to win the day at the end. The show throws new Buff Clan military officer and heavy mobile mechas at us which go down in defeat, and their frequency just rises higher as the show reaches its climax. For a while pacing can be a concern; the first 10 episodes in particular are quite slow moving. Although the show’s plot does pick up considerably in the second half.One can’t review this TV series without bringing up the ending. While this show was originally intended to run a full year, it ended up getting cancelled after 39 episodes, featuring an extremely rushed ending. In fact the ending consists of a very brief, 1 or 2 minute scene at the end of the final episode which comes right in the middle of things and ends the show. A big disappointment if this was all we got. But the show did have its real ending eventually made, in the movie The Ideon: Be Invoked, which is a must watch if you want to see how this show really ends.While it has its flaws, Ideon is a very good mecha anime and I strongly recommend checking it out, especially so you can see its movie ending, which is one of anime’s best.

Although that’s a whole other review…', 'The 80’s started off with an interesting show when Sunrise themselves brought Ideon. Directed by Tomino himself after coming off Mobile Suit Gundam, Ideon has its’ ups and downs that has never been witnessed before. Just like Gundam, this anime did not have a good fan base inevitably causing the show to be prematurely cancelled before a proper ending could be made. If anyone has heard of Berserk or Evangelion having strange WTF endings, well, this anime invented it.The shortened 39 episode show starts out fine with setting a nice little universe and getting right into a war between two alien races (Buff Clan and...humans) over an ancient civilization site the humans are excavating. The Buff Clan is in search of what they call “Ide” which is a source of infinite power. It just so happens that this excavation site of the humans found when migrating to this planet has a giant simplistic art mech. And quickly over a couple petty misunderstandings, a war breaks out and never looking back.The anime, after the good start, gets insufferably slow and uninteresting with little plot development, little character development, and a “monster-of-the-week” battle between the Buff Clan and the humans. Luckily, this is where the movie “A Contact” comes in. “A Contact” is a nice summarization of the show hitting every major character development and plot movement... well, almost. It is missing a key interaction between the pilot of the Ideon and an Earth girl (Ep 23-25). However, even without this, A Contact is an excellent representation of the series and well executed to keep the viewer interested in discovering the Ide and wondering how these two alien races will interact as the plot progresses.Moving onto the second movie, “Be Invoked,” is the conclusion the series never had. And, boy is this epic... everything! Both movies have slightly upgraded animation compared to the series, an excellent full orchestra soundtrack leading every battle encounter, and even a choir to really boost the death scenes. Oh, there is death unlike anything encountered in anime pre-1980. Decapitation, multiple shots to the face, and many more that will leave the viewer shocked while watching Ideon. Nobody is safe in this anime, much like Knights of Sidonia of today. Unlike Sidonia, Ideon is a pleasure to look at in all of the mecha and space station detail that just is not seen anymore. Be Invoked is pretty much a non-stop edge of your seat battle sequence that wraps up everything fairly nicely, as strange as it is.A great way to watch Space Runaway Ideon is to watch movie one “A Contact”, followed by episodes 23-25, 34-38 from the show, and wrap it all up with “Be Invoked.” If this format is followed, I am sure the experience will be fantastic. Without the guide, the show is slow and uninteresting with only the movie ending of “Be Invoked” to be its saving grace. humans) over an ancient civilization site the humans are excavating.

I felt excited to find out what was going to happen next. Unfortunately, after only a few episodes the anime stopped being interesting because instead of building on the ideas that were introduced at the beginning of the show it became boring and the plot started to barely move forward at all and nothing interesting happened. It became repetitive and each episode was basically just about that single episode on its own without contributing almost anything to the overall plot.So it became a repetitive anime where each...episode felt just like the one before it and almost nothing interesting happened. I was about to stop watching this anime but then I read some reviews that said that it gets better after episode 20 so I kept on watching.  After around episode 20 some new things were introduced, however, it did not stop being repetitive. The new ideas that were introduced were barely explored and the show just kept on being repetitive and every episode still felt very boring.The ending was rushed and did not really explain anything. They later made a movie to fix the ending and although the ending in the movie was better, it was not even that good. episode felt just like the one before it and almost nothing interesting happened.

Whereas Gundam took the time to explore its world and offered enough fleshing out of both the Federation and Zeon...factions to show both had their morally grey areas, the same can\'t really be said for Ideon to a good extent. While a number of the human characters do get some fleshing out like Cosmo and Bes, nearly all members of the Buff Clan remain as two-dimensional characters in conflict with the human crew of the Ideon. Also, the series mostly focuses on the Ideon crew\'s conflict with the Buff Clan, with the latter continually spawning ""mecha of the day"" plots to attempt getting the Ideon in their possession and killing its human crew. Not helping matters is that it does take the series nearly a dozen episodes to start picking up steam with offering up some story development.And said story development does gradually start to deliver if you can survive past Ideon\'s earlier episodes. Later episodes of the series offer some interesting twists in the anime\'s story as the Ideon\'s crew start to learn more about the mecha\'s mysterious origins and question the very force that empowers it. Some solid character development is offered with the character of Karala, a Buff Clan member who defects from her race to join the human Ideon crew and develops a relationship with Bes. Also, the anime tosses in some twists to the ""robot of the day"" formula for later episodes when the Ideon crew also have to evade apprehension from human military forces who want to claim Ideon\'s power for themselves or assume the crew is in league with the Buff Clan. Still, this doesn\'t stop the formulaic plot setup and largely shallow members of the Buff Clan from rearing their heads throughout Ideon\'s run and the anime is also left abruptly unresolved during a major point in the anime\'s plot thanks to the series abruptly being cancelled during the time it aired. However, this issue would be resolved a year later with the release of Ideon\'s film sequel, Be Invoked.Visually, Ideon hasn\'t aged all that well. The character designs are a product of their time with the seemingly disco vibe that many characters sport with their appearance like Cosmo\'s afro and the Buff Clan\'s clothing looking like anything you may seen worn in retro sci-fi titles like The Jetsons and Flash Gordon. The animation quality can vary from looking terrible to decent during battle scenes, which are mostly not too spectacular to see for their choreography due to how slow and played out they are.Overall, I suppose my reception to Ideon is mixed. While touches of Tomino\'s story direction are on display in later episodes to make the series somewhat engaging, its flaws still stick out like a sore thumb compared to other mecha titles of the time period he directed like Gundam and Aura Battle Dunbine. Still as I hear Be Invoked is what is Ideon\'s most memorable use of Tomino\'s ""Kill Em All"" moniker, I suppose I\'ll be continuing my viewing of Ideon by checking out the film. factions to show both had their morally grey areas, the same can\'t really be said for Ideon to a good extent.

Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam was on it\'s way. The history of anime demands that the viewers acknowledge that a fearsome roar cried out from far away in the distance of space between their releases. Space Runaway Ideon is one of the most terrifying pieces of fiction I\'ve come to know, and another work of Tomino. The opening, as iconic and upbeat as it is, was already warning the viewers about it. There was no way for me to understand until ""Be Invoked"" grabbed me by my emotions and scarred me with it\'s brutality. I couldn\'t...help but constantly cry, gasp out of shock, and hold my face out of terror. Still, There is a beauty to this story just as much as there is horror to it. In the 90s, and as an influential and important work, Ideon were the hands that helped mold what became Neon Genesis Evangelion.Based on the way this story folds out, it wouldn\'t surprise if this was a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam. Many of the characters here mirror others. There are the very similar relations between Cosmo and Amurou, and Bright and Bes, for example.The story involves a group of humans who find a red giant robot and ship underground and take refuge in them. They were made by an intelligent ancient civilization that died out after its creation. Suddenly they get attacked by aliens in a misunderstanding, and the struggle begins. it was the struggle to control the mysterious power of the Ide, and yet they were all playing into it\'s own hands instead. As the crew of the Solo Ship and Ideon try and figure out how it\'s mysterious powers function, they are forced to flee from the Buff Clan in a never-ending game of cat and mouse where time and supplies are running out. As they battle, the Ideon begins awakening its true powers, and it\'s a sight to see how it can cause multi universal destruction. But for the crew on board, they begin to feel frightened of it. It\'s a power that they cannot only not control, but is appearing to look more and more frightening and undesirable to have.This series does not slow down. Past the half way mark, it only accelerates and doesn\'t slow down in quality. It did rush at the end because it got canceled, but more than made up for it in the end with the movie sequel. The ending here is abrupt and weird enough, but doesn\'t spoil anything for the horrific but beautiful experience that is The Ideon: Be Invoked.The entire cast features great and memorable characters. Many viewers did get annoyed with Lou at first and the constant crying, though later one can\'t help but feel bad and sympathize for the baby and what he has to see.The Ideon is a frightening giant robot. Sentient and all powerful, it posses infinite power but is difficult to understand and control. Ultimately, it\'s an apocalyptic peacemaker that sometimes acts like a mother, mirroring the Evas from Evangelion, and demands that resolve takes place for conflicts between intelligent life. It feels for the life around it, as it can be angered and roars from the killing of innocent animals and people. It is a protector of the pure and just. If upset, it can unleash enough power to slice a planet in half or shift reality itself.

It\'s a legendary soundtrack with many militaristic and guitar solo infused tracks that remind me of original Star Fox\'s soundtrack. As the Buff Clan and the Solo ship move out and Ideon begins to dock, the drums start rolling, the trumpets yell out for the battle to start again and help uplift with perfect execution.

For who does the Ideon decide is worthy? help but constantly cry, gasp out of shock, and hold my face out of terror. Still, There is a beauty to this story just as much as there is horror to it. In the 90s, and as an influential and important work, Ideon were the hands that helped mold what became Neon Genesis Evangelion.Based on the way this story folds out, it wouldn\'t surprise if this was a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam. Many of the characters here mirror others. There are the very similar relations between Cosmo and Amurou, and Bright and Bes, for example.The story involves a group of humans who find a red giant robot and ship underground and take refuge in them. They were made by an intelligent ancient civilization that died out after its creation. Suddenly they get attacked by aliens in a misunderstanding, and the struggle begins. it was the struggle to control the mysterious power of the Ide, and yet they were all playing into it\'s own hands instead. As the crew of the Solo Ship and Ideon try and figure out how it\'s mysterious powers function, they are forced to flee from the Buff Clan in a never-ending game of cat and mouse where time and supplies are running out. As they battle, the Ideon begins awakening its true powers, and it\'s a sight to see how it can cause multi universal destruction. But for the crew on board, they begin to feel frightened of it. It\'s a power that they cannot only not control, but is appearing to look more and more frightening and undesirable to have.This series does not slow down. Past the half way mark, it only accelerates and doesn\'t slow down in quality. It did rush at the end because it got canceled, but more than made up for it in the end with the movie sequel. The ending here is abrupt and weird enough, but doesn\'t spoil anything for the horrific but beautiful experience that is The Ideon: Be Invoked.The entire cast features great and memorable characters. Many viewers did get annoyed with Lou at first and the constant crying, though later one can\'t help but feel bad and sympathize for the baby and what he has to see.The Ideon is a frightening giant robot. Sentient and all powerful, it posses infinite power but is difficult to understand and control. Ultimately, it\'s an apocalyptic peacemaker that sometimes acts like a mother, mirroring the Evas from Evangelion, and demands that resolve takes place for conflicts between intelligent life. It feels for the life around it, as it can be angered and roars from the killing of innocent animals and people. It is a protector of the pure and just. If upset, it can unleash enough power to slice a planet in half or shift reality itself.

Dragon Ball Z Movie 05: Tobikkiri no Saikyou tai Saikyou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/898/Dragon_Ball_Z_Movie_05__Tobikkiri_no_Saikyou_tai_Saikyou,"[""''Let him clean up his own mess, You have a lot to learn brother''.- CoolerThis Movie like a lot of the other dbz films is a very simple yet a fun typical45 minute film to watch. As the name suggest Cooler's Revenge is about Goku facing off against 1 of the major antagonist Frieza - To be precise his older brother Cooler who wants to take his vengeance out on goku for what happen to frieza.The prologue starts of during the demise of goku's former Saiyan home world planet Vegeta's being destroyed by frieza, Overlooking the destruction in his spaceship along with his crew...finding out that 1 of the spaceship getting away from the planet is heading to earth cooler delays the order and decides to let it go.A few decades later Cooler Hears of frieza being defeated by goku that transform into a super saiyan. Cooler while annoyed by frieza's defeat,He and his crew head to earth to kill goku and to avenge his younger brother's death and to restore his own family name to be feared in the universe once again. As you can see with most Dbz films the premise of its story is basic and of course easy to watch.Cooler is Honestly without a doubt my favourite movie villain in the Db franchise I mean his name says it all, he is arrogant, remorseless and condescending not to mention he pretty much hates his brother frieza and the saiyans. He also exercises a greater control of power compare to that of frieza which makes him a dangerous foe for goku to fight against on this occasion. Cooler's Armoured squad are a blatant rip off of the Ginyu force and other nothing special.The other characters are pretty much the same in the movie like the other movies as well as Piccolo who makes his role in the film in such a Badass way! The fight between goku and cooler was just unforgettable from cooler's Epic! Transformation which we find out is a transformation beyond that of frieza final transformation and of course it proves how deadly he can be in that form when he fights against goku which overwhelms goku like with frieza upper hand against him on namek in the series.The music is fine but I like the songs more for the dub's US music score as it included some great heavy metal bands for the more intense action scenes. both sub and dub is good especially cooler's english voice actorAndrew Chandler suited his role nicely as the villain.Of course animation was the standard pretty much for its time and actually is okay.overall quite an enjoyable simplistic film to say the least which I could only wish that cooler wasn't just a movie character but a character that was actually relevant within the series as well.7 out of 10. finding out that 1 of the spaceship getting away from the planet is heading to earth cooler delays the order and decides to let it go.A few decades later Cooler Hears of frieza being defeated by goku that transform into a super saiyan.

But, do the movies hold up as well as the TV Show did? I recently watched Dragonball Z-Cooler's Revenge, and thought why not write a review on it. Basically the movie is short and simplistic (which kind of disappointed me a lot).Story- (7/10) As I said before, the story is simplistic. To tell the truth, there are not even 10 characters in this movie. And the main character, which we all know is Goku, is hurt half the movie. So, yeah, that was kind of disappointing.Art- (7/10)...Dragonball Z art is nothing really special (but today the art is really good). This movie was made back in the early 90s, so the art doesn't hold up as well. But, if you are a true Dragonball Z fan, you'll enjoy this movie.Sound- (8/10) The sound for this movie was very good. I'm still wondering why they use heavy rock for the U.S. version of this movie. To me, it sounds better than the Japanese 2.0 mono. But if you don't like the 2.0 mono, there is also a Japanese 5.1 stereo and also English 5.1 stereo. (I know these are the tracks on the DVD's, not sure about the Blu-Ray's though)Character- (8/10) It's Dragonball Z. C'mon. They're all the same characters we know and love. But there is one character that did an amazing job. And that is Cooler. Andrew Chandler (who is Cooler), does an amazing job playing this role. I'm surprised he isn't in more anime, or voice over casts for that matter. Dude did an amazing job.Enjoyment- (8/10) Truth be told, being a Dragonball Z fan, I love anything from the franchise. But, if I have to look at this from a serious perspective, it's not all that great.Overall- (7/10) Bottomline, this movie is good. Not great, but just good. If you like Dragonball Z, go watch this movie. Even buy it on DVD. It's like 4 bucks for the original release. Even  if you don't like DBZ, this is a good movie to watch.

It can never be accused of innovation, which brings us to the fifth movie in the copy and paste line up, Cooler's Revenge. This is not a movie that I could recommend to someone new to the franchise at all. This is definitely either for fans or those who are familiar with the main story. Before coming into this series, it would be a great idea to see the series up until the Frieza Saga for some type of clue; but the...crazy thing is, this story doesn't exactly fall into continuity. I've noticed fans mention that this story could have taken place between the Trunks Saga and the Androids Saga, however, I don't exactly buy into that.The plot follows Goku's son Gohan, as he attempts to save Goku's life by recovering the Senszu beans. Goku was viciously injured by one of Cooler's attacks, and is now kept hidden by Krillin from Cooler's forces whom are demolishing the forest in their search for all of them.The production values deserves some credit. Visually, it's pretty good with some very nice backgrounds; the waterfalls look nice, and the night time setting has some gorgeous moments. There's also some decent moments here and there with the action, which consist of a decent amount of hand to hand and high energy attacks. However, it's Funimation's soundtrack that really stands out in the style department. The BGM consists of high tempo rock songs by Drowning Pool, Deftones, Breaking Point, and a few others. The music simply rocks covering up the bigger weaknesses.Dragonball Z is something that is mainly action-driven, but I kind of found the action to be sort of lacking a little. The best scenes took place during the middle portion when Piccolo was battling Cooler's men. After that, the final battle scene just took a dive. The plot really isn't well paced, and it spins its wheels at times. In addition, you're not going to get much character development, and the villains are all cookie cutter to the extreme with no depth whatsoever. I would probably have enjoyed this more if the ending had not felt like one big jip. It felt way too gimmicky and terribly tacked on, which is something that becomes a trend in the later movies.Cooler's Revenge actually goes by quicker than its run time states. This is mainly due to the sound track which seriously rules, and makes this movie extremely easy to get through.  I do not recommend this to anyone besides diehard DBZ fans though. To my experience, they're the only ones who truly love it.Highs: Soundtrack and production valuesLows: Weak first and final acts, stock bad guys crazy thing is, this story doesn't exactly fall into continuity.

Despite the short length, the movie really takes full advantage of each second to give us...enough time to get to know the characters and their personality. Cooler\'s henchmen are the equivalent of the Ginyu Force and have some very entertaining interactions with each other and the main cast. They have unique manners and techniques from each others which is why they are more memorable compared your average Dragon Ball henchmen. They show individuality unlike other\'s that are either reactive or do things as ordered.The final confrontation against Cooler is set up well too since Goku lost the first encounter and needed to recover until about half of the movie runtime.Cooler is one of the most interesting antagonist and with his personality being superior to Frieza. While Frieza\'s selling point was his sheer existence nobody can defy, not even gods, Cooler has the family integrity in mind. In the past, he noticed Frieza letting a Saiyan escape refusing to take care of it himself and predicting that this mistake will be Frieza\'s downfall.He is known to analyse the situation showing he is more than just powerful. He noticed that Goku was able to survive his first confrontation and acknowledges the Saiyan\'s strength being capable to kill his brother.Cooler also shows assisting his henchmen on various occasion instead of letting them do something and die because they were too weak. And Cooler is one of few characters you can argue deserved the power he has because he is related to Frieza while Frieza was just an overpowered villain pulled out Toriyama\'s ass without any build up. Something Toriyama and Toei are known for normally.Cooler\'s defeat was also one of the best defeats in the franchise to the point it was replicated many times but non worked as well as in this movie. The poetic irony that he acknowledges a fatal mistake he made as his final moment and not having the right to criticize Frieza for his mistakes.It is the first DBZ movie that features the real Super Saiyan and probably has the best use of it. As it appears as a mystical form that appears in times of despair. Not feeling like just another power up that increases your power by 50 times or something. It became a state that overcomes any hardship presented to it. Unlike what it honestly doing right now.Criticism that no longer hold ups. This is something I want to mention. And it is about transforming villains. Frieza\'s first to third form are means to restrict his powers and destructive capabilities. So 4th form Frieza and final form is Frieza\'s true form. While Cooler was always in his ""true form"" that should be his final form, but he has a transformation that exist to increase his power. Back in the day it seemed like the writers had no idea how Frieza\'s forms work and brought confusion to the fanbase. But with the awful Revival of F movie this criticism no longer hold up since Frieza can now also transform like a Super Saiyan to get stronger instead of restraining himself.Actual criticism. That is the strength of Cooler compared to Frieza. It may be a dub error but many are confused who truly is stronger between Cooler and Frieza, even King Cold. As Dragon Ball Multiverse would show if you read that by any chance (not recommended tho). So many believed Cooler to be stronger in the past, while now everyone believes Frieza was always stronger (excluding the awful Revival of F movie).There is also a question regarding believability regarding Cooler\'s henchmens power since they seemed stronger than First Form Frieza. But that can be argued around with Cooler perhaps training them.If you haven\'t seen this movie and believe you are a big Dragon Ball fan, you should check it out.

You won\'t be disappointed.', 'This is one of my top ten dragonball z movies. this one was great, it had a great plot and cooler is definitely one of my favorite dragon ball z villians of all time, even though he is not officially a canon character. I just remember how excited I was as a kid finding out that frieza had an older brother, which made me very excited about the movie when it came on cartoon network. I am still to this day very impressed with the movies english soundtrack and great fight scenes. This was definitely the best of the first five movies. ', 'Before I get into this, the version I watched was the edited American release. So any scenes cut that affect the score will not be counted.Story: The story is what it needs to be for a DBZ film. Most of it is handled in little chunks just so they can hurry up and start fighting, which starts about 9 and a half minutes in. Granted, this low level of storytelling wouldn\'t really work for other animes or any other movies, but this is DBZ and the biggest reason anyone watches it is for the fighting, not so much the storytelling. However, I did like how...they tied it in with the show instead of just saying ""Hey, at some point in the story, this stuff happens. We don\'t know when, but by looking at the characters, you can probably guess"". It\'s pretty easy to point out that this most likely takes place during that large time gap between Goku\'s arrival back on Earth and the androids first appearance. While this is a movie, and thus not canon, it can work fit itself in rather well without screwing up too much of the timeline, unless I\'m forgetting something. However, characters do still seem to pop up out of nowhere when the writers can\'t find any other solution to a problem, but I guess that\'s what\'s to be expected of the DBZ movies.Art: The artwork isn\'t necessarily anything spectacular. It\'s not anymore detailed than the artwork of the show, but that\'s not a bad thing. The artwork of the show is pretty good and the design of Cooler is interesting, especially his transformation.Sound: As expected from a DBZ movie, the music is amazing. While it\'s still random rock music that most likely don\'t sing about anything going on, it still gets your blood pumping for the fights. As for voice acting, everyone sounds good, although Salza\'s extremely heavy French accent can be annoying for some.Character: I\'ll skip over the good guys since there\'s no real reason to discuss them for this review (I\'ll save that for my review of the series if I ever get around to finishing it). Instead, I\'ll focus on the villains. Cooler\'s minions really are just the Ginyu Force\'s hand-me-downs, right down to their intro poses. Cooler does make up for this since he\'s actually one of the best villains I can think of for the series. Instead of wanting to kill Goku because of how much he cared for his brother, he just wants to keep his family\'s name from being ruined. He doesn\'t care about Frieza at all. I wish they would have had an arc about him in the show. Cooler definitely deserves one more than Garlic Jr.Enjoyment: Taking it as a DBZ film and then comparing it to other films in the series, this is most likely one of the better ones. Granted I haven\'t seen all of the films in the franchise and there is at least one other DBZ film that I enjoy more than this, but this is a really good one. they tied it in with the show instead of just saying ""Hey, at some point in the story, this stuff happens.

At the start, of the movie he criticized Frieza for letting that Saiyan go and it would bite him in the ass.So there is some maturity in this character and I like it. He is more than just another strong opponent. He has the features of an older brother were you can see he has gained life experience and in how he talks to his underlings.What I like about Cooler's troops is they have individual personality. They aren't controlled by fear like Frieza's soldiers were, parody villains like...the Ginyu Force nor are they mindless followers awaiting orders.

Cooler and his gang are just a copypaste version of Frieza and his gang, and the entire story plays out as a low-stakes remake in a way... but with none of the tension because there\'s not much going on except for this purple dude who wants to beat up some monkey dudes.This is sad, too, because this is technically the first Dragon Ball Z movie that could feasibly fit into a part of the timeline-- it works neatly as a side story in that three-year time gap where everyone\'s training and not much exciting happens. The story is...wrapped around so tightly that it has zero ramifications for any other part of the story, so it actually works. Why only technically? Because for some reason, the entire cast is like 10% as powerful as they normally are; even in Super Sayian form, Goku is noticeably not as ""blow up some mountains and then decimate the planet"" as normal, and everyone takes Cooler as a huge threat but he appears to be significantly weaker than Frieza.But... I\'m probably judging it too harshly because I\'m still desperately waiting for another enjoyable Dead Zone movie and none of these are stacking up.

This movie is non-canon, meaning it's anime original, and Cooler doesn't appear in DB manga.Let's get into the review.My Positives:1, DBZ art style and music coat.2, Good fighting sequences3, Goku's and Cooler fight is goodMy Negatives:1, Being a brother of the arguably best villain in the DB universe gives quite the anticipation. Cooler doesn't live up to it. He's a more composed and calculated version of Frieza, but in every...other aspect, he falls below his brother. 48-minute movie cannot possibly create a villain that would rival Frieza. He's there only to give Goku a good fight and to give us some Frieza vibes.2, Gohan: His purpose in Revenge of Cooler is to act stupid, so Goku gets wounded to prolong this movie length.In my opinion, Revenge of Cooler has really good fighting scenes (mainly, because the majority of them were used in DBZ), but its story and characters entertainment are mediocre.I give it 6/10. I don't dislike this Revenge of Cooler, I think it's a mediocre movie. I can recommend you to try this movie at least once, but I cannot tell that you'll like Revenge of Cooler. other aspect, he falls below his brother. 48-minute movie cannot possibly create a villain that would rival Frieza.

I can recommend you to try this movie at least once, but I cannot tell that you'll like Revenge of Cooler."", 'While some have rightly criticized this outing as being a rehash of the big story beats from the Frieza saga, Cooler\'s Revenge is an enjoyable addition to the DBZ universe not because it\'s reinventing the wheel in terms of story structure (the story structure is very derivative, but this is Dragon Ball, it always has been), but because it is kinetic, entertaining, and distills the appeal of DBZ into a short 50 minute runtime.I should mention that I am mainly reviewing the english dub version of this movie that was released by Funimation in 2003. 2003 was the year I really got into Dragon...Ball and this story was one of the reasons why, so I can\'t be objective in any way regarding this review. But then again, none of us are really objective and there is no way for me to separate my subjective individual experiences. But I found this entertaining and I\'ll tell you why.I actually like the rock music included in some of the DBZ movies like Lord Slug, the first Broly movie, and this. I unironically like it, it\'s energizing and makes the fight scenes more exciting even if it is out of place and distracting in some instances. The bad far outweighs the good. And I like the original Japanese score too, but I don\'t find it insulting for the rock music to be added in, I think it\'s cool.Cooler himself is literally a cooler version of Frieza in the way that older brothers tend to seem cooler than their younger siblings. Through very limited screentime, we learn enough about Cooler to the point that he is distinctly characterized from Frieza. He is more efficient than Frieza. He is more active in his pursuits than Frieza, who delegates to his detriment. He is less vicious towards his henchmen. He is more brutal in the way he fights, and does not toy with his enemies as Frieza does. And yet, he is ruled by insecurity and constantly compares himself to Frieza out of residual fear since Frieza was stronger than him for so long. Cooler is also acting out of a twister sense of the ""warrior\'s code"" and feels that he must enact vengeance on Goku out of obligation, even though he has no love for Frieza. Cooler is a cool character, he just is.Goku\'s SSJ transformation has immense gravitas. He only resorts to it when he is truly pushed to his limits, and the transformation scene itself is scored very well in both the Japanese version and the English dub, which uses Deftones\' song, ""Change in the House of Flies"" to great effect. Goku\'s personality is written well, and the way he transitions from his usual kind, goofy self to the avenging angel that is the Super Saiyan is totally badass. When he pushes back the supernova, it\'s a great moment because Cooler is making SSJ Goku really dig deep, it makes them both look strong. The fight in general is really well done despite being short. Thank god they finally got away from ending every fight with the spirit bomb, they overuse that to hell in these movies.Piccolo gets a lot of shine in the movie as he shows off his ingenuity and ruthlessness against Cooler\'s henchmen. He prevails against them as much because of his wits as well as his raw power. This movie demonstrates that aspect of Piccolo\'s character better than any other instance in the Dragon Ball series, even the original manga.My only real complaints are that Gohan and Krillin really have nothing to do. Krillin gets the shaft in this movie so badly, he doesn\'t even get to pick up the beans. Also that dragon, Icarus, it irritates me. I don\'t know why, it\'s just so superfluous. Why did they even add Icarus to the filler arcs...I don\'t get it.Anyways, this movie is entertaining and if you like Dragon Ball it\'s worth your time. Ball and this story was one of the reasons why, so I can\'t be objective in any way regarding this review.

The squadron has simple designs, and apart from Salza, who can have good fights with the warriors.Cooler's personality fits perfectly with him, as he is ruthless, cold, and doesn't even care about his brother's death, prioritizing the restoration of the family's honor. He is already in his fourth form and doesn't use additional forms to limit his power compared to his brother Freeza.The scene...where Salza punches Goku, and Goku feels nothing, punching back, serves as a good introduction to the final and anticipated fight.After a while fighting Cooler, Cooler finally transforms into his final form, which is well-built and cool, resembling a war machine. And here's the problem: Goku, despite having Super Saiyan (SSJ), uses the Kaioken against Cooler, who sweeps the floor with Goku.Goku only uses SSJ at the end, and after a few punches and a Kamehameha towards Cooler's power ball, the villain is easily defeated and sent into space.This movie would be a thousand times better if SSJ were used throughout the fight, creating a wild battle between Cooler and Goku, similar to what happened on Namek.It's nonsensical for the protagonist and the creators of the film to use the Kaioken against a powerful enemy when SSJ was available, especially considering that the Kaioken didn't even last against Freeza in his fourth form, not to mention its negative effects.The animation is the same, and the ending music is good.The destruction of the scenery is very well done.It's a shame that all of this was poorly implemented. where Salza punches Goku, and Goku feels nothing, punching back, serves as a good introduction to the final and anticipated fight.After a while fighting Cooler, Cooler finally transforms into his final form, which is well-built and cool, resembling a war machine.

Digimon X-Evolution,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2123/Digimon_X-Evolution,"['Digimon movies are usually related to the series, however this movie is the exception. It has no relationship with the  anime series but a remake of the manga Digimon Chronicle, only without involving human in the story, also comes in full 3D CG. Even the story has no interaction of human world. Usually a normal digimon fan will say ""No human? That\'s boring man..""But I don\'t think so, digimon is sometimes better without human, so we can only focus with the story and characterization of the digimon, also how they face such a thing..The background story is about the digital world, where digimon lives...in it is experiencing a serious chaos. Unlike other series, while the chaos of other digimon series (except Tamers) involves about darkness invasion or evil swarm, this series has no dark or evil related things. The chaos is about the overpopulation of digital world, which the host computer, Yggdrasil can\'t handle and thus it executes the X Program in order to make only some of chosen digimon will be survived in the end of execution, named Project Ark.Maybe there will be many questions we want to know. We will perhaps ask: ""What\'s the purpose of Project Ark?"" ""Why Yggdrasil dares to do such a thing? Doesn\'t it really care about the life of a lot of digimon out there? It\'s a host computer a.k.a. God of Digital World."" We would expect in the first that: ""Yggdrasil is so evil of doing such of things. It doesn\'t care about others\' life..""But who knows? We\'ll see it then...Now we go to the story progress.. This movie tells a story about Dorumon, a digimon that owns X-Antibody naturally being hunted by Leomon who eventually died bcos he didn\'t dare to kill such an innocent Child level digimon, asking Dorumon to live for him later before he died. And then being rejected by 3 Mushmons saying that Dorumon is the one who will bring destruction  just like another X-Antibody digimon because he had a red ruby on his forehead, explaining that Dorumon is the personification of the launching of the X Program. Meanwhile, Royal Knights, which are responsible for the execution of Project Ark, began to do that task. However, debate came between 2 of the Royal Knights, Dukemon and Omegamon. Dukemon, on the other hand, refuse to do the task because he seems that the Project Ark is something wrong. Even the Project Ark eventually came to the second level, to destroy everything including all digimon.We might also ask: ""Omegamon, one of Royal Knights want to kill a lot of digimon? That\'s crazy! Where is his proud of being guardian of digital world? What an evil motive..""Is that so? I doubt it..Now we go to the characterization progress and development.. Dorumon is the main protagonist of this movie. He\'s just an innocent Child digimon who always questioning about what\'s his purpose of being live. He often got into danger thanks to the execution of Project Ark. He can\'t bear his sadness seeing many digimon died for surviving, even some of them died for him. He later thought that his existence is just bringing chaos to other digimon, and also thinking that his existence is not needed in this world. Nevertheless, he later began matured as the story progresses. He\'s not the typical shounen MC who finished everything with only his own power and being the leader of the comrade, also he\'s not the only one that the story only focused in. The Royal Knights also had a lot of characterization as the story progresses. The knights aren\'t truly evil, no, they\'re not evil at all. They\'re just in dilemma, whether to obey their master or to struggle for the existence of everything, they must be facing the most difficult situation. They were later thinking about what they have done before and began to find the answer of Yggdrasil.So, is Yggdrasil that evil? Does it really want to end the digimon life cycle? No, Yggdrasil was just in desperation. Why it really dare to do such a thing? Why was it desperate about it? The answer is really, really simple. Because Yggdrasil only wants to \'LIVE\'.. So simple right? That\'s what I really like about this movie. They\'re facing a very difficult situation, but the reason of the difficult situation was really simple. That\'s why it became the theme of this movie. [ Subete no Inochi wa Ikiru Tame ni Aru ], meaning ""Life exists for living."" Even they said this sentence in the end of the movie.The theme is really simple, but if you understand it deeper, you\'ll find how beautiful the sentence is. Even I think that the sentence actually wants to tell you some values of life.Well, we usually see someone being desperate of such a thing and eventually ended up suicide. They didn\'t find their purpose of life so that they thought being dead was better. Dude, even in this movie, all digimon were struggling with all their might in order to live although for just a second.We even usually see many people killed or enslaved something with life (animals) for no apparent reason and without mercy. They just want to do for their own sake without concerning others\' life. That\'s why I think the writers concerned about those situations so they want to share their thoughts with this movie.This is not an ordinary digimon movie, this is a movie that tells you the values of life.I have no comment about the sound and graphic, it\'s just as awesome as they are.. Well, it\'s a 2005 film after all, so with that graphic and sound, it\'s more than great.I hope this review will be useful for you all and I highly recommend it for loyal Digimon fans.I\'m a digimon fan indeed, but I won\'t always say that all digimon series are the best. No, I\'m not a digifag.. I just found this digimon movie being different comparing to other series and it had something very special in it. in it is experiencing a serious chaos.

No, I\'m not a digifag.. I just found this digimon movie being different comparing to other series and it had something very special in it.', 'Every Digimon season has one or more short films that serve to tell something that didn’t fit anywhere into the original. However, Digimon X – Evolution is a self-standing film of film length that has a story and world of its own. It doesn’t depend on popularity of anything as it creates something completely new. The question is, does it need other series to look appealing or can it truly stand on its own?Probably the first thing any Digimon fan is going to notice is the lack of human characters and complete focus on the Digimon and the Digital World. This is further emphasised by...using CGI for animation. This setting will either chase Digimon fans away or pull them in depending on whether they watched Digimon series for human characters or for the world itself. I was really happy when I found out that this was only about Digimon because it’s something that hadn’t been explored before.Like I wrote before, the story is completely set in the Digital World. However, the Digital World is close to destruction. The main problem is that it got overpopulated as thus the host computer, Yggdrasil, decided to let only the chosen few live. The Royal Knights, protectors of Yggdrasil and the strongest Digimon in existence, are to execute that task. So begins the hunt of Digimon by Digimon and complete chaos ensues. The film doesn’t even try to go lightly about it and the ugliness of strong fighting the weakest is fully shown. In comes our lead, Dorumon, that doesn’t remember anything and his goal is both finding his purpose and surviving. However, soon its discovered that Yggdrasil’s plan isn’t exactly the same as he told his Royal Knights and they face a difficult decision, to stay by their master and watch the death of many Digimon or to protect those, that are helpless and oppose the one they swore their loyalty to.We are watching the growth of Dorumon, not only evolution wise but also nature wise and maturity wise. While not being exactly an action anime lead, Dorumon is rather weak and helpless, what is something even he acknowledges, he has a very realistic character. His only goal is his survival and survival of his friends but he get swept into hell very fast. He is never black or white and never tries to have moral upper hand. The Royal Knights aren’t exactly villains either. They face very difficult decisions and each of them solves it differently. Every character has their own nature, both good and bad sides and the also make bad and good decisions. No character is what they seem at first sight.Animation is very fluent and for CGI truly amazing even though I generally hate it. To me it made the atmosphere much better because it really gave me the feeling like it was happening inside of a computer. And at times it made me wonder whether a computer should really have the right to control the lives of living beings. That’s one of the things I really liked about this film. While it rises very philosophical questions for a Digimon film it never asks them directly but rather shows them to you.The only real problem I had with this film was that the setting was very complicated and since we were thrown right into the middle along with Dorumon, there was never time for explaining things in depth. Most of the situation had to be deduced by what was going on. That isn’t a generally bad thing but in an action film full of stuff happening left and right it was changing too fast to keep track of it. Generally, I’d say that enjoyment depends on what the idea of Digimon only film makes you feel. If it interests you, watch this.

Doubutsu no Mori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2950/Doubutsu_no_Mori,"[""My first review, please bear with me.I didn't even know there was an anime adaption of Animal Crossing before I came across it on this site. My first thought was, how could the make a movie out of a game that doesn't have a plot? But I was really interested, as I loved the game. Not sure what to expect, I watched it. And I was very surprised.Story ; 9/10The story centers around the main character, Ai, and how she adjusts to living in the animal village she just moved to. Again, I wasn't really expecting this to have a good plot, but it...did! (or at least in my eyes)Art ; 10/10The backgrounds were a tad simplistic, but the people and animals were adorable. Bouquet was so cute! The designs of the animals stayed very close to their game counter parts. The colors were fantastic; bright and colorful and fun to watch. Very smooth animation.Sound ; 8/10Just sound pulled from the game, but it was still nice. It worked well in the situations it was put in. Along with the bright colors it had a calm and almost peaceful effect.Character ; 10/10The characters were all very fun to watch; each had their own distinct personalities. Ai, the main protagonist of the story was very outgoing and determined to be successful in her new village. The other characters personalities also were very similar to the game.Enjoyment ; 10/10Although this movie was aimed more towards kids, I loved it! This was one of the those rare shows/movies that made me laugh and almost cry at some parts! It was well put together, and a very heart warming movie with a good message at the end.Overall ; 10/10Whether you liked the game or not, this movie will have you smiling through out the whole thing. did!

It dosn't matter if your a fan of the video games or if this is your first time seeing Animal Crossing; people are going to be watching through this till the very satisfying end. The story, altough at first dosn't really have a strong plot in the beginning, will make you stay on the edge of your seat and will be making you wonder what will happen next. The art is a bit toned down from most anime. It has a more kiddish feel to it, but it goes well with the anime in this case and it makes...it up with cute and adorable style. The music is really calming and relaxing and fans will hear many familar tunes from the game. It has a good amount of comedy in it. Weither it be Mr Resetti's attitude or Blathers rambling, people will get a good chuckle out of some parts of the anime.The reason that I liked Animal Crossing is that unlike most movies or animes, it really is faithful to the video game and has a story of it's own to keep it strong. It is really worth a watch and if you gather you friends to watch it, all the better. It has a good moral towards friendship, which I highly admire. If your out and about and looking for something cute with a bit of adventure in it, pick up Animal Crossing. You won't be dissapointed ^_^ it up with cute and adorable style.

You won't be dissapointed ^_^"", 'As a fan of the game Animal Crossing (both Gamecube and DS versions) I was pleasantly surprised to discover an anime adaptation had been made. If you haven&rsquo;t played the game, Animal Crossing is basically just living your life in a new town, but while you&rsquo;re a human, the other villagers are all other animals. It&rsquo;s a nice RPG slice-of-life, and it&rsquo;s very fun living your life in your town. This experience is different, obviously, considering you&rsquo;re watching the character living her life in a new town instead of being the character himself/herself.The main character&rsquo;s name is Ai, a magnanimous yet somewhat undecided girl...who comes to live in the village of animals, moving away from home. As she goes through her days in the new village, she meets new animals and opportunities arise from their influence on her, especially Sally, the fashion-designing elephant who shortly moves away to pursue her dream of becoming a fashion designer. But she inspires Ai to find her own dream, or, as the two playfully allegorized, her own cherry pie. She does find her ambition by the end of the movie, and also fits in a little more in the village by helping out with what occurred proving to be the mysterious &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; on the night of the Winter Festival. Because previously Ai had found bottles with notes explaining that if she planted a fir trees in certain spots, a wonderful miracle would happen on the Winter Festival night.While you&rsquo;re watching it, it&rsquo;s very relaxing and calming, much like its game counterpart. The art is absolutely adorable, keeping the style similar to the game. The colors are bright and the animation flow is fluid and rich; I love especially the beautifully rendered backgrounds. Everything was so nice to look at! I loved the music too, because it&rsquo;s all the same tunes as in the game, and if you play the game you&rsquo;ll recognize that immediately.One thing I didn&rsquo;t understand that some of the names were different than in the game. I suppose they were the original names in the Japanese, but then again, why would the English translation bother to change them if they were just names like &ldquo;Sally&rdquo; (or I should say Sari) or &ldquo;Bouquet&rdquo;? That has nothing to do with the enjoyment you get out of the movie.I really liked it overall; I guess the only thing that irked me was the whole bit concerning the notes and the UFOs. I would have rather if it was just a poignant but sweet story about finding your ambition and at the same time, maintaining a strong friendship. This is recommended if you like the game, or you just want something nearly saccharine to watch. who comes to live in the village of animals, moving away from home.

I\'m sure you all had different answers to that, but I\'ll bet none of you said Animal Crossing. And why should you? It\'s a repetitive game about collecting random rubbish with basically no story that many call ""slightly less boring than watching paint dry."" And yet, it has a film adaptation. I\'ve been thinking about checking it out for some time just out of curiosity and this seemed like a good time. So let\'s look at the Animal Crossing movie.The story opens with a young girl named Ai moving to the animal...village, pretty much exactly like the games. She introduces herself at the post office and heads to get her key from a massive tosser, Tom Nook. Who instantly put her to work without giving her much say in the matter, just like the games. Nice to see that he\'s still a giant wanker. We then spend the rest of the film watching Ai collect random rubbish, just like the games. Okay, that part\'s a lie. We actually follow Ai as she interacts with the folks in the village. She makes good friends with a cat named Bouquet and an elephant named Sally who dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Most of the film is just a slice of life look at their interactions with each other and several other colourful characters. It\'s all very simple, light-hearted and whimsical. Surprisingly, I don\'t really have anything to complain about storywise. Sure it\'s really simplistic, but it\'s also a kid\'s movie. The pacing is pretty well handled. There\'s always something happening, but it never feels overly hectic. The humorous elements work pretty well and the overall theme of finding yourself works effectively. The cherry pie metaphor that they use for the theme is silly, which adds to the whimsical nature of the film as a whole.The characters in this are pretty shallow, but they\'re mostly a lot of fun. Halberd and Yu\'s misadventures provide quite a bit of amusement. Kotobuki\'s re-election side plot has a lot of amusing moments. Ai\'s relationship with Sally and Bouquet is pretty well handled. The interactions between characters tend to be very lively.The art in this is actually pretty amazing. I\'m not a big fan of the art in the Animal Crossing games, but the translation into film is very vibrant. The characters look pretty much exactly like they do in the games. The flowers, fossils, and other various background features are amazingly detailed. The animation itself is very smooth and it all just looks really good.The voice acting is well handled. There are some really good actors in this like Kanai Mika, Yamaguchi Mitsuo, and Horie Yui. The entire cast does a good job with their roles. The only real weakness is K.K Slider\'s live performance. It sounds pretty much exactly like it does in the games. Like an overly-synthetic piece designed to empty a room.The yuri factor is a 1/10. It\'s Animal Crossing, what did you expect?And that was Animal Crossing, the film. I thought this was going to be a crappy tie-in film with lots to poke fun at, but there was a lot of effort put into this. It\'s almost like the production team said ""Yeah, this is an Animal Crossing movie but let\'s give it our all anyway."" It\'s a simple but highly entertaining piece that\'s sure to appeal to fans of the series, kids and people who can appreciate whimsy. For myself, I give it a 7/10. I find the whole thing rather charming and enjoyed it quite a bit more than the games themselves. village, pretty much exactly like the games.

Animal Crossing just melts the heart strings but also ...THIS IS THE GREATEST FAN DUB I have ever seen. When Nintendo of America say no just do it yourself and it works so well. I honestly don't know why Nintendo of America never dubbed this movie as it would obviously been great for bringing fans into the franchise. I understand some people prefer subs but as a child's movie a dub just makes sense. Plus listening and being able to focus on all the details the movie has to offer is really enjoyable.All thats left is to vote for...1. me the mayor 2. me the mayor 3. me the mayor or 4. me the mayor. #tortimerformayor 1. me the mayor 2. me the mayor 3. me the mayor or 4. me the mayor. #tortimerformayor"", ""For those of you who enjoyed the game, Animal Crossing was an interesting movie. It summarized the game fairly well, adding in different characters and giving Ai, the main character, a home to live in. It was a fun thing to watch. The animation was cute and the storyline similar to that of the games.One thing that I didn't like much about this was that it didn't have much of a plotline to go off of. Much like the game, you get a job and fix a house up and that's pretty much it. Where do you go with that in a movie? "", ""Really, you would think that there is not much to say about Animal Crossing, but that just is not the case with this movie.  It is simply wonderful when you watch it for what it is: Pure and simple enjoyment.  This movie captures all the best elements from the game (the character archetypes, events, chores, etc.) and puts them together seamlessly with a plot that, while certainly not Shakespeare, is certainly cute and simple but workable.  And the best part is that it never feels like this is trying to sell you something.  Did it make me want to play the...games again?  Surely.  Did it feel like I was watching an hour and a half commercial for a product?  Not in the least, and that was great.The animation is crisp, clean, bright, and fun.  It might not be amazingly detailed, but it follows the style of the games almost to the letter.  And while I could probably go on and a bit more about this movie, I'll just leave it at this.  Animal Crossing is a very fun, refreshing movie that allows even &quot;old folks&quot; like myself to just take a break and smile for a little while. games again?  Surely.

That is, things don\'t really happen for a reason, they just kind of happen at random and don\'t have any real point to them. This made the whole thing very difficult to sit through, and about 1/3 of the way through the movie I was already bored of it. They do try to spice it up here & there, having some adventure-themed moments, and trying to throw in a bit more plot by introducing some mysterious elements... but both of these still manage to come off as forced, and also somewhat uninteresting.The characters...tend to be the real focus of the whole thing, and they\'re lively and represented well. Many of your favorite characters from the game make cameo appearances, as one would expect, but there are also some original characters introduced, too. The original residents of the town all have specific personalities to them. Despite that, they don\'t actually have very much depth to them, but it works pretty well for the context of the setting, and mirrors how the residents in the game would act. However, in terms of characters, I thought the main-character, Ai, was just a very typical, bubbly, cute girl... and she didn\'t really appeal to me at all as a character. She was very uninteresting to watch on screen, and her motivations throughout the story were also not very interesting. Why they chose her as the main character, I\'ll never understand.The art captures the style of the game pretty well, but it doesn\'t end up looking all that splendid. The animation never ""wowed"" me, but it was certainly passable, and seems like it accomplished what it set out to do, despite being basic, and not very impressive.The soundtrack, on the other hand is fantastic! We get a bunch of arranged tracks from the game, as well as some original material, and it all blends together wonderfully, creating the exact kind of atmosphere you expect from Animal Crossing. I watched it in Japanese, and the voice acting is pretty well done, for the most part, but a few of the voices didn\'t seem to fit, and I thought Ai-chan\'s voice was a bit generic and annoying, as well.Animal Crossing started off as a fun little movie, but it quickly became boring, and difficult to sit through. Nothing really stood out as being interesting, and even when they threw in some exciting moments, it still managed to feel pretty tepid and unexciting. This mellow atmosphere suits Animal Crossing well, and it would have been fine in a shorter production... but I just feel like this movie is far too long, and would have been better served if it was only a half hour or so. On top of that, the art is somewhat average, making the whole thing feel really average. There\'s a few decent moments here & there, but I\'d definitely say my time would have been better spent elsewhere.Overall, I give Animal Crossing a 5/10. tend to be the real focus of the whole thing, and they\'re lively and represented well.

So I watched the movie and it was ok, I am not an Animal Crossing fan, but this movie is changing my mind a bit. Well, without further ado, lets get to the score.Story:The story pretty much follows the Animal Crossing one abit, and I liked how it turned out. Its pretty much about the main character, called Ai, and how she meets the neighbors and new friends, and gets to her new home. I give this a pretty 9.Art:The art was fantibulostic. Well, not that of the WOW! But to the animal Crossing style, it fits pretty well, and every character is pretty...well drawn.

So I'm not going low with this one, but there isn't much to say either. Here is a 9.Character:Perfect. Golden. Can't be touched. Every character acts the way he/she is supposed to and doesn't change through the entire movie. I couldn't see this movie any better if this was changed. Everything, some acted friendly, some acted weird, and some funny. There was a lot of variety! You know my score for this, if not, here is is: Golden 10.Enjoyment:I liked it. I wasn't expecting it to be like this and even bring me to play the game. Even though some of you find it boring, or that the main protagonist is a girl, I think otherwise. I'm not forcing you to see this movie, but this movie confirmed me the point that not all games have to be played to see a certain movie. This gets a well-deserved 10.Overall:Well to finish this, its a pretty cool movie I recommend watching, even though you haven't played the game.

I never liked her as a villager, and she's even more of a stuck-up jerk in this movie. Other than her, the rest of the characters are likable and fun. I loved how they portrayed Mr. Resetti especially.The artwork stands out as it is...consistent to the game's art style while also having a bit of flair. Everything just looks cute and colorful.Watching this again makes me feel that the series could lend itself well to an anime series or another OVA.

The music in the movie was great.It's not as amazing as the GOAT Ping Pong, but it is still a fantastic movie I would recommend.8/10 All my friends I showed this movie to enjoyed it. My sister loved it as well. The music in the movie was great.It's not as amazing as the GOAT Ping Pong, but it is still a fantastic movie I would recommend.8/10"", ""Alright, I'm jumping into this review, trying not to be biased whatsoever.Animal Crossing has and will always be my favorite game franchise, so I was ecstatic to find out there was a movie. The movie, however, was not dubbed (or subbed?) for Western viewers, but some voice actors came together and made their own (very good) dub.Now, onto the movie. I'm pretty biased when it comes to rating things, but this I can give a proud 8. While it plays out like a slice-of-life, it's definitely something I'd say the average Animal Crossing fan would enjoy, especially after winding down from school or work. Plus,...it's enjoyable for all ages.While it may not be the world's best anime movie, it was way better than the Mario one, that's for sure. it's enjoyable for all ages.While it may not be the world's best anime movie, it was way better than the Mario one, that's for sure."", ""First review, so please bear with me.I was surprised at seeing that majority of the reviews I've seen on here are positive, so here's one with an opposite tone. Naturally, this review is overall negative. I'm a relatively new fan of Animal Crossing (starting with AC:NL just this year), but I've instantly fallen in love with it, so finding out it had an anime adaptation made me instantly drawn to it. I expected a lighthearted, character driven slice of life, but what I got was a movie too ambitious for it's own good.Story:...4/10.The story is bad. There are around 3 or 4 different arcs in this movie, each of which feels like it should have been 6 episodes long. Instead, they're condensed to around 30 minutes each, which just makes them feel really rushed and full of plotholes. There really isn't much more for me to say.Art: 7/10.The art is pretty good. They tried to make the artstyle closely resemble the Animal Crossing games, and I think it worked out pretty well. The animation isn't anything to write home about, but there are some excellent usage of CGI which can occasionally make it a blast to watch.Sound: 9/10.Most of the music in this game are remixes of music from various Animal Crossing games, mainly the Wild World and City Folk ones as that's the time period this movie was produced in. So naturally, the OST is fantastic. They even included a live performance of K.K. Bossa, one of my favrouite K.K. Slider songs in! The music is generally used appropriately, athough there are some places where it seems a bit awkwardly put.Character: 6/10.I feel like the movie introduces way too many characters to get attached to, so in the end it just makes you not have much emotional attachment to any of them. The individual characters are fine, as most of them are faithful to their in-game counterparts, but I feel like the directors were reaching way too far for this. This may be just me though, as I have never really interacted with any of the characters in the movie save Celeste and Blathers.Enjoyment: 6/10.Most of the parts I liked about the movie are the OST and the characters interacting with eachother, but I feel like the story significantly hinders my enjoyment of this movie. However, I did manage to enjoy it.Overall: 6/10.Despite all it's shortcomings (mainly the story), I still managed to enjoy the movie. I feel like it could have been much better for me if I had any prior significant attatchment to any of the main characters, but I don't. However, the movie set a beautiful message and executes quite well on it, and for me that makes it all the more memorable. In the end, this is a kid's movie, targeted at kids, so I think taking it too seriously would really hinder your enjoyment. 4/10.The story is bad.

I liked how they had the same sound effects in the right spots and the same music as well. I was surprised how good the movie was since it was a video game that all you had to do was collect items, sell them, and pay your debt to your house and what not. They had a lot of the characters in it like Tom Nook, The Able Sisters, K.K. Slider etc. For K.K. Slider they had actual lyrics to the music. I didn't know they had lyrics to the songs. It...also reminded me that K.K. sung in front of the train station in the Game Cube version. I forgot about that. Overall the movie was really good. also reminded me that K.K. sung in front of the train station in the Game Cube version. I forgot about that. Overall the movie was really good."", ""How do you make a movie based on a game with no story? Like this, apparently.What impresses me the most about Animal Crossing: The Movie, is how perfect of an adaptation it is. Not only are a lot recognizable being portrayed here, but nearly almost scene connects to something you can do in the the game, whether it be letter-writing, digging for fossils or shaking trees. The film even portrays the feelings surrounding your favorite villager moving away without telling you. That way it feels both self-aware and genuine at the same time.The only problem is that if you haven't played any of the games,...a lot of what happens in the film might not make much sense to you. But if you have played at least one of the games, or just enjoy slice of life in general, there's a lot to enjoy here.It hits me that slice of life is not just a fitting genre for this movie, but the only one that would have worked for film based on a game series that depends on not having much of story to work. The film has a great uplifting atmosphere. Relatively mundane conversations are made enjoyable by a lighthearted and whimsical nature. Much like other entries to the genre, it's very light on story and has a lot of scenes where not much happens and you just get to see the characters living their lives. There still is a story, it's just not the focus, nor should it be in this case. The film does take a rather strange turn towards the third act, as the characters have to deal with the arrival of an alien. What's even stranger than that though, is that it kind of made sense to me at the time of watching, only after finishing the film did I question the decision to include aliens. What is this film doing to me?The characters all have enjoyable personalities that are expanded upon from the games. The ones that are featured all stand out in their own way. Blathers was one of the most amusing to me, as he's tendency to talk at insane lengths is much funnier when he doesn't stop himself from doing it and someone else has to step in. Of course, the fan-favorite K. K. Slider gets his own amazing scene as well. I'm also happy that the main character, (called Ai in the film,) isn't just the default design for the player character, like what you'd see in the trailer for the new Super Smash Bros. When a film is based on a game with a customizable main character, it's always nice to see a bit of creativity in the character design department.The film also introduces another kid, Yuu, based on the player character, who is from a neighbor village, an idea that's probably based on ability to visit other people's towns in the game. In fact, I almost regretted him not being the main character, as he was much more active and did more things you typically do in the games, like catch bugs and bury pitfalls. What I found the most amusing was how he had a completely different outfit in nearly every scene he was in. Towards the end he's also the one risking his life to help others, yet it's still Ai who gets rewarded for some reason.The film may survive on charm alone, but there's a lot of it. With nice tone, good animation, fitting voice acting and enjoyable characters, it's a movie I didn't think could work, and yet turned out really well.Does anyone else find it weird that an 11 year old is moving out on her own though?

But I don't know what I was expecting anyway, considering Nintendo never released this movie in the West.It has many nice moments and it's very cute. It's also a movie for kids so whatever. But it feels like a compilation movie to a 26-episode TV series that doesn't exist and its meandering plotless slice-of-life story is just the kind of boring thing so many Japanese comedies and dramas fall prey to.Something quieter and more laid back would have been...way better for me, but I guess if they did that they couldn't show off all the cool gameplay features. way better for me, but I guess if they did that they couldn't show off all the cool gameplay features."", ""It's not easy to adapt such a strange concept into a movie. But whoever did it, they managed to keep (at least) the spirit of the game. Watching this movie makes you feel soothed and give you a smile you keep all along.It's not really a great movie though. The story is kinda predictable, even boring considering the very slow pace of the movie. But, maybe by some spell cast on you, you end up appreciating this little moment in this little village with these little and cute characters. Especially when the ost comes from the game..And that's why we love Animal Crossing. "", ""Animal Crossing was possibly my favourite ever video game that I played growing up, so when I found out there was an anime film adaptation I knew I had to watch it no matter how bad it may turn out to be.Thankfully, it wasn't wasted time.This film is, in a word, beautiful. It captures all of the elements of the game seamlessly, from the world which the main character (Ai) lives in to her friends and other NPCs of the game with their unique personalities.I was always wary of the story for this film as Animal Crossing doesn't actually have one, but yet the...writers manage to tell a narrative that works on many different levels. Certain aspects go no deeper than those who would just be watching it casually as well as hardcore fans of the game which would have an expansive knowledge of every Easter Egg the film throws at them. There are some profound lessons to be learnt at the end as well.Everyone should see Doubutsu no Mori, you'll have a good time. writers manage to tell a narrative that works on many different levels.

Its an Animal Crossing film.It did a great job displaying each islander and their personalities. And it felt like I was able to experience the game in a real perspective.Story - 4. Unfortunately the plot wasn't good in my opinion. The plot was introduced 30 minutes into the film and for those bits it was kind of boring. Towards the end of the movie the plot got more interesting and used foretelling from in the middle of the movie to solve a problem. I found this really smart and really amazing because its coming from a 2006 film where these...types of things weren't as common. Overall it did a decent job using the characters in the plot, but it wasted some good potential in some characters, such as Hopper, Timmy, and Tommy.Art - 5. Although it was made in 2006, almost 15 years ago, it wasn't the best art I've ever seen. There were plenty of anime that've done better on the art department. In my opinion I feel the animation was a bit weird especially on the character design, but you can't blame it, they were just copying the game. Although they were copying the game, it still didn't appeal to me. That being, the scenery was very nice and I wouldn't change it for the world.Sound-9. I love the Animal Crossing soundtracks. Especially in the earlier games it had one of the best soundtracks of its time. I like how it incorporated many of the game songs into the movie, and it made it really nostalgic to hear songs from the previous games. I love listening to KK Slider, even in my free time, I spend time relaxing to the sweet guitar melodies from KK. They did a great job timing the right places to put the songs in, and the little flashbacks from time to time during the songs were really enjoyable as well. I think the music was the best thing about the movie.Character- 9. I love the personalities of each islander in game and in the film. It really gave a more realistic touch to the characters, by hearing their voices and how they act in an animated setting, it makes the characters very lovable. They were so diverse, and although sometimes their catchphrases got a bit annoying sometimes, they were unique and part of their embodiment into the film. I don't have much to comment on it, but it was definitely great to hear some of the characters talk. I really loved Hopper fishing in the intervals of scenes. I laughed my butt of when he fished a boot and it was funny to see his expression towards it.Enjoyment- 8. I really enjoyed this film. I know it wasn't the best in all departments, but it made me really happy to see animal crossing in a visual setting. I really liked the emotional impact some of the songs had. KK BOSSA at the festival was especially a tear jerker to me and I loved hearing and singing along to it.Overall I give it a 7. In most terms it was an enjoyable experience and there is nothing wrong with it. It was a nice change to the classic love stories and fighting films that exist nowadays. I really liked how it gave me a nostalgic sense of mind. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I even watched this movie with my friends.

As someone who's been playing Animal Crossing since they were a kid, this film just made me incredibly happy and all the small little details were so satisfactory. This is one of those films that makes you appreciate the finer things in life.With the story, there was about 3-4 different arcs in this one film and they're all pretty short. Usually, I would hate this is in an anime film. Something like this is a bold move and most of the time does not work out, but to me this...just makes it feel more like Animal Crossing. Considering this is an Animal Crossing film, I feel as though this was a good choice due to the fact that when I do play animal crossing this is exactly what it's like. Doing small little things every day, running around my village and just having a grand old time. That's what was happening in this film, it was showing you the day to day life of villagers in the game. It was heartwarming, and in the end it all tied together. Like I said, usually doing something like this in a film is a risky move, but I think it paid off.Now, my two favourite things in this film- the art and the sound. Both of these aspects I feel not only made the film more enjoyable, but made it more homely and nostalgic. The art was exactly what you'd expect from an Animal Crossing film, it's nice and pleasing to the eye- but what's even better is the background art. The background art in this film was amazing, it really brought all the scenes to life and made them look like a scene you'd see on someone's background or as their header. And then the sound, the sound was just amazing. The Animal Crossing soundtrack is one of my favourites ever, and the way it was used in this film was great. Not to mention all the atmospheric sound effects made the film feel so much more cozy and again, added to the nice animal crossing feel of it.When it comes to the characters in this film, they were all true to the games I feel. And to top it off, all the characters are unique and loveable. They all have their moments, and they're all memorable. The characters work well together, and we get to see their friendships slowly develop up until the end.Overall, I really enjoyed this film.

Going into it, I heard that it was quite wacky and weird but that it had a good story. I'd argue I had the opposite experience.The movie seemed to tease at a plot a couple times, but never actually deliver a plot. It gave a couple questions and then seemingly abandoned them for another part altogether. The story didn't seem to have much of a drive, which, would probably be normal for an Animal Crossing movie, but I didn't quite feel satisfied by it.

Mutsuki gets kind of bitter upon finding the other girls just goofing off at the pool, seemingly proving those adults right. Though, she gradually gets convinced to join them. After watching the show, it\'s pretty obvious that it further proves the point of high school about having the space to goof off and form bonds with these friends that you\'ll be stuck in that school with. The kicker comes in during the latter half of the special, when Mika talks with a few workers at the inn that the girls visit. One of them didn\'t go to high school at all and spent those years working at this inn. The younger inn worker and Mika talk about their differing experiences, and while there are certain experiences that the inn worker did not have due to not going to high school, she also explains the satisfaction she\'s found in being able to have the unique experience of working at an inn in its place. It\'s a moment which I enjoy for how it shows a new perspective on the different paths a person can take in life, while further fleshing out the show\'s perspective on what meaning can taken from high school.Character-wise, due to the leg work done by the TV series, I already love these girls\' dynamic, and their interactions are just as fun as they\'ve always been, since the episode is essentially composed of them getting together and goofing off. Something that specifically stood out was how Momo was implemented. I\'ll leave how the episode ends as a nice surprise, but I love the mischievous way she\'s always operating in the shadows while still clearly understanding the value of the girls\' friendship probably even earlier than anyone else did. This is episode 6.5 chronologically. There\'s a nice moment where the older inn keeper who did attend high school explains what she got out of it and how she gets nostalgic looking at the main girls hanging out. Mika says she doesn\'t quite understand al that, and the inn worker tells her that she will someday, which is a nice little nod to the chronology. Mei poses the central question running through specifically this episode in ""What\'s the point of summer vacation?"" and reaches a gradual answer of that. While I wouldn\'t say the characters change that much and the special is not essential to the central storyline of the series, I appreciate spending more time with these characters while expanding and reiterating on its central ideas a bit.Yeah, it\'s a nice time if you liked the show. It adds enough to the themes of the show to be a worthwhile entry, and the character interactions are as enjoyable as ever. Good stuff. by casually discussing how high school kids have so much more free time to be unproductive compared to them.

Dual! Parallel Lun-Lun Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/992/Dual_Parallel_Lun-Lun_Monogatari,"['You can sum up Dual in one sentence: \'It\'s Evangelion but not too far up it\'s own ass""I know it\'s a flameworthy summation, but it\'s true.  It\'s a not-very-well-disguised clone of the series with some harem aspects.  For christ\'s sake, the annoying, overbearing chick who\'s secretly into the protag even runs around in a red mech.  You cant buy that kind of blatancy.  But what does it have that NGE doesn\'t?  Why a protag that you ACTUALLY like.  Or, at the very least, you don\'t hate him for bitching and moaning every three seconds and masturbating to comatose girls!(wow,...didn\'t even get through the first paragraph without mentioning that.  a new low XD)Okay, now that i got that little bit out,  story time!!The show centers around a boy named Kazuki Yotsuga, a regular dude(don\'t they all, though) who everyone at school laughs at because he keeps seeing these giant mechs fighting in the street.  He sees this so frequently he\'s even started a little website where he chronicles what he sees.  Well it all goes tails up for him when the school queen, Mitsuki Sanada shows an interest in the boy, telling him that she believes that he sees these things.  More importantly her father believes him too.  He has a theory about there being a parallel world with events and a time line similar to theirs, and that Kazuki has the unique ability to peer into it.  Since this is an anime the Professor immediately straps the poor schmo into the deus ex teleporter he already had made up, complete with comfy chair and arm straps, and BAM!!  Kazuki is now in the other world.He soon meets up with the Mech he is always seeing in his psychotic episodes and, through serendipity and overly obvious plot devices, he ends up piloting it; defeating the generic mech it\'s pilot, now unconscious, was fighting.  It is through here that young Kazuki learns that he is in the other world when he runs home to find that his parents have no idea who he is(NOT when he was piloting the mech he\'s seen so many times in his hallucinations that he\'s actually given it a name... which i am not even going to TRY and pronounce, let alone spell.  i just started calling it ""Harpsichord"").  Eventually he is swept up by the Giant Mech Military, ran by this Earth\'s version of the loon who sent him there(just go with it), because he is the only male who has ever been able to pilot a mech, previously only women could for some reason.  He soon runs into Mizuki, who decided to follow after him into the Chair of Spatial Impossibility shortly after he disappeared but got there a month earlier for some reason(SCIENCE!!!), and she turns out to be a mech warrior as well, along with the \'Rei\' character of the story who is actually explained in the first appearance as an alien-clone-robot-thing.you read that right, they ACTUALLY flat-out told you that she was a alien clone-robot-thing instead of making it painfully obvious but never even really alluded to in the bulk of the story.  And she\'s a very interesting character, i always liked Tabula Rasa characters, their humor may be obvious(i.e. when looking for a character who ran away they tend to look in the trashcan for some reason) but they\'re always enjoyable and usually give me a smile.And all this brings up a really important point, why the crap can only children pilot giant mechs of death?  does puberty not compute with the OS or something?  but at least this show altered that a bit, the pilot originally controlling Harpsichord was 23, so at least there was that.After the establish the main cast the episodes went kinda basic, they met the Team Rocket-inspired villain who seems more concerned about the the spectacle of invading rather then the actual winning of the battle.  The also have all the old songs of anime here:  They go to school, everyone is jealous of/hating on the protag because the school queen is always hanging around him, everyone wants a piece of him, there\'s a stray dog somewhere along the line that the alien-clone-robot-tabula rasa-Priscilla: Queen of the Desert  grows attached to.  It doesn\'t really try to push any boundaries as a show, its more like the people who created the story were given a big box of what all anime before it did and was told to pick two good concepts to play with and three bad concepts to try and fix and to make a show out of those 5 things and they said \'to piss with that\' and took the whole box and ran with it.And, to me, that\'s not a bad thing.  It\'s a good view if you\'re bored off your rocker and want to just enjoy yourself for 12 episodes.  There\'s nothing really to take away from it in the end, but is that really a bad thing?

', '""Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventures"" is, as everyone I\'ve met who has seen it in its entirety and I will call it, a happy Neon Genesis Evangelion.I say this because for the large part, there are enough parallels between the two series that it\'s at times not to accidentally finding yourself calling the main character Shinji. Except, in Dual! the main character has a spine and actually grows very bold when it comes to him fighting the enemy of the series, the RaRa Army. But even though it can be hard not to see the parallels, it\'s its own entity.Dual!, for all intent and...purposes, is a Tenchi series. It\'s drawn and written by Masaki Kajishima, has a few Easter eggs that point you towards the Tenchi universe, and there\'s even a direct throwback to Dual! in Tenchi GXP. with that being said, let\'s dissect Dual!.First we have the artwork. As a 1999 series, we see that the cell painted style has cycled out and has been replaced by the more smoother use of computer animation (most likely an early adobe or correl product) and the slightest hint of CG with a sophisticated enough style to remind you of Beast Wars (which only appears when the mechs are being launched, computer screens are shown, or a long hallway needs to be walked down....you\'ll see). Textures and patterns are used very sparingly, and ""cheesy"" photoshop effects are used only when needed. Overall, the artwork is at the point where it\'s just about at it\'s best.Second is the Opening and the Ending. The opening song is catchy, but at the same time forgettable. I say this because if you were to put the opening to NGE to Dual! you\'d never tell the difference the sound would make. The ending...... it\'s cute (and again forgetable) but the graphics... my god, the graphics... I will say this. Watch it ONCE and SKIP IT forever more. It\'s that bad.Third on the list is the plot. The plot is fairly simple, and yet complex because of the questions it leaves you with once you\'ve figured out how Dual! fits into the tenchi universe. But for the most part thle plot can be broken down into this :1.Boy has visions of giant robots beating each other up2.Boy meets girl3.Girl\'s father sends boy to world where the robots are4.Boy has to fight robots to figure out a way backSimple, no?Next up, the characters. All I can really say is this. Once you see the parallels between NGE and Dual! (it\'s inevitable so I\'m telling you now) take a second to stop, completely remove any thoughts that these characters are from NGE ad enjoy them or hate them for who they are and how Masaki wrote the to be. That\'s all I can really say about them.Second to last are the voice tracks. We all know they all sound better in Japanese, but Dual! is from that magical time period when English dubbing didn\'t suck. Not only can you watch it in English, but you can ENJOY it in English.Finally Is the fun factor. The humor isn\'t really slap-stick, because it\'s the character\'s demeanor and their personas that add the humor to the series. The giant robot fights are fun all around and certainly add to the series, even though Dual! could survive without them if it had too.Overall, Dual! is a great series with good artwork, characters, vocals, plot, and humor.

Another harem comedy made by Tenchi Muyo creator Masaki Kajishima, Dual Parallel Trouble Adventure looks to also be parodying mecha anime in its run considering it makes enough nods to Evangelion with its premise, mecha and character designs and some notable moments from the mentioned series. The Evangelion parodies did get me giggling as Dual Parallel's creators seemed to know enough about the show where Eva fans could spot certain elements from the series that Dual Parallel decided to poke fun of at points.The series also features Kajishima's style of comedy...featuring male lead Kazuki putting up with his unwanted harem of gals and having unexpected moments of comedy from details on events that characters fail to mention (quite often happening via Misaki's father). The latter element effectively delivers well with Dual Parallel, while the focus on the harem didn't get me as amused since Kazuki and the girls are pretty much cut-out archetypes you likely would see at one point or another in other anime titles and to a great extent, these characters don't get much in the way of depth or growth. This makes them kind of bland and hard to relate with when the series later gets more serious in its plot developments.Speaking of plot, Dual Parallel's premise on mecha fights and alternate dimensions was a bit of a disappointment for me. While the premise seems promising at first when Kazuki finds himself adjusting to life in a different world and piloting a mecha, the later mentioned serious developments in Dual Parallel's plot lead to the anime's biggest weaknesses to come about. It gets in enough of a bad habit of dropping hints and brief details over elements to the world of the series or characters that get introduced just to advance the anime's plot and it never bothers to elaborate on how these elements are important or why one should care for them. It felt like the second half was cobbled together in many areas to try creating something more serious without bothering to go into depth on how and why things were happening.Visually, Dual Parallel sported clean details and a bright color palette in the designs of scenery and characters, while sporting Kajishima's drawing style in said character designs. The show makes frequent use of CG animation at points (such as the use of deploying mechas, camera pans of scenery and the ED sequence) which while it is well detailed, it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the hand-drawn animation. Animation in battle scenes for Dual Parallel is nothing out of the ordinary for a TV anime with hand-drawn sequences, but it gets the job done.Overall, Dual Parallel seemed to wow me with its comedy more than its plot and characters. The comedic delivery for the anime was spot-on for me in most areas, but the bland main cast and the messy second half did hurt its quality to a good extent for me. featuring male lead Kazuki putting up with his unwanted harem of gals and having unexpected moments of comedy from details on events that characters fail to mention (quite often happening via Misaki's father).

Didn't expect much from this series considering it was an older mecha series (they tend to have basic plot progression and characters), and I watched unironically oblivious to the Evangelion parody. Despite being a fairly basic plot structure and generic harem character palette, this series was actually fairly interesting to watch. Let's get into why!Story:We are given an immature, pre-prepubescent nerd that is able to see large mecha fight and destroy his surroundings without affecting his world; thanks to...the opening scene with a mysterious artifact that most likely split the interaction with it into two different worlds (like a butterfly effect) Nonetheless, this teen male picks up a popular, high in demand chick who seems interested in him till he meets her old man, a mad scientist - Long story short he finds himself in the dystopian parallel world as a result of the ancient artifacts. His job in the parallel world is to draw an end to the war as soon as possible so that both worlds experience peace (also to stop his mecha hallucinations).My thoughts on the series:I felt that despite trying to stay exclusive to the mecha genre, this series fails to develop a structured narrative by the end of 13 episode (I didn't bother watching the special) It is a debatable claim however, I really wasn't grasping a powerful narrative apart from the 'save both worlds' mindset - Not the worst but not innovative especially considering it relies on mecha and similar human figured robots to develop the plot. As such, I will be rating this series a fair 7/10 in terms of plot.Art & Sound:1999, a fairly well aged series in terms of animation and music. I enjoyed the main theme that played in between key events in the series but that was about it, most of the music played were fairly generic - Art style to me was fairly average especially for the date it was made in. As such, a generous rating of 6/10 will be given for art & sound.Character:In terms of character development, I'd say all of the side characters as well as the FMC (female main character) had most of the major changes in this series. All the female characters in the harem have more power individually over the MC even at the end of the series - This is fairly ironic considering MC is the person that shines in his mecha on the battlefield. Not a fan of this but atleast it didn't dwell on fan service such as other known mecha series.I'd rate this series a 6/10 in terms of character development, not the best but definitely well needed improvement in character development for the MC .Enjoyment:I was fairly discouraged in the first half of the series because I felt the plot was intentionally being forced to progress - It happened quite fast this way which is why I wasn't as emotionally connected to the characters. Nonetheless the ending definitely didn't disappoint seeing everyone in a good mood is a better ending than a series that kills off characters for 'plot progression'. As an older series, I'd say there needs to be a higher threshold for leniency because most of the mecha plots weren't innovative or unique, so I'd rate this series a solid 8/10 in terms of enjoyment, beginning started off a bit rushed but was on the right track and entertaining by episode 6/7.Overall: 7/10Story: 6/10Art & Sound: 7/10Character: 6/10 the opening scene with a mysterious artifact that most likely split the interaction with it into two different worlds (like a butterfly effect) Nonetheless, this teen male picks up a popular, high in demand chick who seems interested in him till he meets her old man, a mad scientist - Long story short he finds himself in the dystopian parallel world as a result of the ancient artifacts.

Dual is one of those that has some very good tricks at making you wonder what will happen next and while it\'s not as epic as how NGE did it the big difference between it and NGE is that the character problems are more personal and that makes the whole thing more suspenseful for those of us who are not sold with the whole macro-premise of NGE.That is, if you ignore the similarities and separate these two animes, the pacing of DUAL feels much more realistic because the school setting doesn\'t feel tacked on and the robot fights they do not have as big of an end of the world theme and thus it\'s like with many classic super robot films in that you can suspend your reality a bit more in how a young pilot can learn as he rides his automaton while still having a school life.The ending too, even as one reviewer compares it to the underwhelming-ness of NGE - it isn\'t quite comparable.In NGE\'s original ending, ""underwhelming"" is indeed the core idea that comes to mind but because DUAL doesn\'t really have that huge of a premise, ""underwhelming"" here is as how the rest of the plot twist in the anime is: ""under-payed off"".This is why I say I won\'t change most people\'s minds because sometimes the core idea is what sticks most to majority of viewers and in this case the whole thing could have been salvaged away from that comparison if the anime had strived further for a more conclusive better written and better personal to the character\'s ending but by the ending falling way short - all those previous trinkets that might make you want to finish the show thinking there\'s something ""there"" all of it is lost despite it being well inserted to provide mystery to the show initially and up to the ending. pacing quality of NGE and treat this show as more of a Tenchi Muyo style of blandly generic placed events but with a big pay-off....unfortunately the big pay-off never comes which is why I feel this needs to be pointed out.Animes like these rely highly on the ""big"" climax or turning point because without it the whole thing really feels like every annoying thing before it was just ""there"".

Some spoilers contained: And this show indeed has parallels (see what I did there) to Evangelion. It takes a completely different direction however. Instead of gritty action, tear shedding drama, an amazing score, brilliant animation and strong characters we get.... lackluster battle sequences with obvious plot tricks to have the main character fight his girlfriends, entirely muted drama under no circumstances is there ever a strong feeling of danger, the sound is actually serviceable or maybe I am just getting convinced by the fact that it seems to be an advertisement for...pioneer, the animation is fair to horrible depending on which sequences you analyze but certainly those CGI scenes where the mechs leave the hanger are like mid 1990\'s fallout 1/2 cutscene level at best, and they would look better hand drawn, lastly: the characters are weak. I will elaborate a little bit: take for example the main character he is just generic, I figure that like any bland or generic character who takes the spotlight we are supposed to somehow feel like we are in his place because he is bland or generic enough to be any male of his age... None of the characters are given proper development, backstory, or are even clearly defined other than just using cliches when they realized that they hadn\'t given these animated creations a life of their own. For example in the last episode which is called Special on here, really its episode 14, Professor Sanada mentions: ""You know how D is..."" like what how does anyone know how D is? She is entirely blank with little to no development she is a completely deprecated version of Rei. Rei on the other hand while cold and difficult to understand did have some backstory and the way that she would act in a situation would be clear to anyone who watched Eva, as it was clear that she is loyal and would follow orders to a tee even at her own health\'s expense if it was for someone she cared about (Episode 1 when she tries to pilot unit 1 because Gendo asked her to, and End of Evangelion when she cares more about Shinji than Gendo so she rejects him and helps Shinji decide the outcome of instrumentality through introspective questioning). None of the characters get any serious thought in Dual Parallel Adventure. They revert to the typical shounen troupes--which Eva does as well to be fair-- i.e: with Mitsuki Sanada displaying some tsundere afffection for our plain jane protagonist, especially when it seems she is being displaced or her position is being threatened by outsiders (Mitsuki Rara, Yayoi, D..?). Having been penned by Masaki Kajishima who also made Tenchi Muyo, we should expect similar lack of depth and overtly silly harem elements which do make quite the appearance. Ironically I would accuse Evangelion of positing the harem for Shinji as well but it makes up for its trope use with clever manipulations such as the scene where Shinji falls on Rei but he doesn\'t get slapped to the moon, but instead they awkwardly act like nothing happened because that would be more realistic.  The highlight of the entire show is those tug at your heart string moments when things are going well between Mitsuki Sanada and Kazuki;  finally they get a chance to date, and she teases the hell out of him even randomly tickling him before they almost awkwardly kiss but don\'t *sigh*. Anyway of course the distance between these two increases as the harem comes back when they travel back to the other dimension again, and inexplicably she is captured so she is still the focus for a little bit, but the following battle is a direct duplicate of an earlier one in which the other Mitsuki (Rara) became mind controlled to do her mother\'s bidding. The ending is horrible which I figure is actually episode 13, with 14 just being an extension that serves no relevance or purpose. We don\'t see any more romance and the characters have now all been bonded as family although I don\'t think that will stop Kazuki from eventually impregnating Mitsuki. Yea I went there. Anyway its decent enough to watch with the understanding that it is like a B movie, but don\'t expect anything spectacular. pioneer, the animation is fair to horrible depending on which sequences you analyze but certainly those CGI scenes where the mechs leave the hanger are like mid 1990\'s fallout 1/2 cutscene level at best, and they would look better hand drawn, lastly: the characters are weak.

Recently I watched it again and it just didn\'t have the same effect. Is it a result of my having seen more shows, a sign of me being jaded or simply it wasn\'t as good as I remembered? Who knows (it was a rhetorical question by the way). Whatever the reason Dual comes across as a rather uninspired generic attempt to emulate far better shows.To Dual\'s credit it isn\'t actually bad and despite it\'s flaws manages to be quite entertaining just...as long as you don\'t expect much from it. While the influences and similarities are obvious it is not a straight rip off and like Rahxephon takes similar elements and uses them to tell a story that is quite different.Dual\'s characters are certainly rather similar to Evangelion\'s, feeling like watered down but still interesting versions of Rei et all. We have Mitsuki, the tsundere, very much a cross between rich girl and a watered down Asuka. The inevitable Rei clone is there in the form of D. They all happen to be believable, with reasonably realistic reactions but quirky enough to be interesting. Unlike many harem characters what is immediately apparent with these girls is not always reflective of what they really feel.It is because of them that the best parts are surprisingly not the mecha action scenes but the mellower home life bits. It\'s here that the characters and their personalities come to the foreground, frequently clashing with each other, usually involving the attention of the lead guy Kazuki.Since I\'ve mention Kazuki let\'s look more in depth at...someone else. By far the character that stands out the most is the wonderfully eccentric ken Sanada. A mix of mad scientist with capable commander with a dash of perversion and wit thrown in. From ""testing"" a suite made to make Kazuki\'s form more effeminate to commanding the robots in battle he does it all with style.Unfortunately the lead is not worthy of the same praise. To his credit he\'s certainly better than many similar characters and does start off quite well. His isolation from his peers leads him to being slightly embittered giving him a more realistic feel than this type of character usually has. As the episodes go on he soon turns into a cross between standard harem guy and mecha hero. It\'s as if the writers were attempting to create a more heroic version of Shinji (which sort of goes against the point of such a character). However Kazuki lacks the complex inner depth and realism that made Shinji so fascinating while also lacking the wit that often makes more action based characters work or the sheer raw power of someone like Kamina. He ends up uncomfortably in between, being able to pull off neither role satisfactorily.Back to the story. While I liked the harem like home life bits, more than I usually would for that kind of show; the giant robot action parts just weren\'t that great. The main story is serviceable but really has little purpose beyond a reason for the battles and giving the various girls reasons for interacting with the lead. Often the story was at it\'s best when being used to set up one of the comedy scenes. There\'s a scene for example where one of the females is trying to use the ongoing battle to get out of a marriage interview. The whole section is done with a comic flair that makes the fight better than most of the serious parts.Some of the more serious parts do work quite well. One in particular early on is when our hero discovers that in the parallel world he is an unknown person and even those he assumes are his own parents don\'t know him. It\'s a pity that this wasn\'t taken further as it\'s a interesting idea that\'s good while it lasts.Animation is mostly passable, though a few cgi robot launch sequences stand out as rather unconvincing looking like they were rendered on a sadly underpowered machine with no consideration given to how they would fit. Character designs are quite good though obviously taken from their earlier works.Do I recommend Dual? That\'s not an easy question to answer. If asked after I had first seen it I would have said yes. Now I\'d say it\'s worth giving a shot just as long as you don\'t expect a great deal from it. Dual\'s biggest problem isn\'t being bad (despite my complaints it actually isn\'t terrible by any means) but rather lacking anything that makes it stand out. It has its good points (some of the characters, the harem bits being better than usual) but really seems like anime by a committee of people desperate to try to recreate the appeal of better, earlier series and not having the skill or imagination to do so. as long as you don\'t expect much from it.

Gotou ni Naritai.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8120/Gotou_ni_Naritai,"['Just when I thought all hope was lost for the three ""disability movies"" which I like to call them, I randomly come across the fact that Evetaku just fansubbed this...months ago! Whoa! When I saw that on MAL, I rushed over to the site to confirm it, and there it was, right on the bottom of the front page! I immediately downloaded it and watched it right after I got home from school. Thank GOD this thing got subbed! Maybe there\'s some hope for Happy Birthday: Inochi Kagayaku Toki and Momoko: Kaeru no Uta ga Kikoeru yo after all in terms of the fansubbing department!Considering...that this was made in 1995, the animation is clearly rather sub-par, at best. However, the animators did a great job at giving every single character a distinct look and, once again, giving them physical flaws, such as obesity and small eyes and big teeth. One problem I notice in a lot of new anime nowadays is that everyone doesn\'t have their own distinct look. Everyone looks the same, except with different hair styles, hair colors, and eye colors, which is especially apparent in a lot of harem and moe anime. Not only that, they\'re so obsessed with beauty that they have no physical flaws, like big teeth or braces or acne or anything else like that! Even American shows feature characters with those peculiarities and insecurities! What is it with Japan and making everyone look impossibly beautiful and flawless?! Thank God this anime subverted that trope awesomely! The soundtrack isn\'t memorable, really. I don\'t remember any of it.Again, like with the other two disability movies, its characters are awesome, realistic, and wonderfully developed. While they look and act slightly generic, they\'re not flat-out stereotypes either, and there\'s always a reason behind their actions. Heck, later on in the movie, the two main bullies who pick on Ritsuko have their reasons for being so cruel. The movie addresses the issue of love, hate, jealousy (NOT romantic jealousy, mind you), and acceptance, and it follows through its themes wonderfully. They\'re all great and perfectly normal characters. The adults are good too, even though some of them may be a little weird.If I had to name some problems this movie has, one notable one would be that at times, it gets a little too melodramatic, particularly with Ritsuko\'s mother and how she reacts to the bullies. But in this case, it\'s justified because Ritsuko\'s mother is portrayed as an overprotective person, and Ritsuko is embarrassed by her reckless actions (Hey, what kid ISN\'T embarrassed by the things their parents do at one point?), so I can let it slide. Also, while I do like Ritsuko\'s doctor for being so supportive of her, I\'m really confused: are blind people even allowed to be doctors? Or is he just a therapist? I have no idea, even with the subs! Are blind people allowed to be therapists?Well, even with it\'s glaringly obvious flaws, I still liked this movie. Unfortunately, the two other disability movies trump it, though it definitely shouldn\'t be so neglected. that this was made in 1995, the animation is clearly rather sub-par, at best.

This was also an exception, and oh how glad I am it was.Ritsuko has trouble walking, she's been ill since birth, but did her best to keep up with the others, to be able to walk like the others.If I really don't want to spoiler anything, I better not write anything, because that's the way I watched this too. I barely knew anything about what would happen.The art is of course old, but not...in the way that it ruins the enjoyment, not at all. I don't find it bad the least bit, but in comparison to the anime of today of course it looks a bit worse. I think this shouldn't discourage anyone to watch it.Personally what I loved most about this was the character staff and the story. I don't have any disability but there were several things in it that I could connect with, and I'm sure many of you would have a lot too.This was the first anime that I literally sobbed because of.

Hi no Tori,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1371/Hi_no_Tori,"[""Hi no Tori, also known as Phoenix, is an adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's most ambitious but ultimately unfinished manga.I felt quite intimidated, being new to most of Tezuka's work, but the nature of the story and its excellent execution allows Hi no Tori to be surprisingly entertaining while still remaining emotionally and intellectually stimulating.Story:The premise seems simple on the surface: the hunt for an immortal bird whose blood is said to provide eternal life. It is not that, however, which leaves a lasting impression on the viewer, but everything else that happens around it. Each story arc has its own cast of characters whose...respective trials and fates through the ages lead us to a powerful but poignant message, one which also asks more questions than those it answers, directly or indirectly, about life and its value.It's hard to estimate how much of the original manga is being respected in this adaptation, as I have not read it, but director Ryosuke Takahashi does a wonderful job at conveying a sense of internal consistency and the end result is certainly effective. Any added, removed or altered details, for reasons of time constraints and possibly subject matter, do not get in the way.Animation:Most of the character designs are based on Tezuka's artistic style and are repeatedly recycled, which may be a negative for other viewers. I would admit they are cartoony, but a few begin to look a little more modern as the series goes on. It didn't really bother me though. The animation's production values also vary, but they're usually quite fitting and tend to improve. The Phoenix itself, in particular, provides a few opportunities to showcase some nice special effects.Sound:The opening and ending themes are fine, for my tastes, but they do work better as part of the show than by themselves. The remaining musical themes mainly stayed in the background but were also used to convey comfort, tragedy, action, hope and desperation at the appropriate moments.Character:Tezuka's characters are not that complex, but their personalities are strong and the plot twists definitely do not pander to the crowd. Tragedy is commonplace, as it is a fact of life, yet so is the struggle against it, the struggle to overcome, the struggle to survive. At the end of the day, what remains may seem disheartening, even if not everything is bleak. There are sparse comedic moments, acts of heroism and altruism, acts of pure villainy, loss of life, senseless or otherwise, all showing different aspects of humanity's mosaic.A special note must be made about the Phoenix itself, a very intriguing entity in its own right, whose role and intentions seemingly vary throughout the show, something which could literally spark entire debates.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this anime a lot more than originally expected, especially because of all the food for thought it provides, whose surface I have barely scratched. I will now seek to read the manga, in order to have a better understanding of what Tezuka himself did with the material, but it doesn't seem that his spirit was lost to the anime staff.Hi no Tori is definitely great but, unfortunately, often overlooked. If you want something that can make you think about difficult questions, and don't mind if it's not flashy or action-oriented, go ahead and check it out .A word of caution: watch each arc in one go, but do not try to marathon the entire series. Some downtime may be required to fully appreciate the themes and implications of each story and to recover from any resulting emotional fallout.

Phoenix concerns itself with some pretty lofty themes; birth, death, the meaning of life, mankind\'s place in the universe and the quest for immortality.The Phoenix is the classic fire bird that is reborn from the ashes, common to many mythologies both western and eastern - it\'s called Hi-no-Tori (bird of fire) in Japanese. Throughout the chronology of Phoenix, which spans eons, the bird...appears many times. Oftentimes to advise people, influence the development of life, observe or comment on man\'s folly. It is also an object of desire for people throughout time, as it is said that drinking it\'s blood will give one immortality. As it turns out, those that do achieve this suffer the most of all.It\'s hard to pin down what the Phoenix represents, it refers to itself many times as a galactic spirit, other times as one aspect of the life force of the universe. In any case, it is instrumental at key points throughout history.Tezuka began work on Phoenix in the mid 60s and continued to write it up until his death in 1989. He had intended to tie all aspects of the story, past, present and future, in the final chapter - unfortunately it remained unfinished. Phoenix contained a lot of experimental artwork and themes that were very advanced for the time such as ""Metropolis"" and many other fantastic works. Any fan of anime should know this famous legend revered as the ""god of Manga"" is indisputably the father of all modern Japanese comics and animation. His artistry and powerful story telling brings inspiration to audiences and other mangaka\'s all over the world.This 13 episode series was one of the many itterations of ozamu tezuka\'s Hi no tori manga. This was directed by Ryousuke Takahashi and covers the Dawn, Resurrection, Strange Beings, Sun and Future chapters. Well this was a very impressive series for the most part, I felt that they took too many liberties with certain chapters. In some cases totally changing the setting and cutting out massive chunks of the story in order to fit things in. For this reason I was left with the impression that the latter half of the series was somewhat rushed, it would have worked better if they\'d covered a smaller number of chapters in the same amount of episodes. (If you can some how find the manga, i would seriously recommend reading it as its the true spectacle of this classic masterpiece)All in all, this is a monumental series from one of the greats of anime and manga, ""Tezuka"" called it his ""life\'s work"". If you are up for something that will fascinate, amuse, surprise, shock and promote some interesting debate on the nature of existence, Phoenix is really worth a look. appears many times.

For fans of the manga, this may be a little disappointing.  On the other hand, they may be impressed by the fluid animation, music and history used in the story arcs set in the past.The art for some can be trying.  Tezuka's art style was largely inspired by old American cartoons, such as those produced by Disney, as well as Betty Boop among others, and the character designs reflect this....The 'futuristic' robots, computers and clothes may also seem very dated (think 'Lost in Space' dated).  The art however does pay a lot of attention to detail, specifically medical diagrams, and the Ainu style designs on the clothes in one of the arcs particularly caught my attention.Story is hard to describe, since the series is made up of five distinct, but loosely conected stories.  Elements found in all of the stories are the Phoenix, a mythical bird tied closely to the mysteries of life and it's blood is rumoured to grant immortality.  Saruta is also present in all stories, leaving it up to the reader to decide whether the various Sarutas are decendants or reincarnations of the original Saruta from the first story.  The stories also take place in many different eras, from the begining of time until the end of time.  The stories also do not follow a specific formula, and while each involves the Phoenix, the Phoenix is not always centric to the action.  Most if not all the stories contain themes of life, religion, death, love and nature to varying degrees, some of them focusing more on one theme than the others.  As mentioned before, fans of the series may be disappointed that all of the stories from the manga were not animatied.The music in my own oppinion is amazing, particularly the opening theme, which is very flowing and uses orchestral arrangements.  As great as it is, it does not overshodow the story, but rather ehnances it, and never seems awkward or clashes with the story or animation at any point.  All music is appropriate to the scene.In some stories characters must develop quickly.  Stories can take 1-5 episodes to complete, so some characters must develop faster than those in previous arcs.  While some characters do follow old archetypes and are unfailably good while others are unredeemably evil, there are some who blur the lines, switching sides, or having morally complex motives.  Props are also given to this retro anime for having female characters who fight alongside male characters.  Again, female characters can fall into stereotypes, such as the damsel in distress and evil queen, quite a few are equal with their male counterparts in terms of strength, speed and intelligence.  Child characters are often confined to minor roles, making these stories that focus on adults, but a few fiesty, strong and lovable kids manage to weasle their way into the limelight.I would recomend this particular title to a 13+ age group, especially for North American viewing.  This is not because North American audiences are stupid, but there are references to Eastern Religions that young children may not understand, references to Japanese history, violence (such as a man being shot by arrows Boromier-style) and character death that may be upsetting to younger viewers.  This is certainly a series recommended for Tezuka fans, fans of retro anime, fans of sci-fi anime and fans of historic anime.

I find brilliant this technique of alternating the past with future, because it illustrates both the wholeness...of human history and its recurrence. Also, the topics approached in each story are an occasion to reflect about the fact that we, humans, are driven by illusions that we cannot escape from, generation after generation, risking to overlook what's really important and thus, missing the opportunity to bring a salutary change in us. What I find a bit lacking at the anime is the connection between the stories. The Hi no Tori manga, on which this series is based, contains 12 stories which are far better connected. Presenting only 5 of the stories in the anime, while also eliminating some of the details, the unity weakens. Although the characters, especially the Phoenix Bird, have a big contribution to building a bridge between the stories, they still feel rather independent than parts of a whole.Characters:The characters are very representative. Not only that they reflect the human nature so accurately, as being full of flaws, capricious and impassioned, or, on the contrary, prone to self sacrifice and mercy; but we will often notice that some characters from the future's stories have a high resemblance or a similar position with characters from the past tales, thus enabling us to better grasp the previously mentioned common element. The Phoenix Bird has the greatest contribution to this aspect, because in addition to appearing in all the stories, it fulfills two important roles to help understanding the anime's overall message:1) Immortal creature, it highlights the passing of time;2) Achieving a role of both witness and guide, through its interactions with other characters, it helps emphasize the ardent topics presented in the anime.Yet, if I should mention a shortfall of the characters, I would say they are not so engaging emotionally. Despite showing well defined personalities and expressing intense feelings, the characters are less appealing than the themes and ideas presented.Graphics/Animation:I particularly liked the diversity of the characters' design as you could easily tell, from only the way they were drawn, what kind of personalities they had. The beauty and charm of some of the heroines became so obvious through the shape, seize and glowing of their eyes. I couldn't take my eyes off them! The animation is also good, describing so well the moments of tension, the action or the emotion. I particularly liked the scene where the quiet night sea gradually became lit up by the torches of the fleet that was approaching; I was also impressed with the illustration of a swirling vortex connecting two different worlds.Soundtrack:The traditional Chinese music elements were very suitable for the general context and tone.

Good Night World,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56146/Good_Night_World,"[""This was such a wasted potentialThis show had a very interesting premise, with some deep complex emotional and psychological topics, a nice story progression, a very interesting plot twist, with some relatively deep character development, just to throw it all away near the end, rushing into the finish line and disturbing their own established lore and logic.The characters are basically a family of strong players in a game, they help each other and act like a real family, but under the curtains they are people with miserable lives, using the game as an subterfuge to escape from reality, the main twist making it all...even more interesting to watch. If it wasn't good enough, the game it self also doesn't exactly turns out not to be as simple as it looked, with the family now being forced to fight not only to maintain their union, but also to potentially save the entire virtual world.Their motivations are kinda simple, but complex and well established, each one of the family members are trying to replace some aspect of their miserable lives with the in game family and features, unaware of whom each other are in real life, while trying to find some meaning for their lives. But then we get to the ending part.This feels like it should've lasted 24 episodes at least, or delayed the main conflict to a possible second season, giving more time to deepen the character's relations and insert more conflicts and twists, to better building up the final plot. Instead they just dropped it all out of sudden, and rushed into the end, to make into a one season thing, leaving a lot to be desired. Specially the threat to Virtual World thingy felt under developed, with several events near the end feeling out of place.It had a lot going for it, and they just fumbled. The worse part is that even if they made a possible sequel, it wont make any sense, they will be forced into a fresh start or something. They just wrote themselves into a dead end.This show made me love and hate it at the same time, from how wasted it was even more interesting to watch.

However there is no such healing at all. It was good until Ep 5, especially due to the difference of art style between real life and game, but went somewhere else after the twist in Ep 6.Good character design (not only their looks, but also their traumen and accompanied behaviors) and animation, but it seriously lacks coherence in the story. It shares many subjects with SAO, but failed to justify...itself like SAO did. (For example, brain damage from headgear is accepted by everyone, and this show also borrows it. But there is not enough explanation here how AI can damage people in real world even though they are not playing that game.)The worst is that it is full of violent and unpleasant killing with detailed portrait of dead body. Not recommended to those who are looking for happy story, or well developed storytelling. Only for gore fans. I can\'t rate this below average due to the quality of the animation, but to talk about the story only, it\'s 2/10. itself like SAO did.

"", ""To say that this anime is a mixed bag for me would be an understatement.On the one hand, it’s well-animated and has a pretty interesting visual design to its world and characters. They come off as distinct, both in the game world and the real world of the anime.On the other, it’s built on a pretty absurd narrative where four people from the real world who live in an extremely dysfunctional family also just so happen to form a family within the game world full of other players without knowledge of who the others are. It doesn’t help that it remains unclear to the very...end how they formed their in-game family, especially given the lead characters’ rejection of other bonds within the game. Yes, there's a small hint of how they might have gotten here, but it only invites more questions than it answers.On the one hand, it tells the story of a young man whose life is consumed by the games he plays and really gets into his headspace, giving you a deep understanding of why he chose to invest himself in the game PLANET and further deepening his character as the series goes on.On the other hand, virtually every other character gets an exposition-heavy backstory. Exposition seems to function as the main way to explain what happened in the past and, in many cases, what’s going on in the present. There’s a lot more tell than show in this series, which may explain why the characters are invested, but does little to invest watchers of this anime. And some of those characters that are central to plot developments feel like they get no backstory at all, in particular Hana Kamuro and Shigatera.On the one hand, there’s a really solid plot twist about halfway through this series and another about three quarters of the way through that kept me guessing about where things would go. It also includes some legitimately solid nightmare fuel.On the other hand, so much of the narrative and worldbuilding seems constructed around that heavy-handed exposition. We spend much of the series not understanding basic character motivations, which limits our ability to empathize or understand them meaningfully. Even when it comes to just establishing how the gameplay works, the series gives us little exposited statements from time to time, and largely just leaves the rest to our imagination. It yields some good fight scenes, but a fleshed out game this is not.So, yeah, it’s a mixed bag. It really doesn’t help that the ending is a bit of a clusterfuck, in terms of last minute revelations, emotional heel turns, and a reset for the ages. Perhaps that can all be explained by a moment just before we roll to credits, but if that’s where the narrative was going, then that just raises more questions. It’s strange how toothless the series feels in the end, seeming to undermine itself before credits roll. There are a lot of good ideas buried in here, but I feel like it's less than the sum of its parts, losing out on opportunities to make the most of its varied elements. end how they formed their in-game family, especially given the lead characters’ rejection of other bonds within the game.

It heavily suffers from trying to fit too much into a short runtime. There\'s just not enough time spent on each thing that it does, and instead it all just ends up feeling like an amusement park. It keeps grabbing your attention with something, but before that idea sets in the story has already moved on and might never bring it up again. It seems that the story author was trying to cram in so many different cool ideas that would be good enough to develop into an entire episode or...even a whole series, but each of these ideas is just a single minute or two of one episode.I\'m not going to pick this one apart because it would take way too much time. When you have 10 story twists per episode, there are plot holes. Many, many plot holes. This plot might as well be swiss cheese, and it barely gets saved by leaving everything vague enough that it doesn\'t become offensively obvious. It\'s just a complete mess that I doubt anyone would be willing to sift through. Additionally, when a story moves at the pace that this one moves at, almost everything becomes plot convenience. If you find yourself asking, ""why?"", then the answer is plot convenience. There\'s no rules to anything, and up until the very last seconds of the story it is still trying to cram in more twists.Despite everything bad that I could say about it, somehow it still has some impact. Even if those cool ideas are all wasted potential, they are still momentarily fun and exciting regardless. If you are capable of shutting your brain off, the story can be very entertaining. I would liken it to \'Future Diary\', where despite breaking a world record for deus ex machina\'s per minute in anime, it can still be very effective at keeping you engaged so long as you don\'t question it. Instead of deus ex machina\'s, this anime breaks a world record for plot reveals/twists per minute. Sometimes the rules of good story telling can be ignored for the sake of entertainment.That\'s all I really want to say about it. From a technical standpoint (animation, soundtrack, VA, character design, art direction), everything is above average but nothing will stand out as memorable, very 7/10 in that department.I would recommend you to watch this anime if you aren\'t bothered by a confusing or contrived story, you like plot twists, and you like the idea of a dark psychological family drama. I would also recommend it if you are the kind of person who likes sad stories and cries easily because this one will probably make you cry. I would also recommend it if you like horror, because this anime is deserving of a horror/gore tag.Otherwise, you are going to want to be drunk/high if you plan on watching this.

I also get the impression it's really made as a cynical cash-in, but I can't explain why for spoiler reasons. Avoid avoid avoid.My first issue is with the key characters. This anime is set up to be about the 'family', but it isn't really. The mother barely shows up and gets no arc at all, the younger brother gets plenty of screen time but little to do. This anime is about an angry neet who hates...his dad, and the father in question who is a total b*stard. The in game family is around for half an episode, so all those cool clips you saw in the trailer? They're everything you get. If you want to see the in-game family work as a team and be a family you get roughly 15 minutes of this.My second issue is with the plot. It's nonsense, by and large. It drifts between various elements, adding layers and randomly jumping between them with little sense of flow. On at least one occasion it sticks with a storyline for most of an episode in a way that makes it really obvious there's a twist coming. It's taken ideas, and large chunks of plot, from other much better anime. Except not in a way that really makes any sense.My other minor issue is the fight scenes, which are embarrassing.

One never really gets too close to a character, making portrayals of characters shyful.Furthermore, the virtual world and its rules are not completely explained, which is also a shame as would have made the story more appealing.All in all, another average anime, the art is OK, not breakthrough, and it...does not have memorable music. does not have memorable music.', 'A really unique anime.

I liked the art style of the in game cast and the more intense moments were great.This was a very entertaining show. The original premise had a unique hook that several people will gravitate towards. A broken family playing at a pretend family in a game without knowledge of each others identities. I feel as though this original idea could have been extended and done better than what the anime goes down. The anime did a nice job of setting up hints and pulling peoples legs as...things unfolded. Several threads arose which were quite interesting such as piecing together the split in the family, the introduction of the black bird and the real effects on their world. I enjoyed the in game stuff for the first 5 or 6 eps. And then we diverge.We find out Pico is not real but an Ai core to this thing known as the Black Bird and is dealt by the creator of the game who is Taichirou and Asuma father. We were given like roughly an episode length to learn about Pico just to realize she was never real and she never existed physically. Then its revealed the Black bird was some Ai made by the father which fed on human emotions and became rampant and powerful. People in game touched by it would have their mind and body separated, and their mind is trapped in a virtual nightmare as this virus subjects them to this hellhole of endurance trials which involves them dying multiple times. A mind breaking experience and one unforseen. The story soon becomes critical as we learn this Ai touches Asuma and forces Taichirou to take action to save him as well as a hunt for this black bird by Kojirou.Then we have the last arc of this show which involves one of the characters revealing to be the Ai computer virus. It then, with the help of this delusional character, basically eats or merges with many players to gain more power and soon gains enough power to blend reality with the virtual realm. Like....what? It just happens. So the two worlds are combined and this thing becomes that of a god and the family we follow basically sets out to confront and end this nightmare. I will say this was definitely a unique idea and a story line I was not expecting. I think the first and second arcs of this show could have been wonderful. But this last arc put a wrench in things by merging reality without any sort of explanation. There were clues thrown around that were pretty generic such as something happening to the familys daughter and the father creating an AI which led to this. But I enjoyed that and can gloss over several of these glaring plot elements. This is a complete work which I\'m grateful since this does not need any more content. While I did have gripes with the story, it was still a fun ride.For characters, we have the Akabane Family or the Arima Family in real world.Taichirou- A shut in brother. He looked up to his father and learned about computer coding from him. He loved his family until the incident that took his sister. He began to hate the world and escape to games. He began to wallow in his hatred towards his brother and father. His growth throughout the series was fun. Showing his shitty personality to him growing as a character. He was isolated but grows close to Pico which slowly breaks him out of his shell. From there, he become an older brother figure to save his younger brother. Finally, he rejects his fathers perfection and attempts to drag him back with anger. Rather heartwarming seeing him call his father ""Dad"". A rather generic archetype but loved his growth a lot.Asuma- While I did enjoy his backstory, his arc felt cut short. It would have been nice to learn about his unique name of ""AAAAA"". After he is saved from the Black Bird, he kinda lingers in the background. He does serve as the optimist. I like his thinking of there is terrible things in the world. But things are better at least with everyone close to him alive. Even if reality has been altered.Miyabi- A shining light in this family. However, we never did get much info on her side of things. We only ever learned that she never did recover from the loss of her daughter and abandoned the house. It would have been nice to see why she joined Planets and how she came into contact with the others.Kojirou- A shit father yes. They really highlight this. His treatment of his daughter was evident. That loss led him to despair as he tried desperately to bring her back some way. In the end, he does become connected to his sons one last time as well as manages to reunite with some version of his daughter. Sometimes I liked him and other times, yeah he sucks.Supporting cast- Only real noteworthy member was Pico and maybe her crew. I did not care much for Leon nor for Sasmata. I enjoyed Pico\'s story though it kinda felt like a waste with her reveal. I will say though she did get a happy end which was surprising but ill take it.Overall: Show had an interesting setup. They introduced a pivotal plot that could have been good but spiral into some guy managing to create a computer virus to directly affect people and reality without providing sufficient reason as to why. Endurance trials did not make much sense either. Main cast were fun and enjoyed their growth but was lacking for some of them.

The premise of a world full of AI and simulations with it being successful at exploring Trauma.I think the ability to show accurate plot twists and trauma whilst depicting varied and non linear perspectives on characters was really well done.However the first few episodes are tough jts tough to get into theirs nothing about it that innately hooks you in, I mean at first it just feels like another Isekai with a select few OP characters - I thought...it would be about not becoming a shut in anymore or something along those lines.Instead their was an interesting psychological show that explores trauma and the effects of AI on society and how it all merges together the anime really really picks up around episode 4 that’s when it hits you - some characters are grossly underused but a few *SPOILER* deaths are explored really really well you actually feel pity and when you learn a certain character is an AI it completely shocks you then hooks you in.I think the anime could’ve done better at how it illustrates other characters but unfortunately 12 episodes makes it hard to world build a very intricate world with multiple characters.Certain characters are just completely forgotten about and we never learn anything about them or what happened to them- I think their was potential and more ways to explore said potential but all in all i think for what it was it was pretty good even though certain episodes struggled to really be all that captivating with certain scenes really dragging on it would be about not becoming a shut in anymore or something along those lines.Instead their was an interesting psychological show that explores trauma and the effects of AI on society and how it all merges together the anime really really picks up around episode 4 that’s when it hits you - some characters are grossly underused but a few *SPOILER* deaths are explored really really well you actually feel pity and when you learn a certain character is an AI it completely shocks you then hooks you in.I think the anime could’ve done better at how it illustrates other characters but unfortunately 12 episodes makes it hard to world build a very intricate world with multiple characters.Certain characters are just completely forgotten about and we never learn anything about them or what happened to them- I think their was potential and more ways to explore said potential but all in all i think for what it was it was pretty good even though certain episodes struggled to really be all that captivating with certain scenes really dragging on', ""Didn't expect it to be so good.I've started reading the manga a few years ago but then dropped it after a few chapters because it seemed like the thing with family being together online will be the whole plot. I started the anime expecting to also drop it after a few episodes, relying on my past experience, but it really hooked me from the start and turned out to be much deeper.The characters are very well written. The relationships in the family felt real. There are so many scenes that show how three-dimensional the characters are.

It should’ve been a good and quite praised series, and yet it’s not, why’s that?Inconsistent aestheticsThe first and most superficial reason, yet true to these days, is that visually is not great. For a show about people playing a videogame, the game itself doesn’t look very engaging, the avatars look plain and some are not very different from the real people using them,...the setting in the game is both typical and unexplored, the artwork, backgrounds and special effects in it look outdated for a 2023 anime. The real world looks more polished than the VRMMORPG that the characters play, despite being limited to a house, a hospital, and buildings, the artwork in the real world and the backgrounds in it look more detailed and updated than the virtual world, even the real character designs are more interesting to look at than their in-game avatars, how is that possible? I swear, in this trapped in a videogame sub-genre, only .hack//Sign did the designs properly, and that’s the oldest and one of the worse looking of them all!Uneven atmosphereFor a series that tries hard to be a psychological thriller and at times even horror, it sure likes to mix the oldest, most simple, most generic, childish even, type of comedy, and a lighthearted adventure type of feeling during the game, and that clashes a lot with the pretense of a serious show about serious topics. Plus, just like the visuals, the in-game soundtrack and sound effects go completely unnoticed and aren’t impactful enough. Again, the real world just sound better, especially when reality begins to collapse near the end of the series. Voice acting is not very impressive on either side, but works just fine for what the series needed and was going for.Interesting concept and themes but bad writing and characterizationNow on to some real issues regarding the writing itself. Superficially, Good Night World should’ve worked just fine, especially for our current times. It’s about game addicts, a very relevant topic today, that play a videogame using virtual reality, so the technology is up to date, if not advanced and a tentative look into a possible future, and the main ones are all a family, so it also tackles into the internal issues of a dysfunctional family, it has an ever present and catchy element of an advanced AI developing itself to the point of becoming semi sentient, and threatening to take over the world, and a villain that thinks that that’s what’s needed in order for humans to take a needed next step in evolution for both the species and the world itself and that kind of stuff, eventually the two worlds and realities start to converge and collapse into each other and a lot of people die either mentally or both mentally and eventually physically, as it usually goes with this type of premises, so the scenario is both familiar and on theory exciting, as the stakes are seemingly incredibly high, one of the main characters is directly responsible for everything that happens, and having someone that tries to fix past mistakes it’s always catchy and relatable, and everyone is messed up in one way or another, which well-handled can potentially lead to powerful character development and arcs. The problem lies in the writing itself and its poor handling of everything.OverreactionsFirst of all, if you thought that people on previous videogame anime took their games seriously to the point of making you cringe, think again after you watch this because this anime takes it to a whole new level. Over here there is the inceptive of money alright, and a big prize at that, but only a few characters are really interested in that, others just want to escape reality within the game, and get extremely offended when someone say that ”it’s just a game” and take it on a personal level. Regardless of their motivations for playing the game, everyone acts like psychos, which is all well as far as showing how extreme some real people from our real world can take it, and as long as the payoff is good, but over here you never feel that that’s the case, as most characters stay the same without changing in the least, while the only few that develop do it in a way that feels like character rewrite instead of organic development.Weak characterizationThe main characters themselves are very messed up, a shut-in nini that only cares about his unreal family and that only knows how to say shit and fuck, his brother, who is completely different in-game than he is in reality, a chronically online mother, away from the family, or so it seems, and a neglected father who is honestly a complete piece of shit and only makes matters worse. In short, they are all awful and you don’t really want to follow them, at least not without knowing if they change and grow to be better by the end of it.And as it turns out, none of them do, or at least not in a way that feels plausible. The older brother is the one with the most focus in the whole series, and the one you feel will be the hardest to develop, yet he takes most big revelations straight and changes completely by the end of the series, although in sudden ways. For such a character, he sure can adapt and grow as a person rather fast, and that is not very believable, especially for someone that never tried to fix his “shitty reality”.The younger brother is completely different in reality than he is in the game, and although that’s fine and a good representation of what can happen in real life as well, once you get to know his real self you notice how he lies to others and himself, and that he seemingly is aware of everything that’s happening. Just like his older brother, he doesn’t even try to do something to fix the situation, making him a big hypocrite with an unbelievable change with no buildup throughout the series.The father is plain awful, just how much can you mistreat your wife and kids, act completely different in-game, be responsible for numerous deaths, create something terrible without taking proper care of it, and that leads to a big catastrophe, and still be forgiven and redeemed because of “reasons” and “character development”? Well, this character sure can’t, as he is consistently awful throughout the whole show, until he does the most unbelievable 180 at the end of the anime and gets the most undeserved happy catharsis I’ve seen in an anime in my whole life, man, and I thought Domain of Murder was bad at that.And the mother is completely wasted in the anime, she is never looked into, she reappears in the real world of the series out of nowhere in her presentation scene, she reconnects with her sons just fine making it seem that the problem wasn’t that big nor very difficult to solve in the first place, the anime hints at her being possibly cheated on, adding to making her a miserable character, she knows the way younger girl that’s interested in her husband, with the connection between them never being cleared, and does absolutely nothing of importance throughout the series, nether in-game or outside of it, she is just there, not even playing the role of emotional or moral support of the family that ties it together in the end, that’s something that the men, forced by the writing, do by themselves, so she is relegated to a character that does not do even that.And that’s only for the main ones, if you want to talk about the secondary characters, one is a psycho obsessed with money, others like to distress by being assholes in-game but remain completely unexplored otherwise, the main antagonist wants to erase and rebuild the whole world while being a literal kid that is not fleshed out nearly as much as needed so where the hell does he come from with that, others take their in-game role very seriously and are perfectly fine with dying for his cause without being fleshed out in the least, and there is even one that gets a lot of focus for a few episodes, that acts like a spoiled and bratty child, doing what she wants only out of a superficial and childish “love” for a person that she doesn’t really know about and that only used to be edgy along with her, and for what? To have all of her backdrop story to be revealed out of nowhere as a completely fabricated lie before literally being erased from the story, talk about a complete waste of time and pacing and also, bro, what the hell am I watching?Ridiculous revelationsThat one particular character that turned out to be an AI is just the prime example of the numerous instances where the series wants to catch the viewer by surprise with a big revelation, or a newly introduced element and topic, a big plot twist that changes the series completely, or a cliffhanger that makes the audience impatient to watch the next episode. It was done so much to the point of having no downside to take everything in or connect with the characters, or let them be explored and developed in a way that feels organic, and above all, it was done in a way that nothing seemed anticipated in any way and everything felt like an asspull. The best way I could come up with to describe the show, is if .hack/Sign was written by JJ Abrams, a guy known for stuffing his products with numerous plot twists and plot points just to surprise the viewer without ever caring about consistency nor logic. And apparently I’m the only one who thought that a series with broken people trying to connect with others through a videogame, something that they couldn’t do in the real world with their real families, an advanced AI going crazy and affecting the real world and people, and a dead girl resurrected in a way, in the form of an AI, and being hidden in a game as one of its main objectives and reasons for its existence, with a girl falling in love with the protagonist and trying to reconnect him with reality, and anti-escapism messages, is similar to that anime, guess that shows how much it was forgotten.Inconsistent stakesAs it’s usually the case with badly written fiction, side characters receive the worst outcomes for the sake of making it seem like there are stakes, while the main ones go practically unharmed. Secondary assholes? They get trapped in an eternal limbo of mental torture until they fucking die, but the main ones? They can find a solution that has practically no way of working, and yet it works only for them. Other unlucky side characters die when the two worlds start to collapse into each other and onto themselves? The main ones go completely unharmed with no problem, even the ones that are considered unimportant for the making of a new, better world or whatever.Asspulls and cheesy writingAnd why is that? Well, aside from being the main characters, it’s because they get to keep the super powers they have in-game in the real world, or develop even better and more broken new ones in a hurry without much explanation other than the very short and not very clear sequences that are supposed to excuse what’s happening on screen, even though the show does spend a good chunk of time in exposition about less relevant stuff that goes nowhere, during previous episodes. In case they don’t, they’ll find an improbable solution just fine, based on the power of love or some corny shit like that, don’t worry about that.Immature presentationAnd of course, all of that comes accompanied with an edgy presentation. Messed up characters, everyone swearing, yelling at the top of their lungs, gory imagery, no subtlety whatsoever. For a series that wanted to explore serious themes and topics, it comes off as a pretentious edgy shocking show for teenagers instead.Conflicting ending and messagesThe finale is the typical happy one that seemed to have fixed everything with a reset of sorts, which is lazy in itself, but even then the anti-escapism messages are not well delivered, as the characters change completely in ways that don’t feel organic, and if the very last scene means what it suggests, then they didn’t really actually manage to escape, so what was even the point of the whole thing? It affects the main message because of that, you can’t have a proper message if the character arcs which are the base for it aren’t well handled, and the ending goes against and contradicts said message.Rushed pacingPerhaps, the result of every issue besides the presentation is the rushed pacing itself, which tried to cram a 52 chapter manga in a single season tv anime series. Pluto managed to do that but only by adapting everything into hour long episodes, at the expense of accessibility and enjoyability, while Good Night World clearly tried to do the exact opposite thing. Based on one review I read, it seems that even the source material has this issue of having a short yet very overcomplicated and overstuffed plot with poor handling, but it’s still clear that the anime tried to do a speedrun of the whole thing and threw as many revelations and plot twists per episode as it could in order to come off as exciting, engaging and addictive, and just like it happened to The God of Highschool some years ago, it backfired horribly because you can only do it so much before even most of the casual viewers are unhappy with your product.ConclusionAs a whole, I found it to be an ambitious and semi memorable show with many interesting ideas and good intentions within a rather complex and layered plot, but poor decisions in its handling, pacing and progression, ending, tone and presentation, that ended up ruining the whole thing. Interesting to give it a try for its themes and topics, but a not worth watching complete mess as a whole. I’d suggest watching .hack//Sign instead, if you are a veteran viewer that can stomach very talky and slow moving plots. the setting in the game is both typical and unexplored, the artwork, backgrounds and special effects in it look outdated for a 2023 anime.

I swear, in this trapped in a videogame sub-genre, only .hack//Sign did the designs properly, and that’s the oldest and one of the worse looking of them all!Uneven atmosphereFor a series that tries hard to be a psychological thriller and at times even horror, it sure likes to mix the oldest, most simple, most generic, childish even, type of comedy, and a lighthearted adventure type of feeling during the game, and that clashes a lot with the pretense of a serious show about serious topics. Plus, just like the visuals, the in-game soundtrack and sound effects go completely unnoticed and aren’t impactful enough. Again, the real world just sound better, especially when reality begins to collapse near the end of the series. Voice acting is not very impressive on either side, but works just fine for what the series needed and was going for.Interesting concept and themes but bad writing and characterizationNow on to some real issues regarding the writing itself. Superficially, Good Night World should’ve worked just fine, especially for our current times. It’s about game addicts, a very relevant topic today, that play a videogame using virtual reality, so the technology is up to date, if not advanced and a tentative look into a possible future, and the main ones are all a family, so it also tackles into the internal issues of a dysfunctional family, it has an ever present and catchy element of an advanced AI developing itself to the point of becoming semi sentient, and threatening to take over the world, and a villain that thinks that that’s what’s needed in order for humans to take a needed next step in evolution for both the species and the world itself and that kind of stuff, eventually the two worlds and realities start to converge and collapse into each other and a lot of people die either mentally or both mentally and eventually physically, as it usually goes with this type of premises, so the scenario is both familiar and on theory exciting, as the stakes are seemingly incredibly high, one of the main characters is directly responsible for everything that happens, and having someone that tries to fix past mistakes it’s always catchy and relatable, and everyone is messed up in one way or another, which well-handled can potentially lead to powerful character development and arcs. The problem lies in the writing itself and its poor handling of everything.OverreactionsFirst of all, if you thought that people on previous videogame anime took their games seriously to the point of making you cringe, think again after you watch this because this anime takes it to a whole new level. Over here there is the inceptive of money alright, and a big prize at that, but only a few characters are really interested in that, others just want to escape reality within the game, and get extremely offended when someone say that ”it’s just a game” and take it on a personal level. Regardless of their motivations for playing the game, everyone acts like psychos, which is all well as far as showing how extreme some real people from our real world can take it, and as long as the payoff is good, but over here you never feel that that’s the case, as most characters stay the same without changing in the least, while the only few that develop do it in a way that feels like character rewrite instead of organic development.Weak characterizationThe main characters themselves are very messed up, a shut-in nini that only cares about his unreal family and that only knows how to say shit and fuck, his brother, who is completely different in-game than he is in reality, a chronically online mother, away from the family, or so it seems, and a neglected father who is honestly a complete piece of shit and only makes matters worse. In short, they are all awful and you don’t really want to follow them, at least not without knowing if they change and grow to be better by the end of it.And as it turns out, none of them do, or at least not in a way that feels plausible. The older brother is the one with the most focus in the whole series, and the one you feel will be the hardest to develop, yet he takes most big revelations straight and changes completely by the end of the series, although in sudden ways. For such a character, he sure can adapt and grow as a person rather fast, and that is not very believable, especially for someone that never tried to fix his “shitty reality”.The younger brother is completely different in reality than he is in the game, and although that’s fine and a good representation of what can happen in real life as well, once you get to know his real self you notice how he lies to others and himself, and that he seemingly is aware of everything that’s happening. Just like his older brother, he doesn’t even try to do something to fix the situation, making him a big hypocrite with an unbelievable change with no buildup throughout the series.The father is plain awful, just how much can you mistreat your wife and kids, act completely different in-game, be responsible for numerous deaths, create something terrible without taking proper care of it, and that leads to a big catastrophe, and still be forgiven and redeemed because of “reasons” and “character development”? Well, this character sure can’t, as he is consistently awful throughout the whole show, until he does the most unbelievable 180 at the end of the anime and gets the most undeserved happy catharsis I’ve seen in an anime in my whole life, man, and I thought Domain of Murder was bad at that.And the mother is completely wasted in the anime, she is never looked into, she reappears in the real world of the series out of nowhere in her presentation scene, she reconnects with her sons just fine making it seem that the problem wasn’t that big nor very difficult to solve in the first place, the anime hints at her being possibly cheated on, adding to making her a miserable character, she knows the way younger girl that’s interested in her husband, with the connection between them never being cleared, and does absolutely nothing of importance throughout the series, nether in-game or outside of it, she is just there, not even playing the role of emotional or moral support of the family that ties it together in the end, that’s something that the men, forced by the writing, do by themselves, so she is relegated to a character that does not do even that.And that’s only for the main ones, if you want to talk about the secondary characters, one is a psycho obsessed with money, others like to distress by being assholes in-game but remain completely unexplored otherwise, the main antagonist wants to erase and rebuild the whole world while being a literal kid that is not fleshed out nearly as much as needed so where the hell does he come from with that, others take their in-game role very seriously and are perfectly fine with dying for his cause without being fleshed out in the least, and there is even one that gets a lot of focus for a few episodes, that acts like a spoiled and bratty child, doing what she wants only out of a superficial and childish “love” for a person that she doesn’t really know about and that only used to be edgy along with her, and for what? To have all of her backdrop story to be revealed out of nowhere as a completely fabricated lie before literally being erased from the story, talk about a complete waste of time and pacing and also, bro, what the hell am I watching?Ridiculous revelationsThat one particular character that turned out to be an AI is just the prime example of the numerous instances where the series wants to catch the viewer by surprise with a big revelation, or a newly introduced element and topic, a big plot twist that changes the series completely, or a cliffhanger that makes the audience impatient to watch the next episode. It was done so much to the point of having no downside to take everything in or connect with the characters, or let them be explored and developed in a way that feels organic, and above all, it was done in a way that nothing seemed anticipated in any way and everything felt like an asspull. The best way I could come up with to describe the show, is if .hack/Sign was written by JJ Abrams, a guy known for stuffing his products with numerous plot twists and plot points just to surprise the viewer without ever caring about consistency nor logic. And apparently I’m the only one who thought that a series with broken people trying to connect with others through a videogame, something that they couldn’t do in the real world with their real families, an advanced AI going crazy and affecting the real world and people, and a dead girl resurrected in a way, in the form of an AI, and being hidden in a game as one of its main objectives and reasons for its existence, with a girl falling in love with the protagonist and trying to reconnect him with reality, and anti-escapism messages, is similar to that anime, guess that shows how much it was forgotten.Inconsistent stakesAs it’s usually the case with badly written fiction, side characters receive the worst outcomes for the sake of making it seem like there are stakes, while the main ones go practically unharmed. Secondary assholes? They get trapped in an eternal limbo of mental torture until they fucking die, but the main ones? They can find a solution that has practically no way of working, and yet it works only for them. Other unlucky side characters die when the two worlds start to collapse into each other and onto themselves? The main ones go completely unharmed with no problem, even the ones that are considered unimportant for the making of a new, better world or whatever.Asspulls and cheesy writingAnd why is that? Well, aside from being the main characters, it’s because they get to keep the super powers they have in-game in the real world, or develop even better and more broken new ones in a hurry without much explanation other than the very short and not very clear sequences that are supposed to excuse what’s happening on screen, even though the show does spend a good chunk of time in exposition about less relevant stuff that goes nowhere, during previous episodes. In case they don’t, they’ll find an improbable solution just fine, based on the power of love or some corny shit like that, don’t worry about that.Immature presentationAnd of course, all of that comes accompanied with an edgy presentation. Messed up characters, everyone swearing, yelling at the top of their lungs, gory imagery, no subtlety whatsoever. For a series that wanted to explore serious themes and topics, it comes off as a pretentious edgy shocking show for teenagers instead.Conflicting ending and messagesThe finale is the typical happy one that seemed to have fixed everything with a reset of sorts, which is lazy in itself, but even then the anti-escapism messages are not well delivered, as the characters change completely in ways that don’t feel organic, and if the very last scene means what it suggests, then they didn’t really actually manage to escape, so what was even the point of the whole thing? It affects the main message because of that, you can’t have a proper message if the character arcs which are the base for it aren’t well handled, and the ending goes against and contradicts said message.Rushed pacingPerhaps, the result of every issue besides the presentation is the rushed pacing itself, which tried to cram a 52 chapter manga in a single season tv anime series. Pluto managed to do that but only by adapting everything into hour long episodes, at the expense of accessibility and enjoyability, while Good Night World clearly tried to do the exact opposite thing. Based on one review I read, it seems that even the source material has this issue of having a short yet very overcomplicated and overstuffed plot with poor handling, but it’s still clear that the anime tried to do a speedrun of the whole thing and threw as many revelations and plot twists per episode as it could in order to come off as exciting, engaging and addictive, and just like it happened to The God of Highschool some years ago, it backfired horribly because you can only do it so much before even most of the casual viewers are unhappy with your product.ConclusionAs a whole, I found it to be an ambitious and semi memorable show with many interesting ideas and good intentions within a rather complex and layered plot, but poor decisions in its handling, pacing and progression, ending, tone and presentation, that ended up ruining the whole thing. Interesting to give it a try for its themes and topics, but a not worth watching complete mess as a whole.

Usually we ascribe a negative connotation with this word but there is some morbid curiosity to it that we can\'t help but see it to the end.This was Good Night World. The show gives you the premise in its very first episode. A dysfunctional family are all unknowingly playing the same MMORPG (massive multiplayer online role playing game) and hanging out with the same party even though they are all estranged in reality. How will they react once they know who each other are in real life? How does the show allow the family to organically find out for themselves?Then the show adds another...layer. There is a secret end game boss in the MMO but this isn\'t a regular end game boss... what sort of twists awaits the party when they challenge this boss?...But that isn\'t all. The show gives us another character aside from this family that has a deep bond with one of its members. How will her interactions affect the boss fight? And the future of our edgy MC? Is she the antidote that will heal our edgy MC spiritually and mentally?I have to admit, the interaction of Pico and Ichi gave me mad nostalgic vibes. I think anyone who have played MMOs and formed strong bonds in-game can relate to how authentic some of the experiences the characters go through. Of course, it\'s not like everyone have had their extreme experiences to this degree but we can still relate and reminiscence about the friendships in our own MMOs.Watch a bit further, and the train really goes off the rails. I say this in a completely neutral tone. I sometimes enjoy trainwrecks. I think the original writer really took the meme ""never let them know your next move"" to heart. The plot just continues to escalate in its twists and turns and seem to change genres on the fly. Eventually even the dialogue becomes unpredictable. You could have a really serious conversation and then the characters start talking about balding. The amount of random off-topic remarks is quite frequent, which, to be honest, made me laugh quite a bit since it\'s just so out of left field.The show can be absurdly funny, borderline non-sensical, seemingly riddled with a wild turn of events, but weirdly relatable at other times. Are many going to be turned off by the crazy amount of turns this show went through? Absolutely. Are there a ton of poorly explained themes and sequences throughout the show? Yep.

This one achieved that. It was different, good different.Whilst initially seeming like a show focused on family (at a surface level) we come to learn it is more so about ‘father son relationships’ and ‘loss’. Something that we see carried right through from the beginning to the end. The mother often being deliberately excluded from providing any main developmental role (typically out of the picture entirely). And yes, whilst the story explored other familial bonds such as ‘older & younger brother’ ones these were...by no means the driver of this story.Now, some aspects were certainly rushed, such as certain ‘realisations’ coming to surface a lot sooner than I would have liked them to. In light of this I certainly would have loved to of seen the story develop over the span of 24 episodes rather than the 12 we were given…It’s clear this story takes inspiration from previous narratives such as SAO, though as anyone could tell you this one ends up going in a very different direction. A direction that I found was actually pretty fresh compared to a lot of stuff we’re getting these days (and that reminds me, if you’ve come looking for the generic isekai experience/formula your certainly not going to find it here).Sure, to some this story may have come off a little rough but I at least appreciated what it’s doing. It was a decent watch with well designed characters. Even if two of those character designs were very clearly heavily based off Luffy and Whitebeard from One Piece hahaha.SPOILER (well sort of): I appreciated the seeming link this story held to the life of Alan Turing. by no means the driver of this story.Now, some aspects were certainly rushed, such as certain ‘realisations’ coming to surface a lot sooner than I would have liked them to.

The female characters are a failure, the daughter is developmentally retarded, the mother is non-existent except when she is threatened, Shiro's apprentice does what Shiro instructs her to do, despite being the second smartest character in the series. The failure to realize her potential is extremely frustrating. She has skills, and she acts as a cab, a fan service and an example of what not to do with a female character.Overall: 5/10"", 'This will feel weird for some people but this review will be my honest feelings.The story is well made if you break down the plot. It\'s just if they had enough time to build it...This is the structure of the plot which has good reasoning too.1) The structure of the online game they have is exactly how MMO game is... There would be hardcore gamers who steal looting or camp. Most MMO top rankers would usually live like either a NEET or streamers. Also, most end-game MMOs would be doing housing and staff. That\'s what the Akabane Family is. The author knows how MMO social...works to the core. Even the haters too. Yeah, haters are braindead exactly like that pirate traitor... Why? Check twitters... The social media format totally reflects Twittards even how they can\'t divide game and reality...2) The fiction breaking to reality is actually not even a theory anymore. It\'s happening right now in real-time. If you don\'t know humanity has already been able to replicate all 5 senses now. This was completed last year. With the latest VR set humanity can replicate eyesight, smell and sense of touch. With a TV that gives taste humanity now be able to give taste to those visuals... Yeah, sooner or later once humanity combines all that we will get all 5 perfectly virtual senses... It\'s only time when humanity can no longer know which are fake or real...3) AI singularity is still a theory however it is possible. It\'s just WHICH human is willing to test it out.4) All human brains have electronic signals that can\'t be translated to any computer. However, what if there\'s an AI that indiscriminately copies all info perfectly? Yeah... In theory, now they can pretty much do whatever with their brains... That\'s how 70% of people get sucked into the online world...5) The majority of the technology we have now has a connection to the internet and also can create any frequency that CAN affect our brain. This is where the Black Bird AI was used to connect every human to the online world. It is possible only if the computer can ""read"" a human\'s brain...6)AI needs tons of ref to grow which is exactly as we see in this series. The AI just ate them... Pure raw data...The story has an excellent plot but there are still problems...If you realise... Yes, the story that took me an essay to explain should NOT be a 24-ep series! No matter how you look at it this is totally rushing it!I will explain how those stories could have been broken down.1) Arc 1 Neglecting Reality - This could literally take 6 episodes with Ichi playing and grinding from level 1. This is also where the author can explain the game mechanics. As you know the story of him before meeting the Akabane Family as the legendary PK player. This is where Pico\'s story won\'t feel rushed too. Like having Pico around as his partner for 2-to 4 episodes... Meanwhile, they can throw a few refs of his harsh reality with him having dinner outside of gaming...2) Arc 2 New Hope - This is where they can even tell the story of HOW they got together as the Akabane family by coincidence. Then they take care of many dungeons to the point of being ""the game\'s strongest"" Yeah... Like so much potential wasted by poor pacing... This can be done in 6-8 ep... 2 ep per each character\'s story arc while also revealing their shocking reality.3) Arc 3 The Beginning of Despair Black Bird - This is where they can literally show the DAMAGE done by Black Bird. This can happen in 2-3 ep alone with Shiro trying his best to debug them.4) Arc 4 Untold Secret - This is where each piece of info gets revealed to all the cast... They will start to know who they really are and take a while to accept it. The only thing they did good is this... Yeah, 2 ep for the reveal. The problem is they can make it like 2-4 ep for everyone to talk and accept one another. That\'s a misopportunity.5) Arc 5 Final Fight - This is where they can make the whole battle amazing. Like, go all out with crazy battle animation for 1-2 ep.6) Arc 6 Epilogue - This is another one of the only things this show did good too. Is this open-ended nice? Yes!TBH the real problem isn\'t the story... It\'s the pacing. Its suck! I wish I was the editor for this author... I would name a few mistakes that he could make it great... This could have been another classic anime science fiction. It fails because everything happens too suddenly.The author is smart but only for plot settings... This must be why this anime even gets green-lighted. Reminder Netflix is a different breed now that a huge purge happens. Unless the quality is good, they will kick you out.This obviously gets accepted as a project because the plot sounds really good... It\'s a shame that the author sucks at making progressing story... It doesn\'t feel natural.My review for this show would be as follows.1) Characters => They actually reflect the family really well... It\'s just yeah could be better with better pacing.8/102) Stories => This one is a mess because it sounds unbelievable only because there\'s little time to process... The way this anime did is just throwing info not processing it. That\'s a 5/10... Not because the story sucks but poor pacing.3) Animation => Honestly it is normal. 7/10The score is 6.7/10.The potential is 7-8/10. Yes, if they had taken more time to build up such complex stories... works to the core. Even the haters too. Yeah, haters are braindead exactly like that pirate traitor... Why? Check twitters...

Yes, if they had taken more time to build up such complex stories...', '01 - ""I wonder why PLANET has such detailed features like this. There must be some very dedicated devs."" Five minutes before, the dragon was just frozen waiting for the little neck to fall to the ground, beautiful attention to detail indeed. I could even make solid arguments to defend the thesis that there\'s no way the little game family doesn\'t know they\'re actually a ""family,"" but their personalities change so dramatically that you just have to accept it. They really don\'t know anything about each other, and if you\'re not convinced, just follow the script.02 - Isn\'t Ichi a bit too old to be...creating edgy fanfic in the middle of a 2023 VR game? You\'d expect that from Kirito, it\'s already expected, but from the recluse with the atrophied leg? Really going to play house with three strangers gave him a boost in his life; now he just needs 99 more items on his New Year\'s checklist. Let getting a job be one of the priorities, how is it going to be Pay-to-Win if you don\'t even have a minimum wage, and to make matters worse, you can\'t even make an omelet. I wonder how a guy like this has a stalker, this woman must either be from the community soup, or she\'s 12 years old.03 - I\'ve seen many final bosses in games, but a giant beheaded chicken was the most innovative. On top of that, if you die to it, you lose sensitivity in half your body. That\'s worse than being the protagonist of Takt Op.Destiny. Worse than being a minor character\'s cattle that no one remembers from One Piece with the same name, just losing your arm to someone who doesn\'t even remember who you are. But even that doesn\'t surpass the fact that the father of the year here measures favoritism among his offspring by who has the cleanest programming code.04 - It\'s worrying how pirates in video games are all softies, apart from the names of the positions, they\'re the cream of the crop of public servants playing at exploring the seven seas. Where have you ever seen a teacher relieving stress by entering a virtual world? Don\'t they have tests to correct? Grades to ascend in the system? Other schools to teach at? The world is really lost; there\'s a girl pretending to be a pirate, not to mention the lack of clothing on this girl. If she hit puberty, your mom never got around to teaching what bras are for, combined with the secretary wanting an easy promotion, it\'s scary to think of this child having her first period with those glasses on her face.05 - Shigatera must have bumped his bald head on a tree branch when he was a kid, because there\'s no way he insists it was a consequence to accept any riff-raff into the guild, when in the end it was the stolen armor that saved his butt. I\'m sure Shiga is one of those annoying guys who selects members through a call on Discord. Spoke a lot of nonsense about only caring about women and money; that said, he probably ended up becoming a real-life job interviewer. A killjoy like that has surely told a child to stop acting like one. I wouldn\'t doubt he\'s living off someone\'s generosity in some dump, that\'s the only explanation for wasting 3 years of his life on this. In my opinion, it was never about the 300,000.06 - If BoJack Horseman taught me anything, it\'s that asshole parents can produce a child worse than themselves (just look at Dabi from BNH). But here it\'s different, this great father figure of Ichi has not only been toxic to his family until it collapsed, but also made sure his AI had a life just as bad, however, by not revealing this to her, he gave hope that: ""The real world may be full of pain... but you know, Ichi... i\'m not doing this for your sake. It\'s because i want to be with you!"" The worst part isn\'t seeing his death, or his last words completely denying this guy\'s sick Martyrs (movie) ideals, but knowing how everything could have been different for Ichi, If he had ended up having a childhood where he ""kite fighting"" in the middle of the street.07 - Top phrase from Good Night, World: ""It\'s seriously black!"" I don\'t know what he expected from an enemy named ""black bird,"" but it\'s not up to me to judge a poor soul like that; not only does he look like a society-rejected rocker, but the stoner face couldn\'t be missing either. The only thing that impresses me is that he\'s not in a wheelchair; to complain so much about others\' fun, he\'d need to have some ""limitation,"" besides low education, of course. After losing to the lowest level of Homo sapiens, even our protagonist goes back to school; if not for that, it would be to hunt down the most emotionally dependent girl on a Chuck Berry fan boy in the temple of knowledge.08 - ""You\'re My Sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy. When skies are gray. You\'ll never know, brother. How much I love you. So please, don\'t take my sunshine away."" And like magic, the world that was once full of problems now seems less suffocating; but one thing never changes, there are plenty of barber with a bought driver\'s license walking the streets, they\'re so incompetent behind the wheel that they seem to be genuinely trying to run over a civilian; they make sudden turns, strange reverses, step hard on the accelerator going straight over the curb, suspicious at least, it almost seems like a virus wearing a theater mask managed to create limbo for gamers; considering that 97% of the population is focused on making money with NFTs, I don\'t see a way around this situation, the only way is to accept this match of Plague Inc.09 - It never seemed to me that Ichi\'s father could be a good person. After all, the euphemism of the century would be not to say that even at the decisive moment, the epic duel between sperm and ovum, there he was, acting like the commander telling his troops that if they were to enter, they should not be defective and should already be born knowing algorithms. Otherwise, he\'ll just look for an opportunity to send you at 10 p.m. on a deserted street to your school, all for a notebook that apparently has the code of a nuclear warhead. I also couldn\'t expect any less from a bald guy who took a neurology course at TVET. I thought it was too little for this weasel to have only cut off this shameless one\'s legs, that\'s not where his pride is; and apparently being cynical is another one of your skills as a software engineer, really need to be very good to have a good fake cry, better than that only in a Univision soap opera.10 - I wonder how this old chipped man managed to be the Batman of video game anime; he made a copy of himself in the cloud, this one really took the database classes at college too seriously. Being honest, and I wish it had ended there; the image of a bald brawny guy releasing shine through the hands is surreal discomfort, I miss my old master Kame, he never left such a disturbing image in my head. As for Kojirou, I\'m afraid he\'ll show up in my deepest nightmares telling me to go buy half a dozen bread rolls at the corner bakery, and not just me, but the brothers too, only they get a little bonus, Kamuro saying that Shoppe\'s father suffered like all the others, so he doesn\'t deserve to be stoned so much.11 - Once Akibaranger taught me something: ""The adult who doesn\'t accept the cringe is less happy."" That said, I lost it all in this billiard ball that looks like it\'s about to release a kamehameha, only to then shout a Shaiah! So few things can cause such embarrassment; this shriveled raisin cared more about the secretary\'s death than her daughter\'s. And as if it couldn\'t get any worse, he rebuilt her entire Atama, almost explicitly saying: ""Look at my sex doll here. Oh, hello my son, thank goodness you\'re here, you have no idea the things I imagined with this warm body. Well, but let\'s bury her now?"" Moving on to a more family chat, how about we talk about the kid who watched the Supernatural pastor episode and now scams single mothers? No? Alright, I don\'t want to remember that either.12 - I wonder when the author lost himself in this script; a bunch of chained hair making binary code joke to the sound of an opera. Seriously, wouldn\'t it be easier to just go to the server room and blackout everything? This would be the only time no one would complain about seeing a blue screen on your interface; as I also wouldn\'t complain about never having to hear about binary again. There\'s also this pager with the death message, looking more like a mockery of the son\'s face; along with this old guy acting like Kazutora thinking he has zero guilt and his sins will be washed away with his death, that was the funniest and politically dumbest thing I\'ve seen in this whole anime. Never mind, I forgot he created a virus capable of destroying the world (Japan), all because there was a delay in your suffering, my daughter died a month ago, what a good idea it would be if I started to suffer now? Who knows, maybe I\'ll get my son\'s forgiveness, a tomb behind the house on the hill, and a Nobel prize if that\'s not too much to ask.Conclusion: I never thought I would see a copy of Vinland Saga that doesn\'t even have similar themes; since when was this supposed to be a revenge anime? A charisma-less Askeladd and a Thorfinn from a future gone wrong, there\'s no doubt that Ichi is now going to become a lot landscaper, become a father to plants, and become the greatest pacifist after being a great killer. ""You have no enemies"". Well pointed out, Ichi has no enemies, only a father with a god complex; the guy involved a child playing politics, teenagers full of traumas, AIs who didn\'t know the purpose of their existence, living someone else\'s life as if it were true. I desire I found the ending with Pico and Ichi AI beautiful, but what\'s the use if it looks more like another of DC\'s infinite stories by The Writer? Many things make for a bad ending.

And by that, I mean you have to ignore every weird things that happen. And how many weird things that happen you may ask? Well, a lot. If you able to ignore those, then it quite a fun show as it has a good emotional delivery.- Story is about a broken family who surprisingly met in the VR game world, and then as the story goes, they have conflict with evil AI in the game.- Story development is unpredictable because it give you plot twists every few episodes. Perhaps...that's what makes it weird.- art and animation was pretty good, although the fight scenes are few- character development is good too. Well, it's surprisingly well developed IMO- I recommend this anime for people who want a show only for emotional moment and not for people who cares about every little detail. that's what makes it weird.- art and animation was pretty good, although the fight scenes are few- character development is good too.

THE WASTED POTENTIAL.First of all, although I rated it a 7 this anime is not bad. Unfortunately, it just felt super rushed.The character development not just for the main protagonist could have been invested in more. The backstories were almost nonexistent for majority of the characters. This could have easily been made into a second season. The story essentially throws you into a world where OG players are in charge because they\'re shut in elitest but doesn\'t expand much into how they came to be.The plot felt all over the place, not really going into key points, but rather brushing over them....To move into the next ""action scene"".I understand this anime wanted to do a heartwarming plot twist to it, but it just felt forced and didn\'t really have connection.The art style was really nice, and parts of the anime had a RE: ZERO, SAO feel to it. without giving much away, you just don\'t find a lot of the similarities RE: Zero had to this is many animes nowadays. It is definitely what stood out to me the most.Overall, maybe if they lengthen this anime to explain key points, invest into character development I\'d rate it as it deserves. If you like Isekai\'s in general, or VR simulations you\'ll definitely enjoy this.

Taichiro had childish behavior. I can get that, he grew up without any parent figure in his life and didn’t live his childhood but still I don’t like him. Even Shinji did better job.

I had high hopes upon starting my watch. A family broken by an avoidable tragedy and their respective toxic coping mechanisms takes solace in a found family in the virtual world. Yet, the very people they were running from were the ones they came to care for most through their online alter egos, presenting a simulation of what their real life dynamic could have been if they\'d taken the time to empathize with and understand each...other rather than isolating themselves and accepting their own perspectives and assumptions about each other as the absolute truth. In my opinion that by itself would have been enough to carry the series, and I felt like all the sci-fi nonsense ruined what could have been a more meaningful experience.As the story goes on more and more ""cop outs"" and unexplained phenomenons appear, and by the end it\'s become so convoluted that the message is lost entirely. For example, I loved the episode that ended on a cliff hanger when Taichirou and his mother come to visit Asuma, who had been seemingly cleared of any danger, only to find him surrounded by feathers with black, empty eyes. The abrupt death of a main character could have been a powerful example of the fragility of human life and the true danger of the Black Bird, as well as how the father\'s neglect of his sons because of his grief over the death of his daughter led to Asuma\'s demise while he was busy with ""more important"" matters. But no, apparently his eyes were just bleeding and he ripped up his pillow??? Because he was bored??? I\'m calling BS.From that point on, it only got worse. It was never explained how the Black Bird could magically influence the real world or how emotions somehow equated to its power. If creepy coworker lady could create an AI copy of Taichirou, why didn\'t they just make a thousand copies of the father and send them in to destroy Black Bird? Why did Black Bird and Leon bother diddling around with the family and the pirates when Black Bird could have just eaten all his subordinates and taken over whenever he wanted to? Seeing the father\'s face pasted onto a muscle man body was comical. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfactory, and they even had to throw in a little is it still a simulation or not??? crap at the very end. I\'m kinda tired of the simulation within a simulation within a simulation trope. Made me think of the Rick and Morty episode where they were abducted by aliens who put them in simulations to get information from Rick.TLDR: The beginning had promise, the art is nice to look at, and there are good moments scattered throughout the show, but in the end the plot became so lazy and convoluted that its potential was wasted. other rather than isolating themselves and accepting their own perspectives and assumptions about each other as the absolute truth.

True, we're shown the father doing some really crappy stuff as the series progresses, and the younger brother--Eh, he says one thing and does another.More specifically, despite the crappy stuff the father says and the younger brother saying he hates shut-ins, they're both shown as acutely aware of the reason why the main character is a shut-in within the first few episodes and while their responses aren't the best responses to a family member in a similar situation, one can argue they're honestly trying to do their best, even the dad who is presented progressively more and more in a negative light. And the younger brother, who the main character complains about the most is actually dealing with the brunt of his older brother's mental health issues.Which, one would think this would be a far greater plot element than it is, and the reason why one of the themes here on MAL is psychological.And yet, the series fails the mental health issue horribly along with many other things as the creator of the series really didn't think through any of these things beyond shock value, but as the series progressed there just became more and more loose ends they weren't tying up, or things that weren't explored in the rich depth one expects of a psychological themed series. This in turn can end up being taxing on the viewer.So no, I don't recommend it for that reason, but also because I was left with the feeling the creator of the series wanted to capitalize on what's become a major plot theme - virtual reality, shoved in various things from existing series, yet never stopped and really thought about why the more successful ones were successful, which includes the interpersonal relationships which this series had for the first few episodes until it decided to throw that out the window, possibly to be different I guess, and the speculation regarding the probabilities of where virtual reality may somewhere down the line be, whereas this one doesn't stop and think if the things it does are probable, just whether or not the element is cool and/or delivers the wanted shock value.But yeah, what is set up for in the first few episodes never really pans out, so definitely not recommending. something the family looks down upon and despises the main character for, yet this is something we're told by the main character and what we're shown in real life contradicts this as none of his family members he says despise him actually do.

Note that some of it is my own opinion - take it as you will.The story takes place in the year 2024 where computers and technology are evrything.  It centers around a girl named Sora Yuki, a normal middel school girl who is rather out of the loop from the rest of her friends and classmates. However, this all changes once she starts to play the online game known as ""The World"". On her fist experience in the game, she gets involved in an incident and thus begins her...journey.Story 8:  The story is a bit plain with the use of recurring anime themes ; such as love triangles, commentaries/jokes on generation gaps and the famous: one who saves ""The World""(sorry, couldnt resist). But I like these types of stories so maybe thats why I\'m a little biased. Although its not like I\'m going to give it a pure 10, but I feel its fair to give it an average number of 8.Art 9:  To be honost, I expected the normal 2-D animation found in most(if not all) anime, but was surprised to see a 2-D/3-D combination.  It absolutely blew my mind. The art also shifts when they go into ""The World"" where the art mimics that of video game animation scenes.  Overall the art is unique and original and thats why I give it a 9.Sound 10:  OMG the sound, I dont even know. If you have ever played or watched .hack, you will probably feel some nostalgia.  But the main thing that blew my mind was that the Americans were actually speaking fluent ENGLISH. In most anime\'s, the foriegners usually speak in Japanese and it is just indicated that they are speaking English, but not here.  That is why I give it a 10.Character 7:  Overall the characters are not all that great and fall into common character types seen in anime. There is also little to no character development to anyone aside from the main character; but what can you expect from a movie - they cant make it like 5hours long(a 12 ep season).  But they are not entirely bad and that is why I give them a 7.  Plus Yuki\'s grandpa is hilarious.Enjoyment 9:  I personally enjoyed this movie. It tends to be a bit more serious near the end, but the begining allowed for some slice-of-life as well as some comedy.  I also enjoyed it because of the many refferences to the original .hack//sign that brought back many fond memories and thats why I give it a 9.Overall 9:  I have to say I really liked this movie. It has action, a little romance, comedy and the refferences are not so heavy that one would get lost if they never saw .hack. That is why I give it a 9 of 10 and recommend seeing it weather your a fan of .hack or not. journey.Story 8:  The story is a bit plain with the use of recurring anime themes ; such as love triangles, commentaries/jokes on generation gaps and the famous: one who saves ""The World""(sorry, couldnt resist).

It tends to be a bit more serious near the end, but the begining allowed for some slice-of-life as well as some comedy.  I also enjoyed it because of the many refferences to the original .hack//sign that brought back many fond memories and thats why I give it a 9.Overall 9:  I have to say I really liked this movie. It has action, a little romance, comedy and the refferences are not so heavy that one would get lost if they never saw .hack. That is why I give it a 9 of 10 and recommend seeing it weather your a fan of .hack or not.', 'Warning: This review comes from a fan of the series. Actual enjoyment of the movie may vary from person to person. I\'m a bit biased on this review, you are warned.Just like all of the series\' setting, the story took place in a virtual reality world called ""The World"", developed by a gaming company named CC Corp set in fictitious Japan in real world. Even though actual events in the movie happened in the virtual world, these events too have its effects on the real world namely people falling into some sort of coma which has been an issue from the story since the original...game back on the PlayStation 2, and other disturbances in the supposed real world in matters electronics.However, this particular movie release hasn\'t really strayed far from the ""tried-and-tested"" formula the franchise is known for which may appear cliched and even unoriginal (or even boring) given how many times already it has already been used, be it from the original game, anime series, OVA\'s, manga, and probably even the upcoming literary works. I, personally, was watching the movie looking for something new that the story might offer given the timeline of the movie from the overall series, sadly there\'s nothing new in it. Even the characters themselves (some of them) are nothing new but rather are just a recycle of previously existed models namely that of Kite, Balmung, and Orca only given new characters especially fit for the character they represent and the movie.Be that as it may, the movie is notable to its highly detailed animations which gives the movie an appeal to specific audiences such as myself who loves CG animated movies. The movie\'s animation and special effects can be stunning at times if you know how to appreciate art in this discipline. In terms of graphic presentation, this movie is superb.In terms of voice acting and music, I find no fault so as to dislike any of the two within the movie. Voice acting is just fine, if not very good, and so is the music.Overall, I find the movie very entertaining given I\'m a fan of the franchise. The overall experience may vary however if otherwise due to familiarity issues with both the story and characters as these two factors might affect interests for those who are new. However, with these two issues not being a concern and / or have overcome, watching this movie is a visual treat and entertaining especially if one is not expecting much from it. game back on the PlayStation 2, and other disturbances in the supposed real world in matters electronics.However, this particular movie release hasn\'t really strayed far from the ""tried-and-tested"" formula the franchise is known for which may appear cliched and even unoriginal (or even boring) given how many times already it has already been used, be it from the original game, anime series, OVA\'s, manga, and probably even the upcoming literary works.

The aesthetic was interesting in that it used two different styles for real and game worlds. The animation on the faces was fluid and detailed, especially on Kite.There were also a few fun moments when Sora starts playing the game and learns the controls.Cons....So now the bad stuff.The biggest issue is that this movie feels incredibly far removed from the rest of the series. Sure, there\'s the callback character designs to Kite, Balmung and Orca, Aura\'s in it and they play the ""note"" twice, but there isn\'t much tying this entry to the rest of the franchise.Everyone seems to have forgotten the events of G.U. and the original games despite the incidents making headline news at the time.No one recognized the Kite model (which is kind of hinted at to maybe actually be Kite, since it\'s  male despite having a female playe, premade, and named Kite but that doesn\'t go anywhere).They don\'t even seem to be playing the same game anymore (I know it\'s a different version of the World technically, but R2 kept a lot of the same classes and some of the areas from the first version). The big finale is an airship battle that looks like a cutscene from Final Fantasy XII.This movie basically tried to turn .hack// into a slice of life, shoujo story that kind involves MMORPGs, which theoretically could be good, but it\'s not even done well here.What made the .hack// series good was always how the various anime and games explored the reasons people played games, whether it\'s to escape from reality, make friends, kill time, etc. No other franchise ever looks at gaming and ""gamers"" the way .hack// did or has since and that made it unique for me.There is none of that here in this movie though. It feels as if someone unfamiliar with the franchise took a couple recognizable parts from earlier entires, threw them haphazardly into a safe, feel good plot. It\'s just lacking in all the key areas. So now the bad stuff.The biggest issue is that this movie feels incredibly far removed from the rest of the series.

But I'll give my best!after I watch this anime I don't really understand what its means. Then I watch again for the second time.the story isn't really complicated. I like the story because that make me touched. A girl who have a courage to do something for the one she love. or I should say she HAS to do that to save the one she love!the art is great. it made the character and the other things looks more natural,...just like  an ordinary film (3D objects).the sound is good. themes and ending theme was a great music.the characteristic of character was display by the action the character do or take.I really enjoy when I watch this movie. Its looks like I'm really in it and joins the adventure with all of the character!for overall of this anime I give a~jaaang!9 score! just like  an ordinary film (3D objects).the sound is good. themes and ending theme was a great music.the characteristic of character was display by the action the character do or take.I really enjoy when I watch this movie.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryThe usual jam with .hack franchise. New characters, MMO world, people get stuck and lose consciousness, finding the cause, solving it. It was good enough story, enjoyable, had fair amount of action and pacing felt right for the most part.✦Art&SoundArt is like watching some Anime MMORPG story cutscenes, awkward at times but overall felt quite good. Game menus and such things were a great touch for an MMO anime.Music&OST I love as usually in hack franchise. Not Kajiura this time, but KOKIA is as well superb Artist....✦CharacterI don\'t have to say much regarding characters. There were plainer ones and more interesting ones. Main cast was oddly plain, whilst bunch of side characters were quite intriguing.✦Enjoyment&OverallFun MMO world with really cool dungeon/raid\'esque part. Story was the usually .hack, characters were okay, music superb, so why not, did enjoy it. Yes, I did finish 1:50hr movie in a hour or so, as I sat behind PC, and when I watch Anime whilst sitting at PC I have tendency to skip forwards. But in the end I did enjoy the movie. ✦CharacterI don\'t have to say much regarding characters. There were plainer ones and more interesting ones.

But in the end I did enjoy the movie.', 'hack// is a famous franchise of animes and games centered in an online game. I myself have never watched or played any of those before I watched this movie. .hack//Beyond The World is set on 2024 and our protagonist is a young girl named Yuuki Sora. Now, there is an online game called ""The World"" and almost everyone plays this game. Yuuki Sora however doesn\'t want to play an online game, even though all her classmates, including her two bestfriends Kakeru Tanaka and Tomohiko Okano, continuously urge her to play this game. Even her grandpa (and his secret girlfriend lol) secretly plays this game. Now...The World is a virtual reality online game that they play through an app downloaded to phones and with the help of a ""face mount display"" (sunglasses) that users wear they are able to experience the virtual reality. When curiosity won and Sora finally tried playing the game, she was amazed by the surreal fantasy world and all the beautiful avatars(or Mascot, Player Characters) inhibiting it. However, immediately upon entering the world, she had an encounter on viruses that hid behind the beautiful facade of this world. These viruses are soon to be a threat not only to the virtual world but also to the real world.The plot is kinda straight forward and full of cliche story writing, but it is still entertaining nonetheless. Action fights look really good, the virtual world wasn\'t explored much (due to time restrictions of a movie which is about exactly 2 hours) but they still tried their best to present stuff about the world and the game. Besides the actions scenes and role playing game side, we are also offered a love triangle between our trio. The art is beautiful, a mix between 3D and Anime style 2D for the characters looked very good, the backgrounds are gorgeous and well detailed (specially the structures and the ships). The actions scenes are nice and beautiful to watch (plenty of cool looking special effects). Music is also good (specially the ones near the end which truly gives you that cinematic feel), plenty of good background music. Overall, the movie is decent, if your looking for something beautiful and entertaining to watch which is free from a very complicated plot, then this is for you.My Personal Rating: 8/10 The World is a virtual reality online game that they play through an app downloaded to phones and with the help of a ""face mount display"" (sunglasses) that users wear they are able to experience the virtual reality.

The main point I\'d like to make is that this .hack movie has an intriguing package but in the end is unsatisfactory.Story: I won\'t spoil anything but I want to say that the story is intriguing in the beginning, while the actual cause of the problems in The World this time to me is disappointing.Art: Good, even if I\'m not a big fan of this type of CG in movie animations, landscapes and characters (real and in The World) are well done.Sound: Fair, nothing special, just OK.Character: Good, personalities are well characterized and I\'ve empathized with the protagonists.Enjoyment: Fair,...the plot is engaging, the rhythm is well paced and the fights exciting, except for the ""last mission"" maybe.Overall: I think it\'s a fair movie, you can watch it if bored on a rainy night but the .hack series has better anime. the plot is engaging, the rhythm is well paced and the fights exciting, except for the ""last mission"" maybe.Overall: I think it\'s a fair movie, you can watch it if bored on a rainy night but the .hack series has better anime.', 'Take this ""review"" with caution, english is not my mother language so i feel i can\'t make a proper review, take this like a bunch of opinions of a friend of yours.So, long story short, i think this is more enjoyable if you aren\'t a fan of the series, paradoxically if you are a fan of the .hack// series i think this will leave you with a  bittersweet aftertaste. The story is basically about friendship and take place after years of all the main series (Sign, G.U, tasogare, ecc) we know, so aside the avatar\'s design of the main heroine and some events mentioned...this is totally unrelated to other series.The cgi is actually good when they are in ""The World"", at the same time is pretty bad when the story take place in the real world.The first half was pretty boring in my opinion, it focus a lot on the build up of the story(which is good) but taking place 70% of the time in the real world, so basically bad cgi. The second half have a lot of action and good coreography, but at the same time lacks something.For the sound repart: i\'ve seen the movie in japanese with english subtitle (yes,i understand english very well, but can\'t make a proper speech) and the voice actors weren\'t really good, in particular the voice actress of the main heroine was very annoying every time she screams. Honorable mention for the soundtrack, as always the hack series doesn\'t disappoint.Overall for me is a 5/10, good ideas here and there but with bland realization, this movie has its ups and downs but still enjoyable. this is totally unrelated to other series.The cgi is actually good when they are in ""The World"", at the same time is pretty bad when the story take place in the real world.The first half was pretty boring in my opinion, it focus a lot on the build up of the story(which is good) but taking place 70% of the time in the real world, so basically bad cgi.

At this point they only keep making more just to support the videogame franchise and not because it has anything new to show us in terms of context. Having followed the franchise through the years I can appreciate how it keeps trying to flavor the exact same premise and correct past mistakes. At the same time, WOOPS, it keeps making newer ones so it never manages to get something overall better than the rest.So what new minor improvements this version has compared to the older ones? Basically it is...up to date with the current gadgets.- It feels more natural (and cool) to see the game being played as a cell-phone application instead of a PC one. PCs are dying baby; everything is turning mobile!- Those bulky VR helmets have also being reduced to simple sunglasses. Everything keeps being miniaturized and looks trendier as years go by, so it makes sense.- There are AI pets used for file and schedule management. We have progressed a lot since the days of Tamagochi so this too looks cool.- As soon as you enter the game, a ton of advertisements start to fly all around you. The internet may be free but commercialism is not, lol.Too bad it couldn’t keep the amazing production values along with these additions. SENOMUNI happens to be the first fully computer generated HACK entry, meaning that everything is now 3D. That was supposed to be a good addition along with the rest for moving away from the 2D and entering the brave new world of 3D polygons. Sadly it isn’t because it looks very poor compared to what technology can do in the year it came out. All previous versions had amazing budgets for their time but this one is the first to look pretty run down, like it’s a patchwork of cut scenes from a PS2 videogame such as Kingdom Hearts. Hell, Spirits Within was made a decade ago and still looks ten times better than this thing. It’s so crude with its physics and bulky character models that it makes you wish it would instead be hand-drawn.And wait a second, this could have actually worked fine if it really was partially hand-drawn. It could go for the gimmick Black Rock Shooter used and could have the scenes taking place in the real world being traditional animation and the ones in the game being 3D as it is. It would at least save some face by excising it to look like a crude videogame. And sadly none of the guys in the production team thought of something as simple as that.But even with that gimmick, the movie would still be boring because of the simplistic plot. Aside from the overused premise of people falling into a coma and being trapped in the game, there is nothing going on in this movie for the first 20 minutes. Supposed they were spent on getting to know the main characters but they are all so simple and boring that there was absolutely nothing to show about them. You literally need to tolerate 20 minutes of them walking and sleeping and doing absolutely nothing of importance. Jeez you guys, are you trying to make us hate your work?Although to be honest this is technically an improvement over QUANTUM. The characters may be simple and boring as hell but at least they are not sexualized lolis with obligatory bath scenes.Anyways, the plot is exactly the same as before with even the exact same character models as before, albeit now in 3D. The problem is that the whole story needs to be told in just two hours and almost half of it is spent on introductions and boring slice of life scenes. That results to the crisis of the viruses overrunning the game happening way too fast and sudden for you to cherish it. The characters also seems to immediately go to the offence without ever questioning what the devil is going on here or why should they care more than others. Furthermore the heroine had more than a few encounters with the viruses and Aura before the crisis initiates yet dismissed the whole thing as something unimportant. All that result to a very messy storyboard that fails completely to build up tension and interest to the viewer. Stuff happen and you have no reason to care.As far as action scenes go, the movie is fine in making everything look like a videogame. It is a small saving grace as far as guilty pleasure goes. But surely doesn’t beat the original series which was about philosophy and psychology and not about brainless action. There is little to no context in the conflict of this movie; it’s just about beating some faceless virus to save their friend who has been captured. Hell, even the sexualized lolis of Quantum had more psychological conflict than these here in SENOMUNI. Man, it is sad to see the franchise loosing more and more depth with each new installment to the point it is now a passable mediocrity.In all, this is not much of a watch and easily stands as the worse of all current HACK installments. You may dig the sci-fi touches if you are a gadget geek or a veteran gamer but even those mean nothing now that the premise has turned almost to an overused premise because of lame shows such as Accel World and Sword Art Online. Once again, SIGN remains the first and best of the franchise, with other anime such as Serial Experiments Lain and Ghost In The Shell still being the best of what sci-fi has to offer in anime form.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 7/10General Artwork 1/2 (looks like a 10 year old videogame cut scene)Character Figures 1/2 (overused)Backgrounds 2/2 (like a videogame)Animation 1/2 (typical)Visual Effects 2/2 (like a videogame)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (typical)Sound Effects 2/3 (typical)STORY SECTION: 3/10Premise 1/2 (typical)Pacing 0/2 (aimless and rushed)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 3/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 1/2 (cheesy)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (messy)Catharsis 0/2 (messy)VALUE SECTION: 1/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch it)Memorability 1/4 (nothing to remember)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 1/1 (looks like a videogame)Sound 0/2 (sounds lazy)Story 0/3 (generic and rushed)Characters 0/4 (stereotypes)VERDICT: 3.5/10 up to date with the current gadgets.- It feels more natural (and cool) to see the game being played as a cell-phone application instead of a PC one.

7 Seeds 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40602/7_Seeds_2nd_Season,"['I know the first season had a ton of mixed reviews and I was pretty iffy about it as well, but I enjoyed it regardless. The second season though was a good chance to expand on ideas in the previous and show some actual character development that was much needed.I binged the whole second season as soon as it came out and honestly I can confidently say that it was a lot better than the first season. In my opinion, characters were given more life and the main characters of this season were given a lot more screen time to show their character development. The...pacing in this season also seemed to be a lot slower than the first season where it seemed like I was meeting a new set of characters per episode or the characters I had finally learned the names of were constantly changing environments (which to be fair is more or less part of the story).SPOILERS AHEADMost of this season takes place on the groups\' adventure through a ship they found. They discovered it was the last, unidentified, shelter that was able to flip vertically in water and remain afloat. They quickly find themselves in a predicament where they are stuck inside the ship and have to find a way to get out (there is a lot more to it once you actually watch it but I\'m avoiding key plot points.)Personally, their time inside the ship was my favorite part and i\'m glad it was spaced out through multiple episodes. We were really able to see the characters personalities and see how much they have changed/grown since season 1. They have adjusted to the new world and working to make the best out of their situation. We see characters arguing over different perspectives and opinions about the world they live in and how to handle different situations.  We learn more about the characters\' past (some more than others) and some unsolved problems were answered in this season.Unfortunately or fortunately, this second season also did not conclude the anime. The ""ending"" definitely left room for more and I hope this anime gets a third season, though I am sad that it will probably be at least another year till it gets released if it even gets confirmed by netflix.I really wish people gave this show more of a chance, but I do understand why it gets some of the more negative reviews. pacing in this season also seemed to be a lot slower than the first season where it seemed like I was meeting a new set of characters per episode or the characters I had finally learned the names of were constantly changing environments (which to be fair is more or less part of the story).SPOILERS AHEADMost of this season takes place on the groups\' adventure through a ship they found.

This will be a quick review because of my lack of experience in writing one, yet alone a long one. All I really have to say, is that the plot development of the story was pretty slow. Half of this season consisted of one thing, which I will not say for anyone reading reviews beforehand. I was hoping that more of the groups would find each other, and that ---- and ---- would reunite. If I'm being honest, them meeting each other again is...the main reason why I am watching this. This next part is in relation to both the first and the second season. I kind of wish that the narration wouldn't be so focused on Natsu. I like her, but I would like someone more exciting and less timid to be of major focus. I sometimes found myself annoyed at the fact that it took Natsu so long to only slightly stand up for herself or prove herself worthy. But nonetheless, I think that this anime is worth watching because the characters all have their individual traits that make them unique from another, and the storyline is interesting, leading you to always wonder what will happen next. the main reason why I am watching this.

This part continues where the first part ended!This continues where Summer A discovered that Hana died. This makes season 1 overall very complete and part 1 makes a ton more sense with this part added to it.So now that is out of the way let's get to business....This part completes the story of season 1. After Hana Summer A is having it's first trial. This trial results in overall more harmony for Summer A but a smaller Summer A. Certain team members decide to leave for various reasons.This season heavily focuses on Summer B as they get 2 new members... little do they know that those 2 members are extremely dangerous. They however turn out to be vital for Summer B's survival as well as for this seasons climax! Summer B is quite carefree and makes a lot of mistakes, the 2 new individuals try to whip them in shape... or do they just want to get rid of them? All in all every character develops quite nicely through this part.I am honestly very pleased with the character development. All the characters, the likable and less likable ones have major growths and think about what they have done so far. This allows them to see things in a new light. This also sets up the environment mindset wise for season 2 (if we will get any).The art was pretty mediocre at times. I am not going into much detail other than the ship. It looked great but the animated bits were very blurry, hazey and clunky in my opinion. This also applies to other parts throughout the second part of season 1.The story was very enjoyable. Since it was all released at once I was not stuck with cliffhangers and could just watch it at my own pace.Sound effects could be weird at times but were overall okay. Nothing special, nothing lacking either.This is a must watch if you watched part 1. Without this you have not watched the entire 1st season of 7 Seeds! This part completes the story of season 1.

Sure the visuals/art is more improved but the story is so slow and pointless compared to season 1 where they're figuring out what's going on, adapting to the situation, meeting and learning about other groups, and discovering the backstory of the characters and the original organisation.Here in S2 we basically just get the 2 guys leaving their group and wandering around, soon...meeting the main group and hang out with them. Then they all sail off to spend half the season trapped in an old ship they decided to enter, and once they're finally out it's almost all for nothing other than a boring conversation between them. I guess they do try to focus more on the characters, yet even with an open mind while watching the emotional moments just didn't work at all. I think part 1 did a lot better at trying to set those tones when it needed to.So yeah season 2 just didn't do it for me. I know season 1 isn't the greatest either so you're not expecting too much here, but the series had a lot of potential and at least part 1 had more of a story, with things going on and introducing us to this world, which I appreciated more than just having half of part 2 stuck in a ship.-15/02/2022 (edited 19.02.22, 06.02.23) meeting the main group and hang out with them.

For those who haven\'t seen one or the other, I suggest you watch them. (Promised neverland season 2 coming out this year in October btw)Anyways, to start, this was far better than the 1st season as it mainly focused on the rise of each season and how they formed groups along with first-hand problems in this dystopian like environment. They often switched back and forth between teams and characters as...a feeble attempt for character development. I eventually found it quite confusing towards the end of the 1st season.Now the second season is a lot better because it was able to permeate each character hence manifesting a more intriguing story. The characters -- especially the main ones had more screen time and they fleshed out very nicely. Compared to the 1st where they were very static, this season they arguably were round.The ultimatum of the second season would be to have hope for the main characters ESPECIALLY FOR HANA AND ARASHI TO FRIKEN SEE EACH OTHER. And for their longevity and prosperous life.It is within the last episodes did I find that was the best. They were able to really show how Ango changes as a person and realize that he wasn\'t as bad as he portrayed himself. And was a bit refreshing to see Ryo not be a shady pain in the ass for once.Arashi still has the same mindset but is a better person. Semmy, being forced to interact more is less of a nuisance but will get cocky at times. I feel that Natsu was such a nervous nelly and an eyesore in the 1st season, but to see her change; I eventually grew to appreciate her trying to be a better person.  Botan became more of an older sibling which created more of a family perception of summer b.I could go on and on about how the other characters changed but I\'d suggest you watch this season. Don\'t expect something grand and mighty rather expect something you\'d expect from a second season-- with more appreciation.And to be very honest, if this is Netflix\'s own ""ending"" to the show I would be very surprised as the manga is 177 chapters(it\'s completed). So I\'d expect at least another season or two. However, if this is indeed the finale then It would very sad to see this series go without a conclusive ending-- at least to me.(If anybody wishes to read the where the anime left off start from ch.112 --- It has a good ending don\'t worry)As they say ""finish strong"", and that\'s exactly what they did. a feeble attempt for character development.

Overall pleasant to look at and evokes a feeling of ""beautiful blue earth""Sound: 7The OST won\'t be remembered after the watch, but the opening theme was surprisingly pleasant. Overall an improvement from last season\'s OP and ED....Story: 6The premise is still a simple post apocalytic survival tale, the plot complexity has not changed from S1. There are still no webs of subplots to be found. The awkward forced bits of the past that feel unnatural are still present. As such, three of the four categories I rate a story by are still unchanged. I am however now able to remark that completeness of effort gets a good score. There aren\'t really anything that gets started off that don\'t end or don\'t get wrapped up. I suppose one could nitpick and say that the success or failure of the characters at starting human civilization anew didn\'t end, but I think that bit was deliberate and I can forgive it. It might have meant to leave a bit of an open end, possibly for aesthetic or to allow for a season 3.Characters: 9This part improved the most out of everything from S1. Most of the characters received some kind of growth that was even more prominent here than last cour. Namely, Semimaru has entirely stopped bullying Natsu. Natsu has also opened up to the others and began making an active and notable effort to contributing and is less insecure about her own worth. Ango and Ryou both grow out of this one-track-elitist-survival-military-school mindset. This group was possibly the most enjoyable out of all of the characters to watch. Unfortunately, Hana remained pretty lacking in growth and even holds some traits of a mary sue, but in light of her taking up minimal screentime and the pleasantness of the other group of characters, I can overlook this.Enjoyment: 8A solid 8/10 here. Watching characters that start off flawed grow and mature is naturally very pleasant. The main things that reduce keep the show from hitting any higher tiers of enjoyment are its backstory flaws which, while some can probably ignore it, are still nonetheless, glaring.Overall: 7Due to the glaringly flawed backstory setup details and the fact that ultimately this show is not stand alone, but the 2nd cour of its S1, I must maintain a 7 rating. The show is fun to watch and interesting, but bits of the details that influence the actions of key characters remain hard to believe and forced. The plot simplicity and lack of any deep. higher priority societal lesson do bar this from passing 8, and an 8 would have been the highest this show could reach even if the backstory details had been fleshed out better to be more believable and less... exaggerated.

The show mainly focuses on Team Summer B, growing the characters of the team. Natsu gets a lot of focus, but to me her timid character barely changes. The majority of the season focuses on one main thing (spoiler), but by fleshing it out, the characters all get ample screen time and development.I won't tell you how or why, but Ango's and Ryo's characters is explored a lot throughout this...season. It shows them in a different light than in the previous season, and gets us to like them. Their development was probably the most out of all the characters, and the best part of the show.Overall, the season felt dragged out and some parts felt unnecessary and didn't move forward the story. However, this season wasn't based around the story, rather the characters and their development.

It allows us to see the character's personalities grow and change as more unexpected things take place. Compared to the first season, season two is not as entertaining but is really just a way for us to witness Ango and Ryo become likeable people. Its not so boring you would want to drop it but to be honest overall almost nothing happened. If season two had a...vague timeline it would only contain about 4 or 5 points. The first season managed to keep me intrigued the entire way through, this just feels dragged out. Even after watching the ending i dont feel like anything was accomplished except for us watching Ango and Ryo become friends with team summer over 12 episodes. Season 2 is kind of only character development.To be honest i dont think 7Seeds will end at season 2 but i dont think there will be a season 3 anytime soon.

It does well to address some of the short comings of the first season and aside for some things its good.However one problem was prominent in the first season has unfortunately been retained, this problem is the issue of scale and distance. It can be hard to believe how characters seemingly zip around to different locations in such a short time, this can make it hard to...track where the different stories are going on. But if you can look beyond this and enjoy some post apoc themes then you will most likely enjoy 7 Seeds 2nd Season track where the different stories are going on. But if you can look beyond this and enjoy some post apoc themes then you will most likely enjoy 7 Seeds 2nd Season', 'As far as the art/animation goes, it\'s just so difficult to look over. Some of the stills from certain distances are just brutal. Some characters I honestly can\'t even create a proper image in my head from what I\'ve seen because of how often the scale of their facial features change. The actually art in the background is phenomenal, however the characters moving and interacting is just awful.My overall enjoyment, however, is a 10/10. The story is unbelievably intriguing. The experience on the ship requires problem solving, puzzles, and kept me fixated for its duration. Along the way, we also get some amazing and very...much needed character development.When Part 1 ended, I basically thought Ango was a rapist piece of shit and Ryo was a murderer. However, Part 2 really expanded on their backstory and I can honestly say I\'ve grown fond of both of them individually and their bond together. Natsu also turned into a little bit of a badass, which was totally necessary! It was really interesting to watch her grow courageous and curious as to what she can do to ensure their survival among the self-destructing ship.I was also super happy to see Hana alive. Hurray! I know most watchers are rooting for her and Arashi. It was a little bit frustrating that we didn\'t get much of story expansion on them, but I guess that means there\'s some more content for a Part 3!My one small complaint, even though I was very much engaged in the story, is that we basically know as much about their present situation as we did when Part 1 ended. It was nice to see a pace change, considering Part 1 had a million things going on at once and characters introduced at every corner, but all we really got is closer to the characters. I don\'t actually think that\'s necessarily a ""bad"" thing, but if we just wasted an entire season gaining character development for a Part 3 that isn\'t even going to come, I\'m gonna be so mad.Overall, if you\'re considering picking up the anime at all, I\'d totally recommend it. The storyline is intriguing and the characters are lovable. The animation is horrid but worth looking over. much needed character development.When Part 1 ended, I basically thought Ango was a rapist piece of shit and Ryo was a murderer.

The characters were not that likable, therefore I did not enjoy it very much. I gave that season a 3 overall, but this season... MY DAYS. It was the biggest redemption for an Anime for sure! Now to start off, the story.The plot of the story is as interesting as the first season's plot, except this season executed the story in a more satisfying and less rushed way. I felt captivated and was lost in the story in an instant, unlike the first season, where I...was barely able to keep awake when watching it. There are a few filler parts here and there, but there is never a full episode of filler, which is also great! The only complaint is that we never see much of the other teams other than Team Summer B. I would have liked more insight in what they were doing as well. A great story Overall.The artstyle is of high quality but there are never times where the art blows you away, however the artstyle is good at portraying the places they are in. I don't have any complaints with it. It is pretty much the same standard as what you would get in many other Anime.The music is a slight step up, from the first season. The OP fits very well with the series and is quite powerful. The perfect song to listen to before watching the series. The ED has a laid-back vibe to it, it's great! I thought it would play at the end of the series but it didn't. And I am glad that Studio GONZO, chose a different song, because the song they chose was absolutely perfect and fitted way better than the ED would have! I don't know the name of the song, but it perfectly encapsulates the event at the very end of the last episode. The OST definitely is a great one. All the songs are very powerful, in their own unique ways. None of the songs feels like it was just put there for the sake of it.The Characters development was definitely better in this season and is probably the one thing that improved the most out of everything else! The show took the much needed time, that was essentially wasted in the first season, to show the growth of a collection of characters, especially Natsu! She is definitely way more likeable in this Season! At the end, I felt like I was part of their adventure. I felt closer to each and every character, way more closer than I would have ever imagined.Overall, I do believe that you should watch the whole show, if you haven't already. You just have to survive the first season but i promise (and I think many others would agree) that it would be worth it, for when you watch the next season. You won't regret it. Personally, i thoroughly enjoyed watching this Part. The whole show felt like it was thought through and developed better than it did before. I hope it continues at the pace it is going in, that is if Gonzo and Netflix would allow to make another Part, I would really appreciate it. I can finally say with confidence, that this is an underrated show and you should definitely watch it!Have a nice rest of your day! ^^ was barely able to keep awake when watching it.

I don't have any complaints with it. It is pretty much the same standard as what you would get in many other Anime.The music is a slight step up, from the first season. The OP fits very well with the series and is quite powerful. The perfect song to listen to before watching the series. The ED has a laid-back vibe to it, it's great! I thought it would play at the end of the series but it didn't. And I am glad that Studio GONZO, chose a different song, because the song they chose was absolutely perfect and fitted way better than the ED would have! I don't know the name of the song, but it perfectly encapsulates the event at the very end of the last episode. The OST definitely is a great one. All the songs are very powerful, in their own unique ways. None of the songs feels like it was just put there for the sake of it.The Characters development was definitely better in this season and is probably the one thing that improved the most out of everything else! The show took the much needed time, that was essentially wasted in the first season, to show the growth of a collection of characters, especially Natsu! She is definitely way more likeable in this Season! At the end, I felt like I was part of their adventure. I felt closer to each and every character, way more closer than I would have ever imagined.Overall, I do believe that you should watch the whole show, if you haven't already. You just have to survive the first season but i promise (and I think many others would agree) that it would be worth it, for when you watch the next season. You won't regret it. Personally, i thoroughly enjoyed watching this Part. The whole show felt like it was thought through and developed better than it did before. I hope it continues at the pace it is going in, that is if Gonzo and Netflix would allow to make another Part, I would really appreciate it. I can finally say with confidence, that this is an underrated show and you should definitely watch it!Have a nice rest of your day! ^^"", ""I will be honest here the first season wasn't the best, but I knew that out of it will come to a great storyline, me and my sis (who was watching it with me) we weren't a big fan of Natsu but changed our minds a bit once we saw her character development in part two, part two was great I found that they wasted a bit of time with Hana especially when she's speaking about nature bc each part of the anime is only 12 episodes but other than that I love the character developments, I think I can see that part 3 will...be about them finding Hana and other plots that we won't know yet but out of all of this, I really enjoyed this anime series and excited to see more of it. be about them finding Hana and other plots that we won't know yet but out of all of this, I really enjoyed this anime series and excited to see more of it."", ""I watched this one with my Girlfriend and were both passionate Rimwold Players. A game were you start building a colony on a far away planet. So we basically end up finding so many similarities to our colony life so this is straight 10 out of 10 even tho it might be a lower rating if we haven't been playing Rimworld like crazy.All in all its a nice Anime focused on the relations between different groups of colonist after a worldwide disaster. But still they mange to include a lot funny stuff as well. And its really nice to follow the groups through the...different development stages. different development stages."", '*No Spoilers*Summary:This review if for Part 2 of 7 Seeds, which was produced by a different studio than the first season. 7 Seeds (Part 2) is an anime adapted from Yumi Tamura’s manga of the same name. The story takes place in the future after meteorites destroy Earth as it is today, and the characters wake up thousands or some unspecified number of years later to a brand new climate, environment, geography, etc. This part of the story has a much more organized plot and focuses on developing the characters which make it far more enjoyable and fulfilling than Part 1. You may like this...anime if you are interested in a compelling story with interesting characters and a unique post-apocalyptic survival plot. This season is slightly above average in quality, but the downside is that you must watch Part 1 first which is far inferior.Story: 7/10The source material (manga) is interesting with solid pacing and character development coinciding with the plot. The challenge with this anime in Part 1 is that it was adapted terribly; however, this part is much better-paced and not as staggered. The story is much less jarring and flows much more smoothly. In addition, the plot is more straightforward and it focuses on certain characters rather than all the characters in ten different locations. This part seems to be a better adaptation from the manga, which I have read parts of.Art: 5/10The art is average in Part 2. It seems slightly less choppy than in Part 1, although art is definitely not the show’s strong suit.Sound: 5/10The soundtrack, openings, and endings are average, although I do enjoy the intro song with its unique dissonance. Some scenes have fitting background music, and the voice acting is alright. One character (Hotaru) has an annoying voice, which may be because of the character’s age, but it seems very fake. Otherwise, the voice acting is average.Character: 7/10A major flaw in Part 1 was the lack of character development. They were all just plot devices. Part 2 changes that significantly. The protagonists and even “antagonists” are fleshed out and developed over the course of Part 2. Instead of the weird two-minute character arcs found in Part 1, Part 2 shows the characters’ journeys with internal struggles throughout the adventure. Overall, the characters seem to be truer to their portrayal in the manga, which helps them to be more realistic and important. The characters are also more relatable without being as over-the-top or cliché. And, Part 2 helps to illustrate why the characters behave the way they do in Part 1.Enjoyment: 7/10Part 2 is a much more enjoyable story from start to finish. There are parts of Part 2 with the same flaws as Part 1, but it is a more cohesive story that makes the viewer care about the characters. It’s too bad that Part 1 was such a poor adaptation of the manga, because the actual story is intriguing and the characters are cool, which can be seen in this season.Overall: 6.2/10This was a tremendous improvement from Part 1. anime if you are interested in a compelling story with interesting characters and a unique post-apocalyptic survival plot.

"", 'I really likes this season compared the the first all of the build up was worth it and the opening was always a banger. The start of this story is about this dude who tried to rape someone because he hate this girls dad who is innocent and is banished from his group and joins our main character group and gets better over time teaching and protecting our protagonist and the boat arc was really neat and stayed its welcome in just the right amount. I think this season was satisfying at least compared to the first season. The beginning was acceptable the man character...who everyone looks up to getting outed was definitely deserved and i am glad they found him. who everyone looks up to getting outed was definitely deserved and i am glad they found him.', ""I will try to make this very short, and will try not to give spoilers and just opinions . This show is something i feel many ppl are sleeping on , It has a lot of capability to do really good and in my opinion it is doing really good, yet i still don't know why ppl don't talk about this a lot . Honestly if u want a new anime to watch then i will totally recommend it. Yes the character development is a little slow but at the same time it is something u will enjoy happily and also  the pinch of...thriller they put due to that u will enjoy it aswell. thriller they put due to that u will enjoy it aswell."", 'Before i start: i am a fan of the Manga, and i write about the anime IN COMPARISON to each other = more meta. (TL;DR at bottom)So, the anime by netflix got a second season. What is different?The most apparent thing is the story and pacing. It got so. much. better. ( than the first season)Finally we get some semblance of the character development that the manga is all about, we get the background stories of some characters which should have been explained in the first season.It really feels like this pacing should have been applied in the first season, which was just a...really bad summary and skipped on all the important parts. ( for reference, see my review on that one on the corresponding page)The story focuses on the section of the manga where Team Summer B and a part of Summer A meet, and the contrast couldnt be heavier: The goofy weirdos from B vs the overly serious overachievers (and crooks) of team A. The location for the story is mostly a giant ship intended as both a shelter and armory. The combination of the contrasting parties creates occasions for character development and growth on all participating sides.Overall i am really relieved this season turned out so much better. Sure, there are still things that dont live up to expectations if you are familiar with the manga. But compared to season 1 this is a definitive progress!I will still and probably forever recommend the reading of the manga, since this anime still doesnt and will never do it justice ( maybe another adaptation in the future? -- the potential would be worth it)The story and characters just make so much more sense if you have read it.I can only partly understand why it gets so much hate, i guess some people are just missing the usual slaughter, magic, tits and fight scenes. If you look at it from a more realistic perspective though, its quite close to how a bunch of clueless teenagers would behave in a situation like that.( that doesnt mean the scenario with a dystopian post-apocalypse world is depicted realistically)TL;DR:Its much better than the first season storywise: better pacing and more character development.

Astro Boy: Tetsuwan Atom,https://myanimelist.net/anime/971/Astro_Boy__Tetsuwan_Atom,"[""I watched this as a ten year old boy and have great memories of waking up at 5:30am to watch it. I was the only person I knew who'd watched it but it felt like my own secret show. Anyway, I picked up Pluto the manga and have almost finished it, and the memories came flooding back. From what I remember it was great, then again I was 10. If you know any 10 year old's i'm sure they'd love to watch it. Probably best to go with a manga like Pluto if you're older, as this show probably won't appeal to adults. "", ""This anime is really one of my favourites, which can seem odd, especially if I add that I was 19 when I watched it.I am really pained when I see people saying that it is a show enjoyable only by kids. It tackles so crucial themes with such an ease and a simplicity that it is able to touch deeply anyone, kids and adults alike. There are of course goofy moments proving that this show was mainly meant for kids. The moral of the show, however, is so righteous (in my opinion) that it would be a shame if only kids were to enjoy...it!The animation is frankly amazing... for the first half. In fact, it was so amazing it blew my mind when I heard it was hand drawn animation. But then there was a huge decrease in the quality of the animation, around half the show, and it never came back to its previous standard. The OST is really a gorgeous one that deserves to be more recognized.This show has however a massive weakness. It's got one of the worst English adaptation I've ever seen. Everything was messed up: the voicing was horrible, the dialogues were modified, some scenes were cut (sometimes thus hiding the sub-text), the music... oh my God! the music!! The Japanese people who made this show achieved to compose a sumptuous orchestral OST, which was replaced by HORRIBLE electronic sounds. I'm sure those who did that were thinking 'yeah, it'll sound more futuristic all right'! -_-Seriously, I know it's hard to find, but watch the sub version!For me, this show represents the pinnacle of my conception of fictional stories. For me, a story should be used to convey a moral, a message, an idea. And this one achieves it brilliantly, conveying an idea of mutual acceptance, of peace and of the virtues of non-violent resistance. It's an heartwarming show that I'm sure to remember! it!The animation is frankly amazing... for the first half. In fact, it was so amazing it blew my mind when I heard it was hand drawn animation.

Never really known too much about the character back then, but it was one of the first animes I had the courtesy to watch. The story is simple to follow, despite a few filler episodes here and there. It's lighthearted but also dark to a certain degree. The animation looks pretty good and even beautiful at times and the sound design is top notch. I enjoy listening to the shows soundtrack so much, I might just buy the soundtrack for it if it's even a thing....I'm hoping it is.I do feel like they do go a bit overboard with the dark tone though. While it is understandable due to the message its trying to conceive, they were really pushing the envelope with what they were trying to do. I wasn't TOO much of a huge fan on how they wrote Dr. Tenma as the main villain as that is pretty generic and sort of predictable in its own right.Overall, it is the perfect anime for younger kids to watch which is pretty obvious from the get go. But there can be some enjoyment as well for the adults as well who want a fun story. It's not groundbreaking or compelling, but it does serve as a nice little distraction.

It is the most unique anime you would ever have the privilege to watch with...topics that are rarely discussed in depth unlike this series, the art style is also amazing and eye catching at every turn. Although Astro boy could of had some work to do to, he was perfect one day 1, he didnt have any room to improve and to create a personality on his own, the story is compelling enough to ignore, he does learn some lessons and he become well rounded at the end of the season.

To start with, this is clearly a japanese tv shows animated for children, therefore I have judged it as so.From what I recall, in this series, there was always a new villain or an on-going villain for like 3 episodes or so. Please correct me if I am wrong. Even today, I can remember some stories that must have marked child me very deeply. There's one with a scorching burning sun - ah! It's been so long... Or one with a train on the edge about to go off rails -...the point I'm making is that it's been at least a decade since I've watched Astroboy. To even remember shows the impact of the story already.Art wise, I can't say much because I am no artist or animator - cool effects though. For the soundtrack, really I'll put the accent to the opening and the background music for the epic hero or epic sad moments. To this day, I can sing you the melody and the harmonic structure for the opening. The musicians have done an excellent job, to make music that mark me to this day.Characters are pretty much archetypes we can see everywhere. Identifiable, hateable, loveable. Enjoyment? Yeah, absolutely. Child me loved it, I mean, I loved it enough to write a review today, at least a decade later.Overall, I'll give an 8. Keep in mind that I judged it as children's TV show.TLDR: I'd def present this TV show to my 6 year old child, if I ever have one. the point I'm making is that it's been at least a decade since I've watched Astroboy.

I wish the TV anime series was drawn this way; the style used in this mini is more fun to watch, and is more creative. ', ""It really is pretty funny is you've watched the whole series before watching this little short... I'm glad they did something with the pigtails because they we're didn't touch base too much with Osaka's obsession with Chiyo's pigtails. Cute, funny, and REALLY enjoyable! :D "", 'This is the second short pilot film that JC Staff released, this one a lot closer(but still not quite matching) the animation style and budget of the TV release.  It’s a bit longer than Web Daioh, and while it’s not quite as funny, it does put forth a more accurate representation of what the series would eventually be.  Rather than a traditional intro, like Web Daioh had, this film opens with a shot of Chiyo riding on her dog, Mr. Tadakichi, introducing herself and nearly getting thrown off of him.  The opening features some of the show’s iconic background music, which is...always nice.Splitting it into two halves, the first half is probably the weaker one.  It features a couple of minutes of Yukari’s class, squeezing several of the running gags and staples of the series into two minutes.  This includes Yukari being a dick, Chiyo getting good grades, the Bonklers(which I’ll always call them because it sounds better than knuckleheads) acting out, Chiyo trying not to be cute, Tomo standing outside, Kaorin being in love, Sakaki musing over a cat bite, and keep in mind, thisall takes place in the span of two minutes...  Including the opening.The second half, in contrast, plays out one joke on it’s own...  Osaka and her pigtail dreams.  If you’ve seen the anime or read the manga, you know what I’m talking about, and this goes on for almost 3 minutes.  Unlike the first half, this one doesn’t stick to the established material, instead taking full advantage of the surreal situation to try some new jokes, like Chiyo slowly turning her head like an owl(creepy) and the entire class thinking she’s a lost child that doesn’t belong there.  I’m not going to give away how this part ends, you kind of just have to experience it for yourselves.  It’s weird.The short ends with a thirty second credits, marking the second appearance of Chiyodaddy, and if i’m being honest, I don’t feel as though this one’s as strong as Web Daioh.  It suffers in terms of pacing, with so many jokes and in-show references thrown at you in such a short time that it’s hard to process what you’re watching.  The Osaka dream is at least new and interesting, especially the way it breaks away from the script.There’s actual music in it, which I definitely like, especially since upon reflection, this is the pilot for the show’s iconic score, too.  The dub is phenomenal, and the actors are on point...  Save for Mandy Clark and Nancy Novotny, big surprise there...  But I’d especially like to give a shout out to Jessica Boone and Kira Vincent Davis, as they play the most prominent characters in the short and absolutely slaughter their roles.All in all, not quite as good as Web Daioh, in terms of story, but a small improvement in the area of production values.

This show is pretty good in that regard.The story is a typical scene from any random Azu episode. It takes place in Miss Yukari\'s class-room, and features the main girls doing their usual thing. The plot has many twists, even for such a short...show. I don\'t want to spoil anything, but if you\'ve watched/read Azumanga, it will be very familiar.The art is especially notable and good. It is much better than the original 26-ep. Azumanga, but this is not to say Azumanga doesn\'t have good art to begin with. But in the movie, the art is even better. Perhaps to stick to the idea of a ""movie,"" the art seems to have had more time, effort, and money put into it. The character\'s animations are smoother, the colors brighter and more vibrant, the lines sharper. it is a good look for Azumanga, and I like it.The sound is good, but in my opinion it is no better (or worse) than Azumanga 1-26. It is clear and understandable. As for the Japanese AND English voice-actors, they are the same as those who voiced Azu 1-26.The characters are quirky, unique, and each one funny in their own special way. Their actions and antics are similar to Azumanga 1-26. Those who\'ve seen the original series will not feel alienated. The old characters are still themselves.The Azumanga movie is just as enjoyable as a regular episode of Azu, but it is unfortnately quite short. Just when you are getting into it, it ends. Yet, the show is quite enjoyble, and fun, for veteran Azu fans or newcomers to the Azumanga or even anime world.Overall, ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is a good watch that I certainly recommened, either as a compliment to Azumanga Daioh 1-26 or a stand-alone watch.

The animation also received a bump, with several characters shown in far more detailed fashion than in the anime. While I do appreciate the quality increase, this would be more of a detriment to the show as it works well with minimalism, allowing it to explain more with less. However, the animation appears more vivid here, and flows more fluidly. While the majority of the segment is devoted to finding Chiyo-chan's lost pigtails, there are other defining moments such as those...involving Kaorin, though others besides Chiyo, Osaka, and Yukari have a pitifully small role. This is a great short to watch as a prequel to the series! 8/10 rating. involving Kaorin, though others besides Chiyo, Osaka, and Yukari have a pitifully small role.

For manga readers, it’s a lovely run through already-familiar scenarios and characters: Osaka's dream about Chiyo's pigtails, Sakaki daydreams about the cat and so on; for new viewers it’s a preview of what’s to come. It probably isn’t required viewing now as it has outlived its usefulness as a preview of the TV series but it’s so short it doesn’t really matter.The standout here is the animation, as this was shown in theaters, so it's theatrical quality animation.

As she is crying, the high school girls try to find a way to make her better.I really thought Chiyo-chan acted like a two-year-old in this. The girls treating her like a toddler with a lollie pop and everything is very cruel to a little girl.Story: Really enjoyed the story alot. But the story turned into a twist, which made it more enjoyable. Still not as...good as the original Azumanga Daioh series.Art: Much better than the two short and series of Azumanga I've seen. Azumanga Web Daioh, and Azumanga Daioh. It features the best of character designs any movie can have. And it could've really turned into a feature-length movie.Sound: Well, there's no music, but the bouncy music absoloutely fits Azumanga and I liked the English Dub. Chiyo's crying was so cute and the girls' dub was also cute too.Character: Very cutesy characters. Chiyo, the crybaby genius, Osaka, the friendly clumsy chick, Tomo, the very aggresive high schooler, and Sakaki, the shy girl. Loved all of their personalities.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this little short and I think it's good for all ages.

A short and simplistic plotline, with little to no character development, and the sound an...animation had not improved at all. Not a good sign. In fact, what is sadder is in the 24 episode TV series the watcher actually finds Nammo (the robot) and Mughi (their cat) more interesting as characters. This is dispelled in Episode 26 though.The second episode of the OVA (Episode 26) was much more enjoyable. Kei and Yuri fight over a piece of cake at the start, making their cat ""Mughi"" the unwitting middlecat in their silly battle. They then decide to disobey orders to rescue their commander, Gooley, who is being held hostage. That episode showed more character development for the Dirty Pair than the previous 24 episodes of the TV series.Episode 26 was awesome on 3 levels, which actually elevated this anime from mediocre to fair (needed better animation to be Good). There was suspense, drama and a tight plot with emotional moments. Humor was evident, especially the scene where the 2 girls come out dressed as orange tabby cats, guns blazing! There were some great lines, like ""Men prefer breasts!"" and ""just like a woman you can\'t shut up!"".Overall, this 2 episode OVA was better than the TV series, the second being much better than the first. For the 2007 standard, this series is OK, nothing groundbreaking, but nothing totally horrible either (except the old school animation). The characters and concept are very promising. The producers must have realized that with a little better animation, soundtrack and plot, the Dirty Pair franchise could take off - and they\'re right.I\'m an outlier tho, I\'m compulsive, so since I\'ve seen one of the Dirty Pair movies (Project Eden) and liked it, I\'m now compelled to watch ALL the rest of the Dirty Pair series.

Escaflowne,https://myanimelist.net/anime/393/Escaflowne,"[""Take Vision of Escaflowne, remove all the character development, writing, humor, romance, and action that made the series the classic 90s anime people treat it as, and throw it out the window. Then replace all that with angst and blood. That's the Escaflowne movie.While I have to admire Sunrise to attempt to condense the series for those unfamiliar with it, as well as breathe new life into old characters, this isn't the way to do it. Hitomi, instead of being a shy, but head-strong girl, is now a whiny brat who contemplates suicide. Van, instead of being a bickering but brave and powerful warrior, is...now Tarzan with a sword. Allen is now a clone of Sephiroth, and so forth; every character you knew from Escaflowne is ruined, and these character would still suck even to those not very familiar with the franchise (such as myself). The only improved character is Merle, who's a good deal less annoying than she was in the TV series. In fact, she's the best character in the whole movie! Unfortunately, that's not a compliment.Remember those great mecha battle scenes with Van on the Escaflowne? They're gone now, as Van spends most of the movie slashing at things and watching them bleed. There IS a robot battle, but only one worth mention, and it doesn't come until pretty far in to be of much notice.Then there's the writing. I suspect Sunrise hired Escaflowne fans in middle school to write this, as the plot and its constant mention of the same things over and over again makes Doraemon look like it was written by Charles Dickens. Not to mention how boring of a formula the movie follows: if you've watched anime for a few years now, you can guess what will happen before it happens.So is there anything I liked about this movie? Well, it's pretty, with slightly improved character designs and a good sounstrack by the great Yoko Kanno. Annnnnd that's about it. Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea is a pointless retread of something that was good enough the first time around, and it won't win over any new fans in its wake. And Escaflowne fans themselves should stay as far away from this turkey as possible. now Tarzan with a sword.

They're gone now, as Van spends most of the movie slashing at things and watching them bleed. There IS a robot battle, but only one worth mention, and it doesn't come until pretty far in to be of much notice.Then there's the writing. I suspect Sunrise hired Escaflowne fans in middle school to write this, as the plot and its constant mention of the same things over and over again makes Doraemon look like it was written by Charles Dickens. Not to mention how boring of a formula the movie follows: if you've watched anime for a few years now, you can guess what will happen before it happens.So is there anything I liked about this movie? Well, it's pretty, with slightly improved character designs and a good sounstrack by the great Yoko Kanno. Annnnnd that's about it. Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea is a pointless retread of something that was good enough the first time around, and it won't win over any new fans in its wake. And Escaflowne fans themselves should stay as far away from this turkey as possible."", ""Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea was produced by Sunrise and Bandai Visual, and was directed by Kazuki Amane, same as in the series.  It was released in theatres in Japan on June 24th, 2000, was licensed Stateside by Bandai Entertainment and had a limited run in theatres Stateside starting on January 25th, 2002.Hitomi Kanzaki is depressed and considering killing herself.  One day, a man appears before her and calls her the Wing Goddess, summoning her to Gaea, a world at war, where she is the ultimate arbiter of the God of the Heavens and War, Escaflowne, and, accordingly, Gaea's destiny.As you can probably...tell, this is a complete retelling of the original series.  There are far darker takes on all the characters than you saw in the series, and a completely different plot and world that they're in, which in and of itself has its effects on them.  And honestly, even though it's worlds away from the series, it's just as good of a story as the series told, especially in a more limited timeframe to work in.

CG is also used far more in here, and it's kind of just as obvious as when they used it in the series.Every character's seiyuu was able to return for this, which adds that more of a sense of familiarity and continuity, especially if you can't recognize them at first glance.  Yoko Kanno returned to work on the soundtrack for this, and it's just as beautiful as the series was.So, overall, while the movie does have a more limited timeframe to work in and lots of info to convey, the new storyline and character designs are more than welcome, especially with the seiyuu returning to provide continuity, and with Yoko Kanno on the soundtrack, and a richer environment to play around in, this adaptation is just as good as the series. tell, this is a complete retelling of the original series.

It’s everything the TV show should have been.  You don’t have to watch the TV show before watching this, though you might want to if you're interested in seeing how a story can be dragged from the depths of writers hell into the light of storytelling purgatory.The main character of Hitomi is changed from a generic plucky cipher into an actual human being, a typical teenager with suicidal tendencies, who actually has a character arc.  Her plight is introduced and compressed into about five minutes very efficiently through adept usage of editing, direction, art...and music, with a montage of scenes between her and her best friend, who she pushes away due to self-loathing.Five minutes is definitely enough of watching a mopey girl and sure enough before we know it she's teleported into Gaea for a life-changing adventure with plenty of thrills and drama.  The movie is paced so well that it knows how each segment could drag the story if played out too long, but it’s also paced too fast in that the story rolls along without giving the viewer, or characters, time to breathe.  It’s one of the main reasons the overall score isn’t higher than it would have been if the story were more simple or the running time longer.Another fatal flaw is the antagonist of the story, although much better than the beardy old man of the TV series, the motivation and methodology is again woefully lacking.  Just what exactly is the point of the bad guy in this story?  What does he want?  To destroy the world?  Eh?  Is that it?  Why do we not even care?  The writer learns his lesson from the TV series by using a better character as the main bad guy and keeping him bad, but again he doesn’t give the viewer an insight into the thought-process of the character, what he wants and why; or why other people would even follow him and do his bidding.The movie's not perfect and these flaws do irk, but they do not make the movie unwatchable, they simply prevent it from getting a high score.  Escaflowne remains a memorable experience and worth a watch because it’s not long enough to overstay its welcome.The TV series is, or bloody well should be, notorious for its completely out of control plot holes, twists and meaningless revelations.  The movie veers away from this childish nonsense for the most part and opts for more streamlined and concise storytelling, however cliché it may appear, it’s at least solid in narrative and consistent in theme.Now, whenever inexplicable stuff does happen, it’s dressed in abstract tones so it feels more cohesive and natural, it’s more like dreamy art that doesn’t have to make conventional sense, but relies more on mood to convey information or feeling to the viewer.  Maybe I’m going too easy on the anime, but you can’t deny the powerful imagery and composition in this movie, its effective.  It feels like Mamoru Oshii versus David Lynch.Escaflowne concerns itself with fate, space and time, so its skilful editing in the movie can be understood as part of the theme, whereas in the TV series the editing was conventional yet the story made no sense.  This is the key difference between TV series and movie.  One is dressed up in conventional tones yet is weak narratively, while the other is an abstract enigma that makes somewhat logical sense underneath the mystery.People who give this movie undue flak either have suspect taste or are too literal in their criticism of this reimagining of the TV show.  And it is a reimagining, not a condensed version of a 26 episode show, because that would be futile and foolish.This is the writer doing what he should have done the first time round, this is taking the core premise of Escaflowne and fulfilling its potential by working with the rest of the cast rather than doodling random crap together by himself and worming his way out with deus ex machinas every five minutes.  This is a near-perfect melding of all departments of the production team gelling together to bring to the viewer a unique vision of another world and its impact on a teenager at the end of her tether.Character designs are more 'realistic' than the TV series as expected, but what stands out the most is the world design which feels mystical and dreamlike, very memorable and unique, it feels like Escaflowne and not a random generic fantasy-land.  The music by Yoko Kanno recycles some motifs from the TV series but includes a few new compositions and songs, all of the standard you'd expect from the master composer.Escaflowne itself is one of the best mecha designs I've seen in anime, truly a beast of a 'machine', literally taking the flesh and blood of whoever the poor user of it is, a real tool of war, one that is a double-edged sword, quite literally.  And when Kanno's amazing music is playing it’s a sight to behold.The last 10 minutes of the movie revert back to TV levels of idiocy with childish plot devices and character behaviour, but if you're forgiving enough you'll overlook these flaws and just revel in the imagery coupled with Yoko Kanno, the likes of which you'll not see anywhere else. and music, with a montage of scenes between her and her best friend, who she pushes away due to self-loathing.Five minutes is definitely enough of watching a mopey girl and sure enough before we know it she's teleported into Gaea for a life-changing adventure with plenty of thrills and drama.

They released a twenty six episode anime, multiple manga with different writers, some light novels, a video game that never saw an international release and, in 2000, this film. Sunrise was pushing this one hard. Maybe I\'ll get to the main anime later, but for now let\'s critique the film.Story:We open with a lone swordsman raiding an airship and slaughtering everybody. Clearly, this is a family picture. We cut from the fantasy setting and go into the real world where a teenage girl, Hitomi, is going through some depressive issues. Her friend tries to cheer her up only...to be spurned. She probably should have suggested that she see a professional therapist and get some medication to sort her out instead of just playing around. Not that you can really fault a teenager for not knowing better. Hitomi sees a vision calling her the goddess of wings and beckoning her. She quickly finds herself inside a mecha in another world.The big problem with the narrative of this film is that things are wildly inconsistent. This goes for character actions, tone and even the atmosphere around Gaea. I\'ll talk about the character inconsistencies and atmosphere in a moment, but for now I\'ll focus on the tone. The tone is largely dark and brooding but it occasionally throws in something more goofy and comedic out of nowhere. It\'s like they were ashamed of how dark the film is and wanted to reassure people that the franchise does know how levity works. Which doesn\'t work well with the brooding tone but does make me wish I was watching the not brooding version.It doesn\'t really help that everything symbolic is pretty heavy handed. Escaflowne\'s colour changing, the animal people talking about how ""denizens of the forest stood no chance against battle hardened humans, Hitomi contemplating suicide only to find herself in a world where she gets to decide whether to annihilate everything or preserve it. It\'s very not subtle or nuanced.The film also defines a king in a weird way. I get it, it\'s a fantasy story and they aren\'t using the term the way it\'s used in the real world, but it\'s still odd to see a real term used in such a counter-intuitive way. Basically, as a king Van has to walk alone and kill all his enemies. But real kings, even shit ones, are surrounded by loyal soldiers and advisers. Whether that loyalty is based on equating the king with the country or on a desire to advance their own position. And a good king needs to understand the fine art of diplomacy. So, it\'s a bit weird that everyone around him just acts like his faults are just an ordinary part of being a king.To its credit, the film does move at a decent pace and it has enough going on to keep your attention.Characters:There are two major issues with the characters. The first is the inconsistent characterisation. The second is that the bulk of the characters are pretty superfluous. Like, Van goes from bowing to Hitomi and offering to do anything for her to calling her a spy and threatening her in the span of a couple minutes. He then goes from not wanting anything to do with her to having her as the most important person. It\'s like he\'s a tsundere and wants her to know he doesn\'t like her or anything. The mole guy goes from worshipping her as a goddess to trying to get money out of her for no apparent reason. And our antagonist, Folken, shifts from torturing Dilandau for failing to smiling at him and acting like he needs him. It\'s like everyone in Gaea has severe bipolar disorder.It doesn\'t help that there are very few characters in this film who we actually need for the film\'s plot to work. Most of them seem to be here because fans of the longer series will recognise them. You could pretty much get rid of Van\'s entire entourage since most of them have no real personality and do maybe one thing. Dilandau\'s men are pretty pointless too. To the point where there\'s a sequence where they\'re trying to retrieve Hitomi from Van and Dilandau is the only one who actually steps forward to engage him. Does he just keep them around as a glorified cheering squad? I mean, that could work if the film were more comedic and they actually cheered while he went into action. Not so much with what we actually have.The major characters do have their own arcs with Hitomi learning to have hope and Van learning to let go of his past and move forward. They aren\'t particularly well executed but they\'re basically passable.Art:The big problem with the artwork is the whole atmosphere around Gaea. You get some stuff that looks a bit idyllic and gives Gaea a more typical fantasy setting but that\'s superimposed with these grim, heavily industrialised scenes that showcase the world destroying mecha and other science fiction technologies. You could legitimately take scenes from the small beast folk village, put them against scenes from the city where they have the final confrontation and persuade anyone who hasn\'t seen the film that they\'re from two different films.That being said, there are some nicely done action sequences. The character designs are pretty well done too. This would be a pretty nice looking film if it had a more consistent look.Sound:The acting is fine. Seki Tomokazu, Sakamoto Maaya, Takayama Minami, & Nakata Jouji all do fine in their roles. If the film was better directed and the character writing was good, I could see them giving some much better performances. But, as is, they\'re okay. Kano Yokko & Mizoguchi Hajime make the sound track the best part of the film. It actually is really good.Ho-yay:There are a few moments where things get a bit homo-erotic between Hitomi and her friend. Nothing significant.Areas of Improvement:Have some actual arc behind shifts in how the characters feel about each other. It would be fine to have Van be suspicious of Hitomi from the start but when you precede that with him kneeling to her and don\'t have a discernible reason for him to start trusting her, it just comes across as clunky.Tone down the dark, brooding aspect. You can\'t have a work that loves to hint at being more light-hearted but also revels in being dark and brooding and expect it to work well. This film would benefit a lot from less drastic shifts to its tone and atmosphere.Fewer nothing characters, better executed arcs for the important ones. That may seem callous since there are people who watched the TV series and loved the characters who don\'t contribute anything to the film, but when you\'ve got a little over an hour and a half, you have to make some choices about which characters to include and how to spend your time with the ones you have. And this film would definitely have benefited from spending less time with under-developed characters who contribute nothing and using that time to better flesh out the arcs of characters like Van and Hitomi.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, I think calling Escaflowne a bad film would be going too far. It\'s certainly clumsy and has quite a few issues stemming from that. Which is why I\'m giving it a 4/10 and calling it sub-par. to be spurned.

Before I get to that, I'll give a capsule review: this is a very nice movie that takes the characters and basic plot structure of the TV show and crafts them in a way to talk about an entirely different set of themes. To get the most out of the movie some familiarity with the characters will be helpful, however being too tied to characters behaving and doing the same things as they did in the show will invariably lead to disappointment.SPOILERS AHEAD (I can...only talk about the themes of the show and movie with the aid of spoilers, I'll minimize plot spoilers as best as possible)This is an interesting movie as the overall primary relationships between the characters from the show and those in the movie are largely the same. Of course, anyone outside of Hitomi and Van get considerably less to do, but such are the time constraints of a 90 minute movie compared to a twelve hour show. However thematically the story of the movie is used to talk about something very different than did the show.The TV show seemed to show us that man's attempt to change and control fate and destiny, even when its done for pure reasons, has unintended destructive side effects. It isn't so much a free will versus determinism argument as much as it is a warning against trying to get too tangled in controlling fate, lest you get bit.The movie however, doesn't go there at all and instead is a story about suicide and loneliness. There's a sort of fictional logic to the idea that a young girl on earth's desire to kill herself would hold the fate of an entire fantasy world in thrall. Here Hitomi is a very sad and lonely girl who lives life and yet is untouched by it. Her yearning for extinction is what draws her to Gaea, and through the process of meeting Von and realizing that she doesn't want him to want to die, she sees the value of life. The message here is very much about the power of choosing to live even through times of pain and how even though we are alone, within love we are also united.I think both themes and stories are valid and I love how the same director returned to the well and brought up very different results. I'm curious to see if the manga offers a similarly diverse look at the same root material. only talk about the themes of the show and movie with the aid of spoilers, I'll minimize plot spoilers as best as possible)This is an interesting movie as the overall primary relationships between the characters from the show and those in the movie are largely the same.

It is just beautiful, much better than VoE visuals, and those weirds nose are gone!The sound is the same of the 26\'s animated version, so you can count on that awesome ""Escaflowne"" battle song, that sadly only appears one time, a great battle... a pity...this movie is about Escaflowne but only near the end you see it fighting... in all its glory.The story itself it is a different one versus the original, also being far darker. And that extends to its cast, manly Hitomi. As far as it goes, almost everyone from VoE makes an appearence, just dont expect them to have the same personalities, behaviors or goals (I prefered much more Van\'s brother from VoE...).That is fine, while the setting is mostly the same, like I said, it is another story.There is just one thing that makes sting me. I understand that it is a movie that strives to cover alot, in only 95 minutes, but that brings some problems like the pacing and development of its story and characters. If you are watching this for the story, it is watchable. Not bad, not that interesting either. As for characters, the development was too rushed, they behave a certain way, and suddently with certain scene, they just change and the whole transition was just not natural or realistic at all!This means as a viewer, the connection built with the characters wont be as strong as it should...Vision of Escaflowne done greatly on both of these traits (though with more episodes would be even better, but for 26... was great indeed), but the movie falls short on the floor, at this point having seen VoE and being a fan of it, actually helped alot since ""I could justify a bit more their behaviors"" remenbering their development on the main series, making it easier to swallow at the end. Still the flaw is there.I reccomend this one, for the fans of the original to give it a try, just came with the mindset that at the end what will left the biggest impression will be the visuals and the sound, which produced some(ok one or two) really great action scenes, overall great animation that felt much more smooth than VoE\'s and maybe you will kind of enjoy the darker and bit more gory atmosphere that cames with the movie, like I did.For the new guys to the series, if you enjoyed this one, please make an effort to see at least the first 10 episodes of the original, you will enjoy it more.A good watch.

This movie is a re-imagined version of the original 26 episode tv series, and is very different.

As for the voice acting, I watched the English dub version and thought the actors all did a very good job and were well cast for their roles.ENJOYMENT(8):The biggest factor in me rating this movie was my enjoyment and I very much enjoyed this movie, I loved seeing familiar characters re-designed and with different personalities and roles, it was enjoyable for me all the way through.*sigh* if only there was more... had me interested and wanting more until the very end.

The animation (particularly the eyes) seemed a little odd. Not nearly as beautiful as some. Well done overall but not a favorite of mine. ', 'BACK IN MY DAY (!), “The Vision of Escaflowne” was considered one of the pinnacles of Japanimation. It featured the triple threat of a great story, charismatic characters and gorgeous production values. And it also had cross gender appeal through romance and fortune-telling (popular in Japan at the time) for girls and dragons/mecha for the boys. Over time though, it was mostly forgotten in the rapidly growing fandom. Among those relatively older anime acolytes, it still remains a cherished favorite (for yours truly as well). So well received was it, that this big-screen version was birthed a few years later. Sadly, it was the last...time we got to travel with Hitomi in Gaea.“Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea” was one of the last epic anime films with the privilege of being done in cellular animation: and its quality shows.  This ish’ is jaw dropping! Person designer Nobuteru Yūki’s drool-inducing creations are palpably elegant and have textural weight, a rarity in the medium. The central cast in particular will remind you of the moment you fell in love with anime’s strange hyper-reality. Visual moneyshots abound: beautiful clothing flowing in the wind, sunsets reflecting off of armor, and villains brooding in the dark. On that measure the movie is essential to animation enthusiasts of any stripe. Also of note are the action scenes, which are gorgeously done and whose fluidity and detail astound. The cinematography is often excellent as well, utilizing moments of like a landscape’s pensive stillness to punctuate and frame scenes. Some of the locations and background characters are a bit rote, but they still manage to be lovingly detailed and realized. Of course, musical couple Yoko Kanno and Hajime Mizugitchi’s score is charismatic and memorable. I especially like the vocal and choral pieces and the lower key string ques are also intriguing. When the film gets its audio/visual narrative mixture right, the effect is almost mystical and extremely captivating!Yet these virtues are blunted, because this is quite a flawed picture…ending a half hour premature for a normal movie epic, and being half hour too long for what the film actually provides in narrative. When I popped the movie in for the first time, I was dismayed to read its runtime on the keepcase because I knew it wasn’t long enough. In a typical television to big-screen fashion, there are way too many characters, and said characters motivations are vague and change when the story needs them to. We get treated to lots of cameos that distract from fleshing out the main trio of characters (Hitomi, Vaan and Folken) i.e. where the major drama waited to be cooked up. Boiling down about ten hours of television into ninety minutes is a difficult and admirable task, but one can’t help but wish that the product turned out differently. As said before, when this work gets it together, it WORKS. My favorite scene in the entire film occurs at Dryden’s Inn. Naria and Eyira, the cat sisters who served Folken in the anime, are adapted into two dancing girls. They sing an absolutely enchanting version of the film’s central song motif (“Song of the Dragon Clan” whose original version is a bit wonky to be honest) in what results as an actualization of just about everything I love in fantasy. The scene is draped in a bluish haze, parallel to the bluish notes of the new-age synthline that carrys the song, which is then held aloft by a slow electro pulse. The dancers are beautifully dressed in cultural costume and submerged in this interior scene where patrons converse and listen in a lifelike manner. The scene itself does not further the action directly, but instead shows us how elemental and important the legend of the Dragon Clan is to the general population of Gaia. It feels natural and inspired, and it naturally brings on chills. I love the short scene so much that I can’t help but lament about the rest of the film.I must echo the usual complaints that we’ve heard over the years in that Hitomi is a shadow of her irresistible television personage due to how little time we get to understand why she feels so terrible. How did such a state attract the attention of Folken, who likely had access to countless other depressed teenagers? Why is she a chosen one? To be fair, when I watched this movie for the day of its DVD release in summer 2002, my passage through puberty was giving me the first tastes of chronic depression, a sign of what the rest of my life was to be like (my reasons for being depressed were certainly not very dramatic at all at that time). And of course such states mostly go unnoticed by passerby’s in reality, but we get all of a few lines of dialogue and scenes to impart her despondency. She cannot coalesce into a complicated and emotional teenager, instead wilting into someone mean spirited who lashes out at her friend for the heck of it. Spending more time on Earth with her and establishing her as the case as a link between worlds would have undoubtedly made her a much more appealing heroine and given the film the true center it needed. Someone derivative of Nausicaä or Nadia would have even worked much better. It is wise to show that Hitomi feels guilt over her previous behavior in one scene, but it isn’t enough. The obligatory “metaphysical” montage that we get at the end of film also gives us a few vague images and lines about loneliness that cannot stand up to the grandiosity surrounding it. The emotions and motivations of the characters should endeavor to be as baroque as their surroundings.In a similar way, Folken’s ambiguous turncoat from the series is reduced to a rote nihilistic overlord out of a 90’s JRPG. His motivation to “end everything” is fueled merely because he was passed up in line for the throne, and that is it. It is unclear as to why he chooses to destroy his homeland instead of merely seizing it, and his world ending ambitions are just as uncertain. It is possible that the film hinted at this reason with his relationship to dark technologies and sorcery later on, and if he were subject to some mind-warping revelations then at least we would have that. But otherwise he is a significant weakness in the story. A shame. Van is the only character that gets somewhat close to being what he needs to be: a (secretly) compassionate warrior who nevertheless will stop at nothing to destroy the wicked, even if it means his own demise. It is hard not to be interested in someone like that! As a more aggressive and vengeful rendition of his TV character, we are treated to some very cool battle scenes and moments of quiet that show us his softer side that had been pushed underneath his surface. But again, there isn’t enough time to define him as more than just that.The film really wants to be “Akira” or “Evangelion” in its more violent and destructive scenes, but merely shadows those milestones without taking faith in its own fantasy world. Escaflowne itself bleeds and contorts like the Eva units, while the telekinetic battles between Dragon Clan members are pure Tetsuo vs. Possessed Kei and tacked on for a big screen wallop. While they are admittedly cool and flawlessly done, they distract from the numerous phenomena that the TV series already had. The original was conceived as “Macross” mixed with “Dunbine” on paper but it resulted in “Escaflowne.” Here we get something like “Escaevakira.” I also suppose part of what makes me like the film is the fact that it is even connected to such a lovely and fun show. It is familiar, and gives us a chance to reenter the world of Gaea. And reality surely encourages repeat escapes to fantasy.Despite all this dissing, I really like this movie, because there is the feeling that I have about it being “right” in what it is: a stately adventure through a different yet similar place that is filled with numerous familiar beings and locales. It is rather bare, lacks a real central focus and does not live up to its huge promise, but it somehow ends up being rather rich, riffs on some really cool motifs and at times conjures up real wonder and awe. But therein lies one of the film’s intrigues, a viewer knows that there is something very, very right going on despite all the elements that are very, very wrong. Personally, I am quite forgiving of ‘visual-feast’ type films because they serve a really important role in reminding audiences that not everything needs to be a tightly plotted potboiler. We as escapists need a chance to feel things beyond the immediately visceral. Images and music on their own have value, because they can say things in languages beyond what the tongue can conjure, and should not be neglected in the face of stone-faced rigidity and literalism. Animation has considerable powers to make us 3D beings feel 4D things through the illusion of motion and depth on a 2D surface.

I only wished this formula worked in ""Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea.""', 'I rewatched this film recently, and personally it still works for me.  Since there are already many reviews, I\'ll just lay out a few thoughts I had.  Note that I have only had minor exposure to Escaflowne the series and have not watched the whole thing.- It\'s pretty likely you\'ll be disappointed if you really loved the original Escaflowne series and are hoping for something similar to that.  This film has a different tone, a different storyline, a completely different theme, and also removes Hitomi\'s fortune-telling.  Luckily for me, I had very little exposure to the series when I saw this...movie the first time.- Thematically, this is very much a post-Eva type of anime - dark, bloody, emotional.  In some ways, it reminds me RayEarth (the OVA), which was a darker AU rewrite of the original bright fantasy adventure Magic Knight Rayearth.  I don\'t mind this sort of ""dark reboot"" if it\'s done well, and Escaflowne is definitely better comparatively than RayEarth - Escaflowne\'s storyline is internally consistent, people have at least basic motivations, and the magic system doesn\'t feel like it\'s being pulled out of nowhere as we go.- I actually felt most of the characters were more interesting here than the impression I have of them from the series.  Allen, instead of being some sort of doofy dream knight, is straight badass.  Hitomi starts out kind of annoying, but is also (as I recognized more and more with time) a decent portrayal of depression, imo.  I also just really prefer this Millerna.- I really appreciate how they handled the main emotional storyline.  Specifically, I find it compelling that, at the beginning, all 3 of the main characters (Hitomi, Van, and Folken) are in the same general place - hurt, angry, bitter and lashing out at their friends because they don\'t know how to handle it.  The Gaea storyline then ends up becoming one centered around finding people and things to help you, or continuing to lash out and push everyone away.- The music is wonderful.  I also still find the art pretty solid as well - this film has a lot of very good imagery and the director clearly had a direction and made some very purposeful shot choices.  The ""Tree of Hearts"" sequence is still one of my favorites.- Finally, maybe this is just a me thing, but I actually liked that there wasn\'t a super strong romantic emphasis.  You can easily interpret Hitomi/Van as being a thing, and even Folken and Sora have some one-sided love vibes, but there isn\'t anything overtly romantic in the story.  I know this is a pretty big change from the series, which had a frankly soapy amount of romantic entanglements, but I\'ve never been huge on romance-heavy stories, and I think it\'s worthwhile to also celebrate close relationships that aren\'t romantic.--Just to clarify, though, I don\'t actually think this movie is perfect.  Here are a few criticisms:- The way the story is set up does lead the viewer to potentially compare Hitomi\'s initial problems (seemingly just modern depression) with the Gaea characters\' problems (destruction of entire civilizations and war PTSD).  This is by no means me saying that depression isn\'t a real problem, it\'s just that the movie sort of unintentionally leads you to compare the background of why the characters are depressed, which leads to this weird sense of scope imbalance when Hitomi\'s depression doesn\'t have the same sort of dramatic root.- The movie was pretty short, so there\'s not enough time to shows us much of the side characters.  I would have really loved to get at least a little more of the caravan crew, and what the stories were of the cool new Allen and Millerna.- Also probably due to time restrictions, a few things felt like they jumped a little fast.  The biggest example is Hitomi\'s stay at the village, where things feel like they suddenly progressed a little faster than entirely realistic.  (Sorry for the vagueness, trying to avoid spoilers.)--Overall, I still really enjoyed it years later as an adult.  Maybe some of it is the nostalgia, or the fact that I got into anime around the heyday of dark post-Eva 00s series, or just because I watched RayEarth (which was honestly not very good) recently.  Still, I think it\'s worth a try, particularly if you don\'t know much about the original or are okay with a completely different AU. movie the first time.- Thematically, this is very much a post-Eva type of anime - dark, bloody, emotional.  In some ways, it reminds me RayEarth (the OVA), which was a darker AU rewrite of the original bright fantasy adventure Magic Knight Rayearth.

I know this is a pretty big change from the series, which had a frankly soapy amount of romantic entanglements, but I\'ve never been huge on romance-heavy stories, and I think it\'s worthwhile to also celebrate close relationships that aren\'t romantic.--Just to clarify, though, I don\'t actually think this movie is perfect.  Here are a few criticisms:- The way the story is set up does lead the viewer to potentially compare Hitomi\'s initial problems (seemingly just modern depression) with the Gaea characters\' problems (destruction of entire civilizations and war PTSD).  This is by no means me saying that depression isn\'t a real problem, it\'s just that the movie sort of unintentionally leads you to compare the background of why the characters are depressed, which leads to this weird sense of scope imbalance when Hitomi\'s depression doesn\'t have the same sort of dramatic root.- The movie was pretty short, so there\'s not enough time to shows us much of the side characters.  I would have really loved to get at least a little more of the caravan crew, and what the stories were of the cool new Allen and Millerna.- Also probably due to time restrictions, a few things felt like they jumped a little fast.  The biggest example is Hitomi\'s stay at the village, where things feel like they suddenly progressed a little faster than entirely realistic.  (Sorry for the vagueness, trying to avoid spoilers.)--Overall, I still really enjoyed it years later as an adult.  Maybe some of it is the nostalgia, or the fact that I got into anime around the heyday of dark post-Eva 00s series, or just because I watched RayEarth (which was honestly not very good) recently.  Still, I think it\'s worth a try, particularly if you don\'t know much about the original or are okay with a completely different AU.', ""Escaflowne the movie differs greatly from Escaflowne the series. One could have seen this as an opportunity to address the many problems of the source material regarding its plot and poorly written characters but the movie is actually plagued by the same mediocre storytelling the series were...The main problem of the movie probably comes from the fact it is, just like the series, way to short for the story Akane is trying to tell, making everything feel rushed and contrived. This is emphasised even more by the staff's concern for fanservice as they try to shoehorn in a 90min film every characters from a series...that already had too many. As a result most of them serve no purpose other than making a little cameo and hurt the overall plot that cannot properly focus on its main protagonists. For example the sole purpose of Allen here is a short duel with Van, that clearly has no stakes whatsoever. And, because of this, character growth suffers: for example Hitomi starts out as depressed and suicidal but magically becomes fine ten minutes later. Motivations are not clearly presented, or become overly simplistic (Folken), and even the basic political situation of Gaea is left for the spectator to guess, so that I don't think anyone who has not seen the original series (and I said seen, not enjoyed) would appreciate the story that they are being told... Who is Allen ? Why is Van travelling with him if they don't like each other and if he does everything by himself anyway ? Millerna is a princess but of what country ? Why is she with Allen and why is she a medic ? Who is Dryden and why is he important ? Who is this woman that stays by Folken's side ? Why do Dilandau's goons support him ? They mention sorcerers at one point but they are not shown to the spectator even once and have no impact on the plot... The movie clearly tried to simplify the action but still kept way more than it could handle.Along with the many simplifactions come some modifications and even some additions (sigh...). The most obvious one is the fact that Van and Folken have now become moronic edgelords, almost to the same level as Dilandau. In fact everything is has more edge, the anime has become more violent, the tone is darker, Hitomi is suicidal in the beginning... This is not a bad thing in and of itself but the execution is, once again, deeply flawed... The ending is particularly anticlimactic (it was too in the series but this does not make the movie better) with an avorted showdown between the two brothers that does not solve anything and Jajuka coming to kill Folken out of nowhere. The same could be said about Hitomi coming from earth, which yields even less of a pay-off than it did in the show. I do not see how adding magic powers to a few characters is relevant to the plot either.Visuals are once again one of the strengths of Escaflowne. The animation is gorgeous and backgrounds are grandiose with beautiful colors and composition. Still I feel the original was aesthetically more pleasing, mainly because I think the redesigns are not as interesting and novel as they were in the source material (though I like the more organic look of Escaflowne specifically), but also because the image darker overall. Music is still great but not as memorable as it was in the series.Strangely, Escaflowne the movie manages to have the exact same strengths and weaknesses (albeit exacerbated) as Escaflowne the series while changing the plot dramatically.

It had spectacular world building, interesting and realistic characters and an unmatched OST making the emotional scenes that much more impactful and the action scenes that much more exciting. At the end it perfectly wrapped everything up in a tight package with no need for more. 4 years later someone decided to make a movie about it. So how do you follow such a masterpiece with a movie? Well the only conclusion I can draw out of this case study is…. you don’t.The Escaflowne movie...basically is an attempt of a retelling of the original “The vision of Escaflowne” show with the same characters (not all of course), but in a different setting and everything is basically a bit different now.  It is ridiculous to believe a movie that spans 90 min can achieve what a show did in 26 episodes, however the movie tries to attempt that.  For example look at the romance between the 2 main characters. In the tv-show a slow build up that is relatable with setbacks until at the end everything comes together to make it that much more fulfilling, while in the movie they talk to each other for like 2 times (once in a very aggressive manner, almost leading to the death of one of them) and suddenly Hitomi wants to stay at Vans side forever? It would be just pathetic if it wasn't so insulting to the TV-show.Then there is no world building and no politics in the movie, which already takes away a large part what makes the original great and besides being a weak attempt of a romance the movie boils down to a generic action flick. While in the original the villains had motivation that was somewhat understandable, here they are just bad because the script told them to. And when the movie tackles some interesting ideas, like seeing your previous allies being forced to work for the villains to survive, with the moral implication how to deal with it, this situation gets instantly resolved and forgotten about in an instant.  Basically the movie doesn’t want to try anything new, like killing off main characters and shine the spotlight on someone else, its just the most boring re-imagination, stripping off all that was great about “The vision of Escaflowne” without adding anything of value.As I eluded before, the whole movie was too fast paced and couldn’t even make the action scenes interesting. There were no stakes or threats or any worth while connection between villains and main characters. The end felt rushed and not well thought through.The only thing good about the movie is its visuals and audio. The animation was top notch, and the artstyle nice, although since all character look a little different from the original it felt a bit weird and not correct. The whole astetics of the movie had this feudal japan vibe to it which I found also not really fitting for Escaflowne. The OST was also nice. The best songs were still taken from the original but it had some nice additions. It shows however that all the money you spend on making your movie look and sound nice is lost if you cant make the story engaging and your characters interesting.So overall the Escaflowne movie is rubbish. It’s like they wanted to include so many things; romance, character relationships and pasts, action and so on in a 90 min movie, rushing through everything half-heartedly not achieving anything of value.  Just dont watch it. basically is an attempt of a retelling of the original “The vision of Escaflowne” show with the same characters (not all of course), but in a different setting and everything is basically a bit different now.

Just dont watch it."", 'The Vision of Escaflowne (or TVE aka Television Escaflowne lol) is more than just a good show. It\'s borderline great, providing a coming-of-age story with a heartfelt message about being conscious of the consequences of one\'s actions and the ramifications of pursuing one\'s selfish desires. Not only is this exemplified in our main heroine, Hitomi Kanzaki, but it\'s also demonstrated in the story\'s hero, Van Fanel, his antihero brother, Folken, and especially the series\' villain, Emperor Dornkirk. Throw in a pretty decent story, some stellar production values courtesy of Sunrise, and amazing music (from  composers Hajime Mizoguchi and Yoko Kanno, hell yeah!) and you...have a classic of the isekai genre and of anime as a whole. I give it a rock-solid 8 out of 10.So where does Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea, a film reboot of the series, go wrong?Well, to give some context, TVE was kind of like Sunrise combining The Lord of the Rings with Mobile Suit Gundam to make something slightly fantastical, scientific, and epic enough to have giant robots. However, I guess that when this film was in development, Japan was more taken with a mecha franchise different from Gundam, so the developers decided to shift things up a bit, taking away a lot of the science fiction and replacing it with straight fantasy (which I wouldn\'t mind, but the green magic farts are pretty lame). And blood. Lots of blood. This movie is not for young teens, people. Be forewarned.If TVE was a love child of LOTR and MSG, then Escaflowne is a combination of LOTR (with more Asian influence) and Neon Genesis Evangelion, and not always in ways that are as freaking awesome as that sounds.I\'lll go into how the characters feel like they belong in Evangelion later; first, I have to address how much I love the Eva-like redesigns of the mechs in this film. Yes, there basically is only one scene with any Guymelefs, and they don\'t even call them that, but my God is that scene a ton of fun to watch. I can gush for a whole paragraph about how the armors suck the pilot\'s blood and give them a Pacific-Rim-before-Pacific-Rim-like control scheme and all that, and about how the machines move and sound weirdly organic with shiver-inducing Eva-like squelching sounds and UUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! It\' so freaking cool!!! Visually, this may just be one of my favorite works by Sunrise/Bones ever for both the character/mech designs as well as the sheer quality of the art and animation on display. Shading is intensive, animation is almost always very fluid, and while it is true that some background characters are not always drawn super-well, they move and emote frequently (especially in the scenes outside Gaea), and they definitely look better than in a later Bones original film, Sword of the Stranger.Also better than in Sword of the Stranger is the music. Goddamn, this music is incredible. Some tracks do find there way here from TVE (same composers and all), but for the most part, the score is original, with a few insert songs here and there and some truly mesmerizing pieces. Some of my favorite tracks are ""Into GAEA"" and ""Black Escaflowne"". You can find both of them, as well as most if not all of the soundtrack, on YouTube. I highly, HIGHLY recommend you check it out. While we\'re in the sound department, I\'ll mention that the Japanese voice acting is pretty great. I didn\'t watch either of the English dubs, but while I prefer the original Ocean dub over the Funimation dub for TVE, neither really hold a candle to TVE\'s Japanese dub, and while the Ocean dub may be better than the Funimation dub for the film, I didn\'t bother finding out if that\'s entirely true. Unlike with TVE, there is actually a Blu-ray release of the original dub. Funimation has their own release now, but the Bandai Blu-ray is, if I am correct, cheaper to buy than the Funimation release. However, it won\'t be around forever, which makes it even more tragic that Funimation didn\'t do a great job with casting for their dub. If you do want to buy TVE, I would recommend buy the Funimation Blu-ray for the sole reason that you can watch it in 1080p, but the original Bandai DVD releases (in 480p) can be found in a nice collection as part of their ""Anime Legends"" imprint for a price that is an ABSOLUTE STEAL. Seriously, less than 17 dollars for TVE? Sign me the hell up. However, if you reeeeeeally want that sweet HD, just ignore the Funimation dub, because they totally screwed up the voices of Van, Folken, Dilandau, and Mole Man, even if all-around line delivery is better than in the Ocean dub.To backtrack a bit, with all these comparisons to Sword of the Stranger, one would think I was getting a similar vibe when watching Escaflowne, and while that is definitely true, I am happy to say that I was never really bored with this movie (mainly because it\'s half an hour shorter), at least not until the end which certainly drags its feet with a too-long epilogue sequence. It\'s here that we can dive into the negative parts of this film.I get that Evangelion is popular and that it\'s a landmark franchise of animation to the point that Bones would try again to make a series heavily influenced by it with RahXephon just a few years later (their first original project, if I am correct). I also understand that Escaflowne could have worked with Hitomi being a version of Shinji Ikari (i.e. anxious, depressed, uncertain, and very, VERY lonely), but unlike Shinji or her small screen counterpart, Hitomi is extremely passive and acts more as a damsel in psychological distress than being an active character in the film. In fact, the handling of Hitomi\'s angst and near-suicidal tendencies is executed extremely poorly, both in conception and resolution. While we do get some actually decent scenes with her before she teleports to Gaea that demonstrate her mental state, nothing establishes exactly why she feels the way she does. Shinji Ikari comes from a broken family that he barely even remembers, so it makes sense for him to be angsty and insecure. Granted, TVE Hitomi\'s family life didn\'t have any real development either, but were shown to be loving and kind; why not just go all the way with her being a knock-off Shinji in this film and do it right by giving her a similar backstory? Say something like ""her parents got divorced and she didn\'t take it well"" or, if you don\'t want to mention her family at all, say ""she was mercilessly bullied in school because she liked performing tarot card readings and inadvertently pissed off a queen bee"". Actually, I like that second one. It relates the film further to TVE. In my own headcanon, I\'m just going to pretend that\'s the film\'s explanation for her mental state and why she has no tarot cards, because it\'s certainly better than the nothing that we got. Perhaps there was more originally, but they got cut from the film.Hitomi aside, Van and Folken are, unfortunately, also quite poorly developed, despite the fact that they are central to the drama. The story is this: because Van was found to be destined to become Fanelia\'s king, Folken murdered their parents and destroyed the entire country, believing that the only way to end suffering and sorrow was with utter, absolute annihilation. Pretty dumb and absurd, right? Yes. Van has dialed the edginess to freaking 15, convinced that his only purpose in life is to avenge his family and country by killing Folken. Just one-note characters all around (although Dilandau is the kind of one-note character I love). The setup is equally simple and dumb; Folken wants Hitomi to summon Escaflowne (which is her superpower in this film, not divination, hence no tarot cards) to allow Folken to pilot it and destroy everything, and Hitomi has to overcome her own mental hangups in order to... tell Folken ""no""... (sigh, really?)... and help Van through his problems in order for him to pilot it instead without destroying Gaea. This may work on paper, but there is no real transitional phase, no key series of events that brings Hitomi out of her depression and makes it inevitable, not obvious while also out of left field, that she would help Van work through his issues. Additionally, I don\'t buy their relationship for half a second; while TVE Van actually expressed human moments, vulnerability, and kindness toward others, this Van is only edge, only violent outbursts (he even draws his sword to kill Hitomi when they first meet and ends up raging against Allen). The relationship is no less than borderline dysfunctional; while they are similar in that they have both been hurting for a very long time, Van shows no positive emotion, no redeeming qualities, and does nothing to give Hitomi the mental and emotional aid she needs, just saving her life at one point. And that heals her just fine. Remember that scene in Parasyte, when Tamiya Ryoko (a murderer initially devoid of empathy) sacrificed her life to protect her baby and teach the hero, Shinichi, that he actually can still feel, care, and cry for other beings? That empathy is essential to living a fulfilling life? You know, the one (EXACTLY ONE) scene in any anime where I legitimately almost cried? Yeah, nothing like that here, and Escaflowne desperately needed something similar to even come close to working.Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea is not a good film. In fact, one would not likely be hard-pressed to find someone who is legitimately insulted by how they handle Hitomi\'s mental health problems. I\'ll spell it straight out in all seriousness: Hitomi does not need Van, a violent sociopath. She needs a therapist, someone who is patient, able to feel for her, and is willing to guide her to a better state of mind. Insulting as this film is, though, I still appreciate the level of craft and passion that went into making it, and I did in fact find it entertaining, even if it is absolutely, unequivocally a dumb movie that thinks it\'s way smarter than it is. In my book, that\'s even worse than something that fundamentally misunderstands how to explain what it wants to say with characters that make sense (see Eden of the East), but at least Escaflowne is shorter than a TV series. I can see myself rewatching it for some scenes, but the writers missed the mark big time. Stick to the TV series, The Vision of Escaflowne. It is a classic, and it has stood and will continue to stand the test of time.Happy Watching!- LC have a classic of the isekai genre and of anime as a whole.

Escaflowne the movie is none of these things.  So, what went wrong?A lot seems to stem from who the film was made for.  The Escaflowne TV series ended up being a lot more popular internationally than it was in Japan, and I suspect that led them to retool the tone to fit what was the common western perception of anime in the 90s, ie. mindless violence for teenage boys.  Consequently, the film is...pointlessly violent, with limbs being hacked off all over the place, and the elegant Escaflowne robot from the TV series is turned into a blood-sucking biomechanical nightmare.  The characters fare even worse, with most being turned into grimdark mockeries of their TV incarnations, and the main villain being reduced to a one-dimensional shell of his former self.  While Van being turned into a blood-thirsty psychopath is the most jarring change, it\'s the changes to protagonist Hitomi that ultimately break the story.Complaints around the changes to Hitomi tend to focus on her being suicidal at the start of the movie.  I don\'t actually see that as a problem, since it gives her the potential for a decent arc of character growth.  What breaks her role in the story is the removal of her premonitions.  TV Hitomi manages to remain proactive as an unarmed high-school girl in a world where everyone else solves their problems with swords and robots, and she does this by struggling to prevent the impending disasters that she sees in her visions.  This ability is taken away from movie Hitomi, and is replaced with... nothing.  Consequently, while the movie follows Hitomi\'s perspective for the most part, she doesn\'t really do anything for the first half of the movie.  She just stands around quietly looking at the scenery while everyone shouts, ""Hey look, it\'s the Wing Goddess"" at her.The other major problem with movie Hitomi is how her character development is handled.  Rather than occurring organically from her actions (because she doesn\'t take any action), halfway through the movie she just abruptly stops being depressed and falls in love with Van because... that\'s what happens.  It\'s especially bizarre that she falls for Van in their second scene together, since in their first shared scene he is on the verge of murdering her for the crime of getting within 20 metres of him, until he gets distracted by some of his allies getting within 20 metres of him and tries to murder them instead.The movie is admittedly beautiful, with animation direction that\'s even more visually arresting than the TV series, and Yoko Kanno turns in another great musical score, but this doesn\'t come close to saving a movie that has none of the heart and soul that made the TV series so special. pointlessly violent, with limbs being hacked off all over the place, and the elegant Escaflowne robot from the TV series is turned into a blood-sucking biomechanical nightmare.

I think if the WAS a video game the story would be much better, thanks to more character interaction, flavour text, and time (for story to develop, the world to be fleshed out, etc). I heard that this is based off of a series, which has actual character development and moments that are more than just ""depression"" or ""action"" moments. The overall feel of this movie is a depressing, dark tone. Which is cool! I love series that have a dark/depressing theme to them, however there weren\'t really...any fluctuations in emotion throughout the movie. It just leaves the viewer with a sense that they\'re supposed to feel sad without much change (even with increased sadness! It\'s just the same level!) throughout.I\'m going to check out the series this was based off of because it can really benefit from the extra time a series allows for. I\'m also looking forward to more moments of different emotion.

The style was so unique that it picked my interest.After watching some of the series, I decided to watch this movie and got disappointed.The thing is, this movie is rushed and extreme underdeveloped. To fully realize this story you need more time to built these characters, show their backgrounds and develop their relationships. This is something the series does right, even though there's a lot of filler and pointless sidetracking, but that's another review.Another thing that felt lacking here are the mecha battles. In fact, it's almost absent in this movie...and the Escaflowne itself is left in the background.Since the characters are not developed, their motivations feel really weak and shallow. Hitomi and Folken are the ones who suffer the most. Allen don't even get proper screen time.I really don't know what they were aiming with this. It would be much better as by removing the boredom from the series and making it a short series with the same art style and direction. It's not that the decision to make it more dark is a bad thing, ius just that they don't give the audience enough to be immersed or even understand what's going on with this story.Watch it for the art without expecting anything else.I hope they remake this someday. and the Escaflowne itself is left in the background.Since the characters are not developed, their motivations feel really weak and shallow.

Honestly I\'m tempted to give this a 9/10 for what it is. It\'s perhaps one of the best ""performances"" that macross has to offer.Some may find this a bit distasteful with is how it sort of answers some questions that the aforementioned movie left open to interpretation....However as a long time fan of macros F I was just delighted to see such a high quality product still be made in a time where Macross as a franchise seems to have been put to rest.But for what it is, this is definitely very good. I would highly recommend watching this.

The story is tightly-paced and fleshes out the junkyard as its own world extremely well, all without dialogue (an impressive feat).Art, 8: A muted, classic style presumably to match our television protagonist\'s own visuals.

Let's check.Story:We open with an old cabinet television being taken to the junkyard. After being dropped off, the television tries to escape the junkyard, possibly wanting to return to the family that used to own it. The cabinet meets a bunch of other sentient objects in the junkyard led by a broken clockwork rabbit but refuses to engage much with them.The biggest narrative issue with the film is that the rift between the cabinet and the other junkyard denizens isn't...resolved all that well. The cabinet has a moment with clockwork rabbit and that's kind of it. It's also a bit odd that a select few objects in the junkyard have sentience but the rest don't seem to.On the positive side, there are some really funny moments in this. It's also effective at building its world and showcasing personalities of these sentient items without ever having them exchange dialogue. I also really like the ending. It has a bittersweet tint that really works.Characters:The major characters in this are the objects. The clockwork rabbit and cabinet are both well developed and have a good deal of depth in spite of not having any dialogue. The rabbit is pretty endearing as well. The other objects like the fan, chair and bucket are less compelling but you do get a decent sense of what they're like.Art:The artwork in this looks very nice. They make the objects move around in a way that seems very realistic. The style is pretty charming as well. The film also uses visual gags effectively.Sound:The music is pretty solid. There's very little voice acting. It has a little bit when the cabinet television turns on and it does sound like voices over an old, beat up telly.Ho-yay:There's no romance in this. It's about sapient objects.Areas of Improvement:The side objects could use stronger personalities.We need some kind of explanation, even a heavy implied one, for why most of the junkyard objects are just normal objects.The film could benefit from a little more time with the tell cabinet engaging with the other sapient objects after it comes out of its shell.Final Thoughts:Golden Time is almost as good as Tsumiki no Ie. It has charm, humour and effectively tells a story heavily rooted in animism purely through animation. My rating on this one is going to be an 8/10. Check it out if the basic concept sounds somewhat appealing. resolved all that well. The cabinet has a moment with clockwork rabbit and that's kind of it.

Gundam Build Divers Re:Rise,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40192/Gundam_Build_Divers_Re_Rise,"['This is my first review, so please excuse my bad writing if there are any.I mean look we all know what this is, its just an expensive advertisement so Bandai can sell more Gunpla. With that said, this season of the build divers series is much more enjoyable than the first original season which was just bad.Story: 7I personally felt that the story was alright given that it has G rating for kids. In the beginning the story was boring but was understandable to develop the characters and the world. At the very least there were no episodes that were just mindless fillers to...promote a new gunpla kit. The story always kept moving forward even though there wasn\'t much going for it. However towards the end, the story\'s tone suddenly shifted and really surprised me that it would do something like that for a ""kids show"". This was when the show suddenly became more interesting and made me more invested. It wasn\'t anything new but it was a welcome change to the friendship battles we got in the original season (which was again reallyyyy bad). There was this one part where a particular someone was able to ""take off"" which was just bullshit but other than that it was alright. But is it worth watching towards the end ? That really depends on how much you\'re invested in this SAO like world that Sunrise created and whether you give a damn at all about Gundam (and gunpla).Art: 6Let\'s just get this out of the way, we know this show doesn\'t have that high of a budget. But Oh boy does it show like a poorly built or engineered Gunpla kit. When it\'s not moving and standing still it\'s quite decent to look at, but the moment you try to move it, it just breaks apart. That is the animation quality of this show, while its not bad all the time, but when it tries to do fights that requires a lot of movement it just becomes a mess at times. Granted the Gundams did look cool when they\'re not in motion, just dont pause during fight scenes.Sound: 5Nothing much to talk about. The main theme is kinda catchy at times but all in all the sound and music are nothing worth talking about.Characters: 6We got the stereotypical emo anime protagonist, a mysterious girls with a mysterious past, the overconfident teammate and the newbie. That being said, these characters were much better than the characters in the original season. They were all relatable one way or anyway, and had enough development to justify them suddenly being able to do shit and weren\'t suddenly OP. For example, one character was bad at fighting and even after his episode arc he was better but not Godlike. What I meant to say was I think they\'re all just Okay but they kinda grow on ya a bit. They\'re not perfect or OP and I guess that\'s what makes them relatable in a gaming sense. Towards the end, I felt a bit more invested in the characters and want to see more for what they have to offer in the second season.Enjoyment: 7I like Gundam, they release a new show I\'ll watch it, show me a new Gundam design I\'ll like it and maybe buy the Gunpla kit. I\'m a Gundam fan so yes I may be a bit bias and I did enjoy the show I mean I knew this series will be hated by some people who want more out of it. But I know what it is and didn\'t expect much from it. Keeping that mind, I did enjoy watching all the new Gundam designs and how much better it was than the original season.Overall: 6There\'s no point in sugarcoating it so I\'ll get straight to the point. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it better than the original series? Hell Yes. Should you watch it ?

Build Fighters was all about improving and learning more about gunpla. Showing that you can be any type of person and still pay Bandai money, with fanservice galore.Build Divers and it\'s subsequent sequel are now wearing the husk of the original series to pander to the mainstream audience. There\'s no relevancy to anything about Gundam in the story, characters, or world. The only references you will find are cameos. Re:Rise is just a generic modern isekai with gunpla.It has better animation than Build Divers which is why...I assume a lot of people stayed past the first 3 episodes. Because the story is horrid. It continues the trend of having a ""serious"" and ""deep"" plot in a show about building gunpla. Everything is slowly expositioned to you as the episodes go and you\'ll still have ten questions. There\'s no build up to plot twists and no character development. There\'s no exploration of what they shit onto the table. It\'s just there.  There\'s huge event at episode 12 and you can\'t care because all of the characters involved(besides Jed) didn\'t even exist before 1-2 episodes ago.There\'s only one character with an actual personality: Justice Knight. He\'s comic relief. The protagonist is an angsty teenager that has a mysterious past that he flashbacks to like he fought in a war.

Coming off the tail end of Build Divers my expectations were very low, however it definitely surprised me.The story is very simplistic but was approached in a way that felt similar to SAO alternative GGO. In that it actually felt like a group of gamers actually playing a game with thought out mechanics. It is also incredibly nice that these characters face failure in the show on more than one occasion. The few twists in the story can barely be considered twists because of how obvious they are.The art and...sound aren\'t really anything special, they\'re good enough to not be distracting but don\'t stick out as amazing. If you are a fan of good looking mecha designs there are also some pretty good ones in this series.When going into this show I was extremely worried about the characters after how obnoxious they all were in Build Divers, but this does a good job building each of the main casts personalities and back stories. The MC is a bit of Mary Sue but he does lose enough to not be considered infallible and just comes across as a pro player, they also tie his internal conflicts to things other than ""Becoming stronger"" like every other shonen protagonist out there. While the main cast is pretty good the background characters are very standard, almost painfully, with very few exceptions. sound aren\'t really anything special, they\'re good enough to not be distracting but don\'t stick out as amazing.

Like many others, I hadn\'t particularly liked Build Divers very much, so I initially dismissed the anime as being more or less the same in terms of quality. However, after hearing various people talk about how much people had enjoyed this, I decided to give this a try, and I actually found it to be quite enjoyable.For those who don\'t know, unlike standard Gundam anime, the ""Build"" series is aimed at a younger audience, and feature characters who build their own plastic models of the mecha from Gundam anime and then...battle other characters. This sounds very much like other children\'s anime like Beyblade or Bakugan, and there is no doubt that this series was made to sell toys, but I think that just because an anime is meant to sell toys to children doesn\'t mean that it couldn\'t be good. In my opinion, the series doesn\'t particularly feel too heavy on the product placement, though it\'s still rather obvious at parts. As I had previously said, Build Divers Re:Rise acts as sort of a loose sequel to Build Divers, but the series has a different cast and the story is mostly unconnected. While there are a few plot points that would be better understood if you\'ve seen the original, the show does an okay job at explaining those plot points that it\'s not completely necessary to do so. If you would rather not be confused on certain plot points, I recommend you to decide whether or not you would want to watch Build Divers before watching this season. The series itself also have quite a few references and easter eggs related to mainline Gundam anime, so if you have seen Gundam before, it is quite interesting to spot them out. However, the references aren\'t too prevalent, so it\'s not really necessary for you to have any knowledge of Gundam before watching this series.The premise of the story is not particularly amazing. At its core, the series is about the main characters who enter a ""Story Mission"" within the game and fight in the various missions, kind of like some kind of RPG, with the premise that they are helping the Resistance (made up of furries) fight against the ""One-Eye"" mobile suits with their own Gunpla. The overall formula of the series is in the format of several 2-3 episode arcs where the Build Divers interact with the story, practice for the mission, run into some difficulties during the practice and the mission itself, and then resolve the mission. Yes, this is rather generic. However, the arcs themselves are different enough that they don\'t feel particularly repetitive, and the missions and fights are entertaining enough to watch with each battle having different objectives and conditions. Beyond that, the story does have some mystery elements that I find to be quite interesting.The characters are also rather enjoyable. While the characters aren\'t really all that complex, they\'re still fun to watch. Because of how different their personalities are, the team often runs into difficulties during the missions like I\'ve said, and it\'s enjoyable to watch them overcome their differences and begin to work better together. The characters themselves also receive some character development, and while this development isn\'t really unique or complex, it\'s still interesting to watch, such as the main character Hiroto learning to grow more trusting of his teammates. And yes, Kazami starts out pretty annoying in the beginning, but he does get better. The side characters are also surprisingly fun to watch, and I found them to be quite endearing as I watched.The Gunpla fights themselves are alright. The animation isn\'t particularly amazing, and is more of a mixed bag. Like I said though, the fights are still unique and fun to watch as the the characters have to learn to use different strategies with each battle. The Gunpla that the characters use also have various gimmicks to them that are clearly meant to sell toys, but still fun to watch nonetheless. My main complaints with the battles is that the main character, Hiroto, is often the one that does most of the work, especially near the beginning where he is practically the only one that is competent enough at fighting the enemies. This is mitigated slightly by the fact his Gundam has a lot of various forms that make it so that it doesn\'t get too stale every time, but the fact that the others don\'t really get a lot of spotlight still remains. However, this does get better as the episodes progress and the other teammates begin to contribute more to the battles. Another thing that may or may not be an issue is the enemies that the Build Divers fight don\'t really have that much variety. With some exceptions, the enemies are mostly faceless NPCs with no dialogue, and the suits themselves all have a generic looking gray color with some design differences. While I personally don\'t mind it as much, it\'s still something to take into consideration.Ultimately, I found anime to be really enjoyable. Sure, it\'s meant to sell Gunpla, and the characters and story aren\'t really all that the complex. However, it\'s still really fun to watch, both the battles themselves and also the character interactions. The story itself also gets more interesting as it goes on, and ends in a hook for season 2, which I\'m currently watching. battle other characters. This sounds very much like other children\'s anime like Beyblade or Bakugan, and there is no doubt that this series was made to sell toys, but I think that just because an anime is meant to sell toys to children doesn\'t mean that it couldn\'t be good.

The series itself also have quite a few references and easter eggs related to mainline Gundam anime, so if you have seen Gundam before, it is quite interesting to spot them out. However, the references aren\'t too prevalent, so it\'s not really necessary for you to have any knowledge of Gundam before watching this series.The premise of the story is not particularly amazing. At its core, the series is about the main characters who enter a ""Story Mission"" within the game and fight in the various missions, kind of like some kind of RPG, with the premise that they are helping the Resistance (made up of furries) fight against the ""One-Eye"" mobile suits with their own Gunpla. The overall formula of the series is in the format of several 2-3 episode arcs where the Build Divers interact with the story, practice for the mission, run into some difficulties during the practice and the mission itself, and then resolve the mission. Yes, this is rather generic. However, the arcs themselves are different enough that they don\'t feel particularly repetitive, and the missions and fights are entertaining enough to watch with each battle having different objectives and conditions. Beyond that, the story does have some mystery elements that I find to be quite interesting.The characters are also rather enjoyable. While the characters aren\'t really all that complex, they\'re still fun to watch. Because of how different their personalities are, the team often runs into difficulties during the missions like I\'ve said, and it\'s enjoyable to watch them overcome their differences and begin to work better together. The characters themselves also receive some character development, and while this development isn\'t really unique or complex, it\'s still interesting to watch, such as the main character Hiroto learning to grow more trusting of his teammates. And yes, Kazami starts out pretty annoying in the beginning, but he does get better. The side characters are also surprisingly fun to watch, and I found them to be quite endearing as I watched.The Gunpla fights themselves are alright. The animation isn\'t particularly amazing, and is more of a mixed bag. Like I said though, the fights are still unique and fun to watch as the the characters have to learn to use different strategies with each battle. The Gunpla that the characters use also have various gimmicks to them that are clearly meant to sell toys, but still fun to watch nonetheless. My main complaints with the battles is that the main character, Hiroto, is often the one that does most of the work, especially near the beginning where he is practically the only one that is competent enough at fighting the enemies. This is mitigated slightly by the fact his Gundam has a lot of various forms that make it so that it doesn\'t get too stale every time, but the fact that the others don\'t really get a lot of spotlight still remains. However, this does get better as the episodes progress and the other teammates begin to contribute more to the battles. Another thing that may or may not be an issue is the enemies that the Build Divers fight don\'t really have that much variety. With some exceptions, the enemies are mostly faceless NPCs with no dialogue, and the suits themselves all have a generic looking gray color with some design differences. While I personally don\'t mind it as much, it\'s still something to take into consideration.Ultimately, I found anime to be really enjoyable. Sure, it\'s meant to sell Gunpla, and the characters and story aren\'t really all that the complex. However, it\'s still really fun to watch, both the battles themselves and also the character interactions. The story itself also gets more interesting as it goes on, and ends in a hook for season 2, which I\'m currently watching.', 'I finished watching ""Gundam Build Divers Re: Rise"" is spin-off and sequel from ""Gundam Build Divers"" onCrunchyroll.Anyone, who hardcore Gundam series fan here?It\'s anniversary forty years after the original Mobile Suit Gundam first hit the airwaves in 1979 come to the first Gundam show of the Reiwa era.

A location that shows off the richness of the human body of all parties involved. While the hotsprings episode is overdone in anime and will continue to be, it was still fun seeing the Nyaruko crew again and ecchi fans will likely enjoy the fanservice handed to them. Now, let me be completely honest here. I'm indifferent with ecchi, sometimes I love it and sometimes I wish certain anime would remove it. Nyaruko-san is NOT the latter.This OVA is roughly fifteen minutes long and brings the crew of Haiyore! Nyaruko-San W (2nd season) back for an encore and delivers...with the usual comedic goodness that Nyaruko-San offers. I must warn people who truly hate ecchi that there are butt shots, and a few of them at that. I personally enjoyed it, but it is completely understandable that some will not. I really suggest watching both seasons of Nyaruko-San before watching this because it was animated after the two seasons and takes place after them. I'll admit, there is no real story to this OVA and was likely created for the fanservice, but fans of Nyaruko-San will most likely enjoy this episode.I'm pretty confident most-all of the important characters are shown at least once, so if you like a certain character you'll be really glad seeing them again.Overall, I am fan of the anime so I award this a 7/10.

Nyaruko-san W OVA review special!Story (6.45/10):  For plot, the story of the OVA is really nothing special.  More or less it's your average hot springs OVA where the characters go to a hot springs and the only thing that makes it different than other OVA of the same category is with the show's unique charm and comical gags.  Safe to say, this OVA more or less fulfilled what it wanted to achieve.The OVA like its parent story do what it planned on doing from the get go,...become a very entertaining time killer.  Safe to say, the OVA fully completed said goal and overall became a nice recap of the style of the series by making everything (literally everything) as comical as it possibly can, which for this OVA, worked towards its benefit.Overview:+  Original flair to the show kept-   Rather bland base plot ideaCharacters (7.01/10):  If you've seen either one of this show's two seasons, than you should at least be somewhat familiar with its characters.  (To some extent I hope.)Practically everyone from the original series shows up again.  Our main protagonist Mahiro, the show's mascot and my personal favorite of the show, Nyaruko, Kuko, Hastua, and a host of other side characters that more or less pop in and out of importance.What I think the OVA did well was keeping the original personalities of these characters correct, thus making them as memorable as they were before, and therefore as enjoyable as they were before.  Though, mind you, these characters have no deep drama or character development within them, so more or less they're one-sided people that just have outrageous and quite hilarious character to them.Overview:+  Original character personalities kept+  Character gags persisted+  Memorable people-   Rather one-sided overall-   Less than extraordinary supporting cast.Art and Sound (7.57/10 and 6.46/10):  For art the series has kept its original flair with its artstyle.  All of the characters look just as good as they did when they were first introduced, and there was really no jarring animation at all to look at.There was still the quite comical side to the show with overly exaggerated whatever and chibis, which was still quite well done I feel.  Note though, there is fanservice in this OVA as it's a hot springs episode; but, if you've seen the series before, fanservice should not come as a surprise at all due to the fact that many times in the series, Nyaruko well, pulls things out of her lady parts because, reasons.  (Plus she tries to seduce Mahiro, I don't know.)In terms of music, the show retains its original tracks from the second season of the show.  In my opnion, the music sounds rather cheerful and as pointless and exaggerated as the series it plays for, but it's not memorable.  While the beginning part is actually scarringly catchy, everything else is sort of meh.Overview:+  Pretty well detailed art-   Somewhat forgettable music.  (I can't get that beginning part out of my head!)Personal Enjoyment (7.35/10): Haiyore! Nyaruko-san has always been a rather favorable series of mine.  It has this wacky atmosphere that it doesn't even need to try in because everything about it feels so natural.  Even in a generic feeling OVA, the absurdity of the series still came true and persisted throughout the 23 minutes I watched this.The show's personal flair existed throughout the whole thing, and it was nice to get a good laugh out of a series that meant to be extremely pointless.  All in all, this OVA managed to recapture the flair of the original series and was quite enjoyable to watch.  The series is not a masterpiece mind you, but it's a good time killer if you really wish to watch one.Overall Score: (6.98/10) become a very entertaining time killer.

Giniro no Kami no Agito,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1140/Giniro_no_Kami_no_Agito,"[""Like some bastard child of Akira and Princess Mononoke, Origin is one of the strangest movies I've seen in a while...STORY - Origin's (I'm going with the English title because it's easier) central theme is the age old man versus nature. What I found particularly interesting though, is the semi-lack of advanced technology and the steampunk-like environment of the movie's present day, even if the conflict was initially caused by the usual advanced bio-experimentation we're all used to. Further intriguing is the fact that the audience is not automatically expected to side with nature in this movie (as is usually the case); because the people...of the post-apocalyptic world are essentially dependent on the mercy of the quasi-intelligent forest, it seems almost as if nature is oppressing humanity. The main idea might still be that humans and nature should strive to co-exist peacefully, but Origin certainly breaks out of mold for this one.It's also worth noting that technology gives way to something like fantasy in this movie, thus straying out of genre lines. The powers that are granted to Agito are fantastical, and yet remniscent of those given to Tetsuo in Akira (that's so strange), except that they came from a &quot;natural&quot; source -- it's just that nature's been mutated by technology. Makes for a strange roundabout, but interesting, yes?CHARACTER - Admittedly, I wasn't too ataken with any of the characters in Origin, but I'm more inclined to attribute that to my tendancy to be critical of characters in general rather than the idea that the characters were bad, because they really weren't. They just weren't phenomenal. Agito was an good character with steady development throughout the movie that allowed him to mature into a hero. He had questions, doubts, and uncertainties, but the dedication and ambition to overcome them all. My only real quip is the general goodness of his character and the spotlessness of his morality -- it's just way too easy to make characters like that. Toola was a more interesting character because of that; since she was from the past where technology reigned supreme, she had to struggle with deciding whether she wanted to preserve the status quo or return to what she was familiar with. Conflict is good.It was also refreshing to see that there wasn't just one character who happened to survive the major disaster. When Toola was first discovered, alone in suspended animation, I was groaning. Japan seems to really like putting girls in boxes, just waiting to be discovered. It was great then, to see that Shunack had been discovered in a similar manner. Of course, the fact that both of these survivors happened to have been important in the past (or at least, had a relation to someone important in the past) is conviniently coincidental, but some realistic sacrifices always have to be made for the sake of story, hm?ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Origin was a really visually pleasing movie filled with superbly detailed backgrounds and smooth animated sequences. I was especially impressed with how the forest and forest creatures were handled -- details in how water was rendered and how things moved was just awesome. The machinery and pieces of technology also looked great, contrasting well with the more modest environment. Once again, I find that the beauty of the artwork and animation of a movie is one of its strongest points.MUSIC - Nothing amazing, but still good. You know, the average goodness.VOICE ACTING - I saw this movie dubbed (because the person I saw it with didn't feel like reading subtitles at the time). It was pretty good, as seems to have been the case for most movie dubs in the last few years. Toola's voice was a bit annoying, but many young, female characters seem to be that way, whether in Japanese or English.OVERALL - I enjoyed Origin. It surprised me in many ways, which is always a refreshing thing. The story explored a popular theme in an interesting new way, and though the characters could have been a bit more dynamic, they played their parts well enough. And the animation is just gorgeous. If you're a fan of the technology/humanity versus nature stuff, I would definitely check this out. of the post-apocalyptic world are essentially dependent on the mercy of the quasi-intelligent forest, it seems almost as if nature is oppressing humanity.

It surprised me in many ways, which is always a refreshing thing. The story explored a popular theme in an interesting new way, and though the characters could have been a bit more dynamic, they played their parts well enough. And the animation is just gorgeous. If you're a fan of the technology/humanity versus nature stuff, I would definitely check this out."", ""Having heard great things about Origin from various sources, I jumped at the chance to purchase the DVD cheaply on Amazon.  When it arrived, I was excited, the blurb on the case leading me to remember the hype when it was first released; 'dreamily beautiful,' 'breath-taking,' 'almost painfully beautiful,' one couldn't blame me for expecting a lot from the film, and I couldn't help but expect a lot, with Neo's feature on the film in mind which compared the film to Ghost in the Shell: Innocence!  Now, I'm not an enviromentalist by any means, so I do admit I was skeptical when I...read a lot about the film being heavily involved in such themes, but what the Hell, I thought, a great film will always be great even if I don't agree with its agenda; the Battleship Potemkin was voted the greatest film of all time and it was a propaganda piece for the USSR!The problem with Origin, however, is that it is NOT a good film.  Ignoring my own frustration at the plot's subservience to nature over man (I'll leave this out of the review, but honestly, place a human figure in place of 'the forest' and you have a tyrannical regime that limits resources to retain obedience), the story is disjointed and poorly paced.  Rather than the characters developing at all, they are mere mannequins forced into various situations, insanely scaled to advance the plot with no little hint of deus ex machina.  Relationships blossom without so much as a word or meaningful conversation between characters, and the viewer is left wondering why, and did they miss something?  In trying to pretend its artistic and intellectual value, Origin has missed out on coherence, instead feeling like a rushed project cobbled together from a collapsed series (indeed the story might be better served within such a setting).This might all be partly forgiven had the film measured up on another count, but the visuals in Origin were nowhwere near as spectactular as I had been lead to believe.  The CGI, which in films such as Innoncence fitted perfectly with the subject matter, clashed horribly with the organic design, and the characters were poorly designed, with expressions and shadow seemingly omitted.  Most offensively, smoke stacks (of which there were undue amounts in the film) were represented as completely static for the most part, even in lingering shots.  This I might expect from a series, but in a feature?The only element which Origin managed to pin down was the music, which worked well in the admittedly brilliant opening sequence (one feels the critics watched this part of the film and nothing else when writing their reviews).  Overall, however, I'm just glad I bought the film cheaply, because if this is the best modern anime has to offer, I'm not convinced.  A coherent plot, less static art and adult character design are demanded, especially if a film is expected to live up to comparisons with Miyazaki and Oshii. read a lot about the film being heavily involved in such themes, but what the Hell, I thought, a great film will always be great even if I don't agree with its agenda; the Battleship Potemkin was voted the greatest film of all time and it was a propaganda piece for the USSR!The problem with Origin, however, is that it is NOT a good film.

And the truth is, it\'s not just obviously inspired by Miyazaki\'s [early] works—it feels more like the creators were moved by Laputa, Nausicaa, and Princess Mononoke so much they tried their best to outright rehash their story and some of the characters here. Which, admittedly, was a decision that both made the movie as good as it was, and ironically, hurt it the most.The similarities are in fact so intense it would be easy to confuse with the aforementioned movies. We have here a remarkably comprehensive reproduction of...Miyazaki-specific clichés, from the brave and selfless protagonist down to a confrontation between natural and industrial civilization (with the usual ""we should embrace the nature"" undercurrent). Now this doesn\'t make this movie bad or uninteresting per se, but you have to consider the glaring lack of originality and, perhaps more importantly, proper explanation for many events that didn\'t quite made sense—up to the point where it leads me to believe the screenplay writer was so obsessed with some aspects of the story they decided to postpone explaining the rest until it was too late to explain anything. It\'s mildly fun to watch, but not anything we haven\'t seen before—more precisely, it contains just about zero original ideas, and its only saving grace in this respect is choosing good enough ideas to borrow.To move on to the better aspects of the movie, let\'s say the animation is brilliant—and it really is. I would love to see a little more detail in character design, but the rest was very good: lush landscapes, fluidly animated machinery, and everything in general being a treat for the eye (make sure to watch it in HD!). To put it shortly, everything visual was superb—no complaints here.Sound work was alright, but nothing to write home about. It matched the visuals convincingly and did well to represent them, but wasn\'t otherwise memorable.Character development is by far the weakest point of the movie, being next to nonexistent, and the characters themselves are utterly bland and uninspired, as is par for the course in movies like this. After all, many Ghibli characters are easily interchangeable as well (and I\'m not talking about their face design here). For that exact reason, and in order not avoid spoilers, I will abstain from any further comments on that part. Let\'s just say I was completely disconnected with the characters, so there weren\'t really any moments that touched me or evoked strong feelings towards them.At the same time I would lie if I said it wasn\'t an enjoyable watch, either. As a whole, I regard this movie, give-or-take, as worthy of your time if you want to see something reminiscent of the classic Ghibli output... On the other hand, you\'d probably be better off watching the actual Ghibli movies instead. Yeah, go do that.

Put them in a blender with choice elements of ""Titan A.E"". and ""Ferngully: The last rainforest"" pulse a couple of times, strain and call it a film. That is pretty much about what Gin-iro no kami no Agito or Origin Spirits of the Past is.I have heard that every so often an anime company will try their hand at making a story that is reflective of the works of Studio Ghibli. This is I’m sorry to say is apparently Gonzo’s attempt as well as...Gonzo’s first attempt at making a theatrical film.It’s hard to find the words for how to describe this film and how I feel about it. I had wanted to like this film and do like it…sort of. Unfortunately this film is also a great disappointment which most people who have seen this anime can attest. Yet while it’s easy to say that I like something or I don’t like something and then praise it or bash it accordingly, I’m going to go out on a limb and also offer some justifiable defense for this film. To be perfectly honest this film isn’t one of my favorites, but it is far from the worst anime I’ve seen. Disagree with me if you wish, but please hear me out.While visiting the official Funimation website for this anime, I came across a quote from Scifi.com that says “Origin is almost painfully beautiful.” This statement is rather astute on two counts. In the good points of this anime I have found the animation and scenery to be beautifully done all though blindingly garish at moments. The CGI is on par with Gonzo’s standard fair which you may take or leave as you will, and the music by Kokia is astounding. However as beautiful as the music and animation is, the plot is unfortunately quite painful.Overall the pacing of the story is rushed, the plot is so thin and convoluted that it can give you a headache to even attempt to make any sense of the story.  It’s also extremely difficult to even care about any of the characters. I can sort of sympathize with Toola somewhat, because even I would find it hard fathom what it would be like to wake up and suddenly find everyone and everything you knew was gone. However most of the time I wished someone would just run up an smack her one whenever she went into one of her “I want the world to be normal again” moments. So while it is clear this film wanted to be good; and it even tries to be good, the overall story results in an epic fail that no one really cares to watch.I’m not all together sure that Gonzo had honestly intended to make this into a Studio Ghibli-esc film. It certainly does attempt to contain and promote the messages of environmentalism that is shown in some of Miyazaki’s more prominent works. But it also lacks the depth and drive that made people fall in love with Miyazaki’s classic stories begin with. It feels more that Gonzo was trying too hard into making this into a Studio Ghibli-like film rather then letting it be its own story.Also the 94 minute length may have been a strike against this anime as a whole. Gonzo did honestly have something with this story and they certainly could have done alot more with it. The plot of the story feels as though it could have worked better as a 12-13 episode series at least. The movie itself comes across as though it expected the viewers to have some understanding of the back story and over-all personality of the characters and the world they currently live in. This leaves the viewer feeling as though they were thrust into a middle of the story with no idea as to what is actually going on. If it had been a series rather then a film, perhaps there could have been more time to explain some of the excluded back-story and concepts that were never explored.

This story was indeed interesting with the plant-apocalypse, robots and superhuman hybrids. Wait what!? Really!? And a volcano weapon!? It's like Saturday cartoons all over again but this time there's a twist! It's prettier.Art: The art is beautiful almost comparable to a Miyazaki film. The cg/anime hybrid was worked in well. Unfortunately the art begins to degrade as the movie goes on. In the beginning, they do a great job immersing the viewer in a fantastic new...world but towards the end you almost always see lots of desert, metal walls, or tons and tons of green blurs (forest).Sound: The music for the movie is great. But like the art, it becomes more bland towards the end. The sounds used for gunfires, explosions and buckets are very well placed.Character: I've seen plenty of anime movies but this one is completely ridiculous. The character development here is close to non-existent. Halfway through the movie I was confused as to what drove the main character Agito to do what he did. Outside of the 2 main characters and the antagonist - the rest you don't even care for.Enjoyment: At first it was great. I was drawn in. As the movie went on however, I became more and more confused, frustrated and bored as to what was going on.Overall: It has great art and music, both of which are amazing at first but become poor at the end. The story and characters... don't even get me started. Oh, might as well. The story and characters sucked. Period.

Why now write one for this anime??? Well to keep it simple it was how disgusted I was at this anime.First off I am going to go over the things I liked about it.Once Origins starts It gives you the appeal of an anime that was well done and had a lot of work put into it. The art has stunning visuals and is mainly the reason I continued to watch through out the story. It captures you into their world right from the start....Unfortunately I noticed that as the movie went on the art degraded getting closer and closer to the end. Being the strong point of the movie I was very disappointed by this since the art started as a 10 and slowly drifted to a 7.Another thing that was quite strong was the sound effects through out the movie. It was not the best I have heard but it was very good.Now on to what disgusted me.First off their are two reasons anime's are appealing to an audience. One the story is intriguing and two you get attached to the characters. Origins does present a great concept of a story but just doesn't deliver by making it confusing and tiresome through out it. There were many things left unanswered and some information was said and pretty much just forgotten or hard to understand.The Character development was a huge disappointment. It starts off at the beginning in trying to develop the characters and pretty much stops. None of he characters were developed in the way that you really care about them. Not even the forest was developed which seemed it needed it for the point was to save the forest even though they made it look like the forest was evil.The dialog in the story was also repetitive and annoying at points with Agito calling Tula's name frequently.All this put aside due to the art and sound I am giving a 4 but if those were just as bad as the story then surely this would be my first 1 on my list.

Similar in some respects to &ldquo;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&rdquo;,  &ldquo;Gin'iro no Kami no Agito&rdquo; tells another story of a vengeful forest that has slowly taken over Earth.The storyline was really good and characters were likeable. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, I felt that each piece aptly portrayed the scenes for which it was played. The Opening and Ending themes were both really good. The story was entertaining and at the same time, fulfilling. The idea of having some villagers becoming one with...the forest and gaining &lsquo;superpowers&rsquo; was creative, especially the cost they eventually paid for doing so. Although this wasn&rsquo;t a Hayao Miyazaki work, it had that feel to it&hellip;..the feel of a good movie I suppose.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes Hayao Miyazaki works (even though it wasn&rsquo;t one of his movie), especially &ldquo;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&rdquo;, as well as to those who just enjoy good anime movies. the forest and gaining &lsquo;superpowers&rsquo; was creative, especially the cost they eventually paid for doing so.

It obeys no one, but needs to be obeyed,it isn\'t the same nature we knew,it is chaotic,destructive and belligerent. However, even in these harsh conditions, man learned to adapt, trying to co-exist even with this hostile nature. After a harsh struggle,man finally reached an agreement with the forest. They may reconstruct a town to live over the ruins,in exchange of a few of them being possessed by...the forest, sharing the mind of forest,turning with time into a tree themselves, reuniting with the nature.Amid this pre-existed rules, comes a strange girl,named Tula, whom the towns people never saw before. She was released from her dormant sleep,where she was put into a cryogenic capsule,by a young man,named Agito. Finding out about it,the guardians of the forest,release a humungous amount of water in order to drown the suspicious girl who come from the past,but to no avail,the girl being saved again by Agito.Tula tells him about how the world became like this,how her father\'s team whom conducted an experiment on plantes,tried to find other purposes in nature.However,a mistake in the conduct let to the nature to go beserk,transforming the world into a jungle in ruins.Tula has to take now the responsabilty of turning the world the way it was,trying a dangerous method.She leaves Agito\'s side,who thinks that the way the current world is can be improved,by humans co-existing with the nature...And so the ""real action"" starts...Yes,I know what you\'ll say, the nature taking over the world, definitely Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.

Is this movie trying to frighten us,showing how a failed genetic experiment destroyed the earth,quite possible. Is this movie an original,innovative idea?God no.It is more of a showing of the various ideas of animes such as Princess Mononoke to the current, young, gullible audience, but in a flawed, all thumbs and  awkward manner It would have been acceptable in anime format,where imperfections are somewhat more hidden  by the lenght,but as a one hour and a half film,the plot holes and flaws are inacceptable. The beginning starts slow,and the ending seems to be too rushed, leaving a foul taste in my mouth.Story:5The art wasn\'t skyrocket good, but it wasn\'t too bad, either. For a 2006 movie,the animation was decent,even if in that year anime movies such as Toki o Kakeru Shōjo and Paprika had such innovative,imaginative ground-breaking story as well as art,raising the bar much higher.Some of the scenes such as the hand of Agito turning into a monster, was copy pasted from the scene of Princess Mononoke, when Ashitaka\'s hand was being infested by the boar-god,another minus for lack of originality.However, I will give props to the openning scene, where a dragon covered in grass swallows the earth, symbolyzing the destruction of the world by the failed genetic experiment. I have to admit that the scene  gave me goosebums, but I also blame that scene for giving me false expectations.That scene\'s epicness can also be atrributed to the bewildering music, which I will review next.Art: 7As soon as I hear:""Shizukesa no naka  hitotsubu ochita da ke"" (In the calmness  only one drip has fallen), shivers came over my spine, the music leaving me me in awe,speechless.This breathtaking music is entitled ""Chouwa oto ~with reflection~""  performed by the very talented KOKIA,now making its way through my top favorite soundtrack in a anime. KOKIA\'s varied rage and playfullness is really enchanting. The lyrics,the way it is performed, the anguish, the torment, the passion which transmits to us viewers is awe inspiring.It indeed sends you into a calm state,as the lyrics suggest, transforming your consciousness into a clear drop of water who falls into the core of the universe. However, the other songs pale in comparison,not being as powerful as the first one.Sound: 9The main characters even if created quite clumsily, are quite likeable, especially Agito. His  perseverance in defending the precarious equilimbrum between the forest and the humans, his innocent, earnest yet courageous pesonality makes this character quite charming for me. Not many youngsters his age choose to sacrifice themselves for the well-being of others,that takes bravery. Tula,however fades in comparison,even if she isn\'t detestable,the creator tried too hard making her likeable. In my philosophy, if the creator of the character doesn\'t take risks and only plays safe, by creating a avearge character,they end up hurting their own character.The other characters are far from being memorable, Shunack guy seems suspicious form the beginning, making the audience already guess what will happen.Another interesting but undeveloped character is Agito\'s dad, who seems like a fascinating human being, I would have preferred they would give him more screen time, instead of annoying characters such as Minka,who don\'t really have a purpose, maybe other then being a nuisance. The character of Agito raised the bar.Characters: 5My enjoyment wasn\'t all that great since I spotted so many similarities with other well established movies, as I mentioned above, in contrast, this movie seems like a creation of a fourth grader trying to recreate ""Starry Night"" by Vincent van Gogh. The only thing I really enjoyed was the soundtrack and thedevelopment of Agito.Enjoyment : 6Overall: 6 the forest, sharing the mind of forest,turning with time into a tree themselves, reuniting with the nature.Amid this pre-existed rules, comes a strange girl,named Tula, whom the towns people never saw before.

Tula,however fades in comparison,even if she isn\'t detestable,the creator tried too hard making her likeable. In my philosophy, if the creator of the character doesn\'t take risks and only plays safe, by creating a avearge character,they end up hurting their own character.The other characters are far from being memorable, Shunack guy seems suspicious form the beginning, making the audience already guess what will happen.Another interesting but undeveloped character is Agito\'s dad, who seems like a fascinating human being, I would have preferred they would give him more screen time, instead of annoying characters such as Minka,who don\'t really have a purpose, maybe other then being a nuisance. The character of Agito raised the bar.Characters: 5My enjoyment wasn\'t all that great since I spotted so many similarities with other well established movies, as I mentioned above, in contrast, this movie seems like a creation of a fourth grader trying to recreate ""Starry Night"" by Vincent van Gogh. The only thing I really enjoyed was the soundtrack and thedevelopment of Agito.Enjoyment : 6Overall: 6', 'So much promise...Story - 9Although the story is something that has been told, and retold countless times and in various different ways, Origin: Spirits of the Past took a unique approach set in a distant future with memories of yet another future we haven\'t seen yet.Art - 10Perhaps the most compelling feature of the film, it was definitely what made me want to watch it. The world in this movie is simply gorgeous and the characters designs are great as well. The highlights would definitely be the forest scenes that mesmerizing and beautiful.Sound - 9The movie actually opens up with an amazing song that...only promises more stupendous music to follow suit. Luckily, it doesn\'t let down. The score for this film is great and perhaps the second best part of the movie. I would not mind buying the soundtrack and listen to it independently for enjoyment at practically any moment.Character - 5There should have been so much depth... so much emotion. Yet we are met with very mediocre characters as cliche and watered-downed as possible. You never really get the sense that you knew anyone in this movie. This is where your imagination really has to kick to retell the tale to better suit what it was meant to be.Enjoyment - 7Amazing art, splendid music, and an intriguing plot. Please hold just a bit longer for an explanation......So what happened?Overall - 7Stellar art an music paired with a great storyline. Why did it have to ultimately flop? I know many people have compared it to a Miyazaki movie or even more specifically to Princess Mononoke. The animation and scenery was perhaps more beautiful than any Miyazaki movie, but what it lacked the most was its emotion. It was a great story, very poorly presented. It\'s demise clearly centers around the characters. Although I would prefer not to compare, to help explain what I mean, I will compare it to Miyazaki\'s Laputa: Castle in the Sky. The premise of how the two main characters met are very similar: a young boy deep underground, and a sleeping girl with a ""magical"" necklace. What sets them apart, however, is that the characters in Laputa are allowed to grow and spend a lot more time together. Their relationship and their affection for each other is believable and charming. In Origin, the two characters have one significant scene where they seem to be pushed to be together. Not long after, they are separated and hardly ever even speak to or mention each other for quite a while, yet we are left to believe that there was a special connection between the two that was never presented in a good way. Sure Agito has an outburst where it seems he confesses he likes Toola, but that is as far as it goes. Particularly with Toola, there are very, very little hints that she actually cares or likes Agito at least a bit.This also isn\'t an issue of the length of the movie. Though I wouldn\'t disagree with a suggestion of a longer movie to play up the characters, there were many unnecessary scenes that were elongated, and some very short ones that needed to be expanded on for the sake of the story. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is a scene where a character goes through a transformation and becomes a stronger being and we are left to believe that the transformation was really something brilliant within no more than 3 or so minutes.As I mentioned before, I really wanted to like this movie. The beginning was very interesting, but it remained dull and lifeless throughout most of the film, forcing it to lose it\'s charm.I guess in one word, the best way to describe the loss of the movie would be lifeless.The characters seemed interesting, but were never played-up or presented as relatable beings. The setting for the story was brilliant, but it ran across far too many under-worked scenes and dialogue sequence that made it come across as cliche.This is not a bad movie or story. It is simply very un-enthusiastically or monotonously told. only promises more stupendous music to follow suit. Luckily, it doesn\'t let down.

The beginning really sucks you right in with it's very dramatic destroying of the earth. The main character Agito, gets cool powers and saves everybody, been done right? Well this movie did it in a way I wasn't expecting. How many other movies have sent their character to the forest of all places to give him his powers? The ending of the movie leaves you with that epic feel.Art: 10The art was truly outstanding. Everything was full of life and the military weapons had extreme detail and looked almost CG....Every nature scene or even running through some place always had it's own beauty.Sound: 10The music was absolutely stunning. Of course I'm mainly talking about the ones by Kokia but even the orchestra pieces fit in very well with the scenes they were in. Now back to Kokia; her two songs always left me with that tingling down my back. What her voice added to the movie made it more epic than anything.Character: 10Agito and Toola. They go through some serious character development. We first find Toola in a freezing tube. Once she's out, there are a couple scenes explaining where she came from in more detail. At the end it's still giving details about her past. Agito goes through the most development I think though. We already know where he came from so it's not a big deal that they left out his past a bit. Even so, he gets powers from a forest, grows up a bit, and does some other awesome stuff like running down a freakin' volcano. Yeah.As for the rest of the cast, they all held equally important roles. Like the other &quot;enhanced&quot;, supporting Agito throughout the movie.Enjoyment: 10There wasn't a moment during this movie where I didn't fully enjoy it. Every scene had something to look at no matter if it was the characters or some small detail in the corner.Overall: 10Overall I'd have to say that this has been one of the BEST movies I've EVER watched in my entire life. It can only be described as epic. The music is insanely good. It just proves that Japan has better singers than the rest of the world. I recommend Origin - Spirits of the Past to everyone even if you don't like anime.

Agito is an adventurous/curious boy right from the start, and it's easy to accept him as the hero of this tale. This isn't your typical action/adventure anime. It pretty much is a circle of life themed story with fun and well developed characters.The usual post apocalyptic theme for a lot of anime is the heart of this story. Unlike nuclear destruction or demonic plague, it was onset by rampant genetically modified plant life. It's very easy to follow how the destruction occurred, and...the future world of mankind has a certain kind of magical charm. The scenery is spectacular, and the characters are colorful and fun to watch. This is accompanied by wonderful music that fits well in the story.Where I feel it lacks is the length. I wanted to see a bit more time spent on the imminent threat. Thankfully the characters were developed very well during the short amount of time taken, and it really is a fun story to watch. This is a general audiences type of story, and it has minimal violence.I would highly recommend this to others. This is a must see. the future world of mankind has a certain kind of magical charm.

Things won’t go as Shunack wants and Agito will receive the power from the forest to try and stop the destruction and save Toola from his hands...Characters: There are very few important characters in this movie, as it only runs for 90m, due to the nature of the story, there’s no need for extensive character development and I already talked about the main characters and their importance; therefore I will skip this part...Animation: This is absolutely the best part in the anime.As soon as the anime starts, prepare for the jaw breaking sequence of the moon destruction.The movie runs on a multitude of superb backgrounds, from the city founded in the canyons over the ruins of the past, the neighbor living forest and the desert.The background in the city is mostly colored in a grayish mixed with orange rusty color making it look like a post apocalyptic city, during the race trough the ruins every little detail looks great, every artificial made object like pipes and constructions is drawn in 3D CG animation that blends perfectly with the backgrounds and characters, also the animation flow is so fast and rich that makes it look amazing.As we approach the forest the green covers de rusty orange, as we get inside the forest, everything is huge; the use of colors here is great and the trees look almost real, the leaves are specially animated with great detail and is as close to real as possible, the forest is alive and has a mind, this shows during some attacks, the leaves suddenly start to agglomerate forming a huge mass at an incredible speed creating in the end a green dragon, here the animation is full 3D showing a stunning scene gorgeously animated.The desert is similar to the city using grey colors and everything looks good.The character design is simpler than all other animation, still, everyone looks great, and when there is action, the animation never fails to surprise.To finish this part we will take a look ate the mecha design and particle system.The Ragna Army, is a military faction trying to fight the forest amazing power, therefore they haveadvanced in military technology. The army is composed of a dual train, basically its two trains attacked together running  parallel to each other, its design is rather simple but still fully 3D animated, the train provides for a great scene when one of the compositions is destroyed, creating an amazing explosion. The train serves solely for transport, the army\'s strength is in the mechas, there are 2 different types of mechas the first one is a huge red machine that walks on 4 legs and has a huge canon on its bottom, its aspect is similar to a bug, great details are given while they move and fire. The other type is smaller, about one 10th maybe smaller; it’s colored blue and looks more like a scorpion with the canon coming from the rear. The mechs are in 3D, all nicely detailed and animated.The fire explosions look great, a great particle system was using as we see the detailed sparkles from the explosion and the smoke also is full 3D, its color ranges from black to light grey...The clouds seem to use the same system used in the smoke, maybe a little more advanced, whenapproaching the city they look huge mass approaching, from close or under it, looks lime they where filming a real storm, except for lightning, its only a pacific rain, imagine a sunny day, there’s a huge mass of clouds approaching bringing a long waited rain, watch has it falls in the skies and the bright land bathed in the sun is covered with shadow and the blue sky covered in grey, that’s how it looks...The best way to describe the animation is to watch by yourself, as it is hard to transpose its sublimity into words.Music: The opening song is quite good, ""Chouwa oto ~with reflection~"" by KOKIA, the song focus on her voice while a gentle piano string plays in the background, the video sequence for the opis the destruction that took place 300 years ago.Overall, the music does a great work during he movie, always complementing the animation the best way and being in 5.1 all of the audio effects sound awesome during the breath taking scenes.The Ed song ""Ai no Melody"" by KOKIA has a pop stile, it has KOKIA singing more melodic and the music is more complete, instead of a piano solo features more instruments making for a livelier song to appreciate while in background some scenes of after the storm are showed...Overall: Gin-iro no kami no Agito is a 90m movie, so don’t expect a great story or a lot of character\'s development, instead turn of the light\'s, raise the volume and sit back while enjoying this light story on a rich world, where the animation is astounding and the music naturally enchants your years.In the end you will fell satisfied with this great work. is the son of one of the ""Neutral city"" creators and one day while trying to steal some wateraccidentally ended in some sort of civilization ruins where he finds Toola on a timeless slumberinside of a chamber accidentally waking her up.Toola is the daughter of the scientist from 300 years ago who was running experiments on the moon; he also created a system to fight the forest but for some reason didn’t use it.Now Shunack another Human from the past, an assistant to Toola\'s father, joined the Ragna Army whose purpose is to fight the forest, he seeks Toola has only her can find and activate the technology capable of restoring the planet to how it was before.

I didn\'t really like Giniro no Kami no Agito though, although i\'m not entirely sure why. It just felt quite dry and bland with not much character development.STORY- The plot doesn\'t sound too bad, actually. Maybe it was due to the plot execution?ART - It was okay. Above average, I guess.SOUND - Let me first say that the only reason I watched this was because I really liked the ending song ""KOKIA-Ai no...Melody"". Ehh... but other than that, the OST is so-so. Nothing memorable, but not bad either. I do like the vocal OST before the ED though.CARACTER - Maybe because it was due to the lack of character development, but I didn\'t feel anything for the characters (If any, a little irritation for the girl, but that\'s besides the point.) They just felt hard to relate to.ENJOYMENT- It could be due to the fact that I was watching it at 3am in the morning, or maybe it\'s just not my type of show, but I almost fell asleep in the middle part. I found it a little slow.OVERALL- Not a show that I found outstanding, but it\'s not all that bad.

When I discovered it when I was little it complitelly blew me away because how beautiful and misterious the story was. It sparked love for anime inside me and opened up my world view and I saw for the first time the beauty of anime... It of course has flaws and I'm little bit bias because it's extremly nostalgic for me, but I'm trying my best to give a honest opinion. Let's dig in.Origin: Spirit of the Past - is a really, really beautiful and...immersive expirience, but it depends on how you look at it...When you look at it with a really analizing look it isn't as good... The story feels rushed and characters seem simple at times...BUT, here's the catch... When I was little I loved it so much because the mistery and beauty it offered, not because I analized every bit, you have to take it for what it is and flow with it, turn your brain off and just enjoy it! And after the watch you could even imagine what could have happened if this or that character made different decisions and so on... What makes it also beautiful is the blank spots that you can fill in with you own mind!Love the characters! Simple but beautiful! Love Toola and Agito and hia father! Antagonist's designe is nice! 8/10Plot is like modern Nausicaä but believe me they differ a lot, so it's not a copy! Very interesting, misteryous and beautiful! 8/10Soundtrack was little off sometimes, for example at some fight scenes, but OMG the opening is soooooo good! 7/10Animation BESTOPENING ANIMATION I HAVE EVER SEEN! Gives off the 2000's modern anime vibe, really sweet and nostalgic! One of the most beautiful anime I have seen! 9/10Thank you Origin, for blessing me with a really beautiful childhood memory!

The story is about how plants basically destroyed civilization and there's a conflict between man/machine and nature. The movie focuses on Agito who finds a girl named Tula who says that she's from the past. The problem with Tula is that the story makes it sound like she's a bad person (at first anyway) because she decides to go with Shunack, whose suppose to be this movie's main villain, to bring Earth back to it's original form (You know, our world). Also none of the supporting characters don't really help Agito in...bringing back Tula. They just sit in the village and wait for the moment of truth. If I was the one making this film, I would at least have Cain and Minka help out Agito a little bit. If you want to see a great movie, this is probably not the one you wanna pick. bringing back Tula.

If you want to see a great movie, this is probably not the one you wanna pick."", 'When I first watched this film I was mesmerized with just how beautiful the soundtrack and environments were. There are some stunning visuals in this movie and each music score is made for specific scenes, unlike a lot of anime which just repeats the same music for scenes with the same emotion (sad scenes, fight scenes etc.).This film does actually have some great characters with potential, but it\'s just sad that the creators of the film didn\'t develop them enough. The film focuses mostly on Toola and Agito while other characters either only have small moments when they are focused on or they are...not focused on at all.I thought that Agito was a likable character to start with, but when he became enhanced he seemed to lose his adorable personality. I found his moments with Cain to be humorous and I wish that I had seen more of them together, but sadly after Agito became enhanced the film just focused on him and his strength.Toola was probably the character with the most development in this movie which isn\'t a surprise since she is the one the film centres around. We see her flashback scene where she remembers the accident in the past and we see her change from how she was at the beginning to how she becomes at the end, and she is the only character to actually have stages of development, whereas Agito literally just touches the Forest\'s hand and is suddenly a new person.I felt bad for all of the other characters since they didn\'t get much focus compared to Agito and Toola. Hajan was only in a few scenes for a very small amount of time, but since he was one of the enhanced humans who carved out Neutral City I felt as if he needed more attention. The same goes for Agashi and Yolda, though Yolda did have more screentime due to being the town\'s representative. I\'ve already stated how Cain seemed to vanish once Agito became enhanced so I don\'t need to repeat what I previously said. Then there is Colonel Jessica who didn\'t even have her name mentioned once. She was practically silent until the train fight scene. Again, I feel as though she should have had more focus since she was probably the strongest woman in the film and had quite an important role, especially towards the end (where she got a little more attention).What also irritates me is the amount of unanswered questions this film has created. Who are the Druids? To me it sounds as if they are supposed to me humans who have given into the Forest completely, but this is never said directly. What was the book Toola was reading? It may have been hard to notice, but when Toola was using her raban to locate E.S.T.O.C. she glanced down at an open book which Shunack looked at and then closed. What is with the 6 rabans on Shunack\'s wrist? He states that his own raban was lost during a fight with Neutral City, so what\'s with the ones he has? He can\'t use them because Toola already states that ""the raban only responds to the person it belongs to"", so why did he have them? How did he get them? And also, how did he call Toola if the rabans only work with their original owners? This might just be a plot hole, but it is worth noticing. Unless, of course, that phone call was from someone else from the past...The film has many more unanswered questions which should really be answered, others including how Toola survived hibernation while everyone else was dead and what caused Shunack to leave Neutral City (Yolda blames herself and the Forest for driving him away).Don\'t get me wrong, this film is still outstanding in it\'s own way. I think it just requires an imaginative mind to enjoy it completely as it is a great film for coming up with theories. The idea of water being a currency works perfectly as the world could very well end up that way, though in the film the accident is caused by a mistake in a project which was meant to bring good to the world.Overall I do recommend that people should watch this movie as I think that it is quite underrated. Personally I would want to see it remade into an anime series since I\'ve seen many characters and scenes which were cut from the movie, not to mention that an anime series could answer all of those unanswered questions and fit in everything that the creators tried to shove into the film. Maybe an anime series would show more flashbacks from the past instead of just having characters talk about the past.If you haven\'t watched the film, do watch it.

The opening sequence was for me a masterpiece of storytelling. However, after the initial introduction to the world and its characters, the movie went downhill exceedingly fast. While the quality of animation kept up with the beginning, it lacked cohesiveness, and seemed to push for an ever grander scale of wonder that pushed the integrity of the artistic value way over the line.As for characters, there are none, only empty voids giving shape to an ever increasingly erratic plot. There is no reason for writing to...be this bad in a movie that had so much effort put in to the world design. It feels like they made specific plot points on a timeline but didn’t know how to connect them. Except for the beginning every character seems dissociated and hollow, the forced link that allows the plot to move. Everything about the characters development with each other feels unnatural. The characters themselves never change, and the time in which the changes in relationships occur are poorly presented.The plot of this movie starts strong but becomes cringey. There are certain points where I question whether in the process of making the movie they realized just how forced and choppy it seemed so they attempted to compensate by making the series of events more and more extravagant.All and all this movie does not live up to its hype and fails miserably in all but the initial world building and art. be this bad in a movie that had so much effort put in to the world design.

A friend of mine also heard good things, so she and her husband brought it for a watch. In retrospect, I think I might have enjoyed our running commentary more than the movie itself. And, welp, when you realize that you\'re MST 3000ing something to the point that you aren\'t really paying much attention to the film itself, it\'s never a good sign. So let\'s break down exactly why this movie is more fun to mock than to absorb.************WARNING!! SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT...ON***************(I\'m going to try to limit the spoilers as much as possible, but to assess certain aspects of the film, I will say some things that some people would consider spoilers)~Story~This has got to be the single most disappointing aspect of the film. The setup for the plot is actually really interesting: Mankind has somehow messed with plants so that they become intelligent, destroy the moon, and take over the Earth. That\'s intriguing by itself, but the fact that this takeover is enacted by plant dragons -- yep, fire-spewing vine dragons -- is really cool. I admit, I paused and thought, \'Wait, how can a dragon made of leaves spew fire and not burn itself to death?\' But really, with how cool these dragons look, that\'s inconsequential. Unfortunately, while they start with these dragons, the movie quickly forgets about them. They pop up here and there, but aren\'t really in any way central to the plot or the forest itself, it seems.So, anyway, then we move on to Agito, our hero, and his town. We learn a bit about the town, but not a whole heck of a lot. As someone else has pointed out, we do know that the forest is basically blackmailing the town\'s citizens into obedience. And that\'s major problem one of the story: Obviously, by the end of the film, we\'re supposed to share Agito\'s ideal that living with the forest is wonderful and far preferable to destroying it. But why? The forest people are complete jerkfaces. They actually tell the town early on that if they don\'t abide by their contract, they\'ll take all the water away. Excuse me? Isn\'t that a dictatorship? If the humans had something to hold over the plants, too, like they had some means to really hurt the plants if they broke the contract, then okay, that\'s co-existence. But from what I saw, Agito\'s town had nothing to use as a ace in the hole. If the humans screw up, the Zruids (forest people...things), rudely beat their sticks and go ""Grrr! No water for you!"" Which, yeah, that\'s another thing that bugged me. The Zruids just keep beating their sticks on the ground, like, ""We\'re tough! ROAR!"" Personally, if I tried talking to some dudes, and they kept beating their sticks to interrupt me, I\'d grab one and start beating them with it. Seriously. Stick beating does not equal intimidating, it equals annoying.As for other major problems... let me just say that there are so many abandoned and undeveloped plot threads that they\'d be lucky to sew together one glove... or a handkerchief... a small one. The main antagonist mentions that he used to share the thinking of Agito\'s town, but he changed his mind. Why? All we get is, ""I\'m from the past."" Okay. Sure. But seriously. How long did he live in the town before changing his opinion. What specifically was the impetus for doing so? Why does the forest enhance him if he\'s just going to turn around and try to destroy it? On that note: Why the crap does everyone act like getting enhanced is so terrible when they ultimately conclude that becoming one with the forest is wonderful? Uh, what? It\'s great to join with the forest, but OH NO! It\'s soooo horrible if you get enhanced, which leads you to becoming one with the forest. I had no idea that the people of the future would all be so bipolar. Bottom line here is that while we get interesting background info alluded to concerning the main antagonist, we don\'t actually get to see any of it. Oh, and why in the world does he have so many Rabans and where\'d he get them? I thought the reveal for that one would be a juicy point of contention, but sadly, that detail is sidestepped entirely.There are many, many other problems concerning the story, but the main point here is that nothing is really explored. There\'s no depth to any of it. This is obviously a film for which the creators had these great ""intelligent themes"" that they wanted to explore... and then they actually forgot to do so. The film is an idea, a rough-sketch, one of those that you think up with friends while stuffing your face with snacks over a board game where you say, ""Hey, Fred! Wouldn\'t it be cool if blah and blah and blah happened?"" ""Yeah, man, that\'d be wicked!"" But it is not an actual ""story."" Or, to give you a better analogy, imagine that an adult tries to explain some highbrow philosophy to a ten-year-old, and then that ten-year-old writes a story based off of that explanation. That\'s what you get with this movie.~Art~I thought the art was rather nice. It flows well, and I think the CG actually complement the style nicely, which is something that is often not true. I did not, however, care one bit for the clothing. The outfits were ugly and seemed not to have any real thought behind them. How do the weird over-sleeves help the people of Agito\'s town? What function do they serve? You\'d think people working outside farming all day would wear sleeveless shirts, not heavy over sleeve...things.And why were they so against giving Tula pants? You\'d think the decent thing to do once you find someone and bring them home would be to give them some pants, for crying out loud! But even when she gets ""clothing,"" if you look closely, she\'s just wearing a shirt/dress thing over the hospital gown she was found in. Is a good pair of pants really so much to ask for? I really have to wonder if that didn\'t somehow factor in to her decision to leave Agito\'s town. After all, in Ragna, she at least got some pants.~Sound~A lot of people have pointed out how great the music was, and I guess it was nice, but honestly, aside from the opening sequence, I didn\'t notice any of it at all. So, that\'s why I\'m not giving it higher than a 7. If it doesn\'t stand out to me, I can\'t say it\'s fantastic. I will give props to that opening, though. To be honest, that was probably the best part of the entire movie.~Character~There were characters? WOAH! In all seriousness, the characters in this film have as much personality as a cardboard cutout. There\'s no real life in any of them... except maybe the antagonist and the old town\'s lady (forgive me, as I can\'t recall either of their names at present). Though they weren\'t really developed, you got the sense that they were real characters with opinions, backgrounds, and ideals. They existed outside of what we saw, and that\'s really what makes a good character to me. If I really feel like a character exists outside the story, rather than that they only exist within the events that I""m seeing, then that\'s a good character. The movie Inception (which I just saw and HIGHLY RECOMMEND) didn\'t really develop many of its characters, yet, because they were given such attention in regards to each one\'s personal quirks and attitudes, I ended up liking this somewhat minor character named Arthur the best. I wanted to know more about him and loved watching him, even if he didn\'t have a ton of screen time. That\'s what Origins tried to do but failed miserably at.And what the crap was up with the creepy forest girls? They were just sorta thrown in. Like, ""A BOOGA BOOGA! We\'re the scary forest spokeswomen! WAHAHAHA!"" I\'m starting to suspect LSD might have figured heavily in to this production.~Overall~Eh, while this movie isn\'t horrible, though my review seems very much to signify that it is, it had so many unexplored ideas and details that it was very unsatisfying. If I had to describe it in a word, I\'d say shallow. It was very, very shallow. Something pushed out at the last possible minute to meet a deadline. Should you avoid it at all costs? No, not at all. Is it worth watching, eeeehhhh, I\'d say if you have free time to kill, and a good group of high-humored friends in a mocking mood, then yes, go for it! But really, there are many better movies to spend an afternoon watching.

If you're unfamiliar with those titles, this movie might surprise you.Gin'iro is a rehash of two popular anime elements: man vs. nature and boy finds mysterious girl. The plot follows predictably as well: the girl holds some secret that the military wants to use, albeit with malintent. Despite that, the movie is done quite well. Given its archetypal story, this film is most likely designed to retell the story for the newer generation, since the movies listed above are quite old by now.Pleasingly, the animation and soundwork is done extremely well. The...unfortunate point of Gin'iro is its lack of stand-out characters. The cast is mostly stock and forgettable, and they carry the fault of acting rashly for the sake of plot progression even though their actions would normally conflict with true human nature.

The Forest reigns supreme, water is scarce, and humanity, the bulk of its once great technology lost to time, has been dethroned from its once powerful rule over all the Earth. Scattered survivors have become divided between those who respect the new normal and those who would see the world back to the way it once was. When Agito, a young boy of the former camp, inadvertently awakens a girl from the past named Toola, he sets in motion a chain of events that will ultimately decide the fate of all.REVIEWMost people have never...heard of this anime movie, since it wasn't a very big hit in anime. Origin didn't have a very interesting story but, i like the way how they moved the story through out the anime. at first the the story is confusing but,at the end yu will understand. The art work is so good here, especially the forest. Sometimes you just forget about the story to just look at the art.there wasn't many characters which was great. I don't like 50 characters in a movie, it is too crowded. This anime was simple and every every character played a good role. The music was just, plain great. The beginning song starts the anime out great. It makes you feel like there was more to this anime, then the story.I really like the and enjoyed this movie. I was little uncomfortable when i bought the DVD, now after watching it i am satisfied. this movie ispired me to watch more anime movies.I highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes anime.

I've been interested by its title but didn't know much more about it than what animenewsnetwork said about it.It was hmmmm.The animation was good quality, nice colours, well designed characters. I liked thier outfits, especially Toola's one towards the end. Neutral City amazed me, I'd love to see a model of that! So yeah visually it was very well done, not the best animation I've seen, but still good.The story was nice and fairly well told. Sparrowhawk commented that it was a cross between Princess Mononoke and The Matrix. It definitely had the industry...vs nature element in there. I did however feel it wasn't told as well as either of those two though. I think the main thing that has turned me off of it is the dub. I don't normally watch things dubbed (except Hellsing and any Ghibli), and though I was disappointed at the start I thought it was going to be ok. In my opinion the quality of the dialog deteriorated as it went on. By the end I was physically cringing at the cheesiness of it, which spoilt it a bit for me. The sub might be better and I am more than willing to re-watch it to see.The other thing that made me wince a bit was a bit of the disregard for science. I don't normally have that problem with anime, but this one, well I guess it hadn't pulled me in enough to make me overlook it. It bugged me a bit, that combined with the dialog served to stop me from becoming too hooked as it went on.One of the things I did really like about this was the music, especially the song playing when it went all 'other worldly'. The fight scenes didn't strike me as 'kick-arse' but they did make me wince for the right reasons which means they were realistic enough to effect me.Overall? I wouldn't steer people away from this, but I would recommend a fair few other animes before I recommended this one. If you have the opportunity to watch it do.

This movie has some really excellent environment art and use of colors. The world itself feels familiar while looking just a bit alien. This fits the story, of course, and the opening sequences of Agito waking Toola up from sleep are very well done. There is CG in there, but it is mostly well blended (though the characters themselves stand out, in a not so great way). In fact, it still stands up well today and thats something to at least be a bit proud of when it comes to CG...in general, much less something that was made about 15 years ago.The opening song and general tone setting at the beginning is very, very well done. I would easily recommend the first 20-30 minutes of this movie to anyone. We get a glimpse into the past, some pretty devastating events, and it serves as a nice vehicle to carry us into the current world setting. This setting is definitely another strength. We have a murderous forest, a human part of civilization that is about at the stage of industrial revolution (think smoke stacks and trains coupled with a war machine), and a town that tries to play something of a middle-ground between the two.If there are any “good guys” here, it is the Middle-Ground Town. The name of which I have already forgotten since they basically disappeared from the story halfway through. They made substantial sacrifices to build what they had, and this was evident from both characters like Agashi (Agitos dad) as well as exposition.Sounds like the perfect setup for some very nuanced interactions between characters and worldviews, right? The movie actually took great care to coax a depth out of Middle-Ground Town while complementing it with great backgrounds and animation.Well, about that.. it pretty much drops all of that halfway through the movie. It is my working hypothesis that Gonzo realized half way through production that they were, in fact, making a movie and not a series.POTENTIAL SPOILERS:The actually somewhat interesting Middle-Ground Town is replaced by the Super Ultra Good Forest. ..A forest which is presumably still murderous and ruling with an iron fist long after the story ends, but never mind that.. And, the Super Ultra Bad Technology Cult! ..Who, while misguided and somewhat running amok themselves, want to return to a world without homicidal forests inhabited by maniacal tree spirits and blood-thirsty leaf dragons. But they are icky, so never mind that..From there, it devolves into about as basic of a good vs bad series of events as you can get. The general art and animation takes a turn for the worse as well, and any previous character development or world building is essentially chucked into the walking doomsday volcano which serves as the center piece for the climax.Oh, and they explain some stuff in said volcano and then the forest starts having babies that sprout from seeds. D’awwww!Im still going to give it a slightly above average score because the first part of the movie is genuinely promising. Which makes what happens in the second half all the more frustrating. Do note, I attempted to write this review so that it can roughly approximate the experience of watching the movie! A strong, rich buildup and then a second half which can be summarized in a few disappointing sentences.I cant wait for the sequel, when the Forest decides to wipe out the rest of humanity and all life on the planet with pod people, moonleaf dragons, and psychopathic sylphs. Where all the characters realize the ""bad guys"" were right all along. I assume this would precede the third movie of the trilogy, where the Forest ..branches out.. into the solar system and space. Where it then encounters its nemesis: Big space caterpillars and space bugs. I legitimately would look forward to that.Writers note (But wait, theres more!): O Great Forest, I am simply a whimsical creature and would never criticize you. I deliver plentiful uwu in your direction with the same tenacity and fervor Agito yells at Toola. Please dont take away my water or life. Or turn my body into foliage.

', 'This is an example on how to have an amazing idea for creating a piece of art and then executing it in an extremely poor manner. Minor spoilers will appear at the end of this review.Let\'s start with what is good: the backgrounds. They are incredibly detailed, providing the viewer with so much eye-candy that you might as well press pause whenever there\'s a scene with a forest and spend a good few minutes admiring the work that was put into them.Second good thing, the music. Although I expected a bit more after an amazing opening song that was immediately saved for my music playlist,...it is still good nonetheless, serving both as a mood setter for scenes and a pleasant experience alone. I\'d say music and background artworks are the best features of the film.And here it goes downhill.

Its decent, probably only because scenarios about the relation between humans and nature always have something that catches my attention. BUT - the ending feels rushed.

This might be more of a personal opinion (everything is, in the end), but I really didn\'t like the way the characters were drawn here, in comparison with everything that was surrounding them, it seemed off more the longer I was watching (particularly the shading part).

It was infuriating.Overall, this film is just another mediocre way to kill some time, not even good enough to recommend to anyone or provoke to think about the consequences of our actions on the environment.Special mention: The way some characters were ""enhanced"" by the forest was really cringey, it wasn\'t explained or justified in any way. it is still good nonetheless, serving both as a mood setter for scenes and a pleasant experience alone.

Around that time I really enjoyed the movie. Then around December of 2016 I decided to rewatch the movie in the same english dub form that I did when I watched it all those years ago. I can safely say that I was too easily ammused.Now the positive sides I have for the movie include the world it creates, the animation, and the music.It\'s the rest of the movie i have problems with, the story I believe is a bit mediocre, and most of it is...a missed opportunity with the world that the writers had created.

However there are pedantic errors that I felt frustrated while watching it.The voice acting was terrible to say the least. No offense to the sound supervisor I think they really did an amazing job at the sound effects. But the voice acting is so out of place that it makes me think that they have no idea of their roles. Like who sounds so soft when...falling off a ledge?The voice acting was a major turn-off but there's more. The logic is debatable. How does a walking volcano not spill the lava from underneath ?Lastly, the story could have gone better. Why let the audience know what's going on or you can just ignore the lore? The lore is something that makes the audience interested in the world the characters exist in and therefore should be explored further. But the movie simply brushed it aside and only leaving speculations for us.Overall, this movie has a huge potential only to be wasted by poor execution and probably shallow character development. falling off a ledge?The voice acting was a major turn-off but there's more.

To an extent, I think it mostly wants to be a dystopian science-fiction alternative to the historical fantasy of 'Princess Mononoke', and that's not a bad idea in the slightest. And it puts the pieces in motion well. Introduces enough characters to build a story around, a compelling enough mystery box of a female lead, some good world-building. But at a certain point it sort of loses track of everything, and by the end I found myself a little confused as to what it was trying to do, be,...or say.Because I do think the 'Princess Mononoke' comparison is apt, I think it's tonally similar, and aesthetically similar to a degree, and I think that the film thinks it's thematically similar, but it's just... it's not sure what those themes are.

"Hetalia Axis Powers Movie: Paint it, White",https://myanimelist.net/anime/7337/Hetalia_Axis_Powers_Movie__Paint_it_White,"['Axis Powers Hetalia (or Hetalia: Axis Powers, if you prefer) has much to be proud of for itself. Starting off as a webcomic in 2006, it has since spawned a manga, a Drama CD series, an anime series, and now a theatrical film.The movie makes several departures from the main series, most notably having a storyline as opposed to simple sketches, although a few appear in the beginning to ease the viewers into the movie. This new approach brings a few interesting twists to the Hetalia mold, but unfortunately, the movie tries too hard to stay true to its roots, giving very little new...experiences to fans in regards to characters and humor.Aside from knowing that Hetalia is about making cultural stereotypes of several countries into characters representing their respective homes, some of the basic quirks of each ""nation-tan,"" and the fact that it\'s a comedy, there\'s not much need for prior knowledge to understand this movie. Being a fan might make you appreciate it more, however.Story (no spoilers): (5)The Hetalia movie stylistically deviates from its sketch-comedy roots in the anime for a plot-driven story, and this decision brings a few ups and downs. For one, seeing the characters outside of sketches and finally into a full fledged adventure can be quite a thrill for long time fans. Now, here\'s where the issues start, and there\'s (unfortunately) a few of them.The plot of ""Ginmaku Hetalia Axis Powers: Paint it, White"" is a fairly typical alien invasion story, complete with faceless invaders, UFOs, and extraterrestials speaking perfect Japanese. Trying to balance plot and humor, the movie never gives the viewers a sense that the characters are ever in any real danger, and the resolution to the entire movie was rather anti-climactic with very little catharsis in the end.Humor in the movie also took a hit. The focus on plot means that the edutainment aspect of Hetalia loses out to situational comedy, relying on the established character gags to make funny reactions when the time comes. The unfortunate part is that the movie never makes an effort to be funny without the established character gags. Virtually no jokes or gags in the movie haven\'t been done already in the anime (Canada\'s invisibility, China\'s numerous Chinatowns, so on and so forth), even though the setup in the movie is completely different.  More on this in the characters section right up ahead.Characters: (5)What made the Hetalia series so successful has undoubtedly been its large, quirky cast of characters. Embodiments of cultural stereotypes made for hilarious interactions, especially in the skits. Staying true to the stereotypes, the movie doesn\'t spend much time developing each character, and that becomes a problem. The characters, completely driven by established quirks, become ridiculously predictable. While this isn\'t a problem in sketch comedy, watching the same character gags over and over for a full hour becomes a chore. Be prepared to watch the entire movie with England and France constantly beating each other up, even in the most crucial moments, America laughing for 60 straight minutes, Japan struggling to (and failing) to ever raise his voice, Italy running away from everything, Germany yelling at everyone, and so on.The movie focuses almost entirely on the main players of World War II (Russia, China, America, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan) with very little appearances from anyone else aside from small cameos, which was a little disappointing. Iceland is the only new character introduced to the anime here, though he eventually made an appearance in Hetalia: World Series anime as well, so he\'s probably already well known to anime audiences in the West.Art and Animation: (8)Okay, since the last two sections have been a bit critical, let\'s look at some of the more positive aspects of the movie, shall we? The art-style remains virtually unchanged from the anime series aside from new costumes for the main characters, which means that for the most part, it\'s pretty good. The animation takes a step up for for the movie incarnation, though it\'s not particularly noticeable outside of the more fast paced scenes.Sound: (7)The voice-acting cast is the same as from the anime, and they still do an excellent job of portraying the personality of each character to a tee. The music takes on a more theatrical, epic sound for the movie as opposed to the usual happy-go-lucky pieces that are used in the anime (though they\'re still there in the light-hearted parts, don\'t worry). Whilst the music isn\'t very memorable, they do a good job of setting the mood, which is the most important part anyhow. With that said, the theme songs ""WA! Wa!! World Ondo"" by the 8 main seiyuus and ""Mein Gott"" are songs that will stick in your head for a while.Enjoyment: (6)Even with the promise of a plot, the Hetalia movie doesn’t do much to distinct itself from the series it spawned from, and gets repetitive quickly. While this may come as a disappointment for those who sought to see some completely new Hetalia materials, as I did, fans that are a-okay with a little more of the same of what they love will probably find the movie enjoyable.

Even if your Hetalia-crazed best friend is sitting beside you and giving you a running commentary on what is going on. #experienceThat aside, this was actually a decent movie - but again, if you've never seen Hetalia before, you won't get a lot of the inside jokes (e.g. best friend is laughing out loud at random pieces of dialogue that you didn't really notice). If you're a fan of Hetalia, then you shouldn't miss out on this. "", ""Hetalia is an interesting success story. It began as a webmanga by Himaruya Hidekaz. Due to its popularity, it was adapted into a manga and published by Gentosha. This was quickly followed up by an anime version by Studio Deen and the series is still going strong. It's on it's fourth anime series, had a PSP game, a movie and a ton of merchandise. I may do a proper review of one or more of the series eventually, we'll see. That being said, I do have reservations about the film. The anime themselves are made up of short episodes that are made up of a...series of short sketches, which may or may not be connected to each other, based on historical and political subjects. With a five minute runtime per episode, that kind of thing can work. However, this film is slightly over an hour and a quarter long. How could it possibly maintain the aesthetic of the series? And even if they do manage, is it really a good idea to do so for that long or does it overstay its welcome? Let's look at Hetalia: Paint it White and find out.Story:A group of aliens invades Earth with the intent of turning all of humanity into faceless, bland looking beings like themselves. Our main group of countries, America, England, China, Russia, France, Japan, Deutschland and Italy meet to discuss the situation while Canada is in the room going unnoticed because that's pretty much Canada's schtick in the series. The group immediately starts arguing and goes their separate ways to try to fight the aliens off on their own, or surrender to them in the case of Italy. Shenanigans quickly ensue.The major problem with the film is that the main plot is really stupid. Which could work for the franchise, but it's also largely devoid of funny moments. There are a few but it's mostly just uninteresting and dull. They also clearly didn't have enough ideas for what to do with it since it's padded with a large amount of short gags. It wouldn't be so bad, except that all the short gags they pad it out with are ones taken directly from the anime proper. They seriously were so devoid of ideas that they couldn't even come up with original jokes for the film. They had to take jokes wholesale from the series. That's pretty inexcusable even if the padding gags are the funniest part of the film.Characters:They include all the standard Hetalia characters and give most of the side characters small cameo appearances, at least. The trouble is that they don't really take advantage of them. They have a really zany cast in the main series and yet most of them ultimately do very little and a lot of the character gags they do have are just recycled running gags that you could get by watching the main series.Art:The artwork does look like the series and it looks pretty good. My only real issue is with the aliens and their technology. They look really bland and their flying saucers look equally boring, inside and out. I guess that's supposed to provide tension since these dull beings want to replace all of these zany and visually interesting characters with boring carbon copies of themselves, but therein lies the problem. We know that it's not going to happen because it's a comedy and not anything resembling serious. Even if the comedy does fall short. Studio Deen could have at least given us something visually interesting to look at under the circumstances.Sound:If you've seen Hetalia then you know what to expect from the actors. The performances veer into over-exaggeration quite a bit but they're all solidly done and they do suit the characters. The music is pretty good as well with the same style that you'd expect if you'd seen the series.Ho-yay:Italy and Deutschland get quite a bit of homo-eroticism. To the point where one of the other countries comments on it. There's also a little bit between England and France, playing up to their love/hate relationship.Final Thoughts:As someone who generally likes Hetalia, this film is a major disappointment. Most of the jokes that work are directly taken from the main series and used for padding. Trying to have a longer story could have worked, but not with the execution they have here. They simply don't take advantage of the comedic potential of the situation or of the individual characters. What you ultimately get is a stupid, lazy film that doesn't even seem to be trying. My final rating for it is a 3/10. If you're interested in Hetalia, I would recommend watching one of the main series and just skipping the movie since all the really funny bits are in the series proper anyway.

It means I will never have to review anything else Hetalia related ever again!Plot:Wait a minute...does this mean APH actually has a plot?! For the movie adaptation of Hetalia, yes it does! Do they finally do what the series was allegedly created for and finish telling the story of WW2 with our anthropomorphic Yaoi countries? Hell NO! Instead we get a plot about aliens invading Earth. So Hetalia went from being all about WW2 to being about space aliens? (Insert joke about the History Channel here)! The aliens wish...to end conflict on Earth by erasing all the world\'s unique cultures and making every nation completely bland and homogeneous. Yes, the Hetalia movie is a long rant against the forces of globalization and the erosion of traditional cultural heritage. (slow clap). It may have been a REALLY obvious allegory that would make even Frank Herbert facepalm, but at least the Hetalia writers tried harder than usual this time. That is to say the Japanese writers tried harder. The American script was written entirely by Funimation voice acting legend Chuck Huber, who just makes gay joke after gay joke. Honestly, at least Chuck appreciates who the fanbase is and WHY the show is actually popular. Chuck gave the fangirls exactly what they wanted, so I can\'t really blame him.Art:The art and animation for the official movie was honestly WAY better than the series. The use of CG was surprisingly well done and we even get a fight scene that looked decent! I\'m serious, it looked better and was better choreographed than some of the later episode fights in Bleach!Entertainment:""Italy...WHY DID YOU BRING A CAT WITH YOU!!!"" Literally about 95% of Hetalia\'s entertainment is derived from Patrick Seitz\'s absolutely incessant yelling and over the top German accent. I\'m not quite sure why Americans seem to believe that Germans just yell at the top of their lungs all the time. Probably because of that one short, Austrian guy that died 70 years ago. The closest the movie gets to honestly being funny was when the various countries tried to impress the aliens with their own native cultures. America takes them to Vegas, China cooks for them, Russia forces them to watch ballet against their wills, and England nearly causes the annihilation of mankind by trying to give them a sample of his horrible cooking. That was almost funny!Overall: 3/10Was it a surprise to anyone that this movie wasn\'t very good?! The art is an impressive upgrade, the voice acting is fine, and the bare bones of a decent allegory and cultural commentary on globalization are...almost there at times. The latter being sort of like a rejected episode of South Park that was never quite finished. However, the humor is pretty awful and the movie quickly gets tedious and annoying. Honestly, if you want to watch a stupid comedy featuring ethnic stereotypes and  horrible German accents, I would recommend Beerfest.

Which one, I did not enjoy, second I was more interested in the movie that episodes I've seen.The story was okay, it didn't seem much there was much thought in it. "", ""I love Hetalia and just recently got into watching it. I sort of binge watched it and obviously finished the whole thing relatively fast since the episodes are so short. Then I found out that there was a movie and I thought, well... This is going to be interesting, since the episodes rarely have actual plots that lasts for longer than half a minute. I feared that the movie would be chaotic, pointless and that it would make no sense.I was right.The movie is funny, sort of, but the fact that it's main plot is interrupted by these small sketches from the episodes is just...SO confusing! I mean, the original show is confusing but you get used to it - that's just how it is; it's not supposed to have a storyline. So when they try and do a movie with an actual plot, but still with the odd 30 second sketches, it's just weird and... makes it incredibly boring to watch. Especially since all those little clips are from the show, which, I assume, most people who watch the movie have already watched, so I wonder, why put in so much old material that has nothing to do with the actual plot of the movie? When you make a movie from a popular franchise, you wanna create NEW material! I mean, why would you pay for a movie that is, what, 40% clips from the episodes?If they wanted to keep the 30 second sketch thing that the show is known for, I'd been totally fine with just half an hour of random history shit, I mean, kinda like putting together a bunch of the episodes. Totally fine. Or they could've focused on the events of one specific war. Why the made up alien stuff?I just found that having a plot, does not work for Hetalia. It was not really funny... At all. It was odd.After all this is said and done, I am a HUGE Hetalia fan, I think the show is hilarious and I'll keep watching it, but if someone asks me ''should I watch the movie'' my answer will be; ''Only if you've watched the whole show and feel like you wanna sit through 1 and a half hours of pointless stuff just for that extra bit of mediocre Hetalia. Then go for it.''(The dub is great though, as always. You could just watch the movie for Todd Habertalia and Jacque Michael Tatum. That's what I did after the 30 minute mark XP) ((I apologize for the name puns...)) SO confusing!

That's what I did after the 30 minute mark XP) ((I apologize for the name puns...))"", ""Hetalia Axis Powers: Paint it, White is a movie based upon the webcomic/manga/anime Hetalia Axis Powers.While the main series mostly takes place around the time period of World War II (with occasional episodes/scenes taking place before that and in the present), Paint it, White takes place during the present day.Overall, the plot of the movie is what would be expected from this series, silly and fun for laughs. The animation of the movie is relatively the same as the animation from the television series. Normally, this would be a bad thing, but seeing as the movie has random cuts to the series, it actually isn't.The...only bad things about the movie are the fact that about 20 minutes of it are footage from the series and the climax takes place upon the infamous island from the TV series as well.Overall, Hetalia Axis Powers: Paint it, White is a very funny movie and if you're a fan of Hetalia, then you should definitely watch it. only bad things about the movie are the fact that about 20 minutes of it are footage from the series and the climax takes place upon the infamous island from the TV series as well.Overall, Hetalia Axis Powers: Paint it, White is a very funny movie and if you're a fan of Hetalia, then you should definitely watch it."", 'Ok,So with this movie{Which i havent watched for a few months may i add,im a lil rusty}was one that i actually enjoyed.I liked how the story may not have been the most original one used but they made it into their own and made it enjoyable.The art style like always was unique,clever and pleasing to the eye.The sound is something i unfortunately cant remember to well but i think it was decent.The characters included were very good for me because i love them all in the end,apart from the few who are a bit off to me{ahem france ahem}.Overall i found it very enjoyable but...the story could have been amped up a little i guess? the story could have been amped up a little i guess?', ""OK let me start this off with saying I'am a big Hetalia fan. I think the movie was very good and the plot fitted the general atmosphere of the show with it being random and at points hilarious and providing great entertainment to any fan. A nice touch was that the creators made Tony ( the alien) make an appearance. The ending song of the movie was fantastically done and is one of my favorite Hetalia songs. The movie did a great deal to slightly expand on the characters and kept nicely to the canon. The art is in the style of Axis Powers and...World Series meaning its not as 'shiny' as Beautiful World and World Twinkle. A slight problem i had with the movie that the main story was cut at moments to make way for reused content from many of the episodes, but this also made way for more characters to make an appearance in the movie. Overall I really enjoyed watching the movie as it was a fun expansion to the Hetalia universe and a great way to just a laugh at the anime I like as the movie was not historically based.

I was expecting so much of it, and I have to admit I was a tad disappointed with what I got.By no means am I saying it was bad - it wasn't. As expected, it's super funny and wonderfully animated, so I've got nothing to complain about there. However, I feel like the plot could've been better.Now, not spoiling anything, I think it started pretty well, but the ending seemed kind of rushed. I didn't quite buy how easily such a big issue was resolved.I recommend this to...all Hetalia fans, of course, but I also suggest that you don't start watching with high expectations. I, who started watching it expecting a funny, kick-ass action movie, ended less happy with the movie than I'd be if I hadn't been expecting so much out of it. all Hetalia fans, of course, but I also suggest that you don't start watching with high expectations.

The movie never really explained why the aliens were there or have much story to them at all. The movie had nothing to do with the rest of the series and was honestly a let down. The art was mediocre and the characters weren't at there finest. The comedy was bland  (like any other Hetalia show).  The only thing this movie did right were the references. Okay, okay, the cat was good too. This movie is probably not what...you should watch if you are new to Hetalia, it will probably just discourage you. you should watch if you are new to Hetalia, it will probably just discourage you."", ""Movie? This counts as a movie?!?! Well, get the bleach, cause I'm gonna need it! This movie is an absolute disgrace to such an amazing anime, I could get more entertainment out of staring at a globe for 2 hours! All the characters I've come to know and love have been dumbed down and made annoying at an offensive level (like China, America...) and the characters I already despised with every part of me are...somehow even worse! (like England, Italy...) The plot made no coherent sense and the random clips didn't help, you're just taunting the veiwer with the fact that they could be watching...the anime, which is much better!  And the absolute worst thing about this is...France! Now, France, in the anime is an amazing character who just wants everyone to be loved and wants to be loved back, and if he can't get that, he's perfectly fine knowing others can be loved. In the movie, he is some vain assfuck who doesn't care about anything but himself and his image. And my favorite character, China, isn't much better but that would take too long to say why.

The film tackles historical elements of each country\'s past and ties it in with very tasteful satirical commentary of both the axis powers and allies as they unify and tackle the issue of racism and white supremacy at a global scale. Perhaps presenting us with a utopia that could never be, Hetalia: Paint it White is truly a call to arms. Through queer baiting and pasta-based humor, I believe this film has...successfully radicalised young audiences to aid the revolution against white supremacy.As you can see, it would be almost criminal to simply reduce this down to ""gay anime human poland balls fighting aliens"".
