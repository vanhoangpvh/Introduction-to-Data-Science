Of course, the best way of experiencing One Piece will always be, episode one, or chapter one. Not other viable “better” shortcuts to be honest, however, for the fans that like to a refresher on the series every once in a while, recaps like these are always welcomed, no, almost sought in desperation.As a recap, it is, well, meh, but the stories told are ways the finest. You would be expecting to see something new added as a thank you for watching topping, but the same content...you watch in the first 5 episodes of the series is what you get, only condensed in 24 minutes, with the same old animation, voice acting, and a touch of extra narrating from the original cast members. And don't take this as me bashing One Piece's animation, because even when it first started, it was a special kind of SPECIAL. you watch in the first 5 episodes of the series is what you get, only condensed in 24 minutes, with the same old animation, voice acting, and a touch of extra narrating from the original cast members.

Basically it is an episode of recapitulation that summarizes the first three arcs of  East Blue saga.Story: 8. The summary of the story of the arcs of Alvida, the rescue of Zoro and the crew of Buggy is told by Luffy, as Zoro and Nami comment as they met. Personally I found it simple but entertaining.Art: 10.

Negima!? Haru Special!?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1619/Negima_Haru_Special,"[""This spring special was good overall, it kept the essence of Mahou Sensei Negima! (the serie) and entertained the viewer.The storyline of this OVA is very weak, it's about Asuna getting mad at Negi and not wanting to forgive him. In order to cheer Negi up, Ayaka invites him to her secret island, and the whole class ends up tagging along. That's how they end up at the beach. The art in this episode is better than the one employed in the original serie, with more details and better shadings. The songs and sound effects are very well placed. The personality of every character is...refreshed somehow, they act according to how they were in the serie.Just like the serie, this OVA is fun to watch. It includes ecchi scenes, a bit more explicit than in the serie, and might make you laugh a little. It can be understood even without watching the serie, since the plot is very basic and well explained, but you won't enjoy it as much since it has many comical scenes directly related to the anime.If you already saw the anime, watch this special; it won't hurt! refreshed somehow, they act according to how they were in the serie.Just like the serie, this OVA is fun to watch.

There is practically no plot and very little drama.This seems to be just an excuse to show off the girls.  Well, they do a good job of that.  The production quality is high.  The characters are drawn a little differently than the original series and I'm still getting used to that but the art quality is very good.This is worth a couple of watches, but not much more unless you're a total freak. "", ""all this &quot;moive&quot; is fan serivice!it is not too bad but with a series like this, it should have done better!in it's defence, most of the voice actors are in it. which is a good thing.i am use to OVA's not having a lot to do with the anime series.this is a little weak thought.

Manie-Manie: Meikyuu Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1951/Manie-Manie__Meikyuu_Monogatari,"['Esta review también está en español.Well, well... what do we have here...Neo Tokyo is composed of three short films, each one directed by a giant of the anime industry. Since the works are so different from each other, I will comment them separately n_n.Labyrinth labyrinthos (also known as Manie-Manie), by Rintaro (he participated in such things like Jungle Taitei, Astro Boy, Petshop of Horrors, X/1999 and many other renowned works).This is the first short, and the most surreal of the three. LL introduces us to Sachi, a girl that, along her cat Cicerone, is sent to a giant maze, after crossing a clock/mirror/portal/whatever. Once in...this new world, our protagonist will face strange experiences, and the intensity of the unusual is going to rise to uncanny levels... Fortunately, Sachi\'s going to find a guide: a creepy (really creepy) clown. This enigmatic character will lead her to a safer (?) place...If after reading the previous paragraph you thought that this short was bizarre, just wait to see the characters. Just to say something, Sachi\'s pants are so high that they reach her armpits (in what is obviously a hidden tribute to Ed Grimley xD). All the inhabitants of the maze are weird, going from invisible beings to skeletons. The character design is almost cartoonish, being the cat the most detailed one. The rest look a bit too... ""curvy"" let\'s say. Anyway, the animation, although weird, is impeccable (this was done in 1987, but it doesn\'t look old at all).The voices met the expectations. There\'s not much of a dialogue to begin with, but they\'re good. The music is quite unique, featuring classical pieces such as Gymnopédies and Toreador Song by Georges Bizet! (the guy who made Carmen).Final comment: well, this thing is weird. Without going to the insane, surreal levels of things like Chocolate Panic Picture Show (though, of course, nothing can be that crazy xD), Labyrinth labyrinthos is a picturesque experience that vaguely remind me Alice in Wonderland. At least from my point of view, in this short you are not supposed to find a purpose, or an answer, but rather enjoy the ride. Each step Sachi and Cicerone take, there\'s a surprise waiting. Whether striking, bizarre or horrifying, we want to know what\'s next, and what\'s at the end of the maze. And as a final point, we could say that this short and the other two are slightly connected, despite being three separate works. You\'ll see why n_n.Running Man, by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (involved in things like Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars, Mirai Shounen Conan, Tetsuwan Birdy and many others).Luckily, RM is simpler to explain than LL. In a futuristic world, where races to death (kinda similar to the game Wipeout) are the favorite betting event, Zach ""Grim Reaper"" Hughes is the best competitor, undefeated for almost ten years, and once again is participating with the idea of destroying his rivals. Zach\'s secret: telekinetic powers, which he use to crush his competitors.Well, RM is nothing like the others shorts in Neo Tokyo. Here everything is more serious, the character design is more realistic, and deaths, explosion and agony are pretty common here. Visually, is the best thing in this movie/compilation.The sound, like in the case of LL, is good. There isn\'t much dialogue, or music, or anything, but that’s the way it\'s supposed to be.Final comment: Although this short may sound simple, there are several things to consider. Running Man is not presented in order: is a series of flashbacks interspersed with the present. This can be quite confusing, and it may be necessary to watch it more than once to fully understand what’s happening. Not that the story is complex (quite the opposite, the idea is pretty simple), is just that is set in a disorderly way.The Order to Stop Construction, by Katsuhiro Otomo (he did Akira. There\'s nothing else i should say).In a near future, revolution (or better say, LA REVOLUCIÓN!) hits the fictional South American country of Aloana. With the change of command, a japanese construction company received the order the cessation of activities in that country. Receiving no response from the foreman of the construction, the company sends Tsutomu Sugioka, a common employee, with the mission to find what happened to his predecessor, and inform the workers (all of them robots) of the current situation. Tsutomu tries to reason with 444-1, the robot that was left in charge of the work, asking him to dismantle all the structures and machines in the most efficient way, so a big sum of money can be saved, but everything this artificial being have in mind is finish the construction. At all cost.The Order is not as visually spectacular as Running Man, but it definitely is excellent. Featuring a great combination of nature and technology, the construction is huge and incredibly detailed. All the robots follow a similar graphic pattern, but all of them are different from each other, being the 444-1 the most detailed one, and the one that changes the most along the film. Tsutomu has buck teeth xD, but he\'s fine. He really looks the way he acts. He\'s a nerd, but he tries really hard to fulfill his mission.The sound... well in this work, there\'s talking. All the robot\'s voices sound the same way: robotized xD. Tsutomu is an angry little man, and his seiyuu give him an irritated and sometimes high-pitched voice, so good work there. And, like in LL, we have a classical piece here: Morning Mood, by Edvard Grieg (gentleman who also did In the Hall of the Mountain King).Final comment: I can\'t say that this is Neo Tokyo\'s best short, but it definitely is my favorite (aw, screw it, this is the best :D). Much more direct and easier to understand than the other two, the story of The Order is just great, full of intrigue and tension, and a few twists every now and then (and all that in less than 15 minutes!). Also, this is one of many works that leaves us a valuable lesson about over-reliance that we have with technology.Final comment (the global one): Neo Tokyo is a very interesting compilation. Each short has different things to offer, so there are high chances that not everyone likes them same way, but is that variety that makes NT a production suitable for a wide range of people (instead of being just recommendable for those who likes shonens, shojo, sci fi, horror, or any specific genre).I recommend this to... everyone reading this. For me, The Order makes all this worth it, but you, Mr. reader, you can find compelling any of the three short, it\'s on you.Anyways, thx for the reading, and please give a chance to Neo Tokyo.--------Bueno... que es lo que tenemos aquí...Neo Tokyo está compuesta por tres cortos, cada uno dirigido por un gigante de la industria.

LL nos muestra a Sachi, una niña que, junto a su gato Cicerone, se internan en un laberinto luego de atravesar un reloj/espejo/portal. Una vez en el nuevo mundo, nuestros protagonistas vivirán experiencias extrañas, y la intensidad de lo raro subirá a niveles impensados... por suerte, Sachi encuentra un guía: un payaso vestido de blanco que, francamente, es bastante macabro. Como sea, este enigmático personaje los conducirá a un lugar mas... ¿seguro?Si el planteo de este corto les parece bizarro, deberían ver a los personajes. Los pantalones de Sachi le llegan casi a las axilas, en lo que parece ser un homenaje a Ed Grimley. Todos los habitantes del laberinto son extraños, pasando desde seres invisibles a esqueletos. El diseño de personajes es bien caricaturesco, siendo el gato la excepción (se ve más detallado que el resto). Como sea, la animación, si bien rara, es impecable.Las voces cumplen. La verdad, no hay mucho dialogo, pero no tengo quejas. La música es bien peculiar, presentando piezas clásicas como Gymnopédies y Toreador Song, de Georges Bizet! (el tipo que hizo Carmen).Comentario final: Wow, esta cosa es rara. Sin llegar a los niveles de locura de cosas como Chocolate Panic Picture Show (aunque claro, nada llega a esos niveles de locura xD), Labyrinth labyrinthos es una experiencia pintoresca que me recuerda de forma vaga a Alicia en el país de las maravillas. Al menos desde mi punto de vista, en este corto no hay que buscar mucho sentido, o una respuesta, sino más bien disfrutar el viaje. Por que a cada paso que dan Sachi y Cicerone, hay una sorpresa esperando. Ya sea llamativa, bizarra o espeluznante, queremos saber qué es lo que sigue, y que es lo que hay al final del laberinto. Y como dato final, se podría decir que este corto y los otros dos están levemente conectados, a pesar de ser tres trabajos independientes. Ya verán porque n_n.Running Man, de Yoshiaki Kawajiri (sujeto involucrado en cosas como Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest Is the Sea of Stars, Mirai Shounen Conan, Tetsuwan Birdy, y otras muchas).Por suerte, RM es más simple de explicar que LL.

El secreto de Zach: poderes telequineticos, con los que destruye a la competencia.Bueno, RM no se parece en nada a sus compañeros de Neo-Tokyo. Acá todo es más serio, el diseño de personajes es bastante realista, y se ven muertes, explosiones y agonía bastante seguido. Visualmente, es lo mejor que hay en esta película.El sonido, al igual que con LL, cumple. No tengo nada destacable que decir al respecto.Comentario final: a pesar de que este cortó pueda parecer sencillo por lo que escribí, hay varios detalles a tener en cuenta. Running Man no está presentada de forma cronológica: es una sucesión de flashbacks que se intercalan con el presente. Esto puede ser bastante confuso, y probablemente sea necesario ver la película más de una vez para entender bien que es lo que pasa. No es que la historia sea compleja (todo lo contrario), simplemente está planteada de forma desordenada.The Order to Stop Construction, de Katsuhiro Otomo (el tipo hizo Akira. No hace falta embellecer más su curriculum)En un futuro no muy lejano, en el ficticio país Sudamericano de Aloana estallo un golpe de estado.

A toda costa.The Order no es tan espectacular visualmente como Running Man, pero decididamente es excelente. Presentando una muy buena combinación de naturaleza con tecnología, la obra es monumental, increíblemente grande y detallada. Los robots, aunque siguen un patrón similar, son muy distintos unos de otros, siendo el 444-1 el más detallado, y el que más varia a lo largo de la película. Tsutomu tiene dientes de conejo xD, pero por lo demás está bien.

Para mí, The Order hace que ver esto valga la pena, pero usted, señor lector, puede encontrar atrapante cualquiera de los tres cortos, está en usted.Gracias por leer, y por favor, denle a Neo Tokyo una oportunidad!

The following of those screenwriters/directors being Rintarō, who worked on anime films like Metropolis, X & Captain Harlock; Yoshiaki Kawajiri, known for creating titles such as Wicked City, Ninja Scroll (the movie, not the f***ing TV series) & Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust; and last but not least, Katsuhiro Ōtomo, who we all know for Akira, which is not only one of my favorite anime, but one of my favorite movies.The first segment is “Labyrinth labyrinthos” by Rintarō about a young girl named Sachi trapped in a game...of hide-and-seek with her cat Cicerone and her search leads her to a longcase clock that doubles as an entry to the labyrinth world. It also serves as the ‘top-level’ story or a framing device that leading to the following segments.The second segment shown is “The Running Man” by Yoshiaki Kawajiri that takes place in a futuristic world where people race to the death (although this have appeared in movies in numerous times) and one of the best is Zack “Grim Reaper” Hughes, remaining undefeated for 10 years but how does he keep winning for so long? He was telekinetic powers to vanquish his competition.The final segment is “The Order to Stop Construction” or “Construction Suspension Order” by Katsuhiro Ōtomo where a revolution in the fictional country of the Aloana Republic has resulted into having newer government installed but refuses to accept a contract and the company sent down salaryman Tsutomu Sugioka to stop production but as it turns out the work is fully automated and won’t stop to any cause.If I have to pick one of these shorts to be a favorite of mine, it would have to be “The Running Man”, mainly because I can notice some of Kawajiri’s traits of realistic designs of the characters, the deaths among with the element of agonizing pain and misery. While having the power to stop your opponent can make you one of the most notorious racers ever known, having that isn’t going to last forever. “The Order to Stop Construction” while having an excellent detail of the combination of nature & tech, which all the praise goes to Ōtomo but it’s not what I call the best. The only human character in here just seems like the pushover dork that should’ve known better than to accept something that could get him killed. “Labyrinth labyrinthos” is a very simple story of entering another world as a child and it is a visual marvel but it’s nothing glorious about it.The animation here is done by……well, damn, MADHOUSE  and this is a title made in 1987 and it does retain its vintage looks much like any anime made in the 1980s. It has aged very well throughout the years ahead of its existence. However, on the voices and I rarely go on about voice acting but the Streamline Pictures dub is really lackluster, but consider back then, awful English dubs did exist back then and it really shows how awful it is, it’s not 4Kids awful but Streamline Pictures don’t even try to make it sound good, especially on the dub of Akira (for future references, Yes, I rather prefer the Pioneer/Geneon dub to Akira rather than the Streamline dub. Excuse me while I get my shields and beating stick.) The music is composed of Western classical music: the first of Erik Satie\'s Gymnopédies and the ""Toreador Song"" of Georges Bizet\'s Carmen in ""Labyrinth"" and ""Morning Mood"" from Edvard Grieg\'s Peer Gynt score, in an ironic manner, in ""The Order"" in addition to original music by Mickie Yoshino.FINAL VERDICT: It’s a fairly well-done anime that has many visual and storytelling contributions from three different directors/screenwriters.

But is this really a new world she's exploring, or can this be a figment of her imagination?A reporter is sent by a magazine he writes for to do an article on a race car driver, but this isn't an ordinary race. This is a futuristic race called the Death Race, and drivers normally last between 1 to 2 years. Zack Hugh has been champion for years and has been surviving all competition in the process.The Aleona Republic has recently undergone a coup. There's a company whom has...been under contract with the previous government to run a construction site called 444. Due to the new rule the company is being forced to leave. After losing contact with the previous foreman, the company sends one of their workers named Sugioka Tsutomu with orders to shut down the project. However, the project is being ran by a pre-programed robot, whom will see the job done at any cost.-This is a rare gem from way back. Neo Tokyo which is most notably known as Manie Manie: The Labyrinth Tales, is a 1986 OVA containing three separate stories that were directed by three individuals whose names went on to become legendary in the anime world. Rintaro, his most notable work may be Metropolis. However, this is not one of my favorites at all. I instead prefer Doomed Megalopolis. Katsuhiro Otomo is most known for Akira. I prefer Memories way before that one. Finally, Yoshiaki Kawajiri is very well known for Ninja Scroll. Well, I consider Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust to be his best work by far. Each of the stories display their directorial talents and whether you love them or hate them; they would later go on to direct some of the most recognized and cherished titles in the anime world.Neo Tokyo is a splendid and most often overlooked work, which depends on its visuals to tell a story without the use of constant and linear dialogue. The first two stories utilize very little dialogue in its narrative. While the third story contains plenty of dialogue and utilizes its themes. Several anime fans I have spoken to on this series favors the last episode. Others plain don't like the series at all. Whatever.Story One: LabyrinthThis story is directed by Rintaro. This is a very imaginative and well crafted work. The narrative utilizes a dream type setting. It's telling a story with many images and supernatural occurrences; such as the myth behind alternate dimensions within mirrors.The unique character designs carries the personality of the dream type atmosphere. It's really something that must be seen. The music which is made up of playful piano pieces further establishes the mood, by switching between a playful child like rhythmn, and into a sped up cadence creating a more nightmarish style, which blends very well with the visuals and appears to match the speed of the piano keys. The combination of visuals and music is simply stunning. The animation has stood the test of time and doesn't feel dated in the slightest to me.Story Two: The Running ManThis is a glimpse of Kawajiri's future works. This short tale also proves that Kawajiri at one point could also deliver a real thought provoking story. Outside of the introduction that is narrated by the reporter. There is also very little dialogue to be found here.This story is also told with the character. From what I gathered, this was a story exploring the transition from obsession into madness. This second story is the most brutal of the three, with Kawajiri utilizing his now legendary trademark which are creative and imaginative death scenes. The visuals are also outstanding, very dark and even creepy, which blends very well with the self-destructing themes being portrayed.Story Three: Construction Cancellation OrderI found this story to be the least engaging of the three despite being the longest. The reason being, I was attached to the visual style of storytelling, therefore I was expecting more of the same. Still, it's another interesting story packed with style and substance. This is a story about man relying too heavily on technology, thus losing control of his tools. The story is somewhat predictable and the ending could have been a little better.Neo Tokyo is a great collection of stories, but they apparently do have a flaw holding them back. The stories feel a bit like ideas that could have been a whole lot more had they been given a longer run time. Each of the stories are around 14 to 16 minutes, with the third maybe being a little more than 20 or so. They seem like small pieces of a larger work, yet so much is accomplished in that short amount of time where as anime such as Blood: The Last Vampire accomplishes very little, to almost absolutely nothing in twice the time.Even though Neo Tokyo does feel held back. The OVA makes a strong case on why it should be among the better of its type. The stories are very well written. The animation & artwork is excellent, plus both langauges have their place. I highly recommend watching both languages which are well above average, plus watching the series twice for a better grasp of the stories. Neo Tokyo also happens to have a feel that resembles The Twilight Zone.This is an anime that has been sitting comfortably in my collection for years.

It features three different segments, each from a different director. It's no secret that my history with Madhouse is heavily mixed. On one hand, they're the studio behind rubbish like Bio Hunter and the X-men anime. So nice of them to royally mistreat one of my favourite super hero teams. But they've also been behind such excellent anime as Monster & Petshop of Horrors. So, any time I see the studio attached to something, I don't know whether to expect garbage, mediocrity or something amazing.Story:The segments aren't really connected. So, I'll...go through each one as its own thing.Our first segment involves a young girl and her cat entering a mirror world and encountering all manner of strange things. Including the one person who liked Hollywood's Jem film and English cuisine that isn't hideous.The second segment involves a futuristic race where competitors risk their lives. We get to see a particularly disastrous race. You might think health and safety proponents would never allow such a deadly race to exist, but as all the racers are Frank Miller fans, no one actually cares.The third segment is about a young man who gets sent to the jungle to shut down a building operation after the old foreman went silent. He finds the robots working on the project to be less than responsive has to figure out how to stop their activities. He could ask them to calculate pi to the last digit, but he doesn't want to completely destroy their circuits.The big problem that every segment shares is that they all value spectacle over substance. The first and second segments both have very little story. We get a parade of odd images in the first and a big, overblown sequence of crashes and cars getting torn apart in the second.The best segment is the third because it, at least, has something of a narrative. And even then it's a bit lacklustre. While I will credit the people involved with having a strong premise, there just isn't enough time to give it proper build up and its climax basically devolves into a big, over the top sequence.Characters:There isn't much character to speak of. Even in the last segment, what we get is very basic and simple. It's hints of personality without anything properly fleshed out. You could make the argument that these are sixteen minute segments and they can't really develop the characters, but Yami Shibai came closer to having fleshed out characters in under five minutes. Or, in the case of the final segment, it equalled the characterisation.Art:The artwork is quite nicely detailed and well animated. The biggest issue is that the second segment has a lot of bizarre shading and a lot of it looks a bit shit as a result. Like, we're talking a urine coloured filter over everything. Which isn't what you want from something that relies heavily on the spectacle. Give the first segment some credit, it may look like someone's illicit drug trip but at least it's interesting to look at.Sound:The acting is passable. There aren't any amazing performances that will stick with you, but there also aren't any bad ones. The music is fine.Ho-yay:Romantic dynamics are as lacking in this as strong interactions between characters in general.Areas of Improvement:Give us some characterisation. Honestly, each of these segments lasts about fifteen minutes. And each one would benefit from taking a bit of a break from the spectacle in order to flesh out their characters a bit.Some basic narrative for the first two segments. Like I said, the third segment is, hands down, the best because it puts some effort into a narrative.Good art for the second segment. Lose the over-shaded, piss filter look. It's pretty awful.Final Thoughts:If you're someone who likes to watch fifty minutes worth of spectacle without substance, you may enjoy Manie-Manie. For me, style over substance doesn't do a whole lot. The last segment certainly had potential but it needed more time to expand on it. That being said, I didn't think this was awful. Well, maybe the second segment was. It was mostly serviceable at what it's trying to do.

Though the author and directors are different I thought with three attempts I would at least have a chance of finding one of them particularly memorable, while admiring the variety of the movie as a whole. Sad to say, it wasn\'t that simple and Neo Tokyo paled in comparison to its spiritual successor.Neo Tokyo opens with Rintaro\'s (Shigeyuki Hayashi) Labyrinth Labyrinthos. As of writing, I haven\'t seen anything else he\'s directed so I don\'t know...what his usual style is, but this piece is a near dialogue-free psychedelic trip that stars a little girl who chases her cat into a grandfather clock that functions as a portal into a strange world. This entire short segment is simply the little girl running through the strange and morphing land. With the ""young girl chasing her cat into a surreal magical world"" set-up this is very obviously inspired by Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland, but that book was carried by Lewis Carroll\'s acerbic wit as he justified all the eccentricities around Alice as natural. Labyrinth Labyrinthos is almost entirely a visual/auditory experience so it doesn\'t have that. What this means is the world loses its magic because there\'s no rhyme or reason holding all of its strange sights together. It\'s just a random display of sudden sights and transitions and is unimpressive because anyone could\'ve come up with them. The skill comes in implying there actually is a direction behind the madness because it takes effort to find a pattern in something that\'s initially not recognizable. Perhaps another word for that is ""inspiration"". Labyrinth Labyrinthos looks magical but it doesn\'t feel magical. It\'s boring and not intriguing. The segment does feature some great character designs and coloring, but they end up amounting to almost nothing. The most clever thing about this segment is how it\'s set up as the framework for the other two.Yoshiaki Kawajiri\'s Running Man follows. It suits his common serious ""no humor"" approach. In a bleak-looking futuristic world a reporter is hired to interview Zack Hugh, the continuous champion of a dangerous racing circuit known as the Death Circus. The reporter makes a shocking discovery about Hugh and bears witness to his bizarre final race that will never be forgotten. Running Man is the best of Neo Tokyo\'s segments, though it\'d be more precise to say it\'s the one least lacking something. Again, almost no dialogue is here and the story is told visually yet is simple to infer. The high-speed racing thrills and technologically advanced backgrounds do the most justice to the movie\'s budget, and the western art style influence makes it a little more memorable as well. The race itself isn\'t very exciting to watch, but rather the strange things that happen during . Running Man has nothing mindblowing and it could be summed up in three sentences, but from a movie full of very simple stories it\'s the most satisfying to watch and suffers nothing from its brevity.Last is Katsuhiro Otomo\'s Construction Cancellation Order. Otomo is the director of Akira, and it\'s very obvious through the art style. Though not set in a dystopian environment, the machinery and humans are clearly drawn by the same man who did Akira. Tsutomu Sugioka is an employee sent to the jungles of South America to order the halt of the company\'s construction project. Contact has been lost with the previous foreman, and upon arriving Sugioka realizes the lead robot is malfunctioning. The remaining running time is simply Sugioka\'s frustration with attempting to get the lead robot to listen to him. It\'s dull and makes Sugioka look like an idiot for not being able to fix his problem sooner in a number of possible ways. The segment has an ironic ending that feels completely out of place and undeserved. Though by far the most plot-heavy of the segments, Construction Cancellation Order\'s storyline has been done countless times before and there\'s nothing special about it in any way. The only reason it isn\'t the worst segment is because it at least has a hook and natural progression unlike Labyrinth Labyrinthos.Neo Tokyo closes on the conclusion of Labyrinth Labyrinthos. A clown the little girl meets dances around and summons a bunch of friendly monsters. The girl, her cat, the clown, and the monsters all party while countless fireworks go off. This is by far better than the first half of this segment because it\'ll actually make you feel a tiny bit good. Then it\'s over.And that last line kind of sums up Neo Tokyo as a whole. It\'s mildly weird and pretty enough to be worth 50 minutes, but it lacks the detailed storylines and superior animation of something like Memories. The most I\'ll take from the movie is its main theme song, which is actually kind of beautiful. Neo Tokyo actually feels like a compilation movie in a bad way. It\'s a set of three unfulfilling snacks that are supposed to amount to a whole meal, whereas Memories had three well-rounded meals that amounted to something more when had in progression.

It is a film collection of three shorts of little relation, the last short being directed by Otomo was the source of the alternate name; an attempt to capitalise on Akira’s success. Naming aside, the shorts Labyrinth Labyrinthos, directed by Rintaro, Running Man, directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Construction Cancellation Order, directed by Otomo, are each wildly different. They are tales of intrigue each presented in a completely different world, with a different, vivid art style. The thread that holds them together, is that each story is loosely...adapted from Japanese Science fiction writer and poet Taku Mayumura. Each story depicts a setting and characters that exist outside of the audience’s, and provides the viewer a window into their respective worlds as a stranger, permitted to observe, and interpret what they wish from what they see. These stories do not anchor the reader to a relatable protagonist, or strongly suggest what one should feel and make of an event. Considering their narrative disconnectedness, I’ll break down each segment individually.Labyrinth Labyrinthos:Labyrinth Labyrinthos is an arthouse short, with no defined storyline or direction, instead portraying the bizarre, ethereal journey of a girl and her uniquely named cat Cicerone in their game of hide and seek, which happens to occur in a... you guessed it; labyrinth. Despite lacking a story, there are numerous interpretations to made from the surreal and creative imagery the short presents. This alone, results in a high re-watch value, as with each time, the short takes you on a different chain of thoughts and interpretations.Similarly their is no real characters present, only a girl and her cat. We follow their journey, but their is no character development, nor should there been anything of the sort in this type of story that focuses on style and aesthetics. But, again, it can be fun to speculate as to what drives the girl, how many layers of metaphor the setting is under, and what on Earth does it all mean!? And that is ultimately up to you to decide, which can make or break your experience.The art and direction, naturally is this shorts strongpoint. The animation is smooth, dynamic and lively, the character and weird creature designs are all hypnotic, whilst the backgrounds are fantastical, and often eerie. The emphasis on red is incredibly engaging and makes the short a marvel to look at, and the sound design is suitably atmospheric and dreamy.Labyrinth Labyrinthos is vibrant, enchanting and just really weird in a great way. It serves as a framing device for the other shorts in the collection, establishing a brilliantly bizarre tone.Running Man:Kawajiri creates an ethereal and bizarre short too, yet its plot and starkly different artstyle crafts its own identity. The short follows Zach Hugh, the immortal, veteran racer, who participates in the infamous \'Death Circus\', a not so shockingly deadly race. We explore his fragile and volatile mental state, as his years of racing has sent him to the brink of insanity. Secrets surrounding his victory are revealed, and an explosive climax to his career unfolds. Structure-wise, Kawajiri tended to intersperse flashbacks from fairly recent events into the short, which were ultimately a little messy. The content itself was upon re-watching was important, but the delivery was a little too obscure. Despite having the most straightforward storyline of the three shorts, I found Running Man to be the most incoherent, requiring a rewatch. Despite this, Hugh\'s desperate, manic and endless desire for first place was highly engaging, and left room to think about his motivations by the end.A reporter character is inserted into the story to provide sparse exposition, and act as a stand in for the viewer, the events of the race unfolding before him. He has no personality of development and is merely a tool to advance the story. His expository was a little distracting, detracting from the deeply grounded story Running Man establishes, but his perspective as an outsider looking upon the mangled mess of a man that is Zach Hugh, aids Hugh\'s sense of mysteriousness and insanity. We see Hugh at breaking point, the weight of the countless deaths he directly and indirectly caused crushing him, his ever-present drive for first place overriding all logic and reason, his spiritual journey and conflict tells an interesting story of ego, lust and reliance, one which is incredibly re-watchable.The production of Running Man, is arguably the best of the three. Dripping in 90\'s style, even the way the light raced across a set of iron bars brought myself immense satisfaction. There is not much not to love in regards to animation, art and sound. The racing is kinetic, the numerous explosions were a joy to look at and the roaring or the engines were satisfying. As for music, their was none, only an amalgamation of numerous HUD beeps, engine roars and glass shattering, which really grounded the race, and enhanced the tension.Running Man is a spectacle, on both in production, and is the sad conclusion to the unbreakable Zach Hugh\'s career, one that should be viewed.Construction Cancellation Order:At last, Construction Cancellation Order, the short directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, from which the series\' ""Neo Tokyo"" originated. With no relation to Akira, the short is the goofiest of the three, marveling in its worlds\' hopelessness and foolishness. We follow our ignorant protagonist, a salary-man Tsutomu Sugioka, who perfectly embodies the shorts theme; our over-dependence on technology. Deep in the South American jungle, a mega-corporation mindlessly inserts itself into the ecosystem with an army of automated robots, the short explores the potential consequences and sequential horror that such robot dependence may bring about. The plot is linear, loopy and mostly just fun to watch, nothing much more to want. Considering the simple storyline, the fairly obvious message and lack of other ideas present could be a negative, but not much else.As for characters, Sugioka, the dumbfounded and desperate replaceable employee, is probably the biggest detractor of this short. As the embodiment of human reliance and a lack of autonomy, he is understandingly annoying, but that doesn\'t make it any less frustrating to watch.. his exaggerated overbite doesn\'t help either. Contrarily, the leader, and manager of the robot workers, Robot 444-1 was incredibly memorable and charming. His innocent jittering and mannerisms conflicted with his sadistic, corrupted motives, making for an incredibly entertaining enemy. Both characters (the only characters) function very well as respective embodiments for humanity and robots; Sugioka, a little lame, but Robot 444-1 charm ensures most annoyances recede into the background.The production, as with all of the shorts, is fantastic. The animation is smooth, bombastic, the artstyle is peak 80\'s and 90\'s wonderfulness, and the character designs (mostly the robots) are quirkily memorable. The sound is a unique cacophony of construction noises; clangs, dings and thuds, the tempo gradually speeding up,  increasing the tense and distressing atmosphere.Otomo crafted a fun, dynamic short with a strong, core message that will surely become more and more important as time goes on. Whilst not as technically impressive as Running Man, or whimsical as Labyrinth Labyrinthos, it\'s certainly the most comedic, fun, and perhaps enjoyable.Manie-Manie Meikyuu Labyrinth was enthralling.

Apparently from what I can see it worked like a charm in brainwashing people.So lets talk what was so dreadful in it that I would call it a brainwashing program.It has 3 short where obviously are not related to each other written by different people about different things. (Minor spoilers ahead)Labyrinth Labyrinthos (1st short)-It was kind of story which cannot differentiate the line between a masterpiece and nonsense. Yep, can take it either ways because ur brain is not gone...register it anyways. I could seriously tell u, I understood more about the story by reading its summary compared to watching it. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen which cannot be salvaged. I would compare it with alien\'s from mars sending cryptic codes which people of earth misinterpreted as holy text from gods. This was most unexplainable thing out of the three and this was present both at the beginning and at the ending of this movie like as a sign of Hypnotism initiation and completion. ""Muddled portrayal of grotesque feature"" is the best explanation for it. I cannot tell u any more about art, characters, storyline etc because I cannot read Martian unfortunately. Overall if there is really something called so bad which can only be considered as good by a fanatic, then u have it in form of this 1st short. I just hope whoever wrote it doesn\'t have such epiphany again, it probably would be matter of life or death for this world next time.Score-1/10 (as every sane person should)Running Man (2nd short) -It was fortunately more understandable. It had a few more lines to offer compared to what preceded it, which makes it more recognizable. But question remains, is any less bizarre than previous short? Answer is no. While I could comprehend it at emotional level, it makes no sense from most of what was shown. From what I got the theme is ""stress of work"". We got a racer who is yelling and making faces while racing throughout the short and news reporter standing at the stand whose only role is to act as our perspective. Now comes the freakish occurrences. Everything is breaking without any explanation from engines to human faces everything is cracked, exploded and destroyed, but still the racing goes on. A point comes where u cannot differentiate between different racers who are still riding on. There are even more strangeness with pupils disappearing in madness, red streaks of light coming through mouth of yelling protagonist, he appearing both at home and on his cart with an expression of mad rage simultaneously and there Ghosts are still riding on while further racers and their carts are breaking and being destroyed over and over. Everything went haywire just like my spoilers. When finally all was said and done, the last narrative described the incident as ""a mystery that no one seem to mind, if it remains a mystery"" Probably those are similar to my feeling about this short. Never open a Pandora box, it only looks beautiful as a mystery.Score-3/10 (for being understandable)The Order to Stop Construction (3rd short) -Probably the most sane plot out of the three. But is it? probably, yes. While the characters are insane, plot is still sane. It is ur run-of-the-mill  insane robots tropes ( though I am assuming this trope is supposed to be some sort of innovation in 1987). Nothing much is going on, a pretty straight forward story with a wacky ending. So its suppose to be safe, isn\'t it?... No, never ever fell for that. while plot is still safe, the art and designs is right out atrocious. U could have a migraine after seeing the artstyle. One may argue that it was the similar since the beginning, but u see the ingenuity of it shined the best in the third short. As my saying going the true colors of a art came out in the finale. Remember my warning after brainwashing ""horrendous artstyle"" probably will be interpreted as ""clean animation"". So exercise extreme caution.Score-5/10 (art was pretty similar to final fantasy : legend of crystals, probably scores also should be similar. I am not a guy who will treat unfairly only based on art and animation for a old 1987 work being bad)Finally...I am surprised at myself, i could attempt to put this obscurity in words. As one of the survivors of brainwashing, I felt a immense duty to make the society more aware. Probably many fanatics will trash me for this, But I atleast tried to warn u all.Coming to final scores, 3/10 overall (+1 for attempt and for being only a short, +1 for being a old anime and as a respect to its well established directors, +1 for the purpose of this anime - brainwashing works very well) register it anyways.

For what ever reason the 'home' to this story set was drawn not in animation form but more of a painting.

Since these short films are completely unrelated, have different art-styles and are made by different people, I will review them separately.The first short film, Labyrinth Labyrinthos, is the most experimental of the movie, with an original art-style that doesn’t look like anime at all, and it is hard to tell what’s exactly happening in it, despite the fact that the animation is of very high quality. It involves at little girl and her cat chasing a mime from a circus in a labyrinth. Since it is pretty short (roughly 15 minutes), there is...no actual story or character development, but it is interesting for its nightmare-like visuals. Most of the background music is classical music. Sadly, the voice-acting is a bit bad, and the sound effects are weird.The second short film, Running Man, is less experimental, with a more classic art-style, and a more understandable story. It is set in futuristic city and focuses on a champion racer who goes crazy and starts using telekinesis to destroy his opponents. In this film, too, the animation is superb, and is even more detailed – the faces in particular –  than in the previous one, and only for that, it is worth watching. However, this short film is too slow, and the voice-acting is, just like in the previous, not very good.The third and last film, The Order to Stop Construction, is the longest and the most complete, as it has an actual introduction, a confrontation and an end. It is about a salary-man who has been ordered by his bosses to stop a fully automated construction project. He arrives at the construction site and discovers that the robot who is in charge of the project has gone crazy and wants to finish the project no matter what. The characters and the story in this short film are most fleshed out than in the previous ones, and contrary to the second film it doesn’t focus on only one character. The voice-acting is more decent than in the two other films, and the background music is alright. The art-style is more anime-like, and the backgrounds are very nice and detailed.The problem with this movie is the same as all collections of short films: they are too short to leave an impact on the viewer. Nevertheless, these three short films are interesting to watch, the first for its nightmare-like visuals, the second for its very detailed animation, and the third for its story. I recommend watching them.SUB-SCORE EXPLANATION:Animation: great animation and backgrounds in all three films → 9/10Sound: the first and second films have some problems in the VA and the sound effects, the last film is alright; the BGM is decent→ 6/10Story: the first film has no story, the second film as a very short story, the last film is good→ 6/10Characters: no character development in the first film; some in the second film; characters in the last film are more fleshed out→ 6/10Enjoyment: all these films where enjoyable in some way;  some sentimental value; high re-watch value → 7/10Overall: 7/10 no actual story or character development, but it is interesting for its nightmare-like visuals.

I won\'t say that this is the most pleasant and fascinating spectacle, but definitely quite original, not constrained by the clichés of the anime industry. The plot opens with a story in the atmosphere of ""Something wicked this way comes"" by Ray Bradbury about a girl and her cat who do not listen her mother and fall into an ominous carnival through the mirror. There they are shown two more stories, the first of which, ""The Running Man"", has taken on a life of its...own.This story, at one time, was rated as the weakest, but it is still looks the most impressive. First of all, due to its naturalistic cruelty, combined with static and meditativeness. But I would note psychology. The story is sustained in a gloomy cyberpunk style. The unbeaten champion of racing, having lost his former grip, is no longer able to withstand competitors. He is exhausted by the constant tension of the competition. But ambitions doe not let him go - these are all that is left of him. Therefore, he decides to win the losing race at any cost - by simply blowing up the cars of rivals with telekinesis. However, even left alone on the track, he cannot escape from the slavery of his ambitions. He is locked in a labyrinth of his own passions. It begins to seem to him that he is still being overtaken - by the younger ghost of himself. Monitor shows that his heart has stopped and the driver of the car is dead, but the dead man is the first (and only) to cross the finish line, continuing the race with his own ghost to complete self-destruction. The dead racer is driven only by his ambitions, which first made him to ""remove the obstacles"" to the goal - to murder other pilots - and then murdered him too.The second story (Construction Cancellation Order) is more like an ironically absurd story by Robert Sheckley. A Japanese company employee arrives at a flood-damaged, jungle besieged automated construction site in a third world country to investigate what happened to the former site manager and decide to cancell construction or not. However, AI-controlled construction develops according to its own laws. It seems that the machines must withstand the chaos of the jungle advancing from all sides, but they only multiply the chaos themselves, going crazy in an attempt to realize a meaningless task. Ultimately, the new manager has to fight not so much with the life-affirming chaos of nature, but with the meaningless, self-destructive chaos of pseudo-intelligent machines, looking for the central computer in the labyrinth of mechanisms.As for the girl and her cat, they themselves become part of the carnival chaos, seemingly never getting out of their labyrinth. own.This story, at one time, was rated as the weakest, but it is still looks the most impressive. First of all, due to its naturalistic cruelty, combined with static and meditativeness. But I would note psychology. The story is sustained in a gloomy cyberpunk style. The unbeaten champion of racing, having lost his former grip, is no longer able to withstand competitors. He is exhausted by the constant tension of the competition.

I only know that there is a girl who follows the clown with her cat into the carnival. After that it continues to the next story.Running ManThe story is about someone who is ambitious to win the race until He's dead. The theme is cyberpunk and feels like Old Neo-Tokyo....The Order to Stop ConstructionThis is about a man who has been tasked to manage the dangerous section where only robots who survive there.Art (6)The art is good on Running Man and The Order to Stop Construction. But not on Labyrinth Labyrinthos in my opinion.Labyrinth Labyrinthos made my eyes hurt because of the color that they used somehow.Running Man has a good style on the fire effect and that sketchy art.The Order to Stop Construction is good at making robots more realistic.Sound (7)All the sounds that they used are really okay and adjusted to the animation.Character (6)The main character is quite memorable but not for the supporter role.Enjoyment (6)It's quite enjoyable to watch this movie on 2022. it really reminds me to not overwork because it can make us not healthy and sometimes lead to death like in this anime.Overall (6)Recommended to those who love Old Neo-Tokyo style and original story.

My Home Hero,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52092/My_Home_Hero,"[""Well this was certainly depressing. However.If I can be honest about it, what this show can really do well, is draw an interest. Interest into reading the manga to want more. As it makes your curious to see what happens next.Story and characters: 7The story pretty much explains itself, and really feels like your worse fears come to live. Which truly makes you question yourself. Are you willing to go THIS far, in order to protect your daughter? Your family?  To not only kill, but to cover up your actions as best you can, while your backs are constantly against the wall, leaving you...with so little options to do ANYTHING. It feels like big game of cat and mouse. With these poor sods being the frightening mouses. Which to top itall off, there is more to be uncovered, that could really ruin everything for them. It's sink or swim. Fight or flight, and it's terrifying to boot. Only making for a good watch.What I do like about the cast, is that the two parents's reactions, which only makes for good characters. Sure, you can talk about maybe a plothole here or there, but just seeing their reactions, their natural fear deep inside of their very souls. As they try to accomplish seemingly the impossible. It's gritting stuff. There is more twists and turns to come for sure past these three episodes, and I cannot wait for more.Art and sound: 7I'm giving this a high grade, as it deserves such. Sure, while some moments could have been better, but there are times where the reactions are on point. How the scenes are handled and such in the sound department. It really captures how the scene feels,and how it all looks. A great job there. But what I really like most, and what hasn't been pointed out really, is that it's style really fits the tone of the show. Like, let's face it. The theme, the plot, the presentation. It's dark as hell. As if there isn't anything positive about it at current standing, and that's kinda the point? Which is why I feel the gritty, and depressing look of it actually makes it look good as a result. It fits the purpose of the show.I would say give it a watch, only in te right mindset, as it looks very depressing. But what it has done, is really advertise the concept really well, to the point you'd want to watch more. Give it a go. with so little options to do ANYTHING. It feels like big game of cat and mouse.

Give it a go."", ""Anime seasons as of late have been filled with a hopeless amount of formulaic productions. Season after season of inundating slice of lifes, reincarnation fantasies, and morally binary superhero fighting shows that all seem ostensibly different. Not to say they’re individually bad, in fact, I’ve enjoyed a fair share of them. But it’s important to remember that anime is a storytelling medium. You shouldn’t have to go into a season expecting most of the shows to fit into one of those three categories. And sadly, long were the days of Death Note and Code Geass where we had characters who were manically supercilious and selfish...but also unbelievably charismatic that made you hooked. So with the intriguing premise My Home Hero provides, it’s only natural to get excited about something that strays so far from the usual anime titles. But to answer your curiosity and the ensuing question “Does My Home Hero break the mold?” - well sort of and I’ll explain that in this review. But as a quick TLDR for those who just want to know whether they would like the show or not without having to read the whole review to come to the same conclusion. If you’re someone who appreciates methodic careful storytelling, respects strong characters with conviction, and admires hand drawn animation that flows seamlessly: you’ll hate this. If you’re someone who just wants something different from the seasonal bombardment and don’t particularly care about the finish: you might find this interesting. Or if you’ve exhausted all the anime on your plan to watch because eating without watching something seems so otherworldly in 2023 then I'd recommend you give this a shot.With that being said, My Home Hero is the most disappointing anime of the spring 2023 season for me. Not because of how the show ended up, but what it could have been with its premise and source material. While it does try to adapt something unique in anime. It also shows why anime producers have gravitated to the limited show archetypes they produce within; it’s because they don’t know how to make shows of this kind and using a working formula is so much easier. My Home Hero as a suspenseful cat-and-mouse crime thriller fails in appalling fashion and ends up a weird amalgamation of anime triteness and imitated seriousness that misses what makes other shows of this nature gripping and exciting. While it’s unfortunate that this review will have to address these serious problems of the show, I’ll also explain why it’s good in some other aspects.Tetsuo, the dad, is a frustrating character and detracts from any potential sympathy you may feel for him. On one hand, he’s an admirable family man that continuously shows his love for his family. but on the other hand, he’s just this goofball that feels so alien in the show my home hero is trying to be. He’s constantly getting caught in these shameful predicaments that every storyteller knows not to include because it damages the main character's respectability. Worse than that, he makes these high pitched squeals in the slightest discomfort and makes these embarrassing facial expressions in scenes where he’s just conversing with people that feels so unnatural. He also unironically fist pumps the air every time something goes his way which feels extremely forced. Who the hell does that? It’s this lack of composure and this unnaturalness only seen in anime that makes him seem so pathetic in a setting like this. The sad part is he does some intelligent stuff and is somewhat calculating. But it’s completely overshadowed because his plans are always foiled by variables he hasn’t accounted for or other people outsmarting him. Only for him to somehow weasel out of it by sheer happenstance or submission. That’s bad, not bad for the story per se even with the questionable overindulgence of deus ex machina. But bad if you want to make a main character people can root for because it makes him feel powerless and unassertive. Those wimpy self-deprecating characters might work in a more light-hearted story. But when you place a timid salaryman in a crime thriller, you best give that character some redeeming qualities so he becomes somewhat respectable and competitive in the dog-eat-dog world you place him in. Or make him start off not fit for this world, but slowly and unbeknownst to the characters themselves, morph into someone who does like Rock from Black Lagoon. That’s bona fide development and it makes characters feel more three-dimensional. But these come from a complete lack of understanding of what makes a suspenseful enthralling story. And this lack of understanding is even more apparent in the animation, or more precisely, lack of.To classify something as animation, the things on the screen have to move. In which the characters and background of My Home Hero do very little of if at all. That's bad in just about any show. But especially bad in a crime thriller because you want a lot of subtle facial expressions to accompany dialogue that exemplifies intentions, inner feelings, and the mind games at play that sometimes tells more than the actual dialogue. The characters in My Home Hero just don’t react to the things they’re hearing or react so slowly and obviously telegraphed that you’d think everyone else would catch on to whatever fib they’re trying to hide. But this rigidity becomes so much worse when you look at the beading sweat on their face to convey nervousness. The sweat doesn’t actually pour down their face, it just stays there as the character it’s supposedly beading down mouths whatever they’re trying to say in real-time. It’s this lack of even trying to make the animation look somewhat lifelike that’s so ire-inducing. There’s a point in the show where Tetsuo needs to wear some bandages from a head injury he sustained. They made the bandages into this plastic see-through film that looks like he just put a glass bowl on his head that only propagates the goofy narrative. It’s these things that show a lack of effort or care of the production that makes it so much harder to watch for anyone with eyes.In a surprising turnaround, the opening is actually gorgeously woven to fit the narrative with imagery that plays into the show really well. The difference between the opening and the rest of the show is night and day. You’re shown scenes As Tetsuo walks across puddles and in the snow alone. Representative of the hardships he endures to ensure his family remains safe as he reminisces of the times they were happy. Of a time when his family was happy as he willingly takes this journey of self-destruction for a daughter who shows infinitesimally less affection for him. With scenes of his family together vague enough to be relatable to many but specific enough to feel realistic and heartfelt. As Chiai Fujikawa belts her heart out about a love so profound yet fleeting in an octave high enough to blow Ariana Grande with all the autotune she can muster out of the water. This lethal combination will make even the most hardened anime viewers shed a tear. But the real kicker; the main reason as to why I enjoy and would go so far as to recommend this show to some?It’s because that stupid insolent daughter reminds me of myself. A child oblivious to any of the hardships their parents have to undergo and will complain just about any inconvenience that comes their way. The litany of offences you make that your parents can somehow umbrella under the term “rebellious teenage phase” that only a loving parent affectionately ascribed as a home hero can love. I didn’t even go into the show expecting to get so emotional over a bad daughter. It might be because I’m now a university student studying abroad or the fact that this aired on father’s day and I get to spend time with him after what felt like years. But I get really emotional when Tetsuo randomly blurts out stuff like “Let the three of us continue to live happily”. I see the potential, he’s just a father forcibly placed in shrinking confines of a situation he himself placed his family in because of his blinding love for his daughter. It reminded me of all the things my dad did for me growing up. All the things you never say but do to express love. Driving his son to 6am football practices every week for a school team he wasn’t even a starter for. Buying an insane amount of snacks for his son’s first airplane ride by himself because he was nervous his son might be hungry on the plane. Sending care packages with tons of little things I love to make me feel better during exam period. The show captured parts of that type of love a dad has for their child, in its own extreme way. It's just a shame the show didn’t know how to mix that in with the crime thriller portion of the story and made him sound like a bumbling idiot every time he did something loving or sacrificial. I think that’s something that might resonate strongly with you if you grew up with a loving dad. So that’s why, as everyone trained their sights, preparing to drop and cast this show off as more seasonal schlock.

A tight-knit story with a high level of suspense, while keeping the contrivances and convolutions low is most definitely a tough task, and even more of a tough task to satisfy all viewers. “My Home Hero” has its fair share of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat at times, but unfortunately, it had a very low budget to work with, making the important moments not hit as hard as they should be. However, it still did a good job at making some of the characters feel realistic to...an extent.The set up for the show is relatively simple, as it’s about a normal man, Tosu Tetsuo, doing whatever it takes to protect his family, even it means murdering someone in cold blood to save his daughter. In doing so, he gets the yakuza on his tail, and he has to attempt to diffuse the situation and cover up his murder to save his family. The idea of protecting your family is present in both the protagonist’s and antagonist’s point of view, and the story attempts to make you feel for the characters, even the villains. As with most mystery/thriller shows, there are moments that aren’t particularly well written, and you question the intelligence and consistency of some of the actions of the characters.I suppose the most difficult thing to believe, or something that requires a degree of suspension of disbelief, is how the characters are so skilled in escaping the yakuza, despite being seemingly a normal family. Tosu Tetsuo, the protagonist, gets his skills from reading and writing mystery novels, which is quite an interesting concept, though admittedly a bit flimsy. His wife, Kasen, was quite a highlight of the show, as she was able to support her husband extremely well, and together, they made an excellent tag team. One major complaint I would have is towards the daughter, Reika, who despite being the focus of the initial conflict, didn’t play much of a role in the story, and felt a bit too oblivious to what her parents were doing.What I did like about the characters however, is how realistic they felt at points, especially selling the point that they aren’t experts at crime, especially on the emotional side of things. One might criticize Tetsuo for not acting when he had a chance to resolve the issue, perhaps by killing another person, but you got to recognize, he’s just a normal human being with empathy. I also liked some of the fights, as they were realistically awkward and clumsy, because the characters were never trained to fight. It was a good touch for sure.The other major issue is obviously the animation, which was extremely stiff and took away from the major moments of the show. I honestly feel a live action adaptation might have worked better than this anime. However, the soundtrack was quite decent, and had a level of a thrilling tone to it to help compliment the show.Overall, the show’s fine, but just severely held back by the production values unfortunately. The story had its ups and downs, and requires a fair share of suspension of disbelief.

(The ending song is amazing though)➡The rating is 17+, if the action it has will keep staying the same as it is then I think this rating is way to high and should be lowered,  unless something changes, but besides that I think the age rating might put some people off.Now while all of these reasons are valid points I think this is a must watch, it might not seem like it but I'm a big guy when it comes to animation, if you go onto my list you will see most of the anime I watch are either high budget productions with amazing animation or they are heavily stylized (e.g. Kaiji), animation is one of the biggest factors that determines if I watch an anime or not (one of the reasons I haven't watched many old anime) another thing I don't overly like is thriller murder stories, it's not that I dislike them, it's just that they don't overly appeal to me, so it seems like I would be the guy who hates this based on that, but  I like it, have full faith when I say that this anime has some of the most true feeling emotions, every emotion that the characters feel I could see myself feeling if I was in such a situation, the raw emotion is crazy and it will leave you feeling empty, next is that the plot is just really exciting and while you know that the mc will somehow get out of the situation, it leaves you wondering how will he get out of the situation right until he gets out, sometimes you might even be thinking that he won't.This anime is sure to get a low rating, but I bet if you give the first 3 episodes a chance you will get hooked and will enjoy it, that's coming from the guy who hates bad animation, bad music, and dislikes murder thrillers. why this anime is sure to get a below average rating:➡ The animation, the animation is below average for a 2023 anime, there is a lot of still frames, badly drawn frames, and overall the shadows and lighting aren't great.➡SFX/Music, The sound effects weren't overly bad or didn't take me out of the environment/story but it wasn't anything that would appeal to someone who doesn't enjoy anime or someone who only watches the big hits, this may be annoying for some but it should be ok.

It was a slow burn but keeps your attention by drip feeding you what you need at the right times.I have watched so many Anime, near to 1000.. and I can’t believe this is my first review.. I felt compelled for some reason..It’s dark, gritty and realistic to a degree. This is a mature anime for maturer viewers who have patience and an attention span.. it is not for shounen lovers who like power ups..Themes of yazuka, desperation and family are explored.I really enjoyed the cat and mouse dynamic between the antagonist and the protagonist. It reminded me a little of...death note.It’s been a while since I watched an anime with and all adult cast and an R rating, I enjoyed this.I’m a little tired of shounen teens powering up..This gave of vibes like monster and death note, albeit not as good.

To sum up quickly, this anime has an amazing start, gets tedious and fails to find it’s footing, gets amazing again near the end, then slams you with a huge annoying aggravation, before delivering a decent enough ending.The good- the op is one of the best of the season, and thats saying something as I cant remember one season that had so many shows with amazing music.  It’s a story about a normal person with nothing special about him...who has to suck it up to save his family, allowing for some interesting growth.  The characters all were pretty interesting for the most part, each with their own motivations.The bad- for one, the mob seems to catch on way too fast that their darling member is missing, giving the lead almost no wiggle room to get his act together.  They catch on so fast, in fact, that it’s almost unbelievable that they need to play cat and mouse.  The pacing seems to also go off- there’s a large portion of the show where it feels like very little progresses.  Many of the things that the lead does during this time to throw the mob off seem short sighted and not very well thought out.  Animation is average.Its not a bad anime, but not particularly good either.  If nothing else, it stands out because it’s different- which may be a nice change of pace in a sea of isekai’s.  I might watch it again sometime, but I’d have to be pretty bored. who has to suck it up to save his family, allowing for some interesting growth.

While the story itself isn't bad, the narrative quality is dubious. There are moments when the series has a fast-paced dynamic, with things happening quickly, but there are also moments when the opposite occurs, lacking a consistent speed.Now, regarding the characters, I wouldn't say they are bad, but they aren't perfect either. There are instances where their actions contradict the character development previously established, which can be somewhat uncomfortable to watch.Is it necessary to mention the animation? Well, yes. It's terrible. It's normal for animation quality to...decline slightly throughout a season, but in this case, the animation is already poor from the first episode.So, if you don't enjoy watching a PowerPoint presentation with audio, then I don't recommend it.Lastly, the soundtrack is quite forgettable.Only the opening theme stands out, but the in-series soundtrack is mostly slow and boring (this is just my personal opinion).In conclusion, the series falls short in terms of animation.The plot is interesting and captivating, so I wouldn't judge the work based on its adaptation, I'll just say that it didn't receive the adaptation the manga deserved. decline slightly throughout a season, but in this case, the animation is already poor from the first episode.So, if you don't enjoy watching a PowerPoint presentation with audio, then I don't recommend it.Lastly, the soundtrack is quite forgettable.Only the opening theme stands out, but the in-series soundtrack is mostly slow and boring (this is just my personal opinion).In conclusion, the series falls short in terms of animation.The plot is interesting and captivating, so I wouldn't judge the work based on its adaptation, I'll just say that it didn't receive the adaptation the manga deserved."", 'I literally knew nothing about this anime but I saw it in the recently updated list and thought it’d be funny to just jump on it and give it a try and I was kind of impressed.

One moment the show makes me believe that the MC has some wits and in the next he seems dumb as a door..I get that this is supposed to be a first-time something will go wrong type of situation, but even so.Another great example is the faces that the mother and father makes 3 times in a row to their daughter, as she interrupts them trying to decompose the yakuza remains in the living room. This makes me think the daughter either doesn't care at all about what her parents are doing/thinking or maybe she is also dumb as a door.Overall i like the premise and idea, which this show brings, but the animations are pretty bad, and the direction of how to display the events and characters is so damn lousy and doesn't fit into the narrative and theme.The thing I'm missing the most in the animations/direction is some drama. Just add dramatic lighting like in Higurashi. Some dramatic pauses and closeups with dramatic lighting and sweat drops running, to really show the suspense.Anything... The shots feels more like it was meant for a cute slice of life or some comedy.Hope this review saved your eyes some time away from this anime and your face away from your palm.

More than just an average crime drama. It doesn\'t have anything to lighten up the mood and is also realistic.Usually, shows like this have action-packed scenes like brawling, car chase, or some gun fights to take your mind off the heavy stuff like people being murdered in the cold blood. Otherwise, there are scenes from the main character\'s daily life that usually have some relaxing context: colleagues joking around or discussing some silly everyday stuff or relatives that spend their time at home in a relaxing way.""My home hero""...won\'t give you any such pause to get your wits together. It will put pressure on you even when it is supposed to relax its grip a bit. This makes the show rather mentally taxing, even overbearing. So that\'s the biggest minus in my opinion. But while this is a minus for me, someone might find such a narrative to be gritty and unforgiving, which could be good in its own way.Artstyle and animation 8/10""My home hero"" is a bit lacking in this department. But the lack of quality is barely noticeable because the art style adds to the whole atmosphere of the show. The style doesn\'t distract and it is good enough to immerse you in the scene. It\'s actually very fitting for the show because the drawing and animations are similar to the family in the story\'s focus: average, non-assuming.If I were to highlight something, that would be facial expressions and animations. They are really good. They deliver the message.Music and sound effects 8/10Every sound and melody adds to the mood. And again, nothing distracts you from what is happening on a screen. The music won\'t catch your attention, but also won\'t shatter the suspense, which is very good in my opinion. The quality of voice acting is great.Story and narrative 9/10While it\'s too early to say how good or bad the story is, so far the storytelling was good. Screenwriter uses parallel storytelling through background narratives (like news flashes, tv shows, or dialogues that are not directly relevant to the main story) to confer the mood and state of mind of the main characters. The storytelling pace might be a bit faster than you would expect, but the suspense is there, so you can barely catch a breath between scenes. As a drawback, it also puts a lot of pressure on a viewer.Total 9/10If I were to quantify the overall quality, I would give the show itself 8 out of 10, but I gave it a slightly higher score because we rarely get such a good story as an anime show. Yes, criminal dramas or detective stories might provide a better experience in this genre, but those are separate mediums in my opinion.

And in anime, realistic criminal thrillers are far and between.', 'The show in a TL;DR format: great manga, not so great, or shall I say: an even subpar adaptation.I don\'t blame you if you don\'t know who mangaka Naoki Yamakawa is: his first anime adaptation in the form of 100-man no Inochi no Ue ni Ore wa Tatteiru a.k.a I\'m Standing on a Million Lives, studio Maho Film\'s adaptation of its 2 seasons back in Fall 2020 and Summer 2021, just does not do the source material enough justice. And at the time of his next forthcoming towards this Spring season, I foretold that if the next adaptation of his much more successful work in...the form of the drama and psychological suspense manga ""My Home Hero"" got the adaptation it deserves, then at the very least, Naoki Yamakawa would be justified in saying that it got the attention and recognition it should have gotten with 100-man. And boy, oh boy, was I wrong, in the most insulting of ways. First and second time\'s a fluke, third time\'s a literate gangster\'s beating down.As compared to Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu a.k.a. The Dangers in My Heart, which features love and murder in the rom-com sense, My Home Hero is instead, a bat-swinging heck of a suspense thriller that also involves love and murder, but one that proves that the cost to protect a beloved person (i.e. loved ones), comes at the cost of millions. It\'s why the American columnist William E. Vaughan mentions this quote: ""One murder makes a villain, millions often a hero."" This is a direct reference to Naoki Yamakawa\'s first work of 100-man, and My Home Hero showcases the brutality of that work, amped up to a depressing, dark, and gritty state. That\'s what I love about the manga, aided by illustrator Masashi Asaki\'s striking art style that beckons one to read further as an incentive.""To kill, or not to kill, that is thou question."" At the behest of an innocent life played at the hands of one uncharacteristically nonchalant growing other, this is the life of the Tosu family, wrecked to shreds at the mercy of a yakuza corporation. The main challenger is 47-year-old Tetsuo, along with his 41-year-old wife Kasen, who are bidding to fight for their 18-year-old daughter Reika\'s release from her supposed ""boyfriend"" Nobuto Matori, who extorts girls for money and then murders them for his enjoyment. Unsurprisingly, Reika is in the same formation as well, for her physical and mental abuse by Nobuto is seen by her parents to be played out in the exact same sequence as he did before. So, it\'s this action of committing ""the perfect crime"" by disposing of Nobuto instead by whatever means possible, ensuring that he will never live to see another day to torment the Tosu family for any longer. The problem with Nobuto is that he\'s the only son of a powerful yakuza head, with the organization run under his name, Yoshitatsu, spearheaded by his trusted lieutenant Kubo and the many lackeys under his control at his beck and call. And therein, lies the endless cat-and-mouse chase ""of the century"" with many twists and turns, all to avoid Tetsuo and (potentially) Kasen caught in the act, losing out, and being brutally tortured by the yakuza.In many ways, to understand the perils of being chased by an organization as fearmongering as the Yakuza, put yourself in Tetsuo\'s shoes, if this is how you\'ve done it one and the same or different from his outcomes. The thing is, Tetsuo has a knack for the mysterious element since he enjoys reading mystery stories and writing novels in his spare time, and when it came time for an escape plan, that is all he had at his disposal for knowledge gained for an edge over Matori\'s syndicate that is surveilling and threatening his family at every nook and cranny of the order. Conspicuously, his wife Kasen is more of the same, due to the fact that the couple were in the same club in school, being the common interest in their growing-up years until their marriage that gave birth to their daughter Reika, who is left out of the picture completely since the married couple is keeping very close tabs and not wanting any further harm on their daughter. It\'s the same for Yoshitatsu Matori: his son has been murdered, and he wants to know who his killer was, because as barbarian as Nobuto can be, he\'s his only son, and without a mother figure, it\'s the double duty of a father to raise him in this unforgiving and brutal nature of the underworld. A depressant for most of the run, I can understand Matori\'s distress as a father who had just lost his only family, even if he was raised in a bad environment, and his relentless pursuit to give karma back to his killer, more so than not.And other than Matori and Kubo overlooking the cat-and-mouse chase of a case, none has it closer than any other, than Kyoichi Majima. One of Kubo\'s right-hand men with supreme skills of surveillance and detection, as well as countermeasures against both, he is the right person for the call to chase Tetsuo and his wife Kasen, knowing that while Tetsuo committed the crime, Kasen is a collaborator, ready to assist him at his call. But even Kyoichi\'s life doesn\'t come easy: The son of an upstanding policeman who wanted to exact justice from a young age, his family was dealt the worst of circumstances, which led him to join the yakuza to find his own justice, even if it means killing people. It\'s painful to see such a life wasted away for evil, but humans are not God, and that\'s most certainly the case for Kyoichi, who spearheads the on-the-ground investigation, which eventually leads him to the married couple. He wants to fight for a life where life for him is lived in a just manner, and there\'s nothing wrong with that, but it has to come in a worse state than imagined, fulfilled through the tall order of a ruthless yakuza organisation.As expected from the adaptation, which adapts Part 1 of the manga, at least the newbie director Takashi Kamei got the dark and gritty portions of the manga right, though many sacrifices were taken in order to be able to align with regulatory TV standards, so that it almost feels like an incomplete adaptation in comparison. And yes, the intense moments of confrontation, deaths, and killings are there, but at a lower fidelity of the grotesque vibes, it almost looks pedestrian compared to the manga, which brings out the full psychological breakneck mentality that pursues one to read more to find out the outcome of it. But if I have to judge it from an overall state, it would be just like Maho Film\'s 100-man adaptation yet again, for the 3rd time with a different studio that\'s less than adequate for the job. The music, however, is so-so at best. Chiai Fujikawa has done a good job on her solemn OP song, which I find adds an allure to the anime adaptation, though Dizzy Sunfist still hasn\'t quite got the edge, apart from their last appearance being that of Ex-Arm\'s static show of a lazy ED.To put it simply, when all is said and done, I LOVE the manga to shreds, but Tezuka Productions\' adaptation here is yet another vexing matter that Naoki Yamakawa has suffered the same mindless and disappointing shrug of anime wasteland with another subpar showing yet again, but now of his most revered manga series to date. It\'s an absolute shame that he has been screwed over by the anime staff team for the 3rd time in a row (if you count the 2 seasons of 100-man separately), and seeing that he only has both said work and this show\'s manga still concurrently serializing, I think that to properly savour the best of what this mangaka has to offer, it would be better to read the original source materials instead.PLEASE, for the love of God, do yourself a favour and read both 100-man and My Home Hero\'s manga, they are CLEARLY the superior versions over both anime. the form of the drama and psychological suspense manga ""My Home Hero"" got the adaptation it deserves, then at the very least, Naoki Yamakawa would be justified in saying that it got the attention and recognition it should have gotten with 100-man.

The thing is, Tetsuo has a knack for the mysterious element since he enjoys reading mystery stories and writing novels in his spare time, and when it came time for an escape plan, that is all he had at his disposal for knowledge gained for an edge over Matori\'s syndicate that is surveilling and threatening his family at every nook and cranny of the order. Conspicuously, his wife Kasen is more of the same, due to the fact that the couple were in the same club in school, being the common interest in their growing-up years until their marriage that gave birth to their daughter Reika, who is left out of the picture completely since the married couple is keeping very close tabs and not wanting any further harm on their daughter. It\'s the same for Yoshitatsu Matori: his son has been murdered, and he wants to know who his killer was, because as barbarian as Nobuto can be, he\'s his only son, and without a mother figure, it\'s the double duty of a father to raise him in this unforgiving and brutal nature of the underworld. A depressant for most of the run, I can understand Matori\'s distress as a father who had just lost his only family, even if he was raised in a bad environment, and his relentless pursuit to give karma back to his killer, more so than not.And other than Matori and Kubo overlooking the cat-and-mouse chase of a case, none has it closer than any other, than Kyoichi Majima. One of Kubo\'s right-hand men with supreme skills of surveillance and detection, as well as countermeasures against both, he is the right person for the call to chase Tetsuo and his wife Kasen, knowing that while Tetsuo committed the crime, Kasen is a collaborator, ready to assist him at his call. But even Kyoichi\'s life doesn\'t come easy: The son of an upstanding policeman who wanted to exact justice from a young age, his family was dealt the worst of circumstances, which led him to join the yakuza to find his own justice, even if it means killing people. It\'s painful to see such a life wasted away for evil, but humans are not God, and that\'s most certainly the case for Kyoichi, who spearheads the on-the-ground investigation, which eventually leads him to the married couple. He wants to fight for a life where life for him is lived in a just manner, and there\'s nothing wrong with that, but it has to come in a worse state than imagined, fulfilled through the tall order of a ruthless yakuza organisation.As expected from the adaptation, which adapts Part 1 of the manga, at least the newbie director Takashi Kamei got the dark and gritty portions of the manga right, though many sacrifices were taken in order to be able to align with regulatory TV standards, so that it almost feels like an incomplete adaptation in comparison. And yes, the intense moments of confrontation, deaths, and killings are there, but at a lower fidelity of the grotesque vibes, it almost looks pedestrian compared to the manga, which brings out the full psychological breakneck mentality that pursues one to read more to find out the outcome of it. But if I have to judge it from an overall state, it would be just like Maho Film\'s 100-man adaptation yet again, for the 3rd time with a different studio that\'s less than adequate for the job. The music, however, is so-so at best. Chiai Fujikawa has done a good job on her solemn OP song, which I find adds an allure to the anime adaptation, though Dizzy Sunfist still hasn\'t quite got the edge, apart from their last appearance being that of Ex-Arm\'s static show of a lazy ED.To put it simply, when all is said and done, I LOVE the manga to shreds, but Tezuka Productions\' adaptation here is yet another vexing matter that Naoki Yamakawa has suffered the same mindless and disappointing shrug of anime wasteland with another subpar showing yet again, but now of his most revered manga series to date. It\'s an absolute shame that he has been screwed over by the anime staff team for the 3rd time in a row (if you count the 2 seasons of 100-man separately), and seeing that he only has both said work and this show\'s manga still concurrently serializing, I think that to properly savour the best of what this mangaka has to offer, it would be better to read the original source materials instead.PLEASE, for the love of God, do yourself a favour and read both 100-man and My Home Hero\'s manga, they are CLEARLY the superior versions over both anime.', ""I started this anime the day it aired and the first episode definitely exceeded my expectations.Everyone is either saying that this anime sucks or either its AMAZING but im not sure i agree with both.In terms of over-rated or under-rated, it is definitely over-rated, it is not an EPIC mystery/thriller anime however it is pretty good.The animation is so-so, the characters are pretty realistic, and idk WTF is wrong with the daughter's mental health but yea theres def smth wrong with her. The father seems like a general dude who has a daughter...and stuff?The second episode kinda bored me, but it ended in a cliff-hanger...so OFC i had to finish the third episode and i am currently awaiting the next episode.The plot is pretty good, but there are way too many complications and I keep forgetting the characters because they are not really memorable.The anime is pretty good all in all, however it is definitely over-rated.Dont set your expectations too high but its a good time-killer. so OFC i had to finish the third episode and i am currently awaiting the next episode.The plot is pretty good, but there are way too many complications and I keep forgetting the characters because they are not really memorable.The anime is pretty good all in all, however it is definitely over-rated.Dont set your expectations too high but its a good time-killer."", 'My home hero is a fairly mediocre show, but despite its mediocrity I still found it to be consistently entertaining.The good:The first 75% of the story was well done in my opinion. It was entertaining and tense and had progression that felt natural. Despite the show being slightly slower paced due to its genre (compared to the constant action many shows bring) it was still constantly engaging and interesting.I also think the characters were good overall. The characters felt consistent and acted in ways that you’d expect. The show also did a good job of showing different sides of most characters that needed it....Many of the characters acted extremely or had extreme thoughts, but it never felt unjustified or confusing based both on the characters personalities and the life or death scenario most of them were constantly facing throughout the show.There were also no “bad” characters in the show. To me this is a huge plus, as in many shows, a cast of great characters can be dragged down by a few bad ones. This show thankfully doesn’t have this issue.Another point that stems from the characters is I think that they did a good job with humor, or rather the lack of it. Many shows that attempt to be more serious greatly suffer when they try and force humor throughout the show. This show doesn’t have that problem at all, and it greatly improved my enjoyment.Finally I also think they did a good job with the ending. I won’t spoil what happens but they managed to both finish off the core storyline while still leaving the potential for a sequel. I’d feel satisfied if a new season never comes out, and equally excited if one did.The ok:First the sound. Ultimately, the sound wasn’t memorable, neither in a good or bad way. It did its job.Next the animation. I’d expect the animation to be a pretty criticized aspect for many people, either because they were fans of the manga and wanted a better adaptation, or because they thought it was too stiff. While I can acknowledge that the animation isn’t great, I still disagree with many of the criticisms as the animation didn’t hurt my enjoyment of the show at all. This is mostly for two reasons. One is simply that I think its fine. The character models are fine. The animation is consistent. It’s never so bad that its an eyesore to look at. The 2nd point is that a show like this doesn’t need good animation to be interesting. There is very little fighting or fast passed movement. Rather most of the tension is based on characters trying to find or hide evidence or trying to outsmart each other. You don’t need good animation for this kind of story to work well. Still, calling the animation anything better than just “ok” would be a lie.Lastly, while I was giving the story praises above, I still think that its mostly mediocre. It’s true that I found it entertaining, and it was pretty well done but compared to other shows it doesn’t stand out. I’m glad that I watched it, but odds are I won’t think about this show again after finishing this review unless a sequel is announced. Don’t go into this show expecting a masterpiece.The bad:This show is pretty mediocre, but part of the reason that I’d still recommend it is because I don’t think there is much “bad” about the show. However there is one exception. I mentioned that I think both the first 3/4 and the ending of the show are good, but that leaves that tiny bit in between. While most of the content in those episodes was entertaining, the way the story progressed in the end really annoyed me.I won’t spoil the specifics, but the progression of the story changed a bit in this section. Rather than feeling natural, the progression was led by unrealistic incompetence of others, and by extremely unlikely luck. I can even think of other ways they could have handled the progression and gotten the same result while feeling much better.This same progression also allowed the show to avoid some major events and interactions from happening which was disappointing. I can understand why the author chose to avoid those events, but as a viewer it felt really sudden. It made the entire build up feel largely pointless.Overall my home hero is a pretty flawed but entertaining show. If you want to watch something with a more serious tone, I’d recommend you give this a watch.My final scores would be:7/10 story7/10 characters5/10 animation5/10 sound7/10 enjoyment6/10 overall Many of the characters acted extremely or had extreme thoughts, but it never felt unjustified or confusing based both on the characters personalities and the life or death scenario most of them were constantly facing throughout the show.There were also no “bad” characters in the show.

A good anime should have a compelling and well-written storyline that captures the audience\'s attention from the beginning to the end. The characters should also be well-developed and relatable, with clear motivations and goals that drive the story forward.My Home Hero an adaptation of the manga by the same name written by Asaki, Masashi and Yamakawa, Naoki has earned a failing grade in every single aspect.This anime series has a plot that centers around a father who becomes a vigilante...to protect his daughter from her abusive boyfriend. Although this plot may seem intriguing, (as it did to me) it really really really sucked.ART/ANIMATIONLet me start off by saying the animation quality is the equivalent of a YouTube stick figure animation made by a 12 year old. The character designs are inconsistent, its filled with lazy still shots, the animation is choppy and its almost unwatchable. And this transitions us into how the art looks so unfinished. Some of the scenes you can see the rough draft in the background. the character designs are inconsistent and they look different in like every other scene.CHARACTERSmy main issue is with the way certain characters are depicted, I find them stereotypical and one-dimensional. Every single character in this show reminds me of a cabbage; for example when the mom found the body of Reikia\'s ex-boyfriend she reacted as if she had dropped a pencil on the floor and the tip broke off. The characters have absolute no depth. honestly I\'m more emotionally attached to the criminal dressed in yellow with the baseball cap then these generic looking cabbages. The characters are not well-developed, which makes it difficult to empathize with them leading the cheesy and forced ""Suspense"" totally useless.PACINGOn the first episode I genuinely thought I skipped a few episodes because of how bad the pacing was. This show moves way to fast for people to be invested in any of the characters or even the plot, leaving me so bored. The moment I\'m watching an episode I find myself constantly checking the time left just to be disappointed when I have 15 minutes left.This anime had insane potential but its lazy Animation, Art, Pacing and badly written characters leave this anime to be so incredibly boring and hard to watch.

Now like I said pretty easy, but there’s something about the way the plot unravels. You find yourself drawn into where the story could go and it’s...immediately countered by a better twist.

The methods and strategies of the protagonist together with his wife are very cunning, putting all of this together, it captures the viewer in a beautiful way.Art: 7/10The appearance of the characters remained somewhat similar to the manga, it is possible to say that the look is great for those who want to watch something serious and mature and that makes you get more into the story....Animation: 3/10Bad, low fluidity, it's notable that they did it with a low budget, it could have been much better in many ways, such an engaging story should have been of better quality, but even though it was of low quality, the proportions and shapes of the characters weren't strange.Soundtrack: 6/10good, it involves the atmosphere of the scenes, especially the tense ones, the parts where there is no soundtrack are well placed too.Dubbing: 10/10Great, the voices of each character matched their appearance, and they fit into different scenes in the story, adapting to different scenarios.Characters: 8/10Tetsuo, Kyouichi, Kasen and Yoshitatsu were the most notable characters, the others had some good moments, but they didn't have a bigger role like those mentioned previously.Enjoyment: 9/10Since the 1st episode I felt enchanted by the anime, the protagonist's actions and justifications, the suspense, the drama, with each passing episode I became more and more curious to know if Tetsuo would be able to protect his family until the end.Overall: 9/10A great thriller/suspense to watch, the message about family in the anime certainly captivated me and left me very connected with the story, although some small details were left out, it was great entertainment that will definitely make me recommend it to more people, I plan to read the manga too.

We got our struggles, we got our hopes. We got someone we love and someone we hate. We got something good and bad at every corner, but we have control over it. At least we believe so, but that\'s kind of the point. Having a belief, that tomorrow\'s going to be a better day. But like someone once said, ""Life fucks everyone"".FamilyFor Tosu Tetsuo, his family (his annoyingly oblivious daughter, to be precise) is what rises problems but it is also what grants him power, a reason to...push forward. While the story tackles some other notable themes like Justice, Survival, Teamwork etc., it ultimately is about a father trying to protect what he loves, a son trying to get back what he lost, and a father trying to avenge his son. It\'s all about family.The story does a great job at maintaining this suspense, and works well as a fine thriller. Though one thing that the show glosses over is the daughter. She\'s really left as a plot point, with her presence bringing an air of annoyance since the characters we know would be going through a lot of crap because of her flaws while she\'s over her room watching cat videos.One thing I particularly like about the story is how it shows Tetsuo\'s weakness. For all his ""all according to keikaku"" planning, the show makes it point that he\'s still weak, makes mistakes and sometimes all he can do is pray. Though it might pull some asspulls every now and then. It also does a good job at highlighting the moral dilemma he faces, being crushed by the wait of his sins.ProductionI\'m pretty sure the manga benefits from this, because this Anime really highlights it\'s story and writing, by having a weak production. From it\'s almost slideshow-ish animation, poor action scenes, bland opening song and generic sound; it\'s production is ultimately it\'s downfall. I guess the only selling point in production would be voice acting.Similar storiesThere are plenty of other movies/shows that follow a similar plotline like,Devotion of Suspect X (Novel) and it\'s adaptations across multiple languages and countries.And of course Drishyam, which is loosely based on Devotion X, which currently available in like 4 different languages, and an unnecessary but still entertaining sequel. The anime is been compared to this pretty often during the beginning of the show\'s airing, but it\'s pretty different from that, though the tone and overall themes are pretty much the same.OrJust read the manga :)ConclusionThis is an engaging thriller/drama that\'s working with a low budget.

The characters in the show were made to be modern everyday personalities, such as Tetsuo being the father who'd even self sacrifice for his family, Kasen and...Reika making up their family of 3 to the organised crime group with most of them being professional yet stern with their interests.The show revolves around the act of forcing a loving fathers hand when it comes to protecting his family, even against a greater power which is the organised crime group and how Tetsuo has to accommodate every new problem which comes up which could happen and then dealing with on the spot problems which could arise in the moment.So for anyone who enjoys crime documentaries but more as they're unfolding, then you'll instantly like this show.But if you're not into mature themes with somewhat if a slow but decently flowing pace with minimum action as the main character isn't exactly a person who's built like a brick house and can throw down but more of a salary man who is what you'd expect a salary man to be like, then it may not be for you. Which is where I can see alot of people crying about this show, with Tetsuo being very physically weak, the animation not being unlimited budget works level or the music used for it.If you have those expectations then I propose you do more research on which titles which companies do, as Tezuka Productions isn't a demon slayer level producer of anime. But with that being said they did do a decent job of making the plotline as detailed as possible with what they worked with.So in short if you're looking for an anime which is set in modern times which revolves around an individual who's unlucky enough to accidentally get involved with an organised crime group by protecting his family and then having to cover up what he's done against this group who's constantly trying to pin the blame on him.

Tetsuo and his wife are definitely the best characters in the series. They don\'t only personify ""couple goals,"" but they are the only characters worth rooting for. Testuo also has a love for mystery stories which help influence everything he does in the series. No matter how hard things get, this underdog dad really does his best to save his family from the yakuza and all their bull.Cons:The characters that surround Testuo and his wife are just...not...well written--or at least well-established. The daughter--the catalyst for this entire story--sucks. Abused by her boyfriend, her father Tetsuo steps up to not only get rid of the abuser but also everyone opposition that comes their way. And what does the daughter do? Nothing. She is fussy, rude, oblivious to the fact that her parents are coming home injured and let\'s go of this boyfriend faster than a wet tissue. At one point, she even tries to side with the bad guys because they say they ""know her parents."" She\'s terribly stupid for a college student and one might find themselves regretting her ever being saved.The other issue is Nobuto. His goal is to take down the killer of the abusive jerk in order to gain rank in the gang he is in. He suspects Testuo immediately and NEVER LET\'S THAT GO. He becomes a terribly awful person fixated on this one guy. What i really hate, is not only his bull crap motivation, but the fact that he is too smart. He has no background in forensics or crime fighting, nor does he have an affixation for mystery. He\'s just a genius who will notice the tiniest detail. He notices it so much so that at one point one cannot help but wonder why he doesn\'t use his genius to leave the mafia like he wants to. He notices things that don\'t make sense (scratches on unseen window seals, heartbeats, moved boxes in the background, etc). It doesn\'t make sense to be that OP in this series.The plot itself is kind of rushed/ forgotten in some points, and characters are thrown in randomly. The only reason that abusive jerk wad was with the daughter was because her grandfather was rich and was going to give her money when her piano-playing took off or died? We really don\'t go into the details. It didn\'t make sense. She never played piano, and we never met/saw/or spoke of a grandfather the whole series. Alot of backgrounds were introduced but they didn\'t progress the stories.

Tetsuo was an amazing character. They portrayed him as pulling the strings like he was the creator of that story, the creator...of his tragic life. The support he received from his partner/wife was perfectly introduced to us, showing how far they could go for love. Like the opening theme says, most of the anime is like a suspense show, but everything that happens is about Tetsuo’s love for his family.I really hope that we can get another season with better animation because this anime deserves another chance with more recognition.For me was 8,5/10 but for MAL will be 9! of his tragic life.

It starts really great but then walks into realms of disbelief after couple of episodes. We are suppose to accept the fact someone will just pretend yesterday\'s abuse didn\'t happen and get ready for the next one. Then whole show turned into catch 22, where main characters try to outsmart yakuza. This is the place I lost interest.Art is actually great and story is not half-bad either. It\'s just that at some point everyone starts acting irrationally and story simply requires you to step up your suspension of disbelief for just another notch. Episode three gave me the same feeling like...when I watched Death Note and super smart detective said ""I don\'t know how you did it but I know you did"", while being chained to the suspect 24/7. That\'s it, that\'s where I break the line and go on to something else.Am giving it mixed feeling because someone might even not notice what I did and enjoys the show without a problem.

A man going through length to keep his family safe from a criminal organization. The beginning was a little slow, but this anime picked up quickly in the second half with a great mind game between the characters. There’s a lot of planning in this story, but I didn’t always buy the method behind how the dad and his wife tricked the organization. Sometimes I kinda have to extend my disbelief to accept what was shown. The animation, although not the worst, was weak and tampered with my enjoyment of the show.

Truly, the aphorism that ""You never know what you\'ve got \'til it\'s gone"" applies to My Home Hero perfectly. Only when I was exposed to edgy garbage did my appreciation for the slowness, the buildup, and the schemes implemented rise dramatically. This happened again when I read Shinai naru Boku e Satsui wo Komete. Before,...I thought that in My Home Hero, everything goes a bit too well for Tosu. However, again, after reading garbage with an MC that has absurd plot armor did I realize that Tosu had luck that I could suspend my disbelief in.However, I digress. Let\'s talk about the actual story. A man of the household resorts to crime in order to ensure his family security. He goes on from being a very average husband to a ruthless criminal. Ring any bells? Yes, I\'m talking about Breaking Bad. While the synopsis are the same, you could say that Breaking Bad is very American while My Home Hero is distinctly Japanese. Maybe that\'s a good thing, or maybe it\'s not.  Walter White is someone who initially starts off as a relateable or perhaps distressed old man that\'s concerned about the wellbeing of his family, but eventually becomes jaded, calculative, invective, and bitter. Yet, he is a largely multi-facted person that sometimes shows signs of being a good person, and at other times, a malicous monster. Tosu, on the other hand, is portrayed as ""only good."" Yes, he\'s a criminal that certainly killed someone, but on a very reasonable and relateable motive. Throughout the story, Tosu shows constant weakness, yet forges through for his family. He\'s constantly begging, being demeaned, getting his spirits crushed, but he perseveres. He feels extremely guilty at the things he has done and also feels regret at the irreversible situation he put himself and his family onto. Only at the immediate threat of his entire family being killed does Tosu act and do malicious acts. Walter White? Well, He is the danger, isn\'t he? Enough said.I could go on endlessly in an essay comparing the two--like Skyler and Jesse compared to Kyoichi and Kasen--but that would truly go on forever. The stories diverge quite quickly. Breaking Bad is messy. Many plot point involving different characters, and some which are outside of Walter\'s locus of control. Things progress at many different angles, and peoples\' motivations and personalities are more enignmatic. My Home Hero is much more concentrated. It\'s one single case over 48 chapters, or 12 episodes. The entirety of the show is only the course of a week, and it focuses it all on Tosu\'s meticulous planning, strategy, and improvisation when things go awry. Each character has their clearly defined roles, and it\'s more about the thriller and drama with a lot of monologuing from Tosu.  No complaints with me. I\'m satisfied with the meticulousness of the story documenting everything, while also making it believable, dramatic, and exciting at the end.The problem is the art direction. Never had I been so dissapointed with the sound, art, and storyboarding of a show that entirely depends on moodiness, pacing, and attention to detail. The voice acting is fine, but what really gets me is everything else. How do I say this? Everything is so bright. It\'s not dark when it needs to be, and when serious scenes happen, the paneling is so damn bright, animated poorly, or the soundtrack doesn\'t bring any suspense at all with the pacing of the scene. There are a platitude of serious scenes that involve a lot of emotion. I was especially dissapointed with Matori\'s emotional outburst, which in the manga, is executed very well. The scene from the manga jarringly takes the juxtaposition of Matori\'s supposed level-headedness and his actual mental state of mind into great effect. And while the manga is quite faithful in the adaptation, it\'s quite soulless. Facial expressions, too, are just not where it needs to be. And I\'m very biased since I watched Breaking Bad, but I\'d say that this type of show would be much better off in a live action. Nonetheless, the facial expressions aren\'t portraying enough emotion. People can be in life-threatening sitautions and it feels like each person\'s face is stoicThere\'s just not enough shading, detail, and love shown in any of the art. Eminence in the Shadows is a show that establishes a dark mood very well despite it being comedic in nature, and yet My Home Hero pales in comparison in its attention to detail and storyboarding. This is just me nitpicking a very mediocre or perhaps even below-average faithful adaptation. Since this show does faithfully adapt a good series, it gets a pass from me, but it could have been much more. I thought that in My Home Hero, everything goes a bit too well for Tosu. However, again, after reading garbage with an MC that has absurd plot armor did I realize that Tosu had luck that I could suspend my disbelief in.However, I digress. Let\'s talk about the actual story. A man of the household resorts to crime in order to ensure his family security. He goes on from being a very average husband to a ruthless criminal.

What would you do to stay by their side?Well my home hero asks this is question and answers it in an alright manner. Long story short Reika's  father finds out his daughter is being abused by her boyfriend and in a fight accidently kills said boyfriend.  This doesn't go well for him  since the boyfriend, nobuto, is the son of a man financing the yakuza and as a result yakuza members are looking for Nobuto.  Reika's dad obviously does not want to...fall into the clutches of the yakuza,so enlists his wife to help him decompose and get rid of the body if not plant it on someone else which they actually do later. Other than the planting part this is all fine and understandable. You can't honestly blame them for their actions this is up until the framing of kyoichi who while still a yakuza man, who did indeed threaten them, was only in the Yakuza to get money to help his mother after his father died under dubious and mysterious circumstances, we never find out whether kiyoichi's view point on what happened is true.  While it does make sense to leave the bag of bones and the tablet with kyoichi as he's the only yakuza member you can get to, what doesn't make sense is the reika's mother's response to leaving the bag with him. As in she has none, she just goes along with her husband's plan without a 2nd thought despite the fact that she didn't plant the evidence with kyoichi's mother because she emphasised with her love for kyoichi.  However when planting the evidence on kyoichi she has no issues planting it. How? Why no qualms about it?  Beyond that it honestly ends with no consequence to Reika's family, the only thing that might change that is the typhoon that caused landslides and mudflows that might bring the body to the surface.so yeah the show was okay.Characters:Kasen, Reika's mom, is pretty good at creating distractions  and this comes in handy when they get held hostage.  She a dutiful wife who is loyal to Reika's father which is all to protect their daughter.Tetsu is an average sales man who puts his deception skills to work when he frames kyoichi.  When his family is concerned he can relatively hold his own is a fight.

This adaptation has low production values and plenty of outsourcing. The composition is dull, the animation a slideshow, and everything about the visuals are unpolished and cheap. I doubt anyone was expecting this to be beautifully animated, but I at least hoped there would be better composition to help establish something resembling a mood; the pacing is also too quick for effective suspense. I don\'t see any significant inspiration from well-known noir or crime films or any artistry aside from the...bare essentials of drawn environments and generic characters to slide through them. On top of the shoddiness is stacked the modern conceit of using not just an everyman but also an unbearable doormat to be stepped on for our unlikely hero: if they call the more masculine noir hardboiled, and you have the ""softboiled"" goofball (often hipster and stinking like ganja) postmodern claptrap, then this is so beyond the pale that it might as well be called herbivore noir, in reference to herbivore men.I also suspect the source material for My Home Mediocrity isn\'t anything special. The adaptation feels like a cliche family drama with mind games against the yakuza: the same drivel you\'d see on Japanese or Korean live action TV; or a style over substance film like Oldboy, except My Home Wuss doesn\'t have any style! Another comparison might be to bland but mean-spirited films like Taken where some washed-up CIA boomer meathead goes toe-to-toe with traffickers to save his daughter—the intent being for the viewers to project their own protective instincts and revel in bouts of vicarious and cathartic vengeance. The main difference is My Home Pansy deals with two-bit yakuza, and the main character is a pencil-necked, limp-wristed, milquetoast high-fructose soybread man who wouldn\'t hurt a fly, which at least gives one hope that the main will have to be cunning to thwart the antagonists.My Home Twerp has the appearance of a teenage boy who gets dunked in the toilet + lines under the eyes to make him look older. You expect me to believe this milksop of a salaryman develops a spine and meticulously dispatches all of these vicious cold-blooded killers from the yakuza, many of whom have snuffed-out numerous people and brag about it in the first episode alone? Our protagonist, the timid Tetsuo, is probably meant as a nod to the young punk from Akira or the salaryman from Tetsuo: The Iron Man because both films (and the Akira manga) feature otherwise unremarkable characters going through immense transformations, but turning into a metal man or developing psychic powers is somehow less of a leap than My Home Eunuch growing a pair.The first episode is atrocious, hysterical, and encapsulates all the meager potential of the series, so there will be loads of My Home Spoilers (I don\'t have anything to say about episode 2, which is My Home Gardening and the equivalent of a YouTube composting tutorial, wiretapping 101, and how to be a shyster; highly informative episode): when he meets his daughter at a diner and sees bruises all over her face, he asks what happened, to which she responds, ""I fell down,"" and My Home Comedian has this great comeback where he\'s like, ""So how many times did you fall down? Three times? Four?"" I think it was supposed to be funny. The problem is that any humor after this point is unintentional. The absolutely hilarious joke is so good that it prompts his humorless and unlikable daughter to leave, and this downright pantywaist and softnoodle fopdoodle of a protagonist is wriggling like a worm as he grovels on the floor of the restaurant while begging his daughter to come back. Meanwhile, everyone looks at him with equal parts contempt and embarrassment.Similarly, in a later episode, the wife tells a riveting long-form story about a cat or something (it\'s to waste time, but they don\'t even call her out on it), and there are fantastic (???) lines like, ""Don\'t kill me, or I won\'t have a chance to finish the soap opera I\'m recording!"" Another set of brilliant psychological tricks My Home Clownshoes picked up from mystery novels, I guess... I really loved that story about the cat, though.Next, My Home Eavesdropper just so happens to run into a bunch of obnoxious yakuza, and these are not the suit and tie kind but the ones who dress like children or wear Hawaiian shirts. One of them boasts loudly so everyone on the block will hear him: ""Hehehe! Yeah, it\'s this girl, REIKA TOSU. Her dad\'s coming over today. He\'s about as old as My Home Sissy over there (winks). He might even be the same guy, but idgaf. I punched her a couple times and told her to say she fell down the stairs lol.

HYUCK HYUCK HYUCK.""My Home Invertebrate begins his role as accidental gumshoe, but then some bespectacled otaku comes up to him and is like, ""My Home Senpai, I need to have a word with you,"" and this otaku, who is also a yakuza, goes on to manhandle him in public while everyone is watching, drags My Home Pushover into a back alley, strips him nude, and blackmails him by taking... pictures of My Home Exhibitionist\'s widdler while he\'s sprawled-out in a rubbish bin with a glazed-over expression like a used-up boy toy from a back-alley BDSM yaoi hentai. Hell, much of the cover art even looks like My Home Manstress is having a nice post-coitus scream and cry session in the shower (look at the cover of the manga\'s first volume)!Otakuza: Hehehe! You\'d better do as we say, uh, or your My Home Dinky will go viral on the internet!My Home Nudist: No! You\'ll bring dishonor to my family! At least use a mosaic!Otakuza: Don\'t worry, My Home Millimeter (he holds up two fingers together and squints); I forgot the tweezers and macro lens at home (laughs).My Home Crybaby: (cries).My Home Fabulist lies about what happened when talking to his mommy—I mean, wife—on the phone, but he desperately wants her to mollycoddle him and then tell her about how the mean man ripped all his clothes off, blackmailed him, and proceeded to make emasculating insults, but instead he hangs up and cries. Cries, cries, and cries. Then cries some more. He cries about almost everything.In what would make for an easy Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon joke, My Home Nutcracker performs a laughable crotch punch (as if to equalize his shame) from inside the closet that sends Nobuto flying as if he were hit point-blank by a double-barreled shotgun in a Van Damme film, then caves the ruffian\'s head in with a crockpot. Nobuto has been beaten to a bloody pulp by this point, and when My Home Butcher\'s wife walks in, she\'s so casual that you\'d think her husband just squashed a bug. ""Don\'t worry, My Home Honey. Just clean up here, and we\'ll get lunch later."" I\'m expecting a plot twist where it turns out the wife is actually from a yakuza family or her father was a hitman or something, but I\'m not sticking around to find out. In contrast, it\'s not too surprising My Home Detective adapts to the situation quickly because he\'s a longtime fan of mystery fiction and having the chance to put this knowledge to use is the perfect spice for his midlife crisis and represents an opportunity to learn to stop bawling his eyes out all the time.All we get are Razor-thin characters getting themselves in and out of various ""suspenseful"" situations that are so rushed they\'re like the equivalent of Amazon workers having to use bottles in lieu of bathroom breaks and INTENSE My Home Cliffhangers at the end of every episode. If you\'re going to be such a pinchfart as to make an animation but not animate and make something so ordinary, maybe you should stick with adapting your work into a live action series instead, where My Home Cheapo belongs.

HYUCK HYUCK HYUCK.""My Home Invertebrate begins his role as accidental gumshoe, but then some bespectacled otaku comes up to him and is like, ""My Home Senpai, I need to have a word with you,"" and this otaku, who is also a yakuza, goes on to manhandle him in public while everyone is watching, drags My Home Pushover into a back alley, strips him nude, and blackmails him by taking... pictures of My Home Exhibitionist\'s widdler while he\'s sprawled-out in a rubbish bin with a glazed-over expression like a used-up boy toy from a back-alley BDSM yaoi hentai. Hell, much of the cover art even looks like My Home Manstress is having a nice post-coitus scream and cry session in the shower (look at the cover of the manga\'s first volume)!Otakuza: Hehehe! You\'d better do as we say, uh, or your My Home Dinky will go viral on the internet!My Home Nudist: No! You\'ll bring dishonor to my family! At least use a mosaic!Otakuza: Don\'t worry, My Home Millimeter (he holds up two fingers together and squints); I forgot the tweezers and macro lens at home (laughs).My Home Crybaby: (cries).My Home Fabulist lies about what happened when talking to his mommy—I mean, wife—on the phone, but he desperately wants her to mollycoddle him and then tell her about how the mean man ripped all his clothes off, blackmailed him, and proceeded to make emasculating insults, but instead he hangs up and cries. Cries, cries, and cries. Then cries some more. He cries about almost everything.In what would make for an easy Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon joke, My Home Nutcracker performs a laughable crotch punch (as if to equalize his shame) from inside the closet that sends Nobuto flying as if he were hit point-blank by a double-barreled shotgun in a Van Damme film, then caves the ruffian\'s head in with a crockpot. Nobuto has been beaten to a bloody pulp by this point, and when My Home Butcher\'s wife walks in, she\'s so casual that you\'d think her husband just squashed a bug. ""Don\'t worry, My Home Honey. Just clean up here, and we\'ll get lunch later."" I\'m expecting a plot twist where it turns out the wife is actually from a yakuza family or her father was a hitman or something, but I\'m not sticking around to find out. In contrast, it\'s not too surprising My Home Detective adapts to the situation quickly because he\'s a longtime fan of mystery fiction and having the chance to put this knowledge to use is the perfect spice for his midlife crisis and represents an opportunity to learn to stop bawling his eyes out all the time.All we get are Razor-thin characters getting themselves in and out of various ""suspenseful"" situations that are so rushed they\'re like the equivalent of Amazon workers having to use bottles in lieu of bathroom breaks and INTENSE My Home Cliffhangers at the end of every episode. If you\'re going to be such a pinchfart as to make an animation but not animate and make something so ordinary, maybe you should stick with adapting your work into a live action series instead, where My Home Cheapo belongs. For failing to utilize the medium in a worthwhile way, its final appellation is My Home Dropped.', ""I hear praise for this show everywhere, but I disagree with everyone who praises this show. I gave it three episodes and found out it really is not something I would enjoy, that is why I am dropping the show and leaving a negative review.My home hero gives me Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor vibes, especially in the third episode, I loved Kaiji, but this anime does not have the same effect, if you have seen Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor you know the feeling of sitting on the edge of your seat and being absolutely immersed in the plot, getting goosebumps from dramatic scenes and hoping for Kaiji...to get out of his current situation.

Rockman.EXE Stream,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2109/RockmanEXE_Stream,"['Rockman.EXE Stream is just a major disappointment. If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons like I did, you\'ll see what I mean. The animation and story both took a major dive in quality.The characters also take a dive in quality. While most of them are ok, Netto is one I found horribly mean-spirited and out of character in this season. He\'s always treating his childhood friend Meiru like she\'s not worth anything to him and that she\'s weak, all so he can ditch her for Jasmine, some random girl he just met.. He is also too stupid to tell the difference between Rockman and...a sadistic clone of him.Jasmine and Medi were the worst part of this anime, as they are incredibly boring characters who only exist to force in a cliche anime love triangle. They feel like some self insert OCs rather than actual characters and basically exist only to make Meiru and Roll jealous. Another character I hated from this anime was Slur. She wasn\'t even interesting as a villain, and has no sense of morals. (She actually thinks some little kid is ""evil"" and on the same level as a criminal...with basically no justification as to why she feels this way.) Don\'t even get me started on Dr. Regal...what were they even THINKING with the way they changed him? Or Baryl, who\'s suddenly a time traveler despite not being one in the games?There were some things I liked about this anime though. As you can expect from Rockman.EXE, the music is awesome. Many side characters are given a bigger role, and Napalmman.EXE\'s arc was really heartwarming. The ending, while confusing, did have a very nice message overall.

Saishuu Heiki Kanojo: Another Love Song,https://myanimelist.net/anime/609/Saishuu_Heiki_Kanojo__Another_Love_Song,"[""Going into this, I thought Saikano couldn't get any more depressing than it already had been.  I was promptly proved wrong.Another Love Song at first focuses on Chise's early days as the ultimate weapon, and follows her through just past the halfway mark of the actual series.  Scenes from the series are intercut throughout, just so you know where you are in the series when all this is happening, and it's a real help.  It also fills in some details that were missing in the series, so it was a nice touch.  I still would've liked them to explain the anime...ending, though.Added into all this is Lt. Colonel Mizuki, Chise's predecessor, who's being replaced by Chise, and is more or less her polar opposite.  She also shares a mind link with Chise.  So this means that not only do we get to watch her lose her humanity bit by bit and see its effects even more than in the series, we get to see how it happens mentally, and through the eyes of someone who's gone through it, and is only just starting to realize what's been done to her.  You also get to see how utterly heartless the top brass are with regard to these girls.   And it's absolutely depressing and heartbreaking, to watch all this, and it really kicks into high gear in the second episode of the OVA.The other love song of the title, which is between Mizuki and Tetsu, really takes a back seat to all of the former.  But it's a nice touch, on the side.The art isn't really all that different from the series at all, and neither is the music -- although they do have a new song that plays over the credits, and it's a nice little song.Now, excuse me, I'm going to go slit my wrists. ending, though.Added into all this is Lt.

This 2 part OVA succeeds in delivering that.This OVA introduces another character of the military side of the story, explaining (but also kind of making confusing) the military point of view in it's exploitation of the Ultimate Weapon and their justifications for doing so in the first place.So, my point is Shuuji and Chise's point of view -&gt; Military point of view = a very good thing.Bottom Line: Watch this if you've watched Saikano. "", '""Saikano: Another Love Song"", being a follow up to ""Saikano"" (duh!) was probably doomed to mediocrity at best before it even began. Comprising just two episodes, it would have been hard for this set of OVA\'s to turn around the bad impression that the series left me with.[Note: Contains possible spoilers for the main series since I\'m assuming that you\'ve seen it already if you\'re reading this.]Perhaps due to shadow of the aforementioned bad impression of the series, I couldn\'t really get into ""Another Love Song"". No surprise there, then. But what is surprising is how vast the improvement this OVA is on the series.For...starters, being an OVA, ""Another Love Song"" benefits from having better production values. The visuals are much improved, even to my untrained eyes. But ironically, the main thing that makes ""Another Love Song"" better isn\'t what it does, but what it DOESN\'T do - it doesn\'t repeat the series\' mistake of cramming in as many tragic scenes as it possibly can in an attempt to invoke emotions from the viewer. This makes the OVA\'s more believable than its predecessor... though that\'s hardly saying much.""Another Love Song"" introduces Mizuki, a crippled captain of the army (that\'s fighting that enemy who were never shown). More significantly, she is the prototype ""Ultimate Weapon"". Considering the original cast of ""Saikano"" consists of a bunch of angsty, irritating brats who were essentially puppets to the contrived story, Captain Mizuki is a welcoming addition, bringing a much needed air of maturity and sensibility. Her story fills in a lot of the details that were missing from the background of ""Saikano"". It\'s a job that needed doing badly, and it\'s a job the show does reasonably well. For example, it answers questions such as why Chise seems to be the only weapon of her kind (she isn\'t), and what was happening to her towards the end of the series.Of course, with only two episodes to play with, ""Another Love Song"" can only do so much. A lot of grey areas still remain - the sci fi is still mostly muddled, and the war unexplored. The story development, as much as it\'s smoother than the series, could have been better. Mizuki\'s change of attitude towards Chise seems sudden and groundless. The decision for the military commanders - who the anime was at pains to portray as cold and uncaring - to allow Chise to go to school and live like a normal girl is also baffling.Even though ""Another Love Song"" is short, it still found time to fit in yet another love triangle, one that feels like a tag on, like it was thrown in more for cementing its identity as a romance than any other purpose. Personally, I think the time could have been better spent filling in the ocean sized void in the story left by the series.

With his music playing, during well-directed - yet lacklusterly animated - scenes, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Even if you aren't interested in Persona, I'd suggest to just watch this for that fight scene.This special doesn't serve as much more than an introduction for a videogame - Persona 5, as you might have guessed - and logically we don't get a deep, nor resolved plot (we only see a short subplot). While the setting and themes are really interesting, the story (of the special) isn't much new. However, within 24 minutes...it does a good job establishing the characters - again, without too much depth.It definitely did what it was supposed to do: hype me up for Persona 5, which is coming out on February 14th in the west.

I hold it as a series dear to my heart. The series is a Japanese Role Playing game that follows its themes around demonic entities and mythology. Persona is a sub-series of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise that pretty much is just that but with a high school setting. In recent entries there have been the additions of social links and dating. The series has only recently gained a larger following as it\'s been very niche for quite some time until Persona 3...and Persona 4. It is still pretty niche but now with the advent of Persona 5 many newcomers are flocking to the series to experience the greatness of the Persona series for the first time. The series just keeps growing year by year.Now the ride to Persona 5 has been a tough and almost excruciating one. The game has been delayed a plethora of times thus giving off many red flags. All you Persona fans were aware of some of the crazy stuff that was going on with the game\'s release date. That, however, is a completely separate topic.  What I want to discuss today is the single episode 24 minute animated short for Persona 5. First things first, I\'d like to state that the short is very good. Honestly it\'s not enough to keep you occupied until the game is released(especially for us who are waiting on the release outside of Japan) but what I love about it is that it gives Persona 5 a more ""Shin Megami Tensei"" feel. That is, the modern Persona games are generally more lighthearted than the mainline Shin Megami Tensei games. Persona 1 and Persona 2 play very similarly to the early Shin Megami Tensei games on the NES and SNES. Heck, Persona 1 and 2 are related to a game named Shin Megami Tensei: If which is a spin-off of the original Shin Megami Tensei games. The newer Persona games are more cheery and not as dark as the early Persona and Shin Megami Tensei games. So when I see this I get pumped because I did not want another Persona 4 clone. Persona 4 is my least favorite in the series. I love the game but the other entries are just better in my opinion. The mood and tone that the short gave off were the selling point for me. It felt darker and more gloomy. A feeling Persona 3 and 4 did not give me.Now let\'s talk about the quality of the actual story and characters. It\'s very hard to say anything as this is just a 24 minute short and it\'s a standalone episode. The writing overall was done well. They really did a good job at trying to give fans an idea of what Persona 5 will be about.  All perspectives for each character were earned rightfully.  Plus Morgana is pretty cute... :DThe art and animation are very good. Very stylish approach and beautiful color palette. Honestly I give a lot of flack on the animation/art in newer anime and I have to say that is just gloriously animated. Everything about the animation is great. The battle scene in the short was also awesome and perhaps the peak of the animation. It was honestly the best looking piece of motion in the short.This music is just... wonderful! Jazz on crack is what I would describe it as. Persona and SMT games generally have good music but this is just fantastic. Really fits the mood well, even the gloomy portions which is strange to say but they manage to balance it out quite evenly.Overall, your enjoyment of this anime does not matter if you are a fan of the games or not. The animation, art style, and the music alone is just enough to sit down and watch this. It\'s just so jazzy and fashionable. And for those of you who are fans I highly recommend checking this out. This won\'t spoil for the game. If anything, it\'ll actually give you a glimpse of what the game will be like. September 15 for Japan and Valentine\'s Day for the Worldwide release.

It has its interesting points and a decent, if a predictable, twist. It certainly sets up a good atmosphere that never fully breaks, but that\'s about it. There\'s no real pay off in the end as it sets us back to the Velvet Room at the end, making it a ""possible"" path rather than one that we should just assume happens in the future game.The characters are alright, if you\'ve...been keeping up with the trailers. As a half hour OVA should, it wastes no time on introductions and goes right into the plot. There\'s certainly potential for the characters in the game, but they\'re rather one note in this OVA, to the point I\'d argue the trailers had more character to them.The sound and music, as expected of an Atlus product, is fantastic however. Most of the music is from the game (I\'m assuming, as it\'s in the trailers), and it fits well with the fast paced action they try to form. It\'s also just very nice to listen to in general.The animation however is extremely poor at times. Never to the point that I couldn\'t look at it, but definitely to the point that the impact of scenes was lessened. The best example of this is the Persona summoning scene. While the scene itself is very cool, showing the Phantom Thieves working as a team and showing off their powers, the animation is just too poor to leave the impact it was supposed to.Designs over all, also expected of an Atlus production, are amazing though. Characters look fantastic, powered or not, and the Personas look much better than Persona 3s and a bit better than Persona 2 and 4s in my opinion, especially Arsene  and Goemon and Kidd. The world they enter into seems much more interesting than the Midnight Channel, and possibly more than Tartarus, making me think more of that in SMTIII and IV, which is a very good thing. I\'m a bit disappointed that the enemies fought end up being generic demons instead of something unique. At the very least, while the grunts were immediately recognizable, I can\'t immediately place what the boss Demon is even though I know I\'ve seen it a few times, so it\'s less used at least.Overall, it was a decent OVA that did its job, it got me more excited for Persona 5.

The story...isn't astounding but it isn't bad it's for the most part throwaway but it isn't boring.Visit Limienerd/James Limie on youtube to see my Full Video Review isn't astounding but it isn't bad it's for the most part throwaway but it isn't boring.Visit Limienerd/James Limie on youtube to see my Full Video Review"", ""This anime is basically an advertisement/preview for Persona 5 and as such it does its job well. We get to see the characters in action along with how they access their new shadow realm (it's an app!) all with the beautiful art style and character designs developed for the game. The animation's not quite as good as that in the game, but it's still well above average. The plot is pretty basic and takes place within the game without ruining any of the plot for us. Apparently people can put in requests for help to the Phantom Thieves online. One guy, a lockpick and thief...who's unhappy with his life, goes onto this site and the team decides to investigate his case. They follow him around and do various investigatory things before deciding to take action. It's basically like one of the regular bosses in the game except abbreviated to the point of a subplot. In other words, the anime is rather narrow in scope. It works fine, especially when viewed as an extended trailer, and there are one or two twists to keep things interesting. And it reveals next to nothing about the main story. Characterwise it's also very much a teaser. We don't really get to know anything about the characters except that they seem to slavishly follow the lead's lead. They seem rather more sinister or angsty than in previous Personas but they're rarely given time to develop outside of plot exposition. And there's no time for such development either. The anime is pared to the bone.As a trailer this anime works very well. As a standalone episode it's less strong but still admirably clear for an introduction to the series. There's a lot we're not told but it's never allowed to come between us and our understanding of the plot. I'm very excited to play this game and the anime merely whet that excitement. It's limited in scope by necessity, but displays enough cleverness in telling a fairly simple story that the potential for greater stories is easy to imagine. who's unhappy with his life, goes onto this site and the team decides to investigate his case.

This is covering the anime for the new 5th installment (not counting Golden, FES, Persona 3 portable and the other spinoffs) in the Persona franchise which I love almost as much as I do PokemonFor those that don't know this is basically the special to showcase the gist of the new Persona 5 game WHICH YOU SHOULD ALL BUY!.....Kidding Kidding. I'm kidding don't take it seriously....Well don't take 30% seriously.....Moving On!anyway back on...point this is basically showing what the new group of protagonist in the Persona series will be doing in the game and honestly it alright. It's nothing stellar or groundbreaking, but it is worth a watch if you want to get more hyped.The story is alright but nothing great. It's is really just showing the kinda of stuff that will likely go on in the game and was just made to showcase it. The animation and character designs are pretty good for a special and the sound is alright. Characters were....alright but they'll likely be better in the game next year.Honestly I enjoyed this a lot. It got me more hyped for the game then I was before and I was pretty f'ing hyped. Anyway it's a worth a watch, hopefully any body that reads this reviews decides to watch and hopefully enjoys it. I also hope they make an anime series or do the movies with this thing when the game is released like they did with Persona 3 and Persona 4.With that being said I am out people.

Peace"", 'Honestly, i don\'t know why there are some many 7s or even 8s. This OVA is just one adaptation of one of the sidequest you can do in the game source (and a uninteresting one in my opinion). As a stand alone product it fails because you need to have played to game to understand it and as content for the players it\'s pretty boring because it focus too much on irrelevant characters and tries too hard to make the heroes looks cool without them doing anything remarkable until the only (and final) battle. By the way, the ending doesn\'t make any sense at all,...what was the point of that scene? Nothing, just a crazy reference out of nowhere.The animation is good (the baton pass is probably the highlight), nothing more than a few fails here and there but it\'s good overall. The music is hard to tell, it fits but at the same time it\'s weird to see the music from a game in an animation. The new characteres are boring, nothing more than archetypes and the ""villain"" is just an edgelord. I still could find enjoyment watching this because I played the game, but that\'s not an excuse for the product to be so mediocre in content. If you can only make an OVA and it\'s for fans of the game you can adapt one of the most popular moments of the game or do a quick introduction with an original history.Actually, i don\'t know why did I expect something more than mediocre from an anime based on a videogame. what was the point of that scene?

The music really did hold it up for me. I loved hearing those iconic tunes again. Tho i believe they could have used ""Rivers In The Dry Land"" or atleast don\'t have the really awkward cut of \'Last surprise"" in the ""Boss Battle""The review is still too short, so can I just start a discussion of...how much I love Akechi?

Sad he didn\'t get enough screen-time here. :/', 'Okay, why is this SINGLE episode of a Mementos Side Quest better than any of the garbage they put out for the actual anime?The Daybreakers special is not anything too climactic, or even exciting or interesting. It is an episode following a Mementos Request (essentially small-scale palace runs, if you played the game you would know), and basically a single battle showing how it all goes down.As someone who has played the game, it is (for lack of a better term) a deeper dive into how the PTs gain info on their Mementos target in order to confirm if the request on the Phan-Site is...legitimate or not. It was a nice way to give more insight on how the PTs do their business.But the one thing that stands out in this single episode over the entire series is the animation. Daybreakers has ACTUAL fighting (holy shit! what?). What I love about Daybreakers compared to what P5A has done is the quality of the fights. The fights feature the PTs doing more than ""summoning a persona just for that persona to shoot a ball of blue magic"" or some shit. The fight features animation; while not on par with top animes, is much more watchable and enjoyable than the fights in P5A. I also enjoyed the way they incorporated in-game mechanics like Baton Pass into the anime battle in such a way that makes the fight more cohesive.Other than that, even if P5A turned you off from watching any P5-related anime media, Daybreakers is a short, disconnected yet sweet experience that respects the content of the game it is based off of, while at the same time adding on some of the flair that animation without letting itself be confined by the straightforward and somewhat blandness of a JRPG system.8/10, huge recommend!P.S please play persona 5 royal, it\'s an amazing game that i swear goes on sale once every month, it\'s also available on xbox game pass! legitimate or not.

However this is probably the only good A-1 Pictures Persona 5 media.This here is the Day Breakers. This is an adaptation of one of the Mementos quests from around the Casino portion of the game. This however expands on it to give a good idea on what the game is all about. This has no real bearing on the plot, however it does set up a good spot to get comfortable with before you start the game....The Story: Pretty barebones as it is just to sell the concept of the game, and is based on an optional sidequest. Basically this dickbag named Naoya is a total asshole to his brother Kazuya who gets so angry, he posts on the PHAN-SITE to change the heart of Naoya. Basically Akira, Ryuji, Ann, and Yusuke along with the not a cat Morgana go into the metaverse to steal the malice in Naoya's heart. This does expand on the quest actually showing more of what is happening in the game so that's pretty sweet. It gets a 7/10 as it does what it needs to do, and does it well enough.The Art: HOO BOY! Yusuke isn't a fan of the art in this and neither am I. Comparing the work of A-1 who did this OVA and the anime to Production IG's beautiful charmingly animated cutscenes from the videogame, the A-1 version doesn't really look very good. Characters are a bit off model at times, and the movement is a bit too janky. Compare that to the smooth, and crisp visuals in the game it's based on, and you have a problem. I'll give A-1 a 6/10 for at least trying, as some scenes look kinda nice.Sound: The sound is top notch! All the music is ripped straight from the game, composed by Meguro Shoji. All the vocals heard are done by Lyn. The songs both instrumental and lyrical have amazing composition, and that's a given, being from one of 2016/17's best games. All the voice acting is top notch too, as all characters retain their game voices. The new voices also fit in well, and flesh out the universe as now we know what Naoya and Kazuya sound like. PERFECT 10The characters are from the game except you don't get to know them on a deep personal basis, you just get an idea which is the point, and they are great characters once you know them so here's an 8/10. Also Naoya and Kazuya's names are a reference to the Toudou brothers from Persona 1. Except Kazuya was the bad one in P1.This promo anime gets an 8/10 for being a well made teaser that I watched after seeing the game in action, but having seen the action some of the substance is gone, but it's fine here being a teaser.

Because of this, I continued my journey through Persona 5 Strikers, Persona Q2 and Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight. It wasn\'t enough. I read the three Mementos Mission mangas, kept returning to the game\'s fantastic OST, and watched nearly every ""hot take"" video essay on YouTube. Eventually, I ended up watching this OVA. While it did not take my heart, it did help me move on to different forms of entertainment.Now, the above is not to say that I did not enjoy The Day Breakers....It is a pleasant, little snack before (or after) one dives into the full main course that is Persona 5. It introduces its beloved cast in a way that aims to spark curiosity in those who are still to play the game, and a sense of familiarity in those who\'ve already done so. While not too remarkably animated - besides one particular fight scene - it does present its viewers with a solid story featuring ""rotten adults"" and teens, struggling to find their way amidst societal woes.I would suggest this OVA to anyone that, like me, finds it hard to say goodbye to Leblanc\'s coffee and Shoji Meguro\'s astonishing tunes. People that are curious to jump into the 200-hour frenzy that is Persona 5 might also be attracted to this short introduction. In case you have little affinity with Persona ór are in need of a deep, complex storyline and matching visuals: look elsewhere.

Riding Bean,https://myanimelist.net/anime/917/Riding_Bean,"[""Riding Bean is one of Kenichi Sonoda's early works, and though it was originally planned as a series, only one episode was ever released.The anime follows the exploits of the legendary courier &quot;Bean Bandit&quot; (a truly unfortunate moniker), and his partner Irene Vincent. They are framed for the kidnapping of a wealthy heiress, and are subsequently hunted by the police and various other parties.The art and animation of Riding Bean is quite typical of it's time, and bears a resemblance in places to the style of Lupin and Giant Robo. Riding Bean does however have something that sets it aside - the chases. Very few...animes are able to convey the feeling of a high speed pursuit, and Riding Bean is amongst the best.The sound is of a very good quality, and all the gearheads (a.k.a. car fanatics) out there will love the roar of the engines in the anime.Riding Bean has some memorable characters, and ironically enough, the most memorable is not Bean Bandit. It is in fact, the cars. The Bean Bandit drives a customised sports car called &quot;The Roadbuster&quot;, and if you're like me (in other words, you like cars and racing), then you'll understand me when I say I WANT THAT CAR! If you watch the show, you'll understand why. I watched the showed at the young and impressionable age of 14, and The Roadbuster has been flitting around in my head ever since.On the flip side, the police also have a car with which to hunt Bean Bandit - the Shelby Cobra GT500 **drools**One other thing that needs mentioning is the character of Irene Vincent. I hope the name sounds familiar because Kenichi Sonoda later evolved her character into the famous Rally Vincent from Gunsmith Cats.This is an enjoyable romp through the streets of Chicago, and the chases are truly memorable. If you're a fan of classic anime, or better yet, a fan of Gunsmith Cats, then this is a must watch. If you like action and adrenalin, then Riding Bean is well worth viewing.If you're after romantic comedies, slice of life, etc, then this may not be to your tastes, but it never hurts to give it a try :)Riding Bean is effectively a prequel (and dare I say - a pilot), of the legendary Gunsmith Cats, but it is just as enjoyable as GC. The chemistry between Bean Bandit and Irene Vincent is marvellous, and Inspector Percy is a hoot.I found Riding Bean to be fast paced and highly enjoyable. The mixture of action and comedy is just about right for me, and I've rarely seen chases that match the ones in this show. animes are able to convey the feeling of a high speed pursuit, and Riding Bean is amongst the best.The sound is of a very good quality, and all the gearheads (a.k.a. car fanatics) out there will love the roar of the engines in the anime.Riding Bean has some memorable characters, and ironically enough, the most memorable is not Bean Bandit.

It's silly trashy fun. The dub in this is beautifully bad purely because the main character who has a very enjoyably tricked out car has zero charisma. The dubbing of Percy, his arch rival, is a riot though. Percy is the over the top police detective obsessed with catching our hero, The Road Buster!!! The Road Buster (aka - Bean Bandit) does criminal underworld driving jobs and trashes many police cars every time. This anime has a strong sense of fun to it. Percy is especially fun, but take time to enjoy the...ridiculous things Bean does, like the taser bit, or the drinking coffee from the coffee machine (if my memory serves correctly). Express disbelief! That's all in the fun of this show.The car chases and stuff are fun. There's even a mission impossible vibe with one aspect of the anime, which is great fun because it's so ridiculous.The plot is weak but it serves its purpose well. One link in it is especially difficult to go along with. But whatever. It's 45 minutes, so I'm happy they cut out the crap and go straight to the good stuff - the action! Come to think of it, there's one point at the end where a brand new baddie turns up declaring that they're 'desperate enough at this stage' and its like, who the hell are you?This anime gets ridiculous at the end. Roll with it. Understand that this was meant to be the pilot for a series, so presumably it had justifications for the direction it goes in. Sit back and enjoy. Seriously, just roll with it. It is what it is.There's a bit of partner abuse and lolita-ish stuff thrown in there. So, beware if these are things that put you off.That aside, my recommendation is to watch this being aware that it sucks, but it very enjoyably sucks and actually on its own terms totally doesn't suck.

But if there was one, it\'d probably be something similar to ""Riding Bean"" (okay, I concede ""Initial D"" might be a more obvious choice, but I haven\'t seen that yet).""Riding Bean"" is about cars. Cars, gangsters, and more cars, to be exact. All the action centralises around fast and furious car chases down the highway, or the main character (nicknamed ""Bean Bandit"") doing some incredible things with his incredible sports car (named ""Roadbuster"" - you just know it\'s a badass car because it has a name) to get him out of...what seem to be impossibly tight spots. The action is very satisfying for the most part, but does get a little *too* over the top - by the end, this Bean Bandit guy was dishing out carnage comparable to Superman.While ""Riding Bean"" is an action heavy OVA, the story is surprisingly clever, as it has more than its expected share of twists and turns that kept me guessing what was going to happen next. That said, the story is sometimes compromised by the OVA\'s appetite for over the top action. For example, I\'d hardly think people who are attempting to get hold of a captive from a car would resort to shooting the car with anti-tank guns in order to try and stop it.On the animation side of things, ""Riding Bean"" does well with its great action sequences. However on the negative side, there\'s something weird about some of the character designs that I can\'t quite put my finger on. Perhaps it\'s that ginormous chin sported by the Bean Bandit... I just can\'t get over it.I gathered from other reviews that ""Riding Bean"" is considered the prototype of ""Gunsmith Cats"", as the two share the same creator. I can certainly see the resemblence in the style and setting (as well the fanservice), and in fact, the two both feature the character Irene ""Rally"" Vincent (something that I didn\'t pick up at the time). The general consensus seems to be that ""Gunsmith Cats"" is superior to ""Riding Bean"", but I have to disagree. I thought that ""Gunsmith Cats"" feels a bit stale, and does not really standing out in anyway. On the other hand, while there are times when it seems like ""Riding Bean"" doesn\'t quite know what it wants to be (at one point I thought it was gonna go down the perverted path, but the moment passed without amounting to anything), it has a much more nifty plot and action that gets the adrenalin pumping a lot faster.

For those tasks he used his bullet proof modern sports car and performs his missions without fail.The story was pretty entertaining, sometimes silly but in a positive way at that. And was good for this genre of anime. The animation was very good and you can see that it had a good financing backing the project. The character were all consistent, except a slight fail...that remained unexplained that happened near the end and concerned Bean, other than that good work.Unfortunately this OVA is one of those that leaves the impression of a first episode of a series.

As a reviewer… I have to nit pick. The problem with that is that the story is really very good and I believe it has the workings of becoming a whole series is the Manga-ka Kenichi Sonoda had not had a falling out with the studio. After the OVA was created, Kenichi created the manga and the manga ‘Gunsmith Cats’ where Rally Vincent was the star though her design was altered.Anyway, going back to the story, it’s pretty awesome in how...it shows the action scenes and everything. It feels like an American made movie more then just an anime with how many guns and vilence is in the show. It starts out with Bean being the get away driver for a bunch of thieves and then ends him being the hero of the show. It’s not making him an anti hero and has him as a regular guy getting money. He actually is rather strong, almost like Superman strong as he had picked up the front end of a car and also rammed his fingers into the metal door of the car to rip the door right off its hinges. Rally on the other hand doesn’t really do much in the show although she is a quick shot. The only thing I really noticed her doing when she didn’t have a gun in her hand was tell Bean to keep cool or try and take care of the little girl.Going onto the cops side, the cops are damn idiots and Detective Percy should be placed into a mental hospital. Seriously, Percy is infatuated with trying to catch Bean at all cost and goes crazy when he thinks he can. He is the definition of a bumbling detective who gets into a hell of a lot of trouble but I guess I have to give him being smart enough to actually not get fired from his job. The cops don’t help the matter, always crashing into things or sounding like complete idiots or children as in the the small chant they do close to the end of ‘Bean, come out and play’ thing. And yet, in that all that’s said and done, it seemed to sort of fit to me.The animation becomes really sloppy at some points, using many speedlines and odd movements that feel a bit stiff. The times that it doesn’t have these problems though, they are ether still shots or some very detailed action scenes. The eating habits are rather laughable though. It’s very exaggerated as though the animators had no clue how to show them eating so they slowed them down and made rather huge mouths. It becomes almost discusting at how they did it. Bean was designed rather interestingly with a little to large of canines making him look rather beastly.The English voices are laughable at most, feeling mostly stale at the most intence times. It’s as though they were reading a script rather then playing the part. The words really don’t feel like they fit the mouth movements and sometimes the characters move their mouths when no one is talking. The only one that seems alright is Percy and he shouts almost every other sentence. The little children also seem to shout as though they can’t be heard any other way. Dispite that, the people that were picked to play the parts were actually what I would see for the type of voices coming from the characters. If they acted a bit more then shouted, it would have been even better.I think everyone should at least watch this one once. Even with the flaws, the show is rather action pact and won’t leave you bored. Because of the flaws, the times that it does go into a slow pace, they feel a bit comedic and the script can be rather tounge and cheek at points. it shows the action scenes and everything. It feels like an American made movie more then just an anime with how many guns and vilence is in the show. It starts out with Bean being the get away driver for a bunch of thieves and then ends him being the hero of the show. It’s not making him an anti hero and has him as a regular guy getting money.

With a 46-minute runtime, it delivers an intriguing plot with a decent, yet open-ended conclusion, and doesn’t overstay its welcome or get stale. The character designs are nice to look at, the animation and voice acting are decent, and the all-English soundtrack is pleasant. It takes place in Chicago, which is kind of unusual for an anime, and that, paired with the music, gives this OVA a distinctly “American” feel that only a few other anime I’ve seen have managed to accomplish.Similar plots have been done before, but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun to...see it play out, with all of the colorful car chases and gunfights, the larger-than-life antihero protagonists, and wacky twists and turns. The villains are a bit “too” evil, though, which kind of tempers my enjoyment of the OVA and gives me tonal whiplash. The main villain, in particular, can be hard to watch; she is manipulative, and gaslights and abuses the young girl working with her.There is also a fair amount of unnecessary fanservice that has nothing to do with the plot, and it seems kind of forced in there. And we also get a scene where the young girl working with the main villain offers to “help” a man they kidnapped use the bathroom, which is disturbing.Since this is just a one-shot OVA, the characters’ backgrounds and motivations are barely explained, and I’m left with more questions than answers. For instance, why is Bean so strong that bullets bounce off of him? Why are he and Rally partners, and why exactly do they do what they do? Are they criminals? They live in a big city with such a distinctive car, so why do the police have trouble finding them? How do the villains’ disguises work so well? Why does Bean stuff a bunch of nuts into his mouth before he goes on a vehicular rampage? Things like that.Overall, although the villains’ actions, meaningless fanservice and lack of background hamper this OVA, it’s a fun “America-in-an-alternate-universe”-style action romp that is worth a watch. see it play out, with all of the colorful car chases and gunfights, the larger-than-life antihero protagonists, and wacky twists and turns.

Riding Bean was the precursor to my last review, Gunsmith Cats, and even contains Rally Vincent as a secondary character. But unlike Gunsmith Cats, Riding Bean kind of sucks.In what I assume is Chicago, Bean is a courier who, along with his partner Rally, get framed for kidnapping a young girl while the actual kidnappers take her father hostage and steal the ransom money. In a fit of testosterone laden action, Bean...takes out his anger on the actual kidnappers, a woman and an eleven year old girl.What’s instantly noticeable is the violence is a lot more graphic than Gunsmith Cats, somewhat pointlessly too. We’re given to believe that this is going to be a show focusing on shoot-outs but by the end of the forty-five minute episode, Bean is basically using sheer strength to lift cars and wears bulletproof everything to keep him invincible. As usual, the godliness of the main character means the action has no drama to it and instead comes across as silly. So the earlier, realistic violence is cast aside for the cartoonishness of Superman.But it’s not just the action that’s silly. The music is pure eighties cheese, the kind of background noise you’d expect in Commando. Then there’s the dialogue, which is pretty awful, and the voice acting, which is bad too.A moment of terrible dialogue comes with the maid service from the loli who gives the kidnapped father a hamburger and asks if he takes mustard with it. American maids are cool! But then she decides to suck his dick which he doesn’t take too kindly to. He slaps her away and she takes a knife threatening to cut his dick off. To which he responds that a little girl shouldn’t do that! If the anime had just been this forty-five second scene, it would have been a perfect ten for giving me a good laugh.Bean himself is like a Schwarzenegger character. He’s ultra-strong, can’t be defeated, and has the speech capacity of Austria’s favorite son. As for Rally, she’s not at all like her counterpart in Gunsmith Cats and suffers from being too one-dimensional.The bad guys and other characters are not even slightly memorable.What this adds up to is an unintentionally funny show that’s God-awful in nearly every regard aside from the animation. Riding Bean is stupid, underwhelming, and you won’t benefit from a viewing. takes out his anger on the actual kidnappers, a woman and an eleven year old girl.What’s instantly noticeable is the violence is a lot more graphic than Gunsmith Cats, somewhat pointlessly too.

If you have ever experienced Gunsmith Cats, this is like that—ramped up to two-hundred! Half-naked girls, explosions, crazy car chases, the fetishization of rare guns, and much more! Since this is a forty-six minute OVA, there will be spoilers! You have been warned!•\tBean Bandit and his voluptuous friend, Rally, are professional getaway drivers. In the first scene we are already exposed to Bean’s badass nature as he chases a bunch of robbers down in his custom Porche chassis (with Corvette ‘Stingray’ machinery)! Bean is...invincible—he gets caught in a hail of bullets, has a searing hot frying pan placed on his face, and even gets shot in the head without much damage! The most that ever ails him is the shot to the skull gives him a cross-eyed, Looney Toons expression for a couple of minutes but, then, he’s perfectly fine!•\tBean is a bonafide, badass, manly man to an absurd degree. It’s never actually revealed why Bean is immortal—maybe he’s has a cyborg body, maybe he’s Frankenstein’s monster, but the OVA is so captivating that the audience doesn’t really care, he’s just Bean. Speaking of impossibilities, the car physics and functionality are absurd. In an interview, Ken'ichi Sonoda claims that all of the high tech gadgetries in Bean’s car were feasible at the time of the manga’s release (1988) but it would be a stretch to say that those car mechanics would be possible now, thirty years later!•\tAfter being duped by a malicious master-of-disguise, Semmerling—it is revealed that the kidnapping of the child of the Grimwood estate, was actually just an excuse to abduct her father, Mr. Grimwood, and use him as a hostage. This leads to an intense, high-speed chase: Bean chases after Semmerling in her BMW 750iL, while Percy (the police chief, more or less a carbon copy of Zenigata from Lupin III) chases after Bean in his 1967 Shelby Cobra GT-500KR. At the beginning of the film, Percy brags, like a doofus, about his badass car but then it gets utterly destroyed in the car chase! His sensible sidekick, Dick, is just a passenger to Percy’s absurd shenanigans. Finally, Semmerling realizes that she can’t beat Bean (even if she runs him over with a car) and accidentally kills herself (via immolation). Mr. Grimwood and his daughter are reunited, Semmerling’s sex-trafficked sidekick is finally free, and it’s a happy ending.•\tThe level of coolness is intensified by the swooning blues soundtrack that the OVA breaks out during its intense moments; there are A LOT of them, Bean’s car is even shot with an anti-tank rifle! The animation is incredible for its time, the animation of the bullets hitting the cars, the POV shots of the highway, and dynamic tech tricks with Bean’s Porsche were out of this world! The pacing is great, every moment is exciting, especially in the last half!•\tOverall, this OVA is a wild ride: thrilling, a visual spectacle that everyone should watch at least once. I think that Bean was stronger as a protagonist than, the other, Rally from Gunsmith Cats but Sonoda has admitted that Bean was ‘a guy [that he] could identify with much more personally.’ Fortunately, there was a ‘Bean Bandit Project’ officially announced on May 18th, 2018—that is purportedly going to be a sequel to Riding Bean! This OVA is definitely a gem, I rate it a 7.5/10.•\tNOTE: I watched the Riding Bean with the original Japanese audio. I have seen a lot of negative comments about the English dub, so it’s probably best to avoid it. invincible—he gets caught in a hail of bullets, has a searing hot frying pan placed on his face, and even gets shot in the head without much damage!

It's a little schlocky 80s action OVA that I only watched because it's attatched to Gunsmith Cats... and it's not that particularly exciting. But here's the thing, the crappy english dub elevates this to a whole another level of schlock. The protagonist sounds like a tool, the antagonists sound absolutely ridiculous, the side characters are all trying so hard. ''I'll have a stawbewy ice-cweam and miwk''. All of it, accidental brilliance, and I doubt I would've enjoyed this OVA nearly as much in its original form. So props to you dub team, you crazy bastards. You...fucking did it. fucking did it."", ""This film aged extremely well, in my opinion. Try watching it in HD.Don't watch it dubbed though. I listened to about 10 minutes of the dub, laughed, and switched to sub.The story is really straightforward and easy to follow, and the premise is also really easy to pick up. The 80s action movie vibes in the film are very strong, but I think it was executed well -- nothing too cliche. It didn't feel contrived, even though you had over-the-top action sequences. Furthermore, I really liked the characters. I think it was a nice contrast to have the anti-hero being sensitive regarding children and...the antagonist being the direct opposite. I found myself being reminded of Lupin the III, which also has the cliche of an anti-hero being endlessly chased by an officer of the law.Despite having over the top action, the animation wasn't hard to follow. I knew what was going on the entire time, which I can't say for animation I've seen in a lot of vague mecha showsOverall, it's a very enjoyable film. the antagonist being the direct opposite.

Only clocking in at 46 minutes, it is impressive how much was able to be crammed in.  The OVA is mostly non stop action featuring car chases and shootouts but does spend some time to develop some character motivations.  The animation is well done and does not feel dated.  The music fits well within the setting and makes the overall experience more enjoyable.

Too bad Kenichi Sonoda and Toshiba EMI had a falling out so there were no more episodes.Based on Bean's fast and smooth driving skills, it's obvious that they get away again in the end. His sunglasses flying off when he angrily ate those walnuts back at the mansion when his car was insulted was hilarious.I never saw The Warriors but I loved the reference at the end.The part where Rally throws her magazine while keeping one in the chamber to kill the henchman taking Chelsea hostage was badass.I wonder...if Bean knows how to use a gun and if he's the type to use one.

Sometimes they clear their names if they're framed for something they didn't do. Maybe they can show Bean doing more knife fights or hand-to-hand combat. I'm cool with Percy being forced to team up with Bean while Bean is enjoying pushing Percy's buttons.When kids are involved in the situation, both Bean and Rally do their best to care for the kids and make them happy which is one of the factors of bringing the 2 closer together. Maybe they can show more of their domestic life where they take turns cooking and doing chores.They can also explain how Bean got his bulletproof jacket, his superhuman strength and maybe his bulletproof headband with how his head resisted Semmerling's bullet.

A fun story with well-animated action scenes and a good supporting soundtrack. It was a good time, but issue is it felt ""just alright"" to me. Was it bad? No. Was it great? No. It was fun, but I could see myself forgetting about the movie in a day or two as there wasn\'t anything that stood out to me.Well, there was one thing that stood out to me, but not in a great way. SPOILER ALERT, but I personally felt the final confrontation was a bit out...of left field. Essentially, the whole film Bean has succeeded by using his driving skills and quick reflexes. However, in the final confrontation with the main antagonist he decides to turn into a super strength human like Kenshiro to win the fight. It was somewhat entertaining, but it pulled me out of the experience more than anything. Imagine if in a Kaji movie, a series focused on a main character who wins through whits and gambling knowledge, Kaiji wins the final confrontation with the CEO of shady gambling by a fist fight.

Sanzoku no Musume Ronja,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22359/Sanzoku_no_Musume_Ronja,"['It is hard to not make a biased review of this show if you are from Sweden, which I am. ""Why?"" you may ask.This show is based on the story ""Ronia the robbers daughter"" (Ronja rövardotter), written by one of Swedens most beloved author Astrid Lindgren and made into a movie in 1984 by Tage Danielsson. The movie by Tage Danielsson is one of the top 10 most watched movies in Sweden. Even today it is impossible to escape this movie if you grow up in Sweden.Because of this swedes will ether hate or love this show. I personally is biased towards loving it....Therefore, If I were to make a complete review, it would probably be an awfully lot of text, ending with a strong recommendation to go and watch this show now. I will however only talk about some things I find especially worth mentioning about this show.In my opinion the show manage to do the original story justice.The series faithfully follows the book, takes some inspiration from Tage Danielssons movie while adding the well known Ghibli flavor to it. The result is original and nostalgic at the same time.The series is slow paced and really spends time fleshing out the characters. Don\'t expect any fast-paced action-filled adventure. This series likes to take its time and let the moments sink in. While watching this I have noticed things about the story, characters and environment I never thought about in the original.When it comes to bizarre creatures, Studio Ghibli are masters. This story contains some strange creatures which is depicted in a very Ghiblish way. The most successful one in my opinion being the Harpies. These evil birdlike creatures was meant to be scary in the original story. Tage Danielssons version of them may be scary if you are a 6 year old child. But the Ghibli Harpies gives me goosebumps every time I see them.The animation is done with CGI, which is unusual for a Ghibli production. Sadly it makes some scenes look a little bit too synthetic. In other scenes they have manage to squeeze in enough filler animation in between everything to makes the characters feel more organic and alive.When I first started watching the series I had some problems accepting the CGI animations. I had hoped for a classic hand-drawn Ghibli production. But I guess this was the tradeoff they had to do to make it a 26 episode series.After a couple of episodes however I stopped noticing it.For most people I think the animation is where this show will stand or fall. Its not bad, but its not what you would expect.Some will probably find the protagonist Ronja to be a little annoying in the first 3 or 5 episodes. While she is out exploring the world she finds even the simples things in the forest very amusing. She is constantly laughing intensely at everything. This is a passing phase and won\'t be that extreme the whole series.Now go and watch this show!

The main reason is that as a swede I grew up watching the live-action version of this story, based from the children’s book by Astrid Lindgren. So rather than fight the inevitable, I wish to dedicate this review to comparing the two adaptions.The animation is what one notices first as it is far from the usual. With a 3D-style that looks like it came straight out of a video-game, Ronja the Robber’s Daughter has a very different look, which may or may not scare some...people off, though I would say that one gets used to the 3D rather quick.Nature plays a large role in the series, to the point that one could almost call it its own character. Thanks to its amazing backgrounds you can’t help but admire the atmosphere. If you ever need to convince someone to go out camping, show them an episode or two of this. The one aspect that it lacks though is variety, while the live-action version portrays nature both as something beautiful and something that could easily kill you with its overwhelming power, the anime has a tendency to go for nothing but cuteness.The story is intact and when it arrives at the more memorable scenes it manages to portray them well. The main problem comes from how stretched out it is. This series told a story in 26 episodes that could have been told in 12. Many episodes can literally be skipped as they involve nothing but pointless filler. While it is a Ghibli-production and one should go in expecting a lot of slice-of-life elements, I can’t help but feel that it worked against it more than in its favor this time.When comparing the characters in each adaption I found the live-action version to be better. The dialogue in the anime tends to come off robotic and unnatural, which is a consequence of translating the story a bit too literally. The way that Ronja smiles and giggles constantly at the slightest thing nearly drove me nuts at times, and her father Mattis was portrayed as far less of an unstable and dangerous man, and more like a screaming drama-queen. Where I will say it caught me off guard was toward the end, where the characters start to reflect on what has been done and what their future holds. The father-daughter relationship comes to a good climax, and Ronja’s make-believe brother Birk in particular was developed in a way that gave me chills.Overall, Ronja the Robber’s Daughter is a dragged out and cutesified version of the original story. Fans of Ronja are better off rewatching the live-action version or reading the book. It does however offer great art, a decent ending, and a few great scenes in between. If you are a big fan of slice-of-life or Ghibli this will be an okay watch. people off, though I would say that one gets used to the 3D rather quick.Nature plays a large role in the series, to the point that one could almost call it its own character.

I had the highest expectations about it because it was the first animated series made by Studio Ghibli, even knowing that was used digital resources on it.To begin with it, the story is based on the book written by a swedish writer named Astrid Lindgren, and tells us the tale of Ronja, daughter of Mattis (a bandit leader) and Lovis, his wife. She lives at the Mattis\'s Fortress (originally Mattisborgen), which consists on a abandoned castle, split in half by a thunderbolt that struck it on the day Ronja was born. After the storm, the rival bandit clan,...Borka\'s Thieves, takes half of the fortress. Some time later, Ronja meets Birk, Borka\'s son, and they become friends, even against their fathers will. When the clash between the clans gets worse, Ronja and Birk decide to leave the fortress, starting to live together within a cave hidden in the forest.Mattis\'s desire to retrieve his little girl makes him ask for a truce with Borka, reducing the rivalry between the clans a little bit. The book consists on a parable about affection and conflicts at childhood between father and daughter, the discovery of love and independence, the wisdom of a life side by side with the nature and tolerance, at a broad sense. It was translated to a bunch of different languages, and it is an international success.You can notice that the art is a bit different than Hayao\'s designs, because Goro decided to bet on digital resources (while Hayao preferred to draw all Ponyo\'s scenaries by hand, for example) on his animations. But that\'s not a real problem, considerating that he was the director of Tales from Earthsea or Kokurikozaka kara, that we all know how awesome it was.The synopsis of the animations seems a little more fanciful than the book\'s, but the essence is the same: Ronja is the only and loved daughter of Mattis, who\'s a good hearted leader of a colorful and funny group of bandits, that lives on a huge castle at the forest. Ronja was born while a storm was raging, but her personality is cheerful and loving. And much like her father, she has a good heart, but at the same time, is a reckless girl. She starts to study the misterious creatures that live at the forest, meeting other children and then, starts to question her father\'s behavior.Polygon Pictures is a 3D CG partner of Studio Ghibli on the series. It will be the first time that Goro Miyazaki will be running an animated series for television. Satoshi Takebe (from ""From Up on Poppy Hill"") will be the responsible for Ronja\'s soundtrack. And that\'s fabulous, I love him!Sanzoku no Musume Ronja or ""Ronja - Daughter of the Thief (or Robber)"" have a captivating cast and a promising story.To me it looks so awesome as any other story coming from Studio Ghibli, and I was waiting for months until the series went out. And, if you want to know, I really loved the first five episodes. The story follows the original plot, the characters are incredibly sympathetic, the music is nice and the scenarios are gorgeous. The harpies from story are scary and the interpretation of the ""wolf song"" was great. I\'m not the kind of people who dislikes 3D animation, although I saw some people complaining about it. Probably because I sincerely trust the Studio, and I will for sure keep watching this series!Futhermore, Ronja and Birk are also cute together... Even giving me agony for being too naive or jumping off cliffs as if they were jumping out of bed.Story: 9Its funny, but sometimes it becomes a little... Weird. Especially Mattis. But Ronja\'s momma always save it.Art: 9I think it\'s really cool, like I said before. When you get used with the 3D effect, you will find it awesome too.Sound: 10The songs are beautiful and clean. Even as a musician, I really have nothing to complain about.Character: 9They are nice, even if sometimes the adults look a little childish and the kids too adult.Enjoyment: 9It\'s a funny and loving story. It seems to get better and better. I hope it continues this way.Overall: 9Give it a chance, guys! I said it was cute so many times, but I really think it is!

I said it was cute so many times, but I really think it is!', ""I had high expectations for this anime for two reasons: It's animated by Studio Ghibli and it's based on an awesome novel I like a lot. The anime maybe didn't live up to all my expectations, but it was a very enjoyable watch. It's a sweet and cute anime with a good and occasionally very deep storyline with enough humor and some moments that can be even frightening and cruel.I had difficulties getting used to the CGI animation used with the characters and that was the main disappointment to me. Although after a few episodes it wasn't something that was constantly distracting me, I was...paying attention to it throughout the series. On the other side, the background art was very beautifully excecuted and the forest felt fresh and real.The series is very relaxed and for some people the slow pacing might be a negtive issue. For me, however, the slow pacing worked well. Both the characters and the watcher were given time to enjoy the nature and the atmosphere and get into the mood of the series. I also found the pacing to be nothing forced or strained - the series developed on its own momentum and nature was given a large part just as it has in the original novel.Although the series is most of the time quite childish, the themes are mature. I was surprised how well the more serious scenes were executed. Also the way the children's feelings are portrayed is wonderfully natural and sweet.So, overall it's not perfect and the CGI is a drawback, but neverthless it is very good and especially suitable for someone who enjoys a good storyline and atmosphere in a relaxed pacing. paying attention to it throughout the series.

I was initially worried about the CGI-animation of the characters, but got used to it pretty quickly. It is very nicely done and gets you thinking about Zelda: The Wind Waker\'s art. Even if I still would have prefered a traditionally animated interpretation of the story, I don\'t think this is something that should stop people from giving this series a fair chance. And the background paintings is extremely good looking, it truly is a feast for the eyes to see swedish nature depicted in this way!With as much as 26 episodes the series gets a long time to adapt the...book in a fair way, which it does from beginning to end, with some extra fluff that doesn\'t take away anything from the experience. If you would compare it to the old swedish movie from the 80\'s, this is definitely the more true to the book. This is because all the relations, events and characters gets the time they deserve to be built up properly. In the movie they basically just piled up all the key scenes as tightly packed as possible, without giving any emotional connection to anything. This is where Sanzoku no Musume Ronja succeeds splendidly.However, something they did not succeed in was that special feeling of norse fairy tale creatures. The interpretation of the rumphobs (rumpnissar) is pretty awful, both personality-wise and appaerance-wise. The wild harpies (vildvittror) maybe would have worked in a more detailed 2D-animated style, but now they look too flat and cheap. A good equivalent to their classic catchphrase, ""Nu ska blodet rinna!"" (literally: ""now the blood shall flow"") is also missing. The gray dwarves (grådvärgar) and the unearthly ones (de underjoriska) were okay though.Something that the series managed, that neither the old movie nor the book did, was to give all the robbers in Matt\'s Fort their own distinct personalites. I greatly appreciated this. And also, the interpretation of Skalle-Per was terrific.Besides some dumb mistakes, like the fact that they pick blueberries and raspberries in spring (they don\'t become ripe until late summer), the swedish nature is depicted well. Sometimes the tempo maybe was too slow, but this helped more than becoming a hindrance. The thing I missed most from the movie was all the beautiful accapella harmony songs.This is most definitely the best work of Goro Miyazaki so far. But then he also got really good source material from the great Astrid Lindgren! A fantastic story that always is relevant to people in all ages. Strongly recommended to everyone, give it a fair chance! book in a fair way, which it does from beginning to end, with some extra fluff that doesn\'t take away anything from the experience.

There is so much ejoyment to be had in this anime wether you've read the book or not.The characters are great, there are moments of joy, moments of sadness, and everything in between.If you want to watch a good and heartwarming anime...Sanzoku no Musume Ronja is a great option. You won't regret it. Sanzoku no Musume Ronja is a great option. You won't regret it."", ""Initially, I was thrown off by the 3D animation for this, and I regret that immensely. The story had me engaged in every single episode and this far surpassed my expectations. You follow Ronja throughout, and the only experience what she experiences, meaning at no point do you see what is happening in situations she is not involved in (unless it is in her imagination or if she is told a story).This is Ghibli's only television series, and I believe that will be heavily why a CGI approach was taken for this. While it does feel very strange to watch at first, you very quickly...come to love the art style and it seems to bring more life into these characters, and I can't see myself enjoying this as much if it were a normal 2D animation, which I myself find quite shocking.From the getgo, you have a recurring song throughout, which is the Wolf's Song. This is a lullaby sang by Lovis to Ronja to help her sleep - every version I hear of this sounds beautiful. The opening and the ending songs are ones you can't help but sing along to.Birk Borkason - A 10-11-year-old boy who lives with his mother, Undis, and her father, Borka. He is Ronja's best friend and close companion throughout the series.Lovis - Mattis's wife and Ronja's mother, she takes care of all of the Robbers and acts as a strict/stern mother to them all, including her own husband.Mattis -  Ronja's father and Lovis' husband, as well as the Robber chieftain.Ronja - A 10-11-year-old girl who lives with her mother, Lovis, and her father, Mattis.

It's similar to a novel, where the change is slow, but compelling.  Once through the little parts, it becomes fantastic.So as I go into the full review, be aware that I'm writing this a few months after finishing it.Story (9) - The problem with the story is that it's slow.  That is the main problem, it's slow to start and tend to drag along.  I believe it would have been best as...a shorter series, compacting the first five episodes into two or three.  Similarly to Kemono no Souja Erin, for those who've seen it, it's a slow start but a great experience when you're into it.  So my words of advice, push through the first few episodes and you'll have a good time.Art (6) - My problem here, and which is why I deducted some points, is that I'm not a fan of CGI.  I feel like the series would have been much better if it were done with 2d animation, or at least a mix of the two.  CGI is something that is a niche within anime, as I'm sure you know, and for people who watched this just for ghibli, won't like it much.  The CGI does get better later on, but all-in-all it's one of the things you have to put up with to start, and know it gets better further in.Sound (10) - The soundtrack is something I really love within Goro's works, he's able to convey a large part of the story through music, which is something hard to master.  The soundtrack is beautiful, and as is the same with the voice actors, at least in the Japanese version.  The music is one of the best parts of the series, so that is a definite plus.Character (10) - The characters are definitely what put this series so high up.  Even the people that you're supposed to hate are endearing and you can't help but care for them.  Even the minor characters have great stories to them.  And if the minor characters are like this, try to imagine the main characters.  Ronja is one of the most endearing characters that I've seen in a long time.  The thing that is able to differentiate her from other Ghibli heroines is how much of a complex character she is.  She's not some girl who has special powers, she is just a girl that loves and fights for what she believes in.Enjoyment (8) - I think this would have been higher if the first few episodes were easier to get through.  The rest of the series is fine, just the first five episodes drag on.  For a lot of people, they will have dropped the anime before they're able to get to the meat of the story because of those first few episodes.  Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable anime, though.  It's very relaxing but compelling at the same time as well.  One can't help but think about it even after the anime has ended.Overall (9) - Like all longer anime, it has it's high and low points.  I think this is one of Goro's best works from Ghibli, so if you have the time and willpower, I definitely recommend this anime.  You won't be let down.Extra - If you enjoyed this anime, I would really recommend Kemono no Souja Erin, likewise as well. a shorter series, compacting the first five episodes into two or three.

It wouldn't be so bad except that they can't just have her laughing as she does things, they constantly cut away to show you a close-up shot of her stopping to laugh at every single thing.The story starts out looking promising, but there's major flaws as soon as you get into the end of the 2nd episode and into the 3rd.*MINOR spoilers ahead*Ronja is sent into the woods ALONE with virtually no guidance, as her first EVER trip outside the safety of her home, and yet somehow, despite running around entirely aimlessly in the heavily wooded forest where she's never learned to navigate, she magically doesn't get completely lost, and her parents are SHOCKED when it even appears to them that she might have gotten lost. She's never SEEN a river before but knows it when she sees it, she's never SEEN a lake before, but knows it when she sees it.It's only AFTER being rescued from danger that she was told how to avoid the danger. Peek parenting skills...The pacing is SO insufferably slow that the ENTIRE 3rd episode could have been done effectively in 5 minutes. But no, let's have 25 extra minutes of close ups of Ronja giggling. awkward and the lip syncing (even in the Japanese) is really badly off.The characters themselves are all over-the-top, and the protagonist is utterly devoid of personality and could easily be replaced with a happy puppy instead and you'd barely notice, and she laughs WAY too much at EVERYTHING.

I'll just say objectively the good and the bad aspects I found and try to explain why this has happened.(+) Let's see... The nice thing may be that the characters are goodies, the ambientation is positive... that you may actually cry if you're sensitive enough. It's okay for a relatively young kid that doesn't have anything to watch at the time. And, of course, because this is an adaptation from Pippi Longstocking's Swedish author: Astrid Lingdren.(+) The characters design were okay, I liked them and reminded me of Ghibli's....Some music was nice like the 'Wolf's song'.(-) Well, I noticed from the start that its pace is way too slow even for a 26-episode TV series. It doesn't offer anything exciting until episode 6 more or less. But then again, it slows down again. I'm not saying this is like a rollercoaster plot, because it isn't anything like that. It's just a dead plain straight line from a cardiograph that somewhat increases its pulse a little bit from time to time. Maybe a shorter tv series would have been more delighting.(-) The 3D tech wasn't still great at the time. Even today is still hard to accept it apart from some few exceptions. The modelling in characters, such as baby Ronja has exactly the same body model as baby Mattis (her father, if you already forgot). The hair looks weird, etc. I liked Lovis characterization, by the way. She's like Pippi being a strong mum but still I needed her to get on a horse.So why not many people have seen this? This didn't get that much advertisement, it wasn't directed by Miyazaki the father but his son and maybe because, as I said earlier, is too long. Ghibli is best for film and short tv series (I know that Miyazaki has done tv series in the past, but the rest of the studio isn't accustomed to do that and his son is not that good, sorry). And, the most important thing was, that some friend of mine that is a real Ghibli fan had to drop out this in the first chapter... It didn't appeal to him at all and I guess I was chill enough to be able to watch it till the end.I found out there's actually a live-action movie adaptation for Ronja so find out about that and enjoy it. I think it's slightly better. Some music was nice like the 'Wolf's song'.(-) Well, I noticed from the start that its pace is way too slow even for a 26-episode TV series. It doesn't offer anything exciting until episode 6 more or less. But then again, it slows down again. I'm not saying this is like a rollercoaster plot, because it isn't anything like that. It's just a dead plain straight line from a cardiograph that somewhat increases its pulse a little bit from time to time. Maybe a shorter tv series would have been more delighting.(-) The 3D tech wasn't still great at the time. Even today is still hard to accept it apart from some few exceptions. The modelling in characters, such as baby Ronja has exactly the same body model as baby Mattis (her father, if you already forgot). The hair looks weird, etc. I liked Lovis characterization, by the way. She's like Pippi being a strong mum but still I needed her to get on a horse.So why not many people have seen this?

It\'s a charming tale that will make you laugh, cry, and shake your fist and that mean old bad-guy.The art and animation of this series is a bit crummy.

I remind seeing or reading at someplace that Goro intended to do animation for the youngers. That would be his goal with Ghibli. I think he nailed it with Sanzoku no Musume Ronja.The sound in this is so heart-warming. It looks like someone wants to hug you. It's peaceful and somewhat mystical. It matches the forest and its environment. I loved the opening and especially the ending.The characters are all full of energy. It maintains a good atmosphere and catches the children's attention. Ronja's father, Mattis, is so over...the top. But I think we can buy that since he's the leader of robbers. His wife, Lovis, is what gives the show some balance. She's a strong woman who maintains the order there. One could argue about her role as a housewife, depicting her as responsible for feeding the irresponsible male, being the mother of adults that only do little choirs here and there. I won't go against that since I've got a bit annoyed by it. Although considering the story takes place somewhere in the past and the Japanese are quite conservative, that was how things probably worked. I think we can let it lie.Moreover, is being a housewife a bad thing by itself, or is it the way it's generally depicted that's bad? I don't intend to finish this discussion, since it's a big one. In the end, this is a review, not a discussion topic, so I'll end that here. Sorry, I got a bit carried away. Anyways she's an admirable figure. As I said before, she's a strong woman with a great sense of responsibility and quite a tough-lover.Ronja, as her mother, is a strong person. As a little child, she's adorable, and her smile is something else. How could I explain that? It's so sincere, so genuine. It's the kind of smile you only see in young children. It's interesting seeing her growth as the series goes on, her adventures, and her first love. As for Ronja and Birk's relationship, Goro followed Hayao Miyazaki's formula of strong women. She's not the fragile princess in love with the perfect prince. Ronja is equal, and although Birk starts a little more knowledgeable about the world, she fastly keeps up with him, creating a good dynamic.The big let down about this series is that it got lost towards the end, regarding the plot. It builds a charming story, lots of good things to be developed, but Sanzoku no Musume Ronja hurries and delivers a somewhat makeshift end. It looked like the series had to finish before the planned time.Finally, I enjoyed this series. I think that's how a story for children must be done. And the fact is that when a good story is made, even if it's targeted for a specific public, most of us would enjoy it. So, go watch without worries, it's a good story. the top.

Seihou Bukyou Outlaw Star Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33713/Seihou_Bukyou_Outlaw_Star_Specials,"['As it turns out I watched these by accident! Hulu lists Outlaw Star as 26 episodes because apparently they put the specials in at episode 16 and 23. So I guess I watched them without even knowing it.Since no one else has reviewed this title, here we go:The first special is titled ""Demon of the Water Planet"", and is designated episode 16 in the series. The episode did not air in Japan on TV Network, but aired February 5, 2001 on Toonami in North America. In this episode, the crew gets a gig to retrieve a cargo of Dragonite from the bottom of the water...planet, Heifong VII. However, this treasure is guarded by vicious sea creatures that have torn every treasure hunter that came before to shreds. This one isn\'t really vital to the rest of the series as ultimately the end of the episode renders the endeavor pointless. I can\'t explain how without spoiling the end of the episode. However you will see someone (don\'t remember who) holding Dragonite later in the series and without watching this episode you won\'t recognize what it is. It\'s skippable but I do think it\'s a pretty good episode regardless and worth a watch. I was surprised to even find out it went unaired. I did some research attempting to find the reason why it didn\'t air and unfortunately couldn\'t find anything.The second special is titled ""Hot Springs Planet Tenrei"", and is designated episode 23 of the series. The episode aired June 4, 1998 on TV Network in Japan. The episode previously went unaired on Cartoon Network\'s Toonami and Adult Swim on account of adult content. In this episode, the crew ends up on a vacation planet filled with hot springs as far as the eye can see. However, Gene\'s motivation for coming to the planet is to find out the secret behind caster shells and to prepare for the upcoming battle for the Leyline. From the title, you can probably tell this is a fanservice episode. But as far as those go, this is about as well as you can do a hot springs episode. They don\'t spend the entire episode focused on the girls at the hot springs. Most of the episode follows Gene as he treks up Mt. Nantai to meet the 3 wizards. And story-wise, this episode moves the plot forward amidst all the half-naked and fully naked girls. Without watching this one, you won\'t know how Gene got the 4 caster shells. This isn\'t necessarily the best Outlaw Star episode and its placement just before the finale is strange, but like the first special it\'s worth a watch.Note:I don\'t grade individual episodes because individual episodes require the context of the rest of the series to judge its value. To me, grading this would be like grading the second verse of a song. But MAL forces you to add an overall score to any written review.

If you've already seen those episodes then the show will abruptly end at episode 24.If you got to episode 24 and wondered why it ended without a conclusion, the final 2 eps are likely listed as the specials by mistake.

When viewed, even back on the US VHS they were in chronological episode order.The Hot Springs episode is very good and very bad all together. I don’t typically like the super ecchi beach or bathhouse episodes. However, this episode does work really well in the realm of the show and fits along with Gene’s personality. What makes this an important watch is that it’s the main lore episode! You don’t hear much about the magic of the pirates or the caster shells and you learn more about them here.

After marathoning the whole series in a night, I have to say I really enjoyed myself. The characters are all fun and have their own little quirks. I felt they went together in the series well. The show is pretty much all about ping pong too, hardly any filler at all. Surprisingly little fanservice too, considering it's full of girls getting sweaty and moving around a bunch. I was actually hooked on the dramatic moments in each episode, and never felt like fanservice was being crammed down my throat for the sake of selling a product. Not a masterpiece, but worth your...time, and worth buying to put on my shelf.

If you want a show with a deep, involved story and great character development, maybe you shouldn't watch a show about ping pong."", 'Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume (Scorching Ping Pong Girls) is a textbook case of \'I should have known better\'. This anime from studio Kinema Citrus - following the trials and tribulations of a middle school girls table tennis team -  had the potential to be an interesting experience but the warning signs were there from the opening episodes. What unfolded was a by-the-numbers moe-sports hybrid. You\'ve seen this before: New girl has skill, makes number one player jealous and the pair work hard to overcome their faults and step up their game. Is there at least interesting characters or twists to the story to make...this predictable formula exciting? Don\'t get your hopes up. Annoying mannerisms from the cast, bland character design and a drab narrative all play their part in making Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume a show I\'d backhand off the table in a hurry.Our main character is Koyori Tsumujikaze, a shy transfer student who finds the perfect place to seek excitement thanks to the Suzumegahara Middle School table tennis club. It\'s there she runs into the number one player, Agari Kamiya, a confident but jealous girl. Koyori is in search of the player who can bring out the best in her, and Agari fits the bill. Agari has never been greatly tested by the rest of the club but when the talented Koyori shows up things start to change.It feels kind of wrong to hate on such a light-spirited show but when its characters sound and act like fingernails on chalkboard then it\'s hard not to. To counter this I\'ve come up with a way to make watching Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume somewhat bearable. It\'s ""Tozzy\'s Scorching Ping Pong Girls Drinking Game"", and the rules are simple. Grab a bottle of your favourite spirit - the kind that makes your head throb harder than Koyori\'s heart - and make sure you key in the emergency number on your phone beforehand, just in case. Then take a shot every time Koyori mentions the excitable state of her heart, Hokuto converses with a character not by name but by the colour or composition of their underwear, Kiruka decides to nest her noggin in Mune\'s comically large chest, Hanabi squeezes or fiddles with someone\'s hair or one of the first-years need the game explained to them during the middle of a point. It\'s not so much that there\'s anything wrong with these things, it\'s just that their repetition reinforces little surprises Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume is willing to throw the viewers way. The show is built upon characters who act a particular way, and one way only. Sweet, jealous, insecure, creepy, quiet or loud. The end result? No curveballs. Little development. Rarely entertaining.If you\'ve followed through my drinking game I apologise in advance. I assume by the point you\'ve made it through the 12 episodes adhering to these rules then you\'re in trouble. Regardless if you\'re staring down an empty bottle or into your soul contemplating why you watched this show there\'s one thing that\'s clear to see - Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume is no different from the last moe dribble you watched. It\'s sickeningly sacchrine and painfully dull. All these faults, cliches and annoying characters are actually disappointing because there\'s the odd moment of glorious animation in this show but it\'s not worth slogging through the remainder of the series to witness it. Some of the table tennis scenes (the main reason I watched this show) look fantastic, at least when the characters decide to shut up and let the game unfold, that is.Thanks to a one-dimensional cast and a story that ends at an awkward moment Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume earns three heartbeats out of 10.

There are many ways I can express my love for this underrated gem of an anime. I never thought an anime such as this let alone a sports anime would give me this much enjoyment. I\'m not a sporty type of person so I tend to avoid sports centred anime but I\'m glad I watched this and watched it all the way through.This anime is as I\'ve mentioned before simplistic, it\'s a show about girls playing ping pong, no more and no less. It plays out like a typical sports themed show...would about becoming the best and winning the main competition for that sport; and features the theme of typical 1v1\'s for a lot of the episodes; showing us the characters strengths and weaknesses and getting more in depth into that aspect. For a story premise like this it really doesn\'t sound all that interesting but there are many features that make this enjoyable. Mainly because it\'s cute as hell but also accompanied by these matches is a killer OST to accompany them; a feature I will go more into detail with later on in this review.This season focuses on a build up to the national competition; with friendly matches and training up to the main event which in-toe is enough to keep you hooked. We get to see the main cast flourish well and their bonds with each other and also an opposing team which increases the enjoyment factor; but other than that this is all we see from this ""first season"" if the show is lucky enough to gain itself a second.In all fairness while being cheerful and enjoyable a concept like this isn\'t too original, but works well for what it is.The art presented is very cute; it has that charm that made me enjoy it the most, with a cute cast of enthusiastic characters the art style complements that feature well in many ways. It\'s very bright and stands out well; reducing the serious tones from most of the matches of ping pong and flourishing the fun side to sports rather than competitive. Again this is very simplistic in terms of anime but it catches the eye well and makes the vibrant show even more splendid to watch.Now moving onto the sound; which I complemented previously in the story section of the review. The OST to go along the ping pong matches is glorious, up-beat, enjoyable and keeps you hooked into the intensity of the matches. It has a very electronic and modern vibe to it which fits the sport well. The ball hitting the racket in the SFX department is also satisfying to hear especially as the fight grows more intense and you root for your favourite character to win the match. Also I have to mention the stunning opening theme, which I loved so much that I bought it on CD. It\'s upbeat and also complements the show well. Overall, fit to my taste in music.The characters are pretty generic, there\'s nothing too special that stands out for them other than the fact they are all passionate about ping pong and competitive to become the very best. I can\'t find much words to describe the characters but their enthusiasm and up-beat natures is always fun to watch. Which although not very good led me rooting for each character every episode.I can\'t honestly pick a favourite character they were all so splendid to watch.The character development between Agari and Koyori was also pretty neat to watch; but that\'s all I can really say for this part of the review.Enjoyment-wise. I loved this show to death; I want more, it was always the highlight of Mondays as it was cute and feel-good to watch. This led this to being my favourite anime of the Fall 2016 season, it can\'t compare to other more well received titles, but it had enough charisma to keep me hooked and demanding for more. It wasn\'t hard loving this series at all for it\'s nice set of characters and entertaining ping pong matches; along with the prior mentioned gorgeous OST.Overall. I\'m scoring Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume an 7/10 (going enjoyment-wise mainly it would score an 8/10).It didn\'t present much for it to stand out well in the crowd of anime, but for me it was a gem compared to many other anime\'s I\'ve seen. If you are into cute up-beat and happy toned anime\'s. this is a 100% recommendation from me.I have so much love for this series, and I am really hoping this gets a second season someday. would about becoming the best and winning the main competition for that sport; and features the theme of typical 1v1\'s for a lot of the episodes; showing us the characters strengths and weaknesses and getting more in depth into that aspect.

It is something which has been pulled off with great success in the past in shows like Saki for example, and in general I think it adds a nice touch to the otherwise somewhat formulaic sports genre of anime. Following a similar idea, Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume is a surprisingly engaging series which keeps you coming back for more. However, although it exceeds expectations in some areas, it also comes across as rather frustrating or awkward in others. It is the kind of show which I...really enjoyed watching as a whole, but when actually thinking about it I cannot help but find quite a lot of holes in it regardless.The story is quite straightforward and can be roughly divided into two parts. The first half of the anime follows a group of female middle school students in a table tennis club who interact and compete against each other within the club itself. Then in the second half they start playing team games against other schools instead. In other words, completely standard stuff for a sports anime. What is perhaps a bit less ordinary though is the in-house rankings they have where every club member is placed on a ranked leaderboard which is constantly updated based on recent performance in order to determine who the best player in the club is, and in turn to motivate everyone to play their best. What exactly determines these rankings is never explained in detail, but it seems to be some sort of combination of a king of the hill format and an overall collective skill evaluation. In either case, the games are generally quite fun to watch and the anime as a whole is surprisingly addictive as a result, but there are definitely some problems with it as well.The first issue I have with Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume is the characters. There are two main girls: Koyori and Agari, the two most highly ranked girls in the club. Agari is to a large extent a rather stereotypical twintailed tsundere (albeit with boobs for once), but initially she also has a rather strange superiority complex which causes her to frequently look down on others and just take it for granted that she has to be the best, though she grows out of this behavior over time. She can be pretty arrogant but for the most part I am honestly okay with that; in a sense I think it is refreshing to see some main characters every once in a while that are actually intentionally flawed rather than being 10/10 perfect goody-two-shoes all the time, so I actually kind of like Agari as a whole.Unfortunately she is an exception rather than the norm on that front. Koyori is the newcomer prodigy in the club who jumps straight to the top of the rankings right after joining. She is very shy, gets embarrassed easily, and is kind of hopeless at anything other than table tennis, but that is where she truly shines. The problem is that she shines way too much... and in the wrong way. Honestly, Koyori feels too much like a battle shounen protagonist to me, as her special ""ability"" is awfully close to nakama power in my eyes. Essentially she magically powers up from ""having fun"" when playing the game (more on that later), which I think is really immersion-breaking and stupidly cliché. And as far as the supporting cast goes, it\'s somewhat bland across the board. There is Hokuto; the calculative girl who refers to everyone else by the colour of their panties, Munemune-senpai; who is literally named after her enormous tits, Hanabi; the energetic girl who goes >.< at any given moment, and Kirika; the club president who likes enforcing punishments onto everyone she defeats in a match. However, beyond these quirks, they are quite uninteresting as a whole. Probably the most interesting character in the show to me would ironically rather be Kururi, the ace player of the club from a different school that they play against in the second half of the anime. She is an interesting case of a borderline yandere, which is not exactly something commonly seen amongst moeblobs, at least outside of Higurashi.Secondly... there is the somewhat awkward usage of blushing and fanservice. Do not get me wrong, I enjoy seeing red-faced moeblobs as much as the next guy, but Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume takes this concept way too far. Essentially, Koyori has this obsession of wanting to ""feel her heart race"" when playing games, which it seemingly does whenever she is playing a skilled opponent, and it is also the main source of her suddenly powering up as I mentioned before. Not only is this stupidly cliché and cringey to watch, but whenever she does this she also starts blushing so hard it looks like her cheeks is going to catch on fire. What are you so embarrassed about? All you are doing is playing a sport. Are you just blushing for the sake of blushing? It makes no sense at all, and only feels like the producers are trying way too hard to make the girls look cute. I often complain about how many anime tend to throw in ecchi fanservice shots in untimely situations where they simply do not fit in just for the sake of having them, and what Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume does here is effectively the same thing except with moe instead of ecchi. And it happens way too often for me to just ignore it, especially considering that Koyori actually infects Agari with this syndrome after a while so that she starts doing the same thing too, and so we are left with two tomatoes playing table tennis all of a sudden... which is really awkward to watch. As a side note to the above, this anime also has some other form of fanservice in the sense that these girls tend to sweat *a lot* when playing, turning their gym clothes rather transparent a lot of the time. However, this part actually does make sense unlike the needlessly excessive blushing and can also look pretty sexy, so I would consider it a plus point.Thirdly, this is quite evidentially a rather low-budget production and it kind of shows in the animation. Considering that table tennis is a very fast-paced sport, you would also need some rather impressive animation in order to keep up with it, and unfortunately Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume generally does not. There are way too many still shots during the duels instead of fluid animation, which makes it a bit stiff to watch. Occasionally it looks really good though, with some really impressive sakuga usage momentarily, but these are sadly mere exceptions. I think the budget distribution per episode is probably a bit uneven, as some games seem to look a lot better than others. Also, I personally have a bit of a problem with the general character designs: for many of the girls it looks like their cheekbones are completely deformed with almost 90 degree bends in the middle somehow. For Agari this is particularly noticeable. But again these are only visual flaws and not anything major. There are also occasionally some annoying adaptation issues, such as the anime skipping entire sets from matches when playing other schools. Like why are these matches played as best-of-five if you do not have time to show it all anyway, instead of just letting it stay at best-of-three? Probably because it was like that in the original web manga and they did not want to change anything, but cutting it out is hardly a better option in my eyes.So evidentially, there are quite a lot of things which could have been done better. However, all that being said, I still enjoyed Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume decently as a whole. Yes, there are numerous flaws, but beyond the aforementioned issues, I thought it was a pretty solid anime. Even though these problems certainly do drag it down, I would still put the show slightly above average. Seeing cute moe girls working their hardest to achieve their dreams is a quite beautiful sight, and the unusually competitive nature of the matches even within the club itself certainly helps in catching your interest because it makes even regular practice games feel important. Normally training arcs tend to often feel like fillers in sports anime in my experience, but here the girls are competing just as much within the clubroom as outside it, which is a quite refreshing experience. All-in-all, what you have is an anime which probably will not leave much of a lasting impression, but for a mere 12-episode moeblob show you can do a hell of a lot worse. Though it really needs a continuation because the way this season ended was not exactly very conclusive.PS: For whatever reason, Crunchyroll\'s subs for this particular anime were generally quite sub-par by their standards. Unfortunately I have not seen any other group pick it up yet at the time of writing this, but I hope someone does in the future, because the anime probably deserves it. really enjoyed watching as a whole, but when actually thinking about it I cannot help but find quite a lot of holes in it regardless.The story is quite straightforward and can be roughly divided into two parts.

I have to admit, when I first heard of the anime adaptation about this series, I paused and thought “girls playing ping pong…what can be so exciting about this?” Coming into this show, my expectations were rather low. I didn’t read much of the original source material either so venturing into this series is like walking into the world of the unknown.As H.P. Lovecraft once said:“The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown”.Okay, maybe that’s a bit of an over exaggeration. However, what this show ended up being...was a pleasant surprise.Adapting the manga of the same name, the story follows middle school students Koyori Tsumujikaze and Agari Kamiya. They get involved with ping pong, a sport played between players on a hard table divided by a net. On the surface, there probably not much to expect from this show. That’s no surprise considering the simple premise and casual storytelling. However, this show is able to capitalize on several concepts that makes it quite entertaining.First, it’s the characters. The show has a colorful cast of characters of different personalities. From friendly Koyori to the sarcastic third year captain Kiruka Ushirode, there’s something that will always grabs your attention about these characters. Some of the background storytelling are also extensive that expands beyond childhood memories. The series’ attempts at making character roles’ relevant also becomes quite entertaining because every character has a reason to play ping pong. As a sport, the show also introduces rivals so expect the show to evolve with some competitive elements. In essence, character chemistry is likeable especially between friends, Koyori and Agari.Second, there’s the humor. While this show can initially feel like a “cute girls doing cute things” on paper, the comedy can easily be appreciated from the character reactions to their personalities. Take Kururui Futamaru for instance. She has the sort of look that gives off a yandere-like vibe and her behavior in the show is contagiously addictive to watch. The captain of Suzumegahara is also known for her love of teasing her team. Every episode has a balanced feel of humor that doesn’t overextend itself. Even at times when it feels like dumb comedy, it doesn’t drag the show down.Third, what we have is the overall tone of the show. Often these days, sports shows is portrayed as overly serious. Soccer, football, basketball, you name it. There’s the pressure put onto players so drama is inevitable both on and off the field. However, this show portrays ping pong as a more casual sport even with its competitive nature. With that being said, it’s more or less popcorn entertainment. There’s no stress in being disappointed on who will win or lose. At the end of the day, the emphasis on the show is to craft fun from ping pong, something that it effectively achieves. While there are some characters that are obviously more skilled than others, it doesn’t spend too much time focusing on them at the expense of others or the other way around.Still, if you’re looking into a show about creative storytelling, then it’s the wrong place. The storytelling is simple, perhaps way too casual. There’s not much to remember besides the show’s characters and humor. When it come storytelling, the show suffers from development and in general, it isn’t interested in going anywhere new. When watching this, it’ll feel like every episode is nearly the same with its pacing. The final two episodes are also I describe as quite underwhelming compared to the mid-season.Adapted by Kinema Citrus, the anime visual quality is decent at best. The character designs emphasizes on cuteness as the girls (especially the moe eyes) look just like kids. Even the captain has her childish personality being expressed visually with her facial features. The ping pong matches focuses a lot on body movements and camera angles to present its action. Is it good though? Personally, I feel like it works sometimes while other times feels dragged down. Fan service does exists in the show as well although it doesn’t venture beyond onsen scenes.On the other hand, the soundtrack surprisingly creates a perfect storm of expression. It’s spot-on aim with fast pacing and instrumental choreography. Character voice mannerism will probably appeal to fans who are used to shows with cute girls. If you’re not used to this type of show, then it’ll probably feel like a disappointment. There’s nothing else to say besides that. It’s either you’re into it or out.This show can pretty much be recommended to anyone. It’s one of those series where you shouldn’t really expect too much. At its core, the series delivers a satisfying comedy and is hilariously worthy for a sports show. Just watching cute girls playing ping pong and trying to make a name of themselves, you know?

I answer that question with a definite yes.Story-wise, art-wise, character-wise, Scorching Ping Pong Girls may not offer anything far above your average anime, yet I had more fun watching this than any other anime this season.  The reason?  Simply put, the tone of the series.While from first look you might assume that Scorching Ping Pong Girls is a moe series; that you would watch it, say ""That\'s so cute,"" maybe even have a few laughs from some cheerful comedy bits, and then walk away after a relaxing time, what the series actually offers is a...sports anime which will fire you up like its name suggests.  The show\'s story beats all focus on what happens around the ping pong table; games are the main focus and each player represents a different playing style, much like you might expect.  What sets Scorching Ping Pong Girls apart from the crowd is the main character, Koyori, and the mood she bring to her matches.  Koyori doesn\'t play ping pong to win, she plays out of love for the sport, to have fun, and to make sure that her opponent is having fun as well, and when the characters are having fun and you feel that you can root for both sides because it doesn\'t matter who wins in the end, then, in my experience at least, it\'s a blast to watch. sports anime which will fire you up like its name suggests.

Well, let me explain, and then maybe you'll understand why I love this anime as much as I do. (Please bear with me, this is my first time writing a review)Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume, translating to Scorching Ping Pong Girls, is an anime about a group of girls who are on the table tennis team at their school, Suzumegahara. The anime follows their matches amongst one another in their attempts to get better, their practice matches against other schools, and their journey to Nationals.As...soon as I noticed this anime, I was immediately drawn in by the art style. I'm typically a very picky person when it comes to art in anime...if I don't like the art style, then I can't enjoy the anime itself, no matter how great the story may be. I don't know what it was in particular, but I really enjoyed the art, even if the animation wasn't as smooth as it could've been.I cringed upon reading the title, and I assumed that there would be tons of fanservice (as is the norm with anime like this) and that the plot itself wouldn't be very good. I had seen very poor attempts of combining sports and cute girls before, and it hadn't ended well. But I decided to give it a shot nonetheless. And I have to say, just after the first episode, I was immediately hooked on the story and characters.I find that this series doesn't just cater to those who like cute girls and slice of life anime...it has plenty of high-paced ping pong matches between the characters as well that are intense and incredibly thrilling to watch. I play ping pong myself (which is the primary reason I decided to give this anime a try), and just by watching these matches and watching Kiruka give the girls tips, I was able to pick up some tips and tricks and actually improve quite a bit. It was also quite interesting to learn about each character's individual play style.The characters are all amazingly likeable, and fit together so well. Usually, with an anime like this, you get a group of characters: the typical go-lucky genki doormat, the incredibly annoying tsundere, the shy (if you could even call it that) kid who is picked on by everyone else, and the annoying tease/pervert that acts way more mature than they actually are. I was expecting similar stereotypes in this anime, but I was thankfully very wrong.Usually, I can't help but cringe when I see tsunderes on screen, as most of them are very poorly written. But Agari was one of the best tsunderes I had seen in a while. Her dialogue never felt awkward, she actually has insecurities and is capable of forming relationships, and her personality doesn't boil down to that one trait. The same is with Koyori. She isn't your typical shy character, she has a more energetic side as well that only emerges when she plays ping pong.I noticed that quite a few of the characters were amazingly unique, too. Kururi is one of my all-time favorite anime characters thanks to this show. Her personality is so interesting, and I couldn't help but smile every time I saw her on screen because her insecurities and worries about Zakuro leaving her perfectly resemble my insecurities. She's also an actually well written yandere. So there's that.And of course, while I didn't pay too much attention to the BG, the OP and ED songs were both decent, particularly the OP, which, in my opinion, perfectly fitted the contents of the anime, which isn't common.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, and was left wanting more at the end. It felt like the first season ended on a cliffhanger...and the fact that they have yet to announce a second season worries me. I desperately want to see how each school performs at Nationals, and if they have the strength to finally beat the mysterious team shown at the very beginning of episode one. While there isn't much hope considering how long it's been (and how the manga has ended), I'd like to still hope that I'll get to see Death-chan again. soon as I noticed this anime, I was immediately drawn in by the art style.

Later on, they play the table tennis club of another school. This is sports anime 101. But the way it is presented here is cute and entertaining, which makes it work well. The games aren't very thrilling, but they are interesting and short.7/10Art:I hope you like moe, because this anime is very cutesy and colorful. Some of the animations during the matches are in a realistic style, which looks awesome. Other times, they have...this crude dynamic style that Nichijou loved to use. No animation milestone, but as good as it needs to be.7/10Sound:The opening was pretty cute, fittingly so. The ending wasn't bad and the soundtrack during the matches was great. Voice acting was solid all throughout the cast. All the stereotypes were there and they were all well done.8/10Characters:Like I said, we have all the stereotypes of cute girl comedies here: the stoic, the tsundere, the genki girl, the naive main character, etc. I personally have no problem with such a cast, as long as the characters are well done. And they are. All the girls are likeable and the viewer can easily pick out his favourite and root for her.8/10Enjoyment:Shakunetsu is a good anime, not great, but good. It's easy to watch and enjoy, which is more than you can say about most anime every season. If other sports anime feel too lengthy, maybe you should give this one a chance.

Let\'s get analyzing!. Hokuto is a defensive player who essentially analyzes her opponent\'s angle and tries to pull the ball outside of her opponents range, her blue hair and her shy yet knowledgeable personality fits into her ""battle style"". Munemune has an aggressive yet error-prone style and is therefore an excellent smasher. Hanabi is the speedy fighter and is the second to almost best speedster fighter in the club, her yellow hair and her outright genki personality fits into her ""battle style"". Koyori, our ace and her red hair brings semblance to ""main protagonist"" status, she although her personality doesn\'t match with her battle style, her ""battle style"" essentially allows her to adapt to ANY of her opponents play style...she however ""doesn\'t ALL WIN"", she still has some weaknesses actually focusing on her shy personality. Agari having her purple hair and twintails...well she is a very prideful and tsundere character, her play-style focuses more on a jack of all trades and using her kind of ""smashes"" for the deal-breaker, because of this Agari and Koyori have good battle style chemistry even if their personalities are diametric opposites. Finally we the captain of the Suzumegahara ping pong club Kiruka, who focuses on a unique kind of ""chop"" and although her battle style is more calculated, she however doesn\'t have any ""killer shots"", she and Mune are also Doubles Partners which makes them a double pair to be reckoned with what with both of them covering each others weaknesses. Really what this analyzes was getting at is that even if the plot is really simple, it is the characters and their character and battle style chemistry whether they are fighting against one of their own or another opponent and heck even finding out the Suzumegahara\'s opponents they face and THEIR unique battle style which affects their personality and battle style makes the characters unique across the board. Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume\'s definitely lies in it\'s characters. See why LA said at the beginning of this review, that it\'s like Saki meets Ping Pong?.LA talked more the characters game-wise than the characters themselves, let\'s start with Hokuto and Hanabi, they themselves gets character development through their forming of their friendship. Hanabi is your hyper genki to Hokuto\'s deadpan, however the one problem with Hokuto is her ""Panties"" gag, in which she ""knows"" what kind of panties each of the character wear and it converges into nickname basis, it depends if you like this gag as a weird quirk for her, as for LA...LA found it quite annoying much like how Agari points it out. Hokuto even with this gag, it doesn\'t destroy her character as her backstory helps her get out of the annoying character and because of this, Hanabi also gets a bonus in development because of Hokuto. On speaking of Agari, she at first is extremely prideful of her skills and becomes quite jealous of Koyori and becomes her defining trait, thankfully once she realizes Koyori\'s ""just have fun and have a great game"" belief, she gets MUCH better and realizes that she can get even better and her prideful, jealous trait taken away and turned into a ""working ace"" and yeah she became LA\'s favourite character due to her huge development. Koyori gets some but it\'s more or less goes back to her philosophy of ""just have fun"" and it does get conflicted in one battle but nonetheless her meek demeanor doesn\'t really change but her getting some ping pong friends and her drive to have fun makes her an ok dimension character. Finally we have Munemune and Kiruka, they too get their character development similar to Hokuto and Hanabi, but in greater detail but it\'s in more of a focus to their battle styles and WHY they want to go to Nationals and once again the similarities of Hokuto\'s running gag, Munemune has one too and it\'s a bit less annoying than Hokuto\'s, but nonetheless, Munemune\'s running gag is her big boobs -sigh- and the multitudes of characters that recognizes it...again less annoying than Hokuto\'s. Nonetheless, these characters do develop and helps outside of the great ping ping battles.There are some more or less awkward fanservice mainly from Hokuto\'s ""I know what panties your wearing"" (no seriously), but the only other fanservice Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume has are well, but it\'s not as blatant, there is fanservice it\'s just not the focus, it\'s more focused on the characters and the ping pong battles. The only contextual fanservice LA rather endorsed was the yuri undertones towards the main cast especially Koyori and Agari ""friendly rivalry"".The ping pong battles has it\'s ups and downs, the strengths comes from the variety of characters ""superpowered ping pong abilities"" and how they work and conflict with each other a la ""Saki mahjong battle"" and LA can clearly see that the animation and detail worked into that. The weaknesses comes from the truncatedness of the battles and LA does get it as it has 4 to 5 matches lastly the first to reach 11 points for each match, yeah LA can see why, but nonetheless some of the opponents and battles felt truncated even more on how ""fast"" the matches go (this is more or less LA saying LA wanted to see more of the match really), but it does well to balance each other out because of each of the strengths and weakness of the ping pong battles. LA most definitely thought that the anime\'s strengths definitely goes to it\'s ping pong battles and where the attraction to the anime goes to.The animation by Kinema Citrus, if anything LA thought that the matches were the best presented animation, sure it\'s ping pong but once the superpowers comes in, the adrenaline does add in at the same time, the character designs does have the ""marshmallow""-esque facial designs but average body designs, but the character accessories does add in some unique character designs. It does come in that the character designs are moe, but they do try to fanservice these characters through sweating and fanservicey-character-jabbing so LA thinks that from this the fanservice is kinda misguided in some respects because of it, but not to the point of being distracting...ok maybe a little, but still, even with the puni-ish character designs with good match animation, it more or less compensated itself into making the animation ""ok"" at best.The voice acting has some decent voice acting all round, from the stereotypical archetype character roles, genki, deadpan, rival etc. with some ignorable squeakers Yumiri Hanamori as Koyori and Marika Kouno as Hanabi. Standouts towards Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume\'s vocal cast would go to Minami Tanaka as the wide-vocal ranged Agari and LA\'s wild card favourite Shiori Izawa as Kururi a rival Koyori faces.The ending really left on a non-conclusive note with hints littered throughout the final episode, making sense as Suzumegahara hardly entered their tournament stage by the end of the anime and rather went from training their own club and had training sessions with other more powerful school clubs to their own training camp by the end of the anime\'s run. But nonetheless even as LA says it this way, it\'s not as the anime left us with ""nothing"" by the end of it and IT DID go somewhere definitely character-wise. So if Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume can get another season, LA wouldn\'t mind it at all. Yes the ending left on a rather dull note and threw hints in trying to conitue the anime with another season or *cough* read the web manga *cough* ending, LA didn\'t really think this kind of was a dealbreaker into being ""horrible"" as LA was kinda  expecting this kind of ending and hell Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume\'s character strengths definitely won LA over with this kind of ending.Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume may look like another cute girls doing ping pong with it\'s usual structure of a sports anime, but in the background shows how in the line of ping pong that even characters with flaws can improve and not be one-trick ponies, also for Koyori is the good old ""have fun!"" philosophy added to it.

Maybe it\'s like a common thing it all sports anime, but once I noticed it in this show it was pretty hard to un-notice. Every time the girls were in a serious match and the stakes were high, I was having trouble focusing through all that sheen and near see-through layers of clothing. If that\'s your fetish, look no further I guess.Other than that I\'d say it was a fairly standard ""underdog"" sports anime. Or it was trying very hard to set up an underdog story with the other team they were facing. It has a...lot of build up to a match that ultimately ends with our plucky new recruit figuring out the secret is to just hit the ball even harder. I honestly love how the medium of anime manages to make even the most mundane little techniques or changes in attitude so dramatic. The over-the-top voiceovers and framing just wouldn\'t work at all in live action, or really any other medium I can think of.

The 24 minutes of each episode passes without you noticing and when you realize it already is hoping that the next episode will come soon. It was really surprising how much the anime managed to arrest me, being that I just got to watch with curiosity and already thought about dropping soon in the first episode. It turns out that the chronology of the anime is very simple, it is basically a girl who has just transferred from school and loves table tennis, and there, she makes new friends...and next to these, she will go through all the obstacles to be the champion national.Calling shallow may be appropriate because everything goes very slowly (which is a serious defect of the anime), and this meant that 12 episodes were not enough to cover everything he promised. It can be said that it was misdirected in fact, because the anime ended up just where the climax of everything would be: the national tournament (it was as if everything that the anime portrayed was not absolutente at all, because everything was happening all over Cast going through difficulties to overcome its weaknesses for the tournament, which did not happen). The big truth is that the anime was extremely stagnant and what really would make everything run as it should have lagged behind because as I had already quoted it was misdirected or else they should have released money for a two-cour production or else split- Cour, because anything was better than the ending that the anime had, unfortunately. It failed to meet its original premise and eventually the end was deplorable and meaningless.The anime has a soft presence of fanservice, but a heavy presence of an inexplicable moe. Anything that the anime had had a moe implicitly placed there that left in the minimum, the situation comically and logically, cute.Visually speaking, anime is very simple; The traits of the characters are well ... modest. This is made perfectly visible if you repair the eyes of the characters well. The graphic of the anime is quite normal too, nothing surprising. The scenarios are basic and play its part basically.Already the animation, is well above average, which intrigued me, because the context that the anime brings, is usually something very basic or even bad, but in Shakunetsu was different. Everything was fluid, especially in the scenes in which they disputed their departures. Those scenes that I'm going to give a highlight too, because they are incredibly exciting. You really can get stuck there and get into the mood altogether, because in addition to a cool animation that these scenes had, the presence of OST was totally noticeable. What a good OST! It can give 60% of the merits of the 'key' anime scenes to the OST because it was surprisingly good.The cast of the anime is cool. There is not a character you can really dislike. In fact, you separate the ones you found cool and the ones you really craved to see the terribly moist face every minute because I particularly had many.In short, that's it.

For some reason though, I found this to be pretty mediocre. There was little excitement, but I can't wait to watch Ping Pong the Animation.I like the characters. They a vivid and lively. They are all unique, which in the case of a non serious anime, makes it's all the more fun to watch.Sometimes, the animation was amazing, especially in episode 1, which tricked me into watching it. It's not amazing compared to all other anime, but was amazing in the sense that there...was more action sequences that showed the ping pong battle, than just freeze frames of people talking. There were even a few rotoscoped sequences sprinkled throughout the series, and made everything feel much more lively.

Unfortunately it just couldn't come together properly.The pacing of the plot which is little more than generic is extremely questionable, rushing through the season and the first arc to end two episodes into the second arc. This doesn't make sense from the idea of a single season or from a sequel as you would want the sequel to be the start of the new arc and vice versa. They really could have dragged out the arc more and added more character development instead of trying to churn the...story out. The series is very character driven so it's kind of okay that the plot wasn't anything too special however it doesn't excuse the fact that it doesn't seem to be making any real attempt to try anything new either.As for animation the shows has some flashes of brilliance utilizing great use of motion and colour to create strong powerful cuts. Unfortunately they're few and far between with much of the character animation moving awkwardly and reusing far too many cuts. There's really not too much to say it was simply average with the occasional great shot.The soundtrack is one of the high points of this series. It's frantic and energetic and remind me of something out of an arcade. It really helps amp up the action and make up for some of the scenes that have lacking animation. The tracks from competitive matches are so fun I've began putting it on when playing competitive games because it really helps get you into the mood. The opening also makes great use of the sound of ping pong balls bouncing to keep the rythym. Once I noticed by episode 4 or so I couldn't stop myself from bouncing along throughout the rest of the series.Another high point of the series is the characters. The majority of the characters have very unique designs and somewhat unique twists on standard character tropes. The main cast isn't too developed unfortunately which goes back to the pacing issues of the story and could have easily been fixed however the characters who are more fleshed out feel really fun and interesting. In particular one of the antagonists from the first arc is a really unique take on a character trope which I was really able to identify and bond with. They aren't necessarily a character most would or would want to but just the few extra defining feature helped make her feel so real and relateable to my own personal experiences in highschool that it had me rooting for them even though I shouldn't have. Likewise I am extremely intrigued by the very different antagonist introduced at the end of the series for the second arc. Which unfortunately we never get to so I guess I'll just have to read the manga for that.Overally I really enjoyed the series. The light hearted comedy and straight forward plot made it a fun show to unwind late at night to and just relax while watching yet still be able to get invested in enough to really care about some of the cast. Unfortunately as I said at the start, it could have been so much more. I would recommend if you like sports, club or high school club shows and want something light hearted and fun. You wont get anything super deep with this one but if you don't need that then it's a good watch. story out.

She slowly improves and joins the team to help win tournaments, nothing too special there. Characters as well are standard school girl anime.What does give this show some redemption is the animation. The animation does come through in some of the tense ping pong matches which if you do like some sports anime or even something competitive can get you gripped....They only get better as the show goes on, especially in the last few episodes where they are finally challenged by another school.In all it is a pretty average show, but if you are open to some nice animation and whether or not you like ping pong or not I would say to give this show a watch. If you make it through all the hearts and ""doki doki"" which is referred to SO MUCH you can find a nice little show to geth you through.

I recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys the sports or slice of life genreThanks for reading this review', ""I watched Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume. Here are my thoughts:Really fun series. Puts a smile on my face. I really enjoyed watching this.Great direction, both on-court and off-court. The ping pong matches are engaging and fun to watch, and the off-court drama is well executed. The great direction is a major positive in my view.Decent soundtrack. Decent overall audio production.Cute characters. Cute character interactions. Good chemistry among the cast....Decent character development, particularly for a single-cour sports anime with a somewhat large cast.Animation is unremarkable with occasional poor-quality moments, but this is no big deal to me. CGI is used briefly during some of the matches. Animation is not a strong point in this series. I'm indifferent to this but still it's worth mentioning, particularly for a sports-focused show.The overall visual production quality for this anime is low. I don't value animation that much but the bland art style is a missed opportunity for sure.I should mention that the climax of the series is around episodes 9 and 10. The last two episodes were still good but there were a few 'hooks' added to try to draw you into the manga. This is fairly typical of manga adaptations, for better or worse. I'll also point out that the team talks about wanting to go to the national competition multiple times, but they never actually go in the anime. This might bother you if you care a lot about plot.Overall I rate this anime 8/10. Really this is just an incredibly fun series and a joy to watch.Great example of a low-budget anime done well (especially impressive considering that it's a sports anime). Low production quality can't ruin a well-directed anime, but poor direction can cripple any show.Great OP song! I found myself singing along every time it played.Would recommend if you like CGDCT or sports anime, especially as a means of bridging the gap between the genres.

Shin Getter Robo tai Neo Getter Robo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/938/Shin_Getter_Robo_tai_Neo_Getter_Robo,"['Remember the olden days of super robot where there\'s no gray area and goodness always prevail? If you enjoy such shows or just want to reminisce about the past with a great, highly enjoyable show, then Shin Getter Robo Vs Neo Getter Robo (SGRvNGR) might just be your cup of tea.In general, SGRvNGR is an alternate reality version of the original Getter Robo franchise. Without spoiling much of the original Getter Robo, it shows what might happen if Musashi (the original Getter 3 pilot) sacrifices himself to destroy the Reptilian Kingdom before the unfortunate event that changes the original Getter Robo from a regular fun-filled,...monster-of-the-day anime into a story that made the 12 years old me loses all faith in humanity (not really, but you get the point).If the second act of Getter Robo, and its canon, Getter Robo Armageddon, shows a darker side of Go Nagai, then SGRvNGR portrays a lighter story akin to Mazinger Z where good people stays good and justice always prevail in the end.The story itself is nothing special. The story circles around Ichimonji Gou, the new candidate for the newly developed Neo Getter Robo: A safer and stable version of Getter Robo that is developed by the previous pilot of Getter 2, Jin Hayato to combat the upcoming threat from the newly reformed Reptilian Empire.Where\'s the high review score came from then? The answer is simple: It\'s highly enjoyable. Due to its 4 episode-long nature, SGRvNGR presents its story in a fast paced, comprehensive manner with a lot of action in every episode. In just four episodes, it manages to:- Throw cameos from most original Getter Robo characters.- Shows Neo Getter Robo in all of its three glories.- Tease just enough of Shin Getter Robo to make it interesting.- Introduce a fun super robot sidekick to the Getter Robo universe.- Made the kid in me shouts ""Getter Change!!!"" from the bottom of my lung.Therefore, here\'s my review for SGRvNGR:What\'s in it : Super Robot, hand-to-hand fight, giant axe, and lots of cameos.What\'s to like : Action packed story with excellent pace and enjoyment.What\'s not to like : Typical story with no character development.Mood needed to watch : Mood for a light and fun, no brainer kind of story.Overall score : 9 (Great)As an added bonus, the music and sound effects are surprisingly good and complement both the action and the story well. Try and watch this using a good sound system and you\'ll see what I mean.In short, SGRvNGR is something that you might like to watch after a long day\'s work just to relax for two hours. I can almost guarantee that you\'ll end the session with a big grin on your face and an urge to start every sentence with the word ""Getter"". With all that in mind, ""Getter See You Later And Watch This Anime NOW!!!!!"" monster-of-the-day anime into a story that made the 12 years old me loses all faith in humanity (not really, but you get the point).If the second act of Getter Robo, and its canon, Getter Robo Armageddon, shows a darker side of Go Nagai, then SGRvNGR portrays a lighter story akin to Mazinger Z where good people stays good and justice always prevail in the end.The story itself is nothing special.

With all that in mind, ""Getter See You Later And Watch This Anime NOW!!!!!""', ""As this anime was lent to me by a friend on DVD, this is the first time I had viewed something from the Getter Robo franchise. From what I heard, the series, created by Go Nagai in 1974, is the earliest prototype of the combining mecha genre. Though, you have to hand it to Mr Nagai, being the guy who laid out the blueprint for the entire mecha craze.The basic outline of the franchise: The Reptilian Empire (a race of dinosaur-man hybrids) attacks humanity after leaving the underground for the first time in millions of years. A Reptilian mecha is captured by the humans, modified...and used time and time again to foil their plans. That mecha is the Shin Getter Robo.Sounds familiar? You've seen this concept in just about every mecha anime that followed. Heck, studio Gainax practically cited this as an influence for Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. And it shows, because where else would that drill symbolism have come from?STORYThe story is nicely paced for a 4-episode OVA, albeit a very short series that might have very well been given a higher budget and released into cinemas as a feature film. Though I don't blame the director and crew, since this is a sequel to the original series' movie. On the other hand, being the first of the franchise that I had ever viewed, I quickly realized that by the end of the first episode I had enough background on the original series' formula to get a grasp at what was going on.CHARACTERSSince this is an OVA, only four characters had more on-screen time than anyone else: Gou, the hot-headed, macho wrestler, Shou, the quiet female pilot, and Gai, the tubby supporting pilot, and Ryoma Nagare, the original team's leader. The three new characters are stand-ins for the original team and quite possibly the next generation if any future sequels are produced.Despite very little character development, if any at all, the hot-headedness of the male pilots practically provides the humor when appropriate - you can even see where Gurren Lagann got it's 'GAR' from. That, and the cringingly-funny Engrish spoken when the two American pilots are introduced up the humor to eleven.DESIGN/ANIMATIONThe mecha designs are where SGR vs NGR truly shines. The Reptilian Empire's mecha are biological and bleed, whereas the Shin Getter Robo is part biological and part mechanical (Evangelion, anyone? AND YES, I know Evangelion was released 5 years before this OVA, but the original Getter Robo came out in 1974). The American team's mecha has to be seen to be believed, or taken seriously for that matter.The rough and vicious look of the characters echoes Go Nagai's manga and earlier anime works, and juxtaposed against beautifully drawn backgrounds is a nice touch.The animation is pretty outstanding for an anime that was produced in 2000. It's fast, brutal and despite showing age still stands out to anything covered in excessive CGI (and Macross Frontier still comes to mind - don't get me wrong I LOVE the Macross franchise).MUSIC/SOUNDThe music is also quite atmospheric and sets the feeling of each scene quite appropriately. The sound effects are cinematic and add more to the action and drama. The opening theme 'Storm' by JAM project is a catchy number, though by the standards of something like 'A Cruel Angel's Thesis' is not too special.OVERALLI'll be forward and straight on this: this was Gurren Lagann before Gurren Lagann. If you watch carefully, there are a number of similarities between Getter Robo and TTGL. However, most of these feel like tributes from the latter, and I'm respectful to the separate universes of both franchises.SGR vs NGR is a fun OVA. It's not very coherent at times if you hadn't seen the original series, but that wouldn't stop a new fan (like me) from going back to watch the original series or read the original manga. It's chaotic, loud and brutal but at the same time you get a good amount of fun for 4 episodes.Overall: 9/10. and used time and time again to foil their plans.

I mention that up front because this 4-episode OAV series is almost 100% action scenes.  It never pauses for breath.  In some shows that would be exhausting or tedious, but for an old-school super robot story it works just fine.  As with seemingly every Getter series, it assumes familarity with other shows in the franchise, but the proceedings are so simple that it doesn't matter if you don't know these characters.  There's really nothing you could call a plot here, just: bad guys show up, so fight, fight, fight.  Fortunately, the fight, fight,...fighting is entertaining from beginning to end, packed with high energy and back by a rousing score, so that's really all it needs.  Getter Robo Armageddon was a better series overall, but that had 13 episodes to work with, so it had time to build a real story.  If you just want a quick, sharp shot of giant robot action straight into your veins, this one does the trick. fighting is entertaining from beginning to end, packed with high energy and back by a rousing score, so that's really all it needs.

And \'generic\' is a word I\'m going to be typing a lot in this review.Audio and music are... forgettable, nothing to write home about.The story is somewhat interesting although the worldbuilding is generic as it comes. The world is a single continent shaped like an island (boooring), split into multiple semi-autonomous kingdoms. Your run of the mill middle ages society (closer to Renaissance seeing the cities) where the Emperor is not really that powerful and has to thread carefully with the local kings. And war is at the doorstep with the current Emperor being a child with not one but several advisors with conflicting agendas, and the kings smelling weakness like sharks smelling blood on the water.To its credit, the anime shakes things a bit by putting our MC as the child of not one of those kings but two steps down the ladder. His family runs just a little district inside one of those kingdoms. They are bannermen, basically. Lowest you can be and still call yourself \'noble\'. They have a nice house, a few servants, enough soldiers to at least have some infantry, archers and cavalry... and that\'s it. The father is smart enough to see that war is coming so they seem to be preparing for it (or at least training a lot) and, when the MC starts showing his ""instinct"" to see what people are good for, he is happy to see his child has some skills and is not totally useless.The characters are... serviceable? MC is smart and basically a good guy, and realizes that a healthy kingdom is one with good economy and no poverty. Then we have generic highborn dad, generic male fighter, and now in chapter three generic slave mage girl. But none of them are idiots and their actions and decisions make sense, so there is that.This anime looks so far to be leaning more towards ""How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom"" than the more action-focused counterparts, with the MC building a team and taking a more managerial position himself, which is nice for a change but nothing groundbreaking.All in all, it has some potential. But I fear that the unique strong points in this anime are weighted down by being soooo utterly generic in every other aspect. Generic feudal setting, generic magic system, generic people (at least we don\'t have cat-girls for fanservice once again, though), generic \'discriminated minority with just darker hair\', generic everything.

It's not just an mc power change, or a wack world building change, but a completely different take on how to approach fantasy isekai story. The MC isn't OP in any combat abilities in any unique ways, but instead have the ability to see people weakness and strength then need to learn to forge good relations or bad one with them, is such a fun premise. It will more focus on mind games, psychology, and politics, more than fighting.Recommend for: Mind games, Politics, Character, DirectingFull review:THE Potential CONS:Lets get the cons out of the way first....First of all, it's production quality is pretty average for an isekai standard. Not that bad that it make you question in the middle of the show, so good enough to support the show [7/10]. So if you enjoy flashy scenes, or epic OST, this might not be for you. There's no prominent story line, other than to grow stronger right now, and is a pretty shenanigans story[6/10], so depends on you if you like that or not, however, the character IS what making this story shine, which will be talked about on the next section.THE PROS:The characters in this anime is VERY good. As you might expect from the gimmick of the story, it's about having the right people, and making the right conversations, so of course you would need good character to pull that off since it's literally the gimmick. So every named characters, have some pretty good writing, with non 1 dimensional writing. Most side character and the small villains  right now seem a bit still pretty 1 dimensional, as they serve just from scene to scene. So overall very good [9/10].Next is the directing. Even with the average production quality as it would go after the budget, the directing still shines through, and make you FEEL for the show, the characters, and the story. It's very reminiscence with Frieren, where the directing focus on the journey, the beautiful music and scenery, the life of the people of the land, and the powerful talking, overall mix in for the maximum feels and is very aw inspiring [10/10]. The pacing is also perfect! Not too boring but also have progressions. [9/10]Lastly is the psychology. With in just 3 episodes, they prove that they can make good and realistic talks, mind games, and writing. The protagonist doesn't get it easy in this show. Even with his appraisal skills, he still need to talk to them, most characters have their own circumstance, they won't be win over that easy, so he would need to adapt, and learn to understand people for the better. [10/10]IN CONCLUSION:This show have very good gimmick, with the characters, the story, and the directing to support that gimmick and story to the fullest. The production quality might be average, but it's good enough with the very good directing that it is very enjoyable.Recommendation:If you like journey animes, with characters development, feel good vibes, and portray the nature of human being (the good, the bad, and the reality) very well.

The setting and premise is your typical magical fantasy setting, with the mc’s special appraisal gimmick being neither too out-of-place nor innovative. I’d lump this anime into the “junk food” category of isekai because, as of episode 3 when I’m writing this review, everything is progressing mindlessly. There is conflict, but it’s set up in such a way that even if you’re only paying 20% attention to what’s going on you’d realize where the story is going to go. The characters are a step up...from lesser isekai shows and, while not terribly nuanced, have a set personality and motivations that drive them.This anime is a bit mundane for my liking, but if you find yourself enjoying isekai stories in spite of how oversaturated it’s become, you’d probably enjoy this one as it really doesn’t do anything wrong. from lesser isekai shows and, while not terribly nuanced, have a set personality and motivations that drive them.This anime is a bit mundane for my liking, but if you find yourself enjoying isekai stories in spite of how oversaturated it’s become, you’d probably enjoy this one as it really doesn’t do anything wrong.', '""As a Reincarnated Aristocrat, I\'ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World"",  another entry into the hyper-saturated genre of video game-esque ""another world"" stories, takes a unashamedly straightforward approach to the genre and executes it convincingly.

It starts with a very basic premise: a middle-aged man dies and reincarnates as a baby in another world. While this premise may seem standard, the main character isn\'t reincarnated as an overpowered character. Instead, he possesses a simple skill—appraisal. Thus, instead of being an overpowered individual, he recruits overpowered individuals.The animation is above average, with well-animated fighting scenes and decently portrayed...magic casting scenes.

He\'s well-mannered and respectful to everyone, making him a genuinely likable person.Rietz, a butler and guardian of our MC, is a well-spoken gentleman with unmatched fighting skills, sworn to protect him at all costs.Charlotte, an ex-slave turned mage after meeting the MC, also wants to support his dream, which also serve as the main provider of ""waifuable"" and ""fanservice"" characters.Lastly, Rosell, a closet genius with a heart of gold, adds depth to the cast.

As a result, you often can't understand why characters in the anime are so good friends, loyal or sad, while the manga is actually one of the few media ever that made me cry.Accordingly, I can recommend the anime somewhere if you hate manga - if not, ignore the anime and read the manga. approached this with mixed feelings: I already know the story, but ‘rewatching’ it in an animated way could be quite exciting, couldn't it?Unfortunately, the anime lost its appeal for me very quickly: Animations seem far too stiff, which quickly makes it ugly - but my biggest problem is that the anime unfortunately leaves out extremely many of the important character interactions.

The execution of these characters is nothing short of interesting, making each one stand out in their own way. Even the protagonist's fiancée, who falls into a character type I typically don't find appeal in, forced me to admit she has her own charisma that makes her a pleasant presence in the show.She has her own mind, doesn't preach ideals, and sees people for who they are. And the scenes that nailed her expressions drew me into her character even more. Most notably, the story of how she becomes enchanted by the protagonist was marvelously executed. Her role is well-defined, giving her a perfect place in the narrative, not to mention she's bold as f*ck.Bear in mind, this praise comes from someone who usually finds such character types distasteful. And additionally, the characterization of Ars's father was flawless. The emphasis on camaraderie truly hits the mark, even the moments when they sit around a table to drink tea.

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7654/Tokyo_Magnitude_80_Recap,"[""This is the movie that should not have existed in the first place. This is the black spot on the Tokyo Magnitude series. This movie ruined everything that the main series was known for.Even though the artwork is more or less same but animation is improved a little bit specially during some destruction scenes. The sound effect is as great as the original series. For the most part (around 90% or so), it is just taken from the main series itself.If sound effects, artwork & animation was on par with the main series and this is just a recap special than what could have gone...wrong here? Well the answer is every other thing. I acknowledge that retelling the story of around 4hrs in just under 1 hour will require major plot gaps and a little fast pace. But they ruined the complete story.The direction ruins everything the main series was known for: the careful pacing, the emotional connection with the characters (both main and secondary). The story in itself was nothing special nor the characters had something special in them. Its the careful pacing & good direction that binded the story. This special ruined that.I was very disappointed with how the movie came out to be. I didn't feel any connection with the MC inspite of the fact that they were the same where I cried with them at some point (and felt a hole in my heart). In TV series, I felt like I was literally there inside the plot along with other characters but movie failed to established that connection.Apart from that there were some major blunders in the plotline due to haphazard compilation. For example:[SPOILER ALERT]1. How come they forget to remove the conversation between the two siblings regarding her stomach ache when movie skipped the everything about the same till that reference. [If you had watched the main series, you already know how bad was the situation].2. Similarly, how come Maki was shown crying in the shelter when they clearly skipped the part where she presumed that her family died (due to a confusion)? Shouldn't she be shown looking for them in the shelter?Similarly there are many more unjustifiable blunders/plotholes.Conclusion: I would advise anyone not to watch this shit even for the sake of marking it as watched. Better to mark it was watched just after completing the main series, which is everybit worth watching. wrong here? Well the answer is every other thing.

It's only like 50 minutes long, not 20 minutes like a typical episode, but it's not exactly movie size either. And I think this recap benefitted from the length.Sure, a lot of stuff got cut. But what I liked was that it cut right after the Tokyo Tower collapsing incident. Not necessarily the cut itself but it showed that Yuuki was suffering from a headache caused...by the incident till he collapsed due to sunstroke. At first it seemed as if he died solely because of his weakness.Another thing that you'll notice if you watch this recap (or rewatching the 11 episodes) is Mari's treatment towards Mirai after the death of Yuuki. Mirai was obviously coping hard with her loss so her mind was blocking out the memory of Yuuki's death announcement to keep her sane. Along with that she was also hallucinating a living Yuuki. When I first watched it I thought Mari had a darker face because she was worried about her daughter Hina, not Mirai. But this digest proved me wrong.I should add that this recap skips episodes 5,6,7 completely. It continues from Yuuki saving Mirai from the falling Tokyo Tower debris in episode 4 to episode 8 where they have to take him to a hospital for losing consciousness in the road, so this recap makes it seem like he was taken to the hospital for getting hit by small debris when in actuality it was a much slower process that took time.Anyways this is good for a quick rewatch. But if you think you remember the storyline of the 11 episodes then it's unnecessary. But then again if you read this review you can probably imagine what exactly this has in store so (re)watching it would be totally useless. by the incident till he collapsed due to sunstroke.

Unico: Mahou no Shima e,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2429/Unico__Mahou_no_Shima_e,"[""First of all this review contains some spoilers because it was impossible for me to write something without mentioning some so I'm sorry!I had been fascinated by Unico's first film and even its OVA, but this film did not move me as much as the previous one. The artwork and the scenarios with the background music are still great and capture the atmosphere of the film but my main problem is the other characters in the plot and things happens very quickly sometimes, starting with Sherry, who is the girl who shelters Unico in her house with her family. yeah, she loves Unico but I...feel that her role was very short for the potential she had, as for her brother Torby I feel that he could be used a little more because he was a very interesting character and I would have liked to know more things about him. For example, why did he decide to study magic? continuing with the cat that appears at the beginning only remains as comic filler and it doesn't bother me because it is simply a children's movie and that's it, but I feel that there were more wasted characters like the Trojan horse that only appears for a maximum of 3 minutes and was only used to tell the story of the villain and the same with Mars, which is the creature they introduce in this film but she contributes almost nothing to the story other than guiding the protagonists to the end of the world to meet the aforementioned Trojan horse and nothing more. As for the villain, I feel that he is well constructed with an interesting origin and some striking powers as well. The final fight with Unico feels exciting and I cannot deny it, although it was a somewhat bittersweet ending for me, but it continues with the main plot of Unico separating again of his friends and being taken again to an unknown land where he must start again alone. I give it a 7/10 since I am still captivated by the atmosphere and story of Unico in each of his projects and I only recommend it to those who are interested in the works of Osamu Tezuka or who really like old animes with magic friendship themes. feel that her role was very short for the potential she had, as for her brother Torby I feel that he could be used a little more because he was a very interesting character and I would have liked to know more things about him.

Urusei Yatsura Movie 1: Only You,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1920/Urusei_Yatsura_Movie_1__Only_You,"['During the first half of the nineteen eighties, Urusei Yatsura was the most popular anime series in Japan. The story of a beautiful alien who falls in love with a womanising teenager, it\'s credited with bringing the Otaku culture out from basements of Japan and into the public consciousness. Spawning a long-running TV series that ran between 1981 and 1986, as well as a series of films, the series remains popular in Japan to this very day.Several years afterward, the series found a new audience when it was brought over to the United States during the nineties. Despite retaining its popularity in Japan, in...the West it has faded into relative obscurity, with only a small cult following comprised largely of the original Western fanbase, topped up by the few among the younger generation of fans willing to venture into classic anime.The first in a series of six films produced for the franchise, ""Only You"" is often neglected by contemporary critics, particularly in the West. Overshadowed by the sequel ""Beautiful Dreamer"" -which is an altogether more ambitious title than the other films in the franchise. But while ‘Beautiful Dreamer’ may be the superior title, it fails to capture the original ‘essence’ of Urusei Yatsura. While it’s not as distinctive, nor as ambitious as its younger sister, ""Only You” deserves far more recognition than it gets, because it manages to summarise exactly what made Urusei Yatsura great in the space of a single film. World-class comedy driven b y one of the greatest casts in anime history.One of the main reasons that \'Only You\' so closely resembles the Television series is that they share the same basic plot: Ataru Moroboshi meets an alien girl, whom he accidentally proposes to due to a lack of familiarity with the marriage customs of an alien race. Such blatant recycling of the plot might lead one to think ""Only You"" is actually an adaption of the TV series –and arguably it would have been better if it was- but it’s not.The film takes place within the same universe as the TV series... which if you\'ve been following it, makes this the third occasion that this premise has been used. While it’s a not very original (and some would say, lazy) to use the same idea three times, it’s worth taking into account Urusei Yatsura’s strength was never in its storyline.The plot could also do with some improvement; the film was Mamoru Oshii\'s big screen debut, and his inexperience shows; the film lacks a clear \'Beginning - Middle - End\' structure, which results in it feeling overly long, despite its fairly average runtime of just 100 minutes.Even so, there are a few hints of the genius about to blossom; most notably one of the films few sad moments; a particularly powerful scene featuring a beautiful musical interlude that strikes an emotional chord similar to the \'Boat Scene\' in Oshii’s later work “Ghost in the Shell”.Urusei Yatsura\'s strong suit has always been its great cast of characters and \'Only You\' features many familiar faces from the TV series; almost all of them, in fact. And thankfully, they’re on top form here.Protagonist Ataru Moroboshi stands out as the best character in the film; a perpetual womaniser, he continues to chase women despite being \'engaged\' to Lum (though he denies this). In \'Only You\', he discovers that he proposed to another alien girl when he was a child, years before meeting Lum -when friends and family start receiving invitations to their wedding. After being told that his young bride has grown into a beautiful woman, he agrees to travel to her home planet and meet her. Of course, Lum tries her best to intervene, and make Ataru realise that she is the one he really loves.Despite his questionable behaviour, Ataru is actually quite a likable character; While Ataru has a sleazy side to him, he also has a silly, funny side to him. And as the film progresses his character even shows a fragile, human side seldom seen in the series. Ataru’s character has been a major influence for male leads, especially in harems- but Ataru manages to stand apart from these characters Much of it can be attributed to the work of his excellent seiyuu, Toshio Furukawa, who’s excellent range and distinctive nasally tone really set Ataru apart from the many imitators of that have cropped up over the yearsAlthough Ataru is the lead, Urusei Yatsura\'s most famous character is the lightning powered alien girl, Lum Invader. The image of Lum dressed in her trademark tiger-stripe bikini is so well known, it’s often used to symbolise the anime of the nineteen eighties; or even anime in general.She is also an archetype, and like Ataru has been a major influence on many modern anime characters, displaying hints of some popular character traits today. Her fiery relationship with Ataru has led some to claim she is the original tsundere. However, to refer to Lum as a simple stereotype would be a great injustice to her character; unlike many of her contemporaries, Lum\'s personality feels entirely natural, and not like something included simply appeasing a certain section of the fan base.However, in ""Only You"" Lum\'s character doesn\'t show much development, changing very little over the course of the fikm. While her commitment to Ataru is admirable in its own way, she never seems to doubt his feelings for her. Nor do her feelings for him ever falter, something that feels a bit unrealistic at times. Even so it\'s hard not to feel a bit moved by it sometimes.In those few, precious moments where Urusei Yatsura is not an outrageous wacky comedy, but instead a tender romance- the sweet innocence of Lum’s character is always at the centre of it.The antagonist of the film is a female Alien named Elle, an entirely new character created solely for ""Only You"". Despite being the key to most of the developments in the film, her presence in it is rather limited, leaving her character seems a bit unremarkable, though by the end she proves to be a pretty interesting match for Ataru.The supporting cast of Urusei Yatsura is almost as good as its lead characters, with some of its many members even managing to surpass them. Characters like Ataru\'s former girlfriend Shinobu and her new boyfriend Mendou Shutaro make as large a contribution to the film as Ataru and Lum do. Even minor characters with only brief appearances -such as Ataru\'s Mother- never fail to produce a quick laugh.Casts as good as this are few and far between, and the lengthy run of the TV series is testimony to that. With a run of almost 200 episodes despite having no set story, it\'s long run is a feat that can be attributed solely to the strength of its cast and its outstanding comedy.While the animation in the Urusei Yatsura TV was never that good, it wasn\'t that bad either. Character designs were kept simple and animation sequences were rather plain, but it never felt choppy or poorly made; it was cost effective, rather than low budget.""Only You"" continues this standard, but with the welcome addition of some extra detail. Everything is better drawn; characters, vehicles, backgrounds - the lot. The animation remains plain for the most part, but a few scenes do stand out- the title sequence for example features some interesting perspectives and animation.On the whole, the artwork in ""Only You"" is \'the same, but different\'. The same can be said of the soundtrack.The film’s opening theme is the same as one of the ending themes from the TV series, albeit with a different beat, while it\'s ending theme is identical to another ending theme form the TV series. Much of the backing music and sound effects are also recycled from the TV series, leaving only ""Lum no Ballad"" as the only noteworthy new song.Which makes it all the more fortunate that the Urusei Yatsura soundtrack is so good; sci-fi tinged Eighties pop music with plenty of hooks and catchy lyrics that will have you singing along -broken English intact. The backing tracks are of similar quality, and although they can be a bit limited with instrumentation, they are used effectively, and manage to set the mood perfectly. Even sound effects like Lum\'s ""take off"" noise, which sounds like it was lifted from a 50s B-Movie fits right into place.So, who exactly should watch ""Only You""?It goes without saying that fans of the television series should check it out; it\'s as close as you\'ll get to see the TV series in true movie form. Similarly, if you\'re interested in the TV series but are feeling squeamish about its high episode count, ""Only You"" makes for an excellent taster. The first twenty or so episodes of the TV series are quite slow paced and can be something of a chore to sit through. This film is much like the shows later episodes, making it a good indicator for whether or not Urusei Yatsura will appeal to you.However, keep in mind that the film was intended for people who are already familiar with the TV series, and some characters are given little introduction. This can be a little disorientating given the size of the cast, but most of the characters aren’t essential for understanding the film and the film itself shouldn\'t be too hard to follow.Lastly, the film may be of some interest to fans of its Director, Mamoru Oshii. As his big-screen debut, it’s an important title in Oshii’s history by default. However, fans expecting the serious tone or mature themes of his later works are in for a disappointment. Unlike most of Oshii’s productions, in “Only You” he was not given complete creative control; the result is a film far more mainstream than his later works.Ultimately, if you are seeking something thought provoking, it’s probably not the film you’re looking forl but that’s not to say you should discount it completely.

The story is very well written and is worth a watch. I do suggest you watch this as part of the series, not as a stand alone as it expects you to have a working knowledge of the characters and premise. If you’ve been waiting for some Lum and Ataru romance, you’ll find a bit of it here. Rewatch value: extremely high.Score relative to the series.My Original series score: 10“Only You,” is a fun story that is key in the relationship between Ataru and Lum. It was well...written and easy to follow. There are quite a few gags and classic UY bat-shit insanity that will make this a favorite if you enjoyed the original series. The references to pop-culture are plenty and unmistakable. There are two ways you can look at the movie and get the same level of enjoyment. Like I did on my first watch, you can take the story at face value and find it incredibly entertaining, or you can think about the points it conveys underneath the surface in relation to Ataru.Art is on par with the series and sound would be slightly worse, mostly due to the music which is just okay for this movie when compared to the rest of the series. Voice acting is on par.Characters remain high as they are all well thought out and acted, including the new characters. This movie, although seemingly lighthearted, is an important development point for Ataru. To me, this movie marks the turn in where the tension in Lum and Ataru's relationship stems from.I found this movie highly enjoyable and is a must watch for anyone looking to complete the UY storyline. I would also suggest this be watched in release order. written and easy to follow.

I will say outright that overall I was impressed with what was shown here given how I feel about the show in general.I mean no disrespect to Urusei Yatsura as it is an absolute powerhouse in iconic Japanese culture. The early years of the show are from a VERY dated time however and with that and the show being a regular episodic broadcast there are certain quirks...about it that lose some points with me. What pleased me about this movie was that it definitely embraced that it was a film. The quality of the animation was rather enjoyable, the plot was more or less succinct, and it had a good number of legitimately funny gags.The movies shortcomings were the usual fair I’ve come to expect from the franchise. Ataru the protagonist is an absolute degenerate and I hate him, but on the other hand everyone in the series is kind of terrible which gives it a weird charm. Despite the higher quality animation there are a number of segments that reuse a fair number of animations. It’s more or less understandable as this is from a time where everything was made with cells, but it’s still noticeable. Lastly a grievance I’ve had with the series as a whole so far let alone this movie is that no matter how dramatic things get, that tension is always broken with something that feels cheap. I felt the plot of the film was actually quite sad and could have been something further explored, but nope we gotta revert to our status quo for when the show keeps airing. Can’t have our characters experience any real growth, now can we? Sigh…I really enjoyed some of the musical numbers and I felt they gave the movie some extra push where it needed it.I’ve been enjoying this series as a bit of a Japanese learning tool and to place myself in the shoes of a Japanese generation older than myself. This movie was very fun sitting comfy with a blanket and a bowl of cereal and I look forward to the many others. Just make no mistake, it’s not great, just a longer, higher quality episode of Urusei Yatsura and if you’ve signed up for that you know what you want any way. about it that lose some points with me.

Hopefully these next reviews that I write don\'t become dull and monotonous. Lord give me strength. I\'m going to spoil this movie, by the way. Eleven years prior, a young boy and a young girl meet each other in a playground and play a game of tag with each other. Everything is fine until the young boy steps on the young girl\'s shadow. The young girl tells the boy that on her home planet, if a boy steps on a girl\'s shadow then the two must marry someday. The young...boy agrees to marry the girl someday, not even aware of the concept of marriage. The girl leaves and they never meet again, until eleven years later in present day, present time ha ha ha! The young boy\'s name was Ataru Moroboshi and grew up to be quite the unpleasant person. I\'ve watched a large chunk of Urusei Yatsura up until this point, and I can safely say with absolute confidence that I really hate Ataru. Without going into too much detail, because let\'s be real, if you\'re reading this review you\'ve seen or at least watched some of Urusei Yatsura, Ataru has the tendency to cheat on Lum. He\'s a complete scumbag because he cheats on her right in her face, begs for forgiveness after realizing how much he misses her, they make up, and then a week later he\'s cheating on her again. The dude is oblivious of how lucky he really is and takes advantage of Lum\'s kindness. Which leads to the plot of this film.Anyone with a connection to Ataru in any way is given a letter of invitation to Ataru and Elle\'s wedding. The young girl that Ataru played with all those years ago, her name is Elle, and she is the queen of her own planet. Everyone almost instantly finds out about the wedding, including Lum, and no one is happy about it. Except for Ataru. He\'s ecstatic for the wedding; which is concerning because he has no memory of the promise he made eleven years prior. When meeting with the aliens who work for Elle, Ataru easily accepts his fate to marry Elle while knowing jack diddly shit about her. Lum is understandably pissed about the whole situation, but quickly falls into a depression. The first-third of this film is pretty slow with not much going on. That is until Lum meets Benten, an old friend who convinces Lum to fight and take back Ataru. They even planned a wedding for Ataru and Lum inviting most of the cast from the show. Well, not invite, more like forcefully brought along.The midsection of the film starts to pick up by having a long, intense action scene where spies working for Elle kidnap Ataru. There\'s a brief scene of Ataru talking shit about Lum and how she\'s annoying and persistent all the time, and everyone hears it. What an absolute fuckface. Lum can be annoying at times, but she always means well and has the best intentions. Pretty sad how she fell in love with Fuckface Mcgee and he doesn\'t care half the time. There\'s a scene where Lum is chasing down the spy to rescue Ataru and she didn\'t realize that the ship she was using was going to explode. When it does, Ataru sees this and he\'s immediately concerned. I appreciate this scene because the writing in the series loves to show how terrible of a person Ataru is, but this scene in particular proves that he isn\'t heartless. I like that. Lum is unharmed and it leads to a sweet yet somber song about Ataru and Lum\'s relationship. It was really beautiful and it was a touching moment. And now, we finally meet Elle and honestly, she\'s not as cute as I thought she would be. She mistook Mendo, the rich asshole character, as Ataru and that got a laugh out of me. Elle portrays herself to be a sweet, prim and proper queen. She keeps her Moet et Chandon in her pretty cabinet. ""Let them eat cake,"" she says, just like Marie Antoinette. She seems pleasant, but there\'s a twist. Mendo and Elle split off alone because Elle finds Mendo more attractive than Ataru. She then reveals to Mendo that she has a harem of one hundred thousand handsome men. She keeps them all in a large freezer so she can have an eternal harem. This may come off as nitpicky, but this brings up an issue. If she was a young girl only eleven years ago, how did she have the time to manipulate and capture one hundred thousand men. That\'s physically impossible. She would have to manipulate and capture nine thousand ninety one men a year. And yes, I did the math.9,091 × 11 = 100,001I mean, I\'m a tad bit off, but whatever. The rest of the gang overhear this information and are quickly thrown into prison. From this point forward the movie becomes a ""We have to stop the wedding"" story, and right before Ataru and Elle are officially married, Lum interrupts the wedding and somehow the harem of one hundred thousand men are released. Shit gets wack after this point. The last twenty minutes of the film is insane and it definitely reminds you of an Urusei Yatsura episode, which is something I\'ll get into later.The coolest scene in this entire film was also the shortest. The warp scene! Lum and Benten invade the wedding and try to leave by warping back to Earth. It\'s the only scene I found pretty to look at. Great animation, vivid and bright color choices, and the background looks like an acid trip. In fact, the whole sequence looks like an acid trip. The characters are thrown eleven years in the past do to the warp machine not functioning properly. That makes no sense, but whatever. They soon realize that Ataru never stepped on Elle\'s shadow and fibbed about the whole thing. What a massive fibber. I\'m not entirely sure why, but Elle is devastated to see the truth. At the very end of the film, the characters make their way back to planet Elle and they\'re banished forever. When they make it back to Earth, a new wedding is prepared for Ataru and Lum, and of course, Ataru rejects it. That\'s how the film ends.This was an okay film. My biggest complaint with it is that it felt like a twenty minute episode of the show stretched out to be a one hundred minute feature length film. The production quality of the movie doesn\'t look any better than the actual show. Maybe just slightly higher. The background art looks better and it\'s more detailed, other than that, it looks like an episode of the show. Most of the soundtrack is just music from the show, with the exception of a few new emotional tracks that sound great. The animation, like I said, is just like the show. Things do get a bit crazy near the end, especially with that mob of handsome men. I like this movie, but not all that much. If you like Urusei Yatsura, then just watch it. When I say it\'s just like an episode of the show, it really is just that, exactly. It\'s nothing all that special and the stakes are not that high, because stuff like this happens all the time in the show. Rumiko Takahashi\'s writing is peculiar.

However, I thought the characters were only really okay, but some were better than others, i.e. I really like Lum, but I dislike Ataru.Again, I first watched the movie with zero...prior knowledge of Urusei Yatsura as a series, so this may have hindered my experience watching the movie. prior knowledge of Urusei Yatsura as a series, so this may have hindered my experience watching the movie."", 'Short review, with mild spoilers. Overall, a 7/10. The film captures the pure wackiness of the TV show, and all the characters stay true to form. The animation is a bit better than the TV series, but not much. Nice to have a longer story than the standard 23 minutes, although it could have benefited from some trims here and there. The biggest flaw, though, is the lack of development for our main characters, Lum and Ataru. I am not certain whether this movie is ""canon"", but if it is, then the writers should have taken this opportunity to flesh out our MCs in this...longer format. Assuming the movie is actually episode 58.5, I am still at a loss, this far into the series, as to why Lum loves Ataru so much, to the point of possessiveness. One could argue that the question is nonsensical since this is a comedy, and Lum only got ""married"" to Ataru as a result of a funny misunderstanding. However, through the series (up to and including ep. 58), we\'ve had serious romantic moments between the two. And yet Lum\'s over-devotion is never really explained. Ataru\'s resentment towards Lum has been explained a couple of times: he enjoyed being a Casanova before meeting Lum, and never planned on changing. The ""marriage"" to Lum spoiled his way of life. Despite this, Ataru has come to depend on her for companionship and affection. So we have a contradiction, a mix of feelings within Ataru. And the movie failed to resolve, or at least take steps towards a resolution of, this internal struggle. (Here follows the spoiler) For example, in the first act of the movie, Ataru, through no fault of his own, is tortured by both his high-school friends and Lum for an engagement he was not aware of. With the introduction of Elle, he now has a chance to renounce everything on Earth and start all over with a clean slate in another planet. This would have been a great moment for him to state clearly and decisively his reason for abandoning friends, family... and wife: he is unhappy. We get very close to something like this when he asks Lum: ""If you really love me, then why can\'t you accept the way I live?"". Alas, we get no answer. In the end, both return to the status quo. Nothing was resolved. And this is also my main complaint about the TV series so far (again, up to ep. 58). Nothing wrong with over-the-top episodic silliness, but if we\'re also gonna have serious moments, with the implied promise that our protagonists will develop a strong emotional bonding in the future, then we do need some moral progression. I\'m hoping that this will eventually happen; there are still some 130 episodes left. But if that\'s the case, then this progression is extremely slow! Anyway, ""Only You"" is quite enjoyable as a comedy and an adventure, just don\'t expect much in the way of character development. Think of it as an extended episode. longer format.

Seirei Gensouki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44203/Seirei_Gensouki,"['This anime is good. 10/10 in fact. I too am surprised when i first watched this anime. I mean, who wouldn\'t? In terms of overused materials, this anime got them all. Cliché plots, generic kirito-type character (they even got the same seiyuu wtf), cringe and emo MC, i mean damn, you name it all.But the real reason why i rated this anime a 10/10 is because of the plot itself. It\'s clean, it\'s bland, and it doesn\'t even have any new contribution to the isekai genre. I might have rated this anime a little bit too high but please listen to what i have...to say.This might be a little bit too scientific. If you\'re one of the people who said ""SAO is bad because tons of people say it\'s bad."" then you\'re free to not read this essay.What i want to explain, is about how clean the plot is. You might think it\'s lazy to make such a simple plot, but being simple in the world of infinite possibilities is actually the hardest thing to do. The author brilliantly starts and ends an arc without a single space for the sense of ""uncomfortableness"" to fit in. Yes, it might be cliché, but the cleanest of it is also something we need to give credit to the author. (I mean, making a long story without once making the readers feeling weirded out is extremely hard.)Diving from one arc to another. It\'s really clean that you could even see the plot structure and it\'s especially good if you\'re learning how to write an engaging story. Basically like Nemo and other Disney movies that are also clean and solid in terms of plot structural management, but in anime version.I\'m not the type of person who would say ""try making a story and see how hard it is"". I understand that Seirei Gensouki is lacking in some parts like the art and the sound quality. I also understand that people are trying to find newer and more engaging stories to watch and were certainly disappointed after watching this. But if someone were to ask you how is Seirei Gensouki, you can say ""Yeah it\'s pretty bad but it also got some good points in it"" so you can sound a bit more intelligent. Or don\'t follow my advice im not your mom to say.This might be a little bit too scientific.

I sometimes thought that the anime might be buffering while watching, but then realized that the animation is just so stiff that every scene feels like a still shot. I would occasionally be awoken by the hallowed voice and visage of Kirito, only to realize that no, it's just Rio, who has the same voice actor and a strikingly similar design to everyone's favorite Gary Stu, except worse because the proportions in this anime are awful. I thought I fell asleep from time to time and missed something important since characters...would suddenly be like 5 years older, but then realized that no, it's just the horrible pacing and random time skips.Well, at least the girls are cute, right????? Would be a lot better if they were actually animated decently...This has been my experience with Spirit Cronicles, and as you can probably tell, I'm not a fan. But you'll also be surprised to hear that I think this anime has the potential to actually be decent for what it is.The good news is that I went into this expecting absolutely nothing, and so far, the anime has been able to perfectly live up to my expectations. Yay! Now I actually thought the first episode was pretty alright as it introduced some interesting concepts into this world. I like how the isekai aspect of this series is at least being handled differently. The idea was a little intriguing and I was interested in seeing where things were going. But then the protagonist went to school.Everything about Rio's academy life that didn't involve Claire Celia was the most uninspired, bland writing I've experienced in a work of fiction in awhile. It's just...so bad. You have to watch it to fully understand. Even though the reason behind Rio leaving the school was pretty poor, terribly forced, and completely avoidable, I'm kind of glad he left because it just wasn't going anywhere. The male students are the most stereotypical noble douchebags imaginable and the female students do literally nothing. Luckily, the 2 episodes featuring the school went by quickly (though I hope that isn't a bad sign for the overall pacing of the anime. Ah, who am I kidding, it totally is). These 2 episodes only served to show that our protagonist has the potential to be a completely overpowered character. Hooray...Episode 4 is the best one so far and the reason why I haven't lost faith in this series yet. And no, it's not because Rio acquired an animal girl loli...ok, that's part of it, but it was the execution of it all that pleased me. The combat sequence was actually passable, and Latifa's backstory was well done considering the lore of the series. Yes, it's nothing amazing, but it's a step up from what I've seen previously.The only character who's been good in my mind is Celia. I like her design, personality, and voice actress. Though that's not to say she's great or anything, it's just that Celia actualy has...character. Plus I probably won't forget about her a week after the show ends, though two weeks MIGHT be pushing it. At least that's more than I can say about the rest of the cast thus far. So the author was able to make a cute, white haired waifu girl. Does that alone make the show a resounding success? Yeah probably. But as a boring semi-critic, it's nowhere near enough for me.Quick shout out to the ending theme song which is actually pretty solid. They should have switched it with the opening in order to at least attempt to hype up viewers before watching each episode. But then again, this show's placement of music has been quite questionable, so I shouldn't expect anything. I just don't feel like the songs match up with their corresponding scenes a good portion of the time.I'm not scoring Spirit Cronicles lower yet because I'm an optimist who has hope that the upcoming episodes will be able to improve upon the anime's current shortcomings.

I do find it funny when he asked if he could run faster then it zoomed out like he was jogging lightly.The show itself is a typical Isekai style show but has more connection to the previous world especially as evident in the final episode. I must say the show is very typical throughout and rushes a few bits like the school arc but it isn't that bad necessarily.The art is pretty good...overall, it is very consistent and nicely animated in fight scenes.The OP and ED are both fun, the general sound is good with voices but the combat is a bit hollow.Characters are wide and that means not so developed.

As a genre made famous from the tropes it originated from, the popularity that literally started its rise and downfall with SAO, and the momentum of shows like it has never stopped. Giving us the great likeness of Re:Zero to the horrendous worsts like Isekai Smartphone, there exists an Isekai for everyone, but not all of them are masterpieces of their own right. Seirei Gensouki on the other hand, touts to be just that and more: a carbon copy...of SAO, but there is a major key difference that sets it apart.Let\'s get the similarities out of the way for most of the anime-onlies being simpletons for comparison: Haruto Amakawa a.k.a Rio (in the fantasy world) is pretty much a less-refined version of Kirito, from the behaviour (which looks more lax than said character) to even the costume which looks eerily similar the the Black Swordsman coat. Rio no doubt has a harem of girls kissing up his ass, but just hold that thought for later on.

Which begs the Gary Stu of a character of questioning why wouldn\'t he be rescuing those in danger, but like the others before it, there\'s a very specific reason behind all of this ordeal.If you can get past all the blatant similarities of how Seirei Gensouki is just another work of literate copy-and-paste Isekai tropes, then this is where the proof of the redemption story of novelist Yuri Kitayama\'s writing capabilities lies at: it\'s not just your typical, generic Isekai story plot, but something that will have you going back and forth of reading between the lines of what was presented and piecing those plots together in the span of different timelines. I would like to give a shoutout to Typecero, because this guy is a devout fan of Seirei Gensouki, and most of the analyses done was in no small part his work, and this review is made possible because of his episodic breakdowns which made the big picture clearer between the anime adaptation and its changes when compared to the source material.So, in the beginning, characters do get brutally Isekai-ed in a wayward bus onto an incoming train, but the thing is that the characters in the bus are not one-trick ponies who are just Isekai-ed into the fantasy world. See, for the main character Rio, he isn\'t just some generic Isekai character, but one that\'s of reincarnation and fused with the original person\'s (Haruto Amakawa) memories. An orphan living in the slums of the new world, and wanting to find revenge on the person whom killed his mother at a young age. To make things more complicated, the kidnapping of princesses gets him unequivocally involved (which he saved), which lands him in the walls of royalty for a commoner such as Rio to attend school, only to get ridiculed by the usual hierarchy social status of commoner and arrogant nobles, children or adult, they\'re all the same. Being falsely accused of anything and everything of noble status, Rio is labelled as a fugutive to the point of literally being forced to escape from the Bertram kingdom, which continues smearing his name left and right.It\'s not just Rio who suffers this kind of usual historic barbarism of instigating the superiority of nobles. Take the young fox girl Latifa for example. Like Rio, she was subjected to slavery, and being a tool for the royal family as their controlled assassin to hunt Rio down to kill him when he was forced to flee from the kingdom. Thankfully Rio was able to get her out of her predicament, to which then she followed him on his lone journey, becoming his adoptive sister. If anything (and this might come off as a spoiler) that you should pay attention about, Latifa is one of the passengers on the bus with Rio (the real world Haruto), and she is known as Endo Suzune, another charcter reincarnation into the new world. See, I told you that characters in Seirei Gensouki aren\'t just walking tropes.The thing that\'s so interesting (but sadly generic for a ""prologue"" of sorts) about Seirei Gensouki is the world-building that\'s between characters, the factions within kingdoms and not to mention, Rio\'s ""harem"" of girls that admire him for what he does like Maou Gakuin\'s Anos Voldigoad. Most of the content would already be going into spoilers since the anime\'s plot had one major development skipped that made or broke the overall tone of the series, but I can share a few details while keeping vague. Let\'s take Rio\'s teacher, silver loli Celia Claire for example: she was the one whom took care of Rio when he was being taught at Betram Royal Academy, overseeing his progress to the point of gradually being in love with him. Yes, you saw that right, a teacher-student relationship that built up to a point where the anime resurfaced back again with the passing of timelines to make it relevant. Another significant character is the pink-haired Aishia, whom is Rio\'s spirit of a contractual awakening of a ""special power"", and for better or worse, this is where novel fans went all gaga about her. Because from the time she appeared in the original source material, everything appears to have a drastic change of course within the timeline of its spectrums, and for good reason to shift the tonal direction of the novel. Even villains (or rather antagonists) like noble Charles Arbor accumulated all karma from oppressing Rio at the initial stages of the anime, get their break from being served that under their noses. You see, the various intertwinings of the factions and the characters belonging to the faction they come from, carries the weight of the name they bore, So for Rio to sense any injustice and fight back, he literally cannot do so as it would be treason on the part of the family and people held responsible, not Rio. The dreaded ""harem"" is something that I\'d left must be concerned, because it\'s through the actions that Rio does to infatuate the girls\' hearts, not by sheer looks alone. Rio is admired because he is a hero to them, and ladies fawn to heroes because of this.On that note, I\'d highly recommend you to read the manga or light novel if you\'re interested, because while I cannot cover that much hidden context of what the anime presented, the world of Seirei Gensouki is much larger than life when compared to the anime adaptation. Because while it isn\'t bad, the tropes that we\'ve seen time and time again are the result of compressing such a big story as this from the hands of the production team. Led by veteran director Osamu Yamasaki in both direction, script and series composition, they tried their best to stack as much content, while making some questionable narrative decisions that relegated Seirei Gensouki to the average Isekai lookalike of a show that even novel fans have to concede that it\'s labelled as such. What a disappointment.Other than that, I\'d feel that this is a show where without the knowledge impartation from novel fans, anime-onlies will not feel lost, but just feeling that average, mediocrity of subpar-ness of tropes seen one too many times before, compiled in one complete package that is this show. If you\'re like me, seek out the forum discussion topic that I created explaining all about the adaptation comparison so that everyone can be on the same page. Bear in mind that it\'s full-on spoilers, so watch the anime before reading the hefty few-thousand word episodic essays. At first, I was gonna shrug this show off as just the typical ""not bad, but not good either"" Isekai show, but thanks to people like Typecero, I get to understand this show better a lot and have some appreciation for Yuri Kitayama for a generic story that can go as deep as it could to prove the naysayers wrong. The novel truly has its hardcore fans for reasons such as this.Animation-wise, Seirei Gensouki just exists. Given that this is TMS Entertainment with WAO World for co-production, it just looks fine and nice while smelling that limited budget work. Not spectacular, but as I\'ve mentioned time and time again, it\'s serviceable on all fronts. While I feel jaded that the OST didn\'t really come off as something unique, there is at least some creativity in the OP/ED visuals which are foreshadowing the story. For one, there are 2 versions of the OP: one that you normally see on Crunchyroll, and there\'s the Bilibili version which has the same narrative tone, albeit with a few differences that novel fans (and eagle-eyed anime-onlies) will recognize very subliminally. Are you surprised to hear of this? I bet you were if you\'re paying attention. The songs and the artistes helming them also sound very generic, but Aguri Oonishi\'s ""Elder flower"" for the ED is one hell of a good song. But just like the rest of the show, you\'ve guessed it: it\'s average across the board.Back to the main point, Seirei Gensouki a.k.a Spirit Chroncles won\'t ever break the bank out of the hellhole that is the Isekai genre. And since it originated from the Isekai lands of Syosetu (which is where you\'ll see works like Mushoku Tensei, TenSura etc.), be prepared for some of the most average Isekai tried-and-true formulas just repeatedly conspiring together for a story well short of initial expectations. I also highly doubt that anime-onlies like myself will ever want to read the original source material since the adaptation has some minor missteps that gave it a major disservice. All in all, it\'s the same average and repetitive ""You can pass this show up for better shows"" cliche rhetoric or metaphor, and my hope has already diminished since Day One when this anime started to tingle my bored antennas, that slowly but surely spearheaded into pure disconnect. of SAO, but there is a major key difference that sets it apart.Let\'s get the similarities out of the way for most of the anime-onlies being simpletons for comparison: Haruto Amakawa a.k.a Rio (in the fantasy world) is pretty much a less-refined version of Kirito, from the behaviour (which looks more lax than said character) to even the costume which looks eerily similar the the Black Swordsman coat. Rio no doubt has a harem of girls kissing up his ass, but just hold that thought for later on. Most of the baddie villains are similarly one-toned evil with boisterously filled egos that are meant for the MC to trump justice with good against evil, but most of the time he does nothing against it. Which begs the Gary Stu of a character of questioning why wouldn\'t he be rescuing those in danger, but like the others before it, there\'s a very specific reason behind all of this ordeal.If you can get past all the blatant similarities of how Seirei Gensouki is just another work of literate copy-and-paste Isekai tropes, then this is where the proof of the redemption story of novelist Yuri Kitayama\'s writing capabilities lies at: it\'s not just your typical, generic Isekai story plot, but something that will have you going back and forth of reading between the lines of what was presented and piecing those plots together in the span of different timelines.

It does absolutely nothing new except for some strange elements they added to try to stand out which made it worse for the show it anything.These characters that were reincarnated are in the middle ground of remembering themselves and not, it honestly is a gimmick that makes it worse than just all the sheer amount of generic tropes and cliches that are packed into this show. The art and sound directing are decent at best, very average. The story is about another well-accomplished good looking dude that died in...the most over-exaggerated hilarious bus accident I have ever seen. Like I legit burst out laughing when it happened. Anyways, he is revived, happens to have special powers (1 cliche), happens to just be good at anything he does (2), and is a fucking girl magnet (3). And to top it all off, there is a magic high school where he will most likely be attracting girls like nothing (4). With the mc being packed with all these cliches, he is so one-dimensional it's laughable. Every other character is also so one-dimensional that it's just so dreadful to keep watching. You have that one girl that keeps getting saved, one annoying ass royal ojou-sama wannabe, kids that try to talk shit to mc to bring him down, all these characters exist for one purpose and are literally not developed at all. The only thing that's saving me from putting characters at a 1/10 is the slight mystery aspect with the reincarnations in the middle ground like I mentioned before, but overall, it brings it down as a more pointless gimmick that seems unneccessary anyways and made it worse overall. In summary, Spirit Chronicles is the new isekai that does tries to stand out with this weird gimmick but it makes it worse, not to mention it won't save it from the sheer amount of cliches it already threw in. Don't watch this unless you like to find guilty pleasures or you enjoy trash. the most over-exaggerated hilarious bus accident I have ever seen. Like I legit burst out laughing when it happened.

I really liked it until the second half of the episode. The premise starts of with a pretty standard isekai set up but with a twist that the mc retains the memory of his new host.Everything else feels like superficial. The plot muddens as the story progressed. The anime begins as if a sketchy dude told you he can tell you a story about an isekai story, the story is a bit interesting but then it suddenly feels like he cuts off some important details and adds...some really exaggerated unbelievable crap just to keep your attention.The anime presents itself so you would feel disconnected with the characters. I feel bad for the author of the original source. The director, writer, and editor approved and made this possible.It's such a bummer that even isekai pharmacist feels better compared to this. I'm a trash isekai fan but this is too much. some really exaggerated unbelievable crap just to keep your attention.The anime presents itself so you would feel disconnected with the characters.

I'm a trash isekai fan but this is too much."", '*This review contains any spoilers*This text will be an analogy. Actually, a generalization.What is your favorite food? This can be a difficult question. In fact, it is a varied subject and depends on many external and internal factors, personal tastes, experiences and expectations. Anyway, imagine that you have the opportunity to eat the same thing every day.Well, this is somewhat of a dream. Who wouldn\'t want to spend a moment of their life overindulging in what they like most? I myself feel that it is something unique and that this utopia would be nice eventually. However, think how nauseating it can be to live...with the same thing over and over again. It is uncomfortable, isn\'t it? Now think that this analogy resembles Seirei Gensouki, a show that started out delivering interesting ideas and was managing to be a good (almost utopian) experience, but that lost its rhythm, got out of hand, and is now another one of the animes that today is just... cloying.To begin with, Seirei Gensouki starts out like many other shows of the genre and of light novel adaptations of isekai: a boy who, with a noble and honorable occurrence, changes his life and becomes a special person in a Kingdom of his Universe. Saving the princess was something unexpected for the character who still had memories of his past life, but this first stage follows with a chance at the Royal Academy, becoming a respectable person, even with the interpersonal problems and scorns by other classmates.Oh, I forgot to mention that in his other life, Rio (""Haruto"" in the real world) died as a result of a bus accident, with two other girls. One of these girls was apparently the same person with whom Rio was friends in the past. Well, fate prevented this reunion from happening amicably. Generic, no? However, even with these simple and expected archetypes, the show was not exposed in a negative way at first. In fact, it really felt like a utopia this introduction. The anime inserted a teacher named Celia as Rio\'s tutor while he learned for 5 years, from reading and writing, to the art of fighting and social etiquette. The universe of the show is a medieval fantasy, but it possessed its beauty, even if this very beauty was more evident than the story of the show itself. All expectations were projected to build 12 episodes that would guarantee a good experience, right? Wrong!!!What if Rio has some trouble along the way and ends up escaping from Bertram\'s Kingdom? Well, that\'s what happens. The monotony and coexistence nurtured for five years within the story collapses at an unexpected moment. Flora, the same princess saved by Rio in the past, is saved in a near disaster during a test, by Rio. The problem is... Rio starts to be accused by evil people of being the very culprit of this incident. Rio then decides to flee the kingdom and begins his adventure, far from his classmates and especially far from his teacher Celia, his best friend during all his life. This kind of thing was quite unexpected frankly. For those who remember, Rio had already been through moments like this and it would not be very difficult to reverse the situation and graduate from the school. Even so, he did not wait and continued to follow his own path.The protagonist really was unfortunate to make this illogical choice, yet Rio was never a meddlesome character or one who conveyed scenes where he turned into a ""two-face."" His courtesy and formality is a unique trait and one that captivated me throughout the show. Celia also had her charisma and striking presence that enveloped the story, even though she was far removed from the events surrounding the anime.Time passes and Rio is attacked by Latifa, a slave girl ordered to kill him, but who is saved by himself from this cruel fate. Latifa is a demi-human, yet another common element in isekais today. Over time, their trust and trustworthiness becomes a relationship between two brothers and they spend time together, until they find a region where other demi-humans live in harmony. This is an interesting moment, as it is in this place where Rio is able to discover more about his amazing powers.Rio then goes on to live a life where living still was impossible, after all, the character had one objective: to visit the place where his mother was born and who had promised to take him, if she were alive. There, in this village, more friendships and relationships made Rio known as a humble young man who always liked to help people.His strength and affinity with various types of fighting is a unique ability that had a fair highlight at the time it was introduced, and the existence of a Spirit that made a pact with Rio is the cause of this being a story recounted in the future. And this is where I begin to question the show.So far, Rio thought little of remembering what he experienced in the real world, much less wanted to know what occurred so that it was his main goal. As much as he wanted to, his honesty was enough to convince him that it was something beyond his own control. Then the unexpected occurs. During his return to the Kingdom of Bertram, Rio is contextualized about an unexpected political marriage. And this involves his teacher and dear friend, Celia, and one of the knights who mistreated Rio for a long time in the past, when he was still a suspect in the kidnapping of Flora, the princess. As much as the anime tried to make the story more intriguing, it was rushed, forced, and purposefully moved to end open-ended without much explanation.I don\'t know what really went on in the heads of the staff at TMS studio (the same as Dr. Stone, Furuba, Takagi-san, and other always interesting titles), but the story\'s inability to possess a longer pacing time hampered the realization of this outcome. Even though the ending was a moment of glory for Rio managing to help Celia and not getting married and fleeing the Kingdom, yet another new context is invested in order to progress the story, but it was a deplorable execution.Remember the bus accident and the two girls who were with Rio on this fateful day? Well, Latifa was one of them and the other was still far away from Rio. However, a great amount of power appears without much explanation and Rio, advised by his Spirit (who is now called Aishia), helps a group of humans who have also been summoned into this fantasy world. The problem is that one of the girls is possibly Rio\'s best friend and... the show ends.Yes, the show ends. Nothing happens to explain the last 5 minutes, there is nothing to explain the blue-haired man\'s goals about the Kingdom, there is no conclusion. The show ended in a pathetic, immature way and was pretty much left aside, as if we, the viewers, had to continue the story for ourselves.Look, I know that the Light Novel has more plot and that the anime has its reasons, but this kind of thing really is a disappointment. It\'s not bad to put the anime at a point where it can move on without losing momentum, but when Seirei Gensouki is planned to end this way without a precise sequel announcement, we have problems. It is clear that the project wants to continue, but this moment has drastically shaken the future of the show, as the reception towards this has not been good. In fact, for an anime that started out average and was doing well, continuing to improve would be a must, which in fact did not happen.I don\'t really blame the studio entirely for this, much less the author of the original material, but it is a really uncomfortable feeling to wonder what could have been done instead. Some filler episodes, some side story, but that would help and not give the feeling of wasted time, but in the end it will be a utopia again.Seirei Gensouki was a decent production and one that I recognize the value it had during its time here this season, but unfortunately it is another one of the animes that you can compare to a favorite food. You love it, you love it, you always want to be enjoying it even though you know it can be bad for your health and cause nausea, but you still have hope that it will be profitable, just like isekais, just like Seirei Gensouki. Whether we will ever have a show that can again have such a chance I don\'t know, but until then you have to accept the deep sadness that is a show being wasted by the end of time. with the same thing over and over again. It is uncomfortable, isn\'t it?

Even though the ending was a moment of glory for Rio managing to help Celia and not getting married and fleeing the Kingdom, yet another new context is invested in order to progress the story, but it was a deplorable execution.Remember the bus accident and the two girls who were with Rio on this fateful day? Well, Latifa was one of them and the other was still far away from Rio. However, a great amount of power appears without much explanation and Rio, advised by his Spirit (who is now called Aishia), helps a group of humans who have also been summoned into this fantasy world. The problem is that one of the girls is possibly Rio\'s best friend and... the show ends.Yes, the show ends. Nothing happens to explain the last 5 minutes, there is nothing to explain the blue-haired man\'s goals about the Kingdom, there is no conclusion. The show ended in a pathetic, immature way and was pretty much left aside, as if we, the viewers, had to continue the story for ourselves.Look, I know that the Light Novel has more plot and that the anime has its reasons, but this kind of thing really is a disappointment. It\'s not bad to put the anime at a point where it can move on without losing momentum, but when Seirei Gensouki is planned to end this way without a precise sequel announcement, we have problems. It is clear that the project wants to continue, but this moment has drastically shaken the future of the show, as the reception towards this has not been good. In fact, for an anime that started out average and was doing well, continuing to improve would be a must, which in fact did not happen.I don\'t really blame the studio entirely for this, much less the author of the original material, but it is a really uncomfortable feeling to wonder what could have been done instead. Some filler episodes, some side story, but that would help and not give the feeling of wasted time, but in the end it will be a utopia again.Seirei Gensouki was a decent production and one that I recognize the value it had during its time here this season, but unfortunately it is another one of the animes that you can compare to a favorite food. You love it, you love it, you always want to be enjoying it even though you know it can be bad for your health and cause nausea, but you still have hope that it will be profitable, just like isekais, just like Seirei Gensouki. Whether we will ever have a show that can again have such a chance I don\'t know, but until then you have to accept the deep sadness that is a show being wasted by the end of time.', 'This anime is what I live for, Im so happy right now. Need a season 2,3,4,5 asap.Plot 10/10One of the best isekai animes out there with a unique twist. The characters retain their memories from both japan and the new fantasy world. The mc was really well made with his cool and dashing personality. Combining romance , action, some revenge and harem, this is one of my favourite isekai anime out there to date.Art 10/10The animation for this is just top notch, no other words are needed.The music is great too.Enjoyment 10/10Overall, I enjoyed this a lot . Highly recommended. ', ""If you're looking for a high-quality, thought-provoking anime that will leave you feeling intellectually fulfilled, then Serei Gensouki is definitely not for you. This show is the trashiest of trash, and I mean that in the best possible way.From the awful animation to the nonsensical plot, Serei Gensouki is a hot mess of epic proportions. The characters are all one-dimensional caricatures, and the dialogue is cringeworthy at best. But somehow, despite all of its flaws, I couldn't NOT look away every 5 minutes. I was so mesmerized by the trainwreck unfolding before me that I just had to keep watching.In conclusion, Serei Gensouki is a...must-watch for anyone who loves terrible anime. It's the perfect blend of trashy goodness and pure entertainment. 10/10 would recommend to all trash aficionados. must-watch for anyone who loves terrible anime.

One would think they made this to compete for the title of the worst anime of the decade, if not of all time. The characters act less human than the average fly on the wall, the art is bland and boring and the story is less interesting than watching paint dry. I usually don't think one should write a review until the show/season is complete as the ending will often change one's perspective on an anime. However there is no hope left for Seirei Gensouki, so heed my warning; do not, under...any circumstance, watch this pile of garbage. any circumstance, watch this pile of garbage."", 'After seeing all the other reviews dunking so hard on this show, I almost passed up trying to watch any of it.I\'m glad I did decide to watch though.While there may not be anything particularly amazing or noteworthy about the show, as an isekai junkie, this show is a very smooth watch.The main character isn\'t a moody jerk, nor does he do anything particularly fantastic.But if you like watching a ""hero\'s journey"" and finding out what the character can do and how he handles situations, there is a fun watch here.Will I ever turn around and point to this anime as...something worth going out of your way to see? Probably not. But if you find you like Isekai shows, this is one of the better new ones this year, and can scratch that itch until Shield Hero starts up again.Don\'t let the bad reviews cause you to miss out on giving this a chance. something worth going out of your way to see?

With limited episodes to cover the source material is a major handicap.

This isn't shounen after all.I would give this anime an 8(ofc inflated) because of the art, decent execution, and overall enjoyment factor lives to some extent.Character development,...Story is definitely not in this anime and that's because it is made with a key role to satisfy that isekai adventuring genre of anime and it does well.

Rather than feeling like you're following along for the ride, feeling the hardships along the MC, it's like you're listening to someone tell the story about their D&D character that never really had to struggle for much. Rio just takes everything in stride, and never actually loses. The one thing that made him interesting, his backstory in the alternate world, could've been reflected somewhere in the story at some point, but they never utilize it.There's some interesting worldbuilding and characters to play around with,...but the story focuses so much on Rio we never really get a chance to see where any of it could go, which is really unfortunate.

Give it a watch once and see if you like it.Story:...Its an Isekai which follows a boy who died and his spirit fused or took over a boy of another world. To be honest it seems like another Isekai fantasy, but the story is interesting to an extent. Like he has a goal, a journey, a nation is pretty much against him. He makes a ton of friends. Most are girls which would make you think it's a harem anime, but it all mainly platonic it seems. Like they're just friends. At most a diet harem if that's even the right way to describe it lol. I'm kinda interested to see him prove his OPness to his classmates, and I honestly think that's what's keeping me around. But it has some other elements that are keeping me around not to sure, but I like this anime. It's not like way up there as a favorite, but it's alright.Art: Let's spend most of the budget on eyes and the hair, making the characters look great, but animation mediocre. Like I love the looks of the characters, but those animations can be stiff sometimes. The only thing that bothers me is Kirito clone lol. I mean he got story which is why I'm not minding it, but can't help but to think Kirito at times.Sound: Eh op and Ed are alright, but nothing I'd listen to on repeat.Characters: They have some uniqueness, but I feel the most unique one was probably the little sister demi-human had the most character development so far because of her backstory.

Literally 90% of the comment section for each new episode that airs for the isekai is just a hate thread).If you want my advice, Seirei is worth watching...and you will enjoy it if you keep your negative attitude out of the equation.

I hope one day these hate watchers will take new Isekai\'s that air for granted.9/10, cant wait for Season 2.', ""It's pretty bad, I would say maybe watch if you enjoy watching bad shows just to see the multitude of ways they manage to be bad. You can see the cracks in the first episode, and every episode after that the show almost seems like it's about to take off and it constantly whiffs.This show had some cool character designs and at times it was endearing enough that if it actually went somewhere it could have been a mediocre but okay show. But the plot development is extremely poor and the show wastes a lot of your time doing nothing of interest for a...while. Then in the last couple episodes there is not enough time for the show to properly end. Nothing much gets resolved and nothing really feels worth resolving. The end is not satisfying and leaves as much open as possible for a second season which I don't think will happen and even if it did I'm sure it will just pick up with some random time wasting that makes the season 1 cliffhanger completely pointless. As soon as something interesting starts going on you can totally rely on this show to not follow through and turn it into a waste of time.In a sense the show starts off as an adventure, but the motivation behind the first goal is not enough to get the viewer interested.  Then when the journey ends somewhere halfway into the show, the protagonist goes on a revenge plot, which comes out of nowhere because the protagonist has never shown any emotion or reason to desire revenge until the second he learns there is someone to get revenge on. Then that plot just disappears entirely, if you didn't watch that episode you wouldn't even know because that plot point is never referenced after that episode. It feels very haphazard. More like a loose collection of events than a story.The characters are all fairly one dimensional and none of them develop. The MC acts in a way that you never know what he's thinking except for the two times in the show that he says it out loud. They killed every potential that he had in order to make him a self insert. By the way, I would have never thought to call this a harem if I didn't see the tag. I would watch other shows for that, nothing really happens to call this a harem. And also the MC has still not gotten over the crush he had on a girl that rejected him IN A PAST LIFE. Even after meeting multiple new romantic interests in his new life over the many years during the show he is still thinking about her. It almost feels like the writer of the show felt like he was rejected only a couple hours ago because that's when the flashback happened, but in the setting of the show it has been way too long to still care.There's also the power fantasy aspect of the self insert, as the MC is pretty much just a one man army, but the system of powers/techniques is not well explained and doesn't make much sense. Also you never see him training despite him saying he has always kept it up. They also say like 30 times in the first couple episodes that the MC can't use magic, but it's never explained why. But he can use seirei jutsu, which is not magic, but other people can't use it, but it functions essentially like magic. I think the fighting is not that satisfying, as you never see the MC overcome a physical challenge. He mostly wins fights easily against overwhelmingly weaker opponents, and there is never really any threats, so it's not a great show if you're into the fighting and power scaling stuff.There's tons of other small things that really don't make sense and it just kind of makes me incredulous. If you reincarnated, and you were one of the two people that remembers your past life, and you met the other one, and you recognized them because you died in the same accident, you would not spend years around this person before it randomly comes up in conversation. What a ridiculous plot point, which by the way is pointless and nothing ever comes of it, I guess it's just a bad excuse for one of the characters to call him oni-san. I'm not sure what they were thinking when writing this show. It's just kind of a mess that chooses not to redeem itself. Truly bad in a way that feels intentional at many times. And it's not even a fan service or funny. 0/10, waste of fairly decent animation and artwork for this script. while. Then in the last couple episodes there is not enough time for the show to properly end. Nothing much gets resolved and nothing really feels worth resolving. The end is not satisfying and leaves as much open as possible for a second season which I don't think will happen and even if it did I'm sure it will just pick up with some random time wasting that makes the season 1 cliffhanger completely pointless. As soon as something interesting starts going on you can totally rely on this show to not follow through and turn it into a waste of time.In a sense the show starts off as an adventure, but the motivation behind the first goal is not enough to get the viewer interested.  Then when the journey ends somewhere halfway into the show, the protagonist goes on a revenge plot, which comes out of nowhere because the protagonist has never shown any emotion or reason to desire revenge until the second he learns there is someone to get revenge on. Then that plot just disappears entirely, if you didn't watch that episode you wouldn't even know because that plot point is never referenced after that episode. It feels very haphazard. More like a loose collection of events than a story.The characters are all fairly one dimensional and none of them develop. The MC acts in a way that you never know what he's thinking except for the two times in the show that he says it out loud. They killed every potential that he had in order to make him a self insert. By the way, I would have never thought to call this a harem if I didn't see the tag. I would watch other shows for that, nothing really happens to call this a harem. And also the MC has still not gotten over the crush he had on a girl that rejected him IN A PAST LIFE. Even after meeting multiple new romantic interests in his new life over the many years during the show he is still thinking about her. It almost feels like the writer of the show felt like he was rejected only a couple hours ago because that's when the flashback happened, but in the setting of the show it has been way too long to still care.There's also the power fantasy aspect of the self insert, as the MC is pretty much just a one man army, but the system of powers/techniques is not well explained and doesn't make much sense. Also you never see him training despite him saying he has always kept it up. They also say like 30 times in the first couple episodes that the MC can't use magic, but it's never explained why. But he can use seirei jutsu, which is not magic, but other people can't use it, but it functions essentially like magic. I think the fighting is not that satisfying, as you never see the MC overcome a physical challenge. He mostly wins fights easily against overwhelmingly weaker opponents, and there is never really any threats, so it's not a great show if you're into the fighting and power scaling stuff.There's tons of other small things that really don't make sense and it just kind of makes me incredulous.

However, I did try to find sources that can explain the differences between WN, LN, and the anime series for a clearer, overall, understanding of this series - albeit the relevant sections that the anime covers. This review will (strictly) be covering the anime but will consider the differences between the different media, such as the LN and WN based on my own understanding and interpretation. Feel free to disagree since I admit that I do not have all the information and I am aware that not reading...the original material (i.e. the LN and WN) might make my review less convincing.*For this series the MC will be used interchangeably for the character that has been isekaied and the character that hosts all of the MC\'s memories.Story: The story of this anime starts with an interesting concept for a reincarnation isekai genre where the main character (MC*) behaves (mentally) different from other reincarnation isekai genre MC\'s. This is because the reincarnation isekai genre (so far) makes the MC; preserve both memory and (physical) body, inhabit another body and preserve their memories, or inhabit another body and lose their memories, when going to another world. However, there is not much anime that tackle the question of the MC having to inhabit another person\'s body whilst the host memories are still retained. This gives the impression that the story will be about how the MC and host resolve their own identity considering that the host suddenly receives memories (from the MC) and believes they are his own despite not having experienced any of those events. However, its execution on this front was unsatisfactory since it focused more on the adventure where the MC meets relevant characters instead of his mental state. I am aware the LN also contains the adventure part so this is not a saying it\'s an error but more on its poor method of execution on the main theme of the story, i.e. the mental state of the MC confirming his identity.From my understanding, the entire first season of this anime should be the prologue according to people who read the LN (from what I gathered is 3 volumes long!!) but the irony is that the anime does not convey this at all. The story starts the series when the MC was in his childhood but then quickly moves to his adolescent state after two episodes. This gives the impression that the ""prologue"" was over and we were already in the main storyline. The main cause of this impression was a lack of an in-depth narration and/or monologue from the MC since understanding the mental state and goals of the MC gives a clearer idea to the viewer what events have to transpire for the MC to attain their goal. Even more so for this series since the MC has to come to terms with the ""extra"" memories that he does not fully understand. It was clear (after knowing this was meant to be a prologue) that the adventuring was meant to be an exposition for the MC so the viewer has a better understanding of his character, ability, his two different memories (and arguably their two personalities), and their background. This implies the next season may start focusing on the identity issue for the MC and host where the host will start to get confused about who he is considering he has two sets of memories (and personalities) from one being on Earth and one is in the current (isekai) world. As a result, the story left an unsatisfactory feeling where important information/insight on the MC\'s mental and emotional growth is left in an unknown state.Character: As mentioned in the story section the main point of the story was to explore the identity crisis of the MC, but the anime conveyed very little information about it. The main reason was that the MC was introduced to us (the viewer) in his childhood and after two episodes (of going through education) he becomes an adolescent young man BUT we are not given how much the MC has adapted to his new memories nor his emotional state on the matter. His outer appearance always delivered a calm and mature outlook of life and makes it seem that he has sorted out the memory issue but later in the story, we become aware that he is still trying to cope with them. Moreover, the lack of information on how the MC copes with his new memories (and the new personality) makes some of his actions when interacting with other characters (during his adventure) questionable since we do not understand the choices he makes. For example, he turns down on a girl who wants to travel with him on his adventure despite the fact he is only traveling to figure out his past. You can argue that there are dangers to the girl if she wasn\'t prepared but the anime made it clear that he is powerful enough to protect her and she was aware of the dangers of traveling and yet he still doesn\'t allow it. As a result, for the first half of the series, you are always trying to figure out why he acts the way he does and whether this has any relation to his identity crisis until midway through you are given his background, origin, and motivation and then it becomes clear that all of his actions has little do with his identity and more to do with his motivation (his revenge). The lack of the MC\'s monologue on his emotional state makes his character quite boring and confusing and even after knowing his motivation (which is revenge) it still makes him boring since we are unsure how his other persona (the isekaied MC) feels about it. In addition, we get to see other characters (predominately females) interact with the MC and this should also contribute to his emotional state (since he has two personas) but again we have a lack of information about it making it seem that both personas have similar values, which is not the case by the last few episodes. Thus, creating confusion on the situation of the MC\'s mental (and emotional) state between the two personas.As for the other characters, they are quite one-dimensional since it is very easy to identify which characters will either be friends or enemies to the MC without any grey areas so to speak, such as being frenemies or spies, etc. Therefore, it becomes easy to identify characters that are villains and allies and characters that may become his romantic interests. Although considering this is the prologue of the story, it is possible that these one-dimensional characters are meant to set the stage for new characters that could actually endanger the MC where he needs his allies to aid him. Otherwise, the story would become very linear with a very predictable plot and very simplistic story where it is easy to foresee the MC will always be placed on the pedestal where his identity crisis makes him more special rather than being detrimental.Art and Sound: For the music, I do not have any problems with the OP, ED, or OST but I do have issues with the art (or in this case the animation). The animation was very noticeable when looking at the fight scenes throughout the series. All of them show a very simplistic (to borderline lazy) representation of the MC fights with difficult foes. Such as, the sword swings the MC uses to cut through the body of large beasts or the MC\'s hand-to-hand combat against powerful foes makes it very noticeable the animation for these motions was done with a lack of understanding of how the body interacts with such dynamic movement. As a result, the fights feel lackluster and quite amateurish which downgrades the supposed difficulty (or ease) the MC should be experiencing when he is fighting.Overall: The anime takes a very interesting approach to the reincarnation isekai genre where it is rare to see the MC having an identity issue in regards to both the MC (isekaied) and host\'s memories preserved. However, the anime executed this topic poorly leaving a very unsatisfying feeling. Both the story and characters did not deliver the importance of this identity crisis and it was left in the air until the last few episodes where it becomes apparent the MC\'s and host\'s personalities have different values and this becomes clearer near the end of the series. Luckily, there is a second season so it may be possible that the anime will do better considering the ""prologue"" of the series is now over. Furthermore, the last episode introduced us to other (spoilers) isekaiers thus providing potential character development for the MC by comparing him to the others based on their adaptation to this new world - as long as these other isekaied characters are not one dimensional. the original material (i.e. the LN and WN) might make my review less convincing.*For this series the MC will be used interchangeably for the character that has been isekaied and the character that hosts all of the MC\'s memories.Story: The story of this anime starts with an interesting concept for a reincarnation isekai genre where the main character (MC*) behaves (mentally) different from other reincarnation isekai genre MC\'s.

It was clear (after knowing this was meant to be a prologue) that the adventuring was meant to be an exposition for the MC so the viewer has a better understanding of his character, ability, his two different memories (and arguably their two personalities), and their background. This implies the next season may start focusing on the identity issue for the MC and host where the host will start to get confused about who he is considering he has two sets of memories (and personalities) from one being on Earth and one is in the current (isekai) world. As a result, the story left an unsatisfactory feeling where important information/insight on the MC\'s mental and emotional growth is left in an unknown state.Character: As mentioned in the story section the main point of the story was to explore the identity crisis of the MC, but the anime conveyed very little information about it. The main reason was that the MC was introduced to us (the viewer) in his childhood and after two episodes (of going through education) he becomes an adolescent young man BUT we are not given how much the MC has adapted to his new memories nor his emotional state on the matter. His outer appearance always delivered a calm and mature outlook of life and makes it seem that he has sorted out the memory issue but later in the story, we become aware that he is still trying to cope with them. Moreover, the lack of information on how the MC copes with his new memories (and the new personality) makes some of his actions when interacting with other characters (during his adventure) questionable since we do not understand the choices he makes. For example, he turns down on a girl who wants to travel with him on his adventure despite the fact he is only traveling to figure out his past. You can argue that there are dangers to the girl if she wasn\'t prepared but the anime made it clear that he is powerful enough to protect her and she was aware of the dangers of traveling and yet he still doesn\'t allow it. As a result, for the first half of the series, you are always trying to figure out why he acts the way he does and whether this has any relation to his identity crisis until midway through you are given his background, origin, and motivation and then it becomes clear that all of his actions has little do with his identity and more to do with his motivation (his revenge). The lack of the MC\'s monologue on his emotional state makes his character quite boring and confusing and even after knowing his motivation (which is revenge) it still makes him boring since we are unsure how his other persona (the isekaied MC) feels about it. In addition, we get to see other characters (predominately females) interact with the MC and this should also contribute to his emotional state (since he has two personas) but again we have a lack of information about it making it seem that both personas have similar values, which is not the case by the last few episodes. Thus, creating confusion on the situation of the MC\'s mental (and emotional) state between the two personas.As for the other characters, they are quite one-dimensional since it is very easy to identify which characters will either be friends or enemies to the MC without any grey areas so to speak, such as being frenemies or spies, etc. Therefore, it becomes easy to identify characters that are villains and allies and characters that may become his romantic interests. Although considering this is the prologue of the story, it is possible that these one-dimensional characters are meant to set the stage for new characters that could actually endanger the MC where he needs his allies to aid him. Otherwise, the story would become very linear with a very predictable plot and very simplistic story where it is easy to foresee the MC will always be placed on the pedestal where his identity crisis makes him more special rather than being detrimental.Art and Sound: For the music, I do not have any problems with the OP, ED, or OST but I do have issues with the art (or in this case the animation). The animation was very noticeable when looking at the fight scenes throughout the series. All of them show a very simplistic (to borderline lazy) representation of the MC fights with difficult foes. Such as, the sword swings the MC uses to cut through the body of large beasts or the MC\'s hand-to-hand combat against powerful foes makes it very noticeable the animation for these motions was done with a lack of understanding of how the body interacts with such dynamic movement. As a result, the fights feel lackluster and quite amateurish which downgrades the supposed difficulty (or ease) the MC should be experiencing when he is fighting.Overall: The anime takes a very interesting approach to the reincarnation isekai genre where it is rare to see the MC having an identity issue in regards to both the MC (isekaied) and host\'s memories preserved. However, the anime executed this topic poorly leaving a very unsatisfying feeling. Both the story and characters did not deliver the importance of this identity crisis and it was left in the air until the last few episodes where it becomes apparent the MC\'s and host\'s personalities have different values and this becomes clearer near the end of the series. Luckily, there is a second season so it may be possible that the anime will do better considering the ""prologue"" of the series is now over. Furthermore, the last episode introduced us to other (spoilers) isekaiers thus providing potential character development for the MC by comparing him to the others based on their adaptation to this new world - as long as these other isekaied characters are not one dimensional.', 'If you are bored of isekai, this probably isn´t a show you should watch.While yes, it is a little generic that doesn´t make it bad.It has a unique take on reincarnation which i personaly enjoyed and if you haven´t seen a lot of anime or perhaps you like the easy to watch shows this show will put a smile on your face.

I also won\'t organize this like a typical review. I will simply talk about what I liked and what I didn\'t like. Also, since I\'m not knowledgeable on academic terms for more obscure anime-related archetypes, I will coin them as I go along. Also, this review is very subjective (notice all the first person); however, I do provide reasonings for my opinions, so please stick around.Sometimes I find myself in a perpetual cycle of consuming isekai anime. To be more specific, by ""find,"" I do not mean ""become"" as much as...I mean ""notice."" It is a genre that I am familiar with (to a some extent), so I enjoy being amused by all the small details I see in the new isekai releases. This title in particular has quite a few of them that I\'d like to talk about.I noticed that the ""loli magic teacher"" character archetype is getting quite popular these days. It\'s really something you only see in ""reincarnation-type"" isekais, but I don\'t remember seeing them before last year. I enjoy this character archetype because it is a clever blend of the ""childhood friend"" and ""magic teacher"" archetypes to bring out the appeals of both in an additive way. My only qualm is how easily these types of characters fall for the main character because they seem like a type of character who would be more interesting if they would show some independence from the main character. This archetype more so than other archetypes with that similar characteristic. For me, that\'s the only downfall.I also found the Japanese village quite an exciting change of scenery. The only other isekai I remember doing this is Re:Zero during Arc 5 (not yet in anime form as of writing this). I enjoy this because I watch anime because I enjoy Japan. Seeing more Japanese scenery is a plus. Also, the likeable characters during this part were quite likeable, even if the character dramas never really went anywhere.The part of this anime that sticks out the most is how the main protagonist retained both their ""before"" and ""after"" memories. This idea was explored in a sort-of melodramatic way as the author isn\'t a literary master (and that\'s really what it takes to get a unique idea like this right on the first try). Since this release is quite small, I\'m not sure if this idea will go anywhere, but I\'d like to see how it develops in the future.I also found it strange how the ""noble bullies"" archetype was never a primary focus of the show. Instead, the relationship between the protagonist, his teacher, and himself were the primary focuses. As a result, the bullying could be considered as a sort of ""setting"" perhaps. This might just be a result of how common that trope usually plays out, but it is still something I found interesting to think about.All of these small things make isekais enjoyable to think about.

I\'ve read the manga and light novel of this show so I know how it is. At first, I was telling myself not to read the novel of Seirei Gensouki after reading the manga because I really thought that it would just be another typical isekai. Then, the announcement of the anime came out so I thought to myself ""This show is getting an anime adaptation?"" and  told myself not to watch the anime since it wouldn\'t be great anyway.After some time, I ran...out of novels to read and I got curious about seirei gensouki. I was curious as to how it sold a lot of copies. So I thought, it might be a good read. At the first few volumes, I was really bored about the story.

I was disappointed with how the third episode was animated. The fourth episode\'s animation was great. The fifth, a little lacking but it was great.

I will not say it is a bad show, but it is certainly not a good show. The writers didn't intend for it to be great probably. Just a corporate money-grab in the booming isekai anime market.A perfect show to go brain dead to and just let play. Perfectly predicable, completely average, comfortably...unsurprising.

It\'s so cool that it is absolutely heart-rending that the anime that presents this premise is just such shamefully self-indulgent uninspired harem trash (and I\'m no harem-hater, there are legitimate amazing harem anime, but this deserves the \'trash\' label wholeheartedly).When I say ""Isekai where the guy from our world doesn\'t just magically reincarnate, but actually has his soul and memories fused into a pre-existing person from the \'other world\', forming essentially...a new person with the memories of both and a personality that combines the two"", do you get excited by that prospect?

I\'d rather spare myself the unhappiness of focusing only on the cons, and try to focus on the pros as well. With no regrets, I\'d say that Seirei Gensouki deserves a 5/10.I gaze upon such a low score, and ask: Why is that? Well the answer is quite simple. The story pretty much has no direction.The show started off fairly well, as the Rio (the main character) is Isekai\'d to this new world...as a poor orphan in the kingdom\'s slums. As he started to form relationships, climb the ranks, and gain more power and recognition, the story was truly beginning to develop.Then all of a sudden, poof. He gets framed for a ridiculous reason, leaves the kingdom, and then embarks on a journey to where his parents are from, which was his original goal, or rather, the original goal of the body that he had begun to inhabit. Once he had completed his goal, there was just nothing else for him to do. The story relied on the pointless side characters that had been introduced previously to add new goals for him, but at that point, the new goals weren\'t even really ""goals."" It was just ""filler"" to give Rio things to do.In addition, the pacing was quite horrendous. A two year time gap would be glossed over like nothing had happened, which puzzles me just a bit. I think we all know that two years is quite some time, so it just feels ludicrous to have such a long period of time hold almost no weight.With all of that said, the world building was quite pleasing. It\'s easy to feel like you are part of the world as Rio traveled the land. From the fictitious magic and spirit art systems in place to the realistically historical kingdoms mirroring the olden days of Europe and Japan, the setting had developed quite nicely in only twelve episodes.I enjoyed this anime as a casual anime, but it didn\'t stick out to me as much as I hoped it would. If you\'re looking to expand your knowledge of possible stories and ideas out there, I would recommend watching this as that was the main reason that I had decided to do so.

This review is going to focus more on the fundamental pros and cons of the show and less on each arc and episode as I feel like that would make this review 10x longer.When I say that this show has an interesting premise and lots of potential, I mean it. I haven\'t read the light novel series but I\'ve read up on some of the lore from it and I really think that with the...right kind of skill and talent, this could be the next Rising of the Shield Hero. Unfortunately, it did not have the right skill or talent. In fact, I\'m kind of having a hard time trying to think of anything genuinely positive to say about the anime itself. That isn\'t to say that I think the show is complete garbage, I still think it\'s at least worth watching when you\'re bored. I just wish that this IP was given to a better studio that has the ability to properly adapt it to its fullest potential. Before we get into the actual pros and cons I want to say right off the bat that because I have not read the light novel series, I will be coming into this purely from the perspective of the anime.PROS:1. The setting of this fantasy world is pretty well developed. Though we never actually see any physical map of the land, you get a good idea of where the different nations are and how they interact with each other. Within the limited scope of the show itself we only get to see about five different places: Beltrant, Amande, Seirei no Tami, and a couple places in the Yagumo region, all of which sort of line up west to east respectively. I feel like more fantasy shows, especially isekai ones, should to take the time to establish the lay of the land and really push the feel that it\'s a living, breathing world.2. The premise of how Haruto, the main character, ends up in this fantasy world as Rio is really interesting and could lead to a lot of very cool moments that we don\'t really get in most isekai shows. Like almost every other isekai show in existence, Haruto dies in the real world and is reincarnated into a new fantasy world as Rio. While most shows would just have the main character retain their memory and just have them draw endless parallels to some video game they spent thousands of hours playing, here we see that the main character has become another existing person within this fantasy world. However, this isn\'t like there are two different minds in one body. Instead, Haruto and Rio have essentially become one person with memories of both being retained. This starts to get really interesting around episode 7 when an incident with assault triggers a memory that only Rio had that has been his main motivating force behind his entire journey, that being revenge. We see Rio do something seemingly out of character and the Haruto side of himself reacts the same way yet also knows that this was his motive the entire time. This was the first thing that seriously caught my attention while watching this show.CONS:1. While the setting and premise are grounds for a promising show, the poor execution of the story\'s overall pacing kills the momentum of any emotional stakes whatsoever. Not even three episodes in we get a five year time skip that basically glosses over an entire arc of the story just because they wanted to get to the certain season finale cliffhanger. Time skips run rampant throughout the show and we basically get zero time to settle into any single arc.2. The animation quality fluctuates GREATLY from smooth, high quality action with fantastically choreographed fight scenes to being some of the most unintentionally funny moments I\'ve seen in anime alongside season 3 of Seven Deadly Sins. Something tells me that there was something going on with the third episode because the animation in that one was also the worst in the show. I know that we can\'t expect every show to be Demon Slayer but at least be consistent with the animation. It\'s not that I have an issue with the quality of the animation as a whole, 80% of the time it\'s actually completely fine, but the fact that it\'s so inconsistent makes that 20% look even worse by comparison.3. Besides the actual physical land, worldbuilding in this show is almost completely lacking. I don\'t expect this show, or any show for that matter, to be like an entire D&D source book, but SOME kind of explanation to ground the story is necessary. This links into the pacing issue I stated before too. Episodes 2 and 3 are focused on Rio attending school and they didn\'t use that as an opportunity to explain the world and its mechanics beyond explaining the existence of magic. Even then, the explanation they gave was essentially ""use magic essence to create magic formulae"" which is literally the most basic explanation of any magic system ever, one that we\'ve been using in video games since the goddamn 80s. Throughout the show, they try to somewhat explain the magic system but they never actually set any rules or reason as to why Rio can do the things he does beyond ""he\'s a special boy"". A part of me says that it\'s because the writers want the freedom to write whatever they want but if that\'s the case then why would they bother trying to explain anything at all in the first place? Again, this is probably only an issue in the anime but that\'s what this review is for.4. The potential that I originally mentioned in pro #2 has been utterly squandered. Apart from the first episode and episode 7, the duality of having Haruto and Rio being one and the same was never touched on beyond the absolute most surface level. It\'s not used as a reason to explain why Rio is so powerful and it certainly isn\'t used to tell a more compelling narrative. It\'s like they forgot that Haruto and Rio were supposed to be conflicting in some way until episode 7 and then immediately forgot it again like a monkey with ADD on crack. There were implications of Rio going down a darker path near the final 3 episodes but they\'re so vague and directionless that they might as well be fan theories.Final Thoughts:Despite the apparent disparity in numbers between pros and cons, I actually did enjoy watching the show for what it was. It wasn\'t fantastic or even great but didn\'t put me to sleep or make me feel like my time was being wasted (except for episode 11). I was never all that emotionally invested except for that one scene in episode 7 I keep bringing up, but I at least finished it which is a lot more than I can say about a lot of other shows of this done to death genre. I guess the best thing I can say about this show is that it still isn\'t done and I believe there\'s still a chance for it to realize its full potential. The show isn\'t terrible and genuinely has some really good moments but it\'s overshadowed by the overwhelming sense of meh that dominates the rest of the show as a whole. Again, I would still recommend this show if you\'re bored and are looking for something to watch but don\'t go into it expecting it to be your next big obsession.Score Breakdown:- I give the story a 6. Not the most compelling thing but does the job to move the narrative along and even has its moments of intrigue.- Art was decent for the most part but terribly inconsistent with it being absolutely comical at its worst and downright impressive at its best. 6 for its inconsistency, would have been higher if it wasn\'t.- Sound was perfectly fine. Never had any audio balancing issues and the voice acting was well done. Soundtrack was completely forgettable and the OP and ED aren\'t my favorite but that\'s all subjective. That\'s a 7.- Characters were pretty decent but mostly lacked development aside from Latifa. Some characters did have their moments which coincidentally happen to line up with the story\'s best moments as well. I would have scored it higher if we got to see more of Rio conflicting with Haruto, but as it is I give it a 6 as well.- Enjoyment is a 7. This is a very subjective rating but I like explaining this anyways. I did enjoy my time watching the show. I feel as though certain scenes and episodes really did carry this show as a whole but I\'m okay with that.- Overall score is a 6, see my final thoughts for a full explanation of that. Apparently, this show\'s been confirmed to be releasing a second season so let\'s just hope that they can improve upon where the first one fell flat. TL:DR, the show\'s good enough for a casual watch, you probably won\'t despise it or love it, just wish that it could have been more. right kind of skill and talent, this could be the next Rising of the Shield Hero.

It feels like the story really lacks direction and its super cliche.Reincarnation, poor sob story about his childhood which involves a female. People think he's super weak at first then he's strong but obviously doesn't know it and makes this face :0. (seemingly shook over his own skills). Someone who's jealous and tries to oppose him. Triumphs over boo boo the fool and a female falls in love with him. At this point its not even a spoiler, its how 90% of all...terrible isekai animes work.I think its not brought up often enough but female leads in isekais literally suck. They are, of course yet again kinda whiny, fragile AF and there just for the looks. One is the super shy type that has teary eyes. Usually the main chara's lover/ future lover. Other one is some furry or some creature, probably enslaved and designed to be cute blegh. Last is the big bobbed girl who sticks them to the main character and drink beer. There's literally no individuality to them so it would be nice to see a decent female lead once in awhile.Overall:To be fair, I really tried continuing but its a type of anime where you just skip and skip just for the good parts LOL or just watch snippets of it on social media.

Thats enough for me."", ""Spirit Crap.Get ready for another *sigh* light novel isekai adaptation. Though, I will say that I was impressed with the first two episodes. The isekai premise of a teen getting killed by a trunk-kun and then getting reincarnated into another world has been done to death, but I don't think I had ever seen Spirit Chronicles spin on the premise and that got me excited. Our male protagonist no.1 Haruto isn't exactly reincarnated per say. His spirit is reborn into an already existing boy of the fantasy worlds slums called Rio.Rio gains all of Haruto's memories and physical experiences as if they're his...own, but struggles with the dichotomy of that and his own personality as his mind has difficulty processing two different lives from different worlds.It's a really cool idea. A better writer could do a lot with the premise. Unfortunately, by episode 3 the premise is basically completely forgotten about and the show's already low bar plummets into a Sword Art Online-esque, edgy, power fantasy with characters so boring and uninteresting I've already forgotten their names and who are either so comically evil or so comically in love with Rio because he like, farted in their general direction that they accidentally come off as hilarious.The Sword Art Online comparison isn't by coincidence. Rio basically is as boring and flat as Kirito, is voiced by the same voice actor and after around six episodes in he literally dressed in the same black trench coat as the black swordsman. Just like Sword Art Online none of the women around Rio (or any other character now that I think about it) can do anything to move the plot forward by themselves without him having to save or help them so the show can show off how important and over-powered he is. He even has a harem, but unlike Kirito's harem-not-a-harem this harem is made up of a specific kind of manufactured waifu aimed at a certain... umm... disturbing kind of anime enthusiast... *cough* lolicons *cough* siscons *cough*.The best character in the entire show is the Dwarf leader who is called Dominic. Dominic the Dwarf. He made Rio a sword and a house he can put in his pocket, but what truly makes him the best character is that his name is Dominic. Dominic the Dwarf... hilarious.Unlike Sword Art Online the animation budget was running low by episode three and the sound track wasn't on a level where the audience could be tricked into thinking the show is good in comparison.

A better writer could do a lot with the premise. Unfortunately, by episode 3 the premise is basically completely forgotten about and the show's already low bar plummets into a Sword Art Online-esque, edgy, power fantasy with characters so boring and uninteresting I've already forgotten their names and who are either so comically evil or so comically in love with Rio because he like, farted in their general direction that they accidentally come off as hilarious.The Sword Art Online comparison isn't by coincidence. Rio basically is as boring and flat as Kirito, is voiced by the same voice actor and after around six episodes in he literally dressed in the same black trench coat as the black swordsman. Just like Sword Art Online none of the women around Rio (or any other character now that I think about it) can do anything to move the plot forward by themselves without him having to save or help them so the show can show off how important and over-powered he is. He even has a harem, but unlike Kirito's harem-not-a-harem this harem is made up of a specific kind of manufactured waifu aimed at a certain... umm... disturbing kind of anime enthusiast... *cough* lolicons *cough* siscons *cough*.The best character in the entire show is the Dwarf leader who is called Dominic. Dominic the Dwarf. He made Rio a sword and a house he can put in his pocket, but what truly makes him the best character is that his name is Dominic. Dominic the Dwarf... hilarious.Unlike Sword Art Online the animation budget was running low by episode three and the sound track wasn't on a level where the audience could be tricked into thinking the show is good in comparison.

Kirito?"" is probably something many of us thought upon merely glancing at this series\' cover, HOWEVER - I am one to admit I was in for a better experience than I expected.The isekai setting is rather overused these days, to say the least - even so, I was surprised to see a unique twist on the genre, at the least one I hadn\'t really seen before.But let\'s take it from an end, beginning with the base elements - and later get into why this anime is average but also close to being so much more than that.The story itself banks on the unique...element, that is the main character technically consisting of two individuals; Haruto, and Rio. It is used in a relatively clever manner, making for intriguing dilemmas. It asks us, the viewers: ""What if the MC is reincarnated into someone else\'s body, and becomes part of them?""I suppose that is more of a character-relevant analysis, however, it impacts the story - and thus I shall rest my case.Story-wise, there is/was not a whole lot of drive. The world-building is not incredibly complex, yet provides enough information that the story can move on in relation to it and bounce off of it. (Ex: How wars are referenced between [x] countries, where it explains the early-mentioned dire situation of the kingdom Rio starts his journey in.Speaking of plot and such, the series goes very loosely about it throughout the season, there only being a few random things for our MC to do, once we figure out he only really ""kind of wants one thing"" - And HOLY SMOKES does this series not care about letting us know when stuff is going on.Before I move on, allow me to say; The time-skips single-handedly downed the score by one point. Time-skipping, when there is no real relevance or substance in doing so, is merely wasted time as a viewer, as they might as well just have started the story at a later point to the same effect -- though I will, later, explain why I do also appreciate them not doing so. (Duality of man, I know.)The production value:By no means a poorly animated series, though it doesn\'t give a whole lot of grandiose moments. The fights are majorly hand-animated, and I actually was surprised to see as little visible CGI as I did.The soundtrack is pretty good, though I am unsure of what to say there except ""music makes the good noise sometimes"" - my very qualified opinion as a hobby musician.Characters... Oh, characters.Now, we\'ve talked about the main character earlier, but what about the rest?Without going into detailed spoilers, we don\'t see a lot of incredibly unique characters. We have some side characters that revolve around the MC, basic tropes, and harem possibilities - Essentially the run-of-the-mill isekai character list formula, checking ALL the boxes.Now, I don\'t particularly mind, given that the MC takes up a majority of the attention, which might be for the best (for now.) It should be noted that the ending has slightly changed my view, especially on Rio/Haruto, for the better - though you should see that for yourself.---Finally, enjoyment and overall rating:I rate this anime.... 7.69/10.

I really enjoy watching Isekai anime and this anime is no exception. It\'s easy to watch and has a plot that\'s easy to follow. Review time!Story: 8/10 - the story is about Haruto who dies in a bus accident and is Isekai\'d to another world. This new world that the MC woke up in has magic and other intelligent species like Elves and Beastmen aswell as Humans, Dwarves and Spirits. The MC wakes up in the slums in the body of a boy named Rio and...has the memories of his previous life. To me it seemed to me that Rio started to remember his life after getting sick and almost dying but that\'s just how I looked at it. Rio has had a rough life up until now. He was dumped in the slums by the man that murdered his mother and later picked up by a group of thieves to use as a goffer for table scraps. Rios one true goal is to get revenge and kill that same man that he watched murder his mother. His life changes shortly after he gained the memories of Haruto because he saved a member of the Royal Family using martial Arts Haruto had learned. He was then placed in a school for noble children as a reward and remained there until he was 12 when an incident happened and he was forced to leave the school and country. His adventure takes him to multiple countries including his mother\'s home country and then all the way back again. It\'s a pretty basic revenge story on the surface but has some nuance and good story telling in my opinion. The MC is torn between his memories as Rio and the memories of Haruto and therefore isn\'t totally hell bent on getting revenge even though it\'s his underlying goal. He meets people that I think help him see a different path for himself if he so chooses. It\'s a good story that I liked and thought they did a great job. The MC was my favorite character but I liked the rest of the main cast of characters too  though lol. After watching it I would like to read the source material now while I wait for S2.Art: 7.5/10 - this anime had pretty good animation and I thought it was done very well. Lately I\'ve been getting more into the production side of anime so I\'m not surprised that I hadn\'t heard of TMS Entertainment before doing some research before my review. The art was done well and one thing I like was it didn\'t look like they rushed all of the backgrounds and made the places the MC went feel like the could be real places. Also the backgrounds were always legible and the viewer was able to discern what was in the background. One thing I think that needs a little work for S2 is that the fight scenes weren\'t the best. There weren\'t very many in the entire season but the few there were needed abit more work. The Rio vs Wyvyrn fight was the best fight and it still wasn\'t great.Sound: 7.5/10 - the music they used in the OP & ED were decent, I liked the OP more than the ED though. I normally just skip both anyways and just watch in the 1st and last episodes. I like the video for the OP and ED also, it felt like the ED was just a continuation of the OP and I thought that was cool. I don\'t think I\'ve really seen another anime do their OP & ED like that. One thing I find some anime do in the OP is spoil something, whether it be the appearance of a certain character or something that\'s less noticeable to the average viewer but for someone who may have watched it a few times will catch a few things as I did while getting ready for this review lol. It can ruin things sometimes but if you have already watched the anime and skipped the OP everytime like I did, watch the OP and pay attention to it because it actually foreshadows a few things that the viewer finds out during the season without ruining anything, in my opinion anyway. I think the SFX were good and sounded realistic I suppose. They were placed in the proper spots and weren\'t too early or late. Also the background music was done well and enhanced the scenes. The background music is best when it adds to the scene it\'s in and doesn\'t detract from it or sound out of place.Characters: 8/10 - I really liked the characters in this anime. The MC was kind of relatable and not super OP from the start. The design of the characters was pretty good and there was a good variety of character models, even the background characters looked different and most of them had faces. I see a lot of anime where they stick a helmet on a background character and then shade half their face so they can just repeat it. I like when the anime doesn\'t feel rushed and they take their time, even on the background. The voice acting for both Japanese and English were done well and I can\'t really think of any bad things about them. I\'ll say that I used to watch just the English Dub anime but lately I have been watching both versions so I can get better with understanding Japanese plus I think Japanese voice actors are great. I mostly watch the dubbed version because I can\'t read the subtitles and follow the action of the characters at the same time for the entire episode lol so I watch English dub first then the original with English subtitles after I\'ve seen all the action.Enjoyment: 8/10 - I really enjoyed this anime when I first watched it and I enjoyed it when I rewatched it before this review. It\'s an easy to watch anime and doesn\'t take a lot of brain power to watch it. I don\'t mean that in a bad way either, it\'s not a high stakes anime like AOT where things that occur in the 1st season can effect things in the final season. I\'m not saying that it can\'t happen later down the line but it would be more of a holy crap moment and not something you see coming a mile away. It\'s super chill for the most part but it also knows when to turn up the intensity when needed. It\'s definitely worth watching if you just want to relax and you enjoy Isekai anime. And try not to compare it to some of the best Isekai like Mushoku Tensei or Reincarnated as a Slime because even though they are similar in the fact they\'re all Isekai but they\'re all completely different types of Isekai and some people can\'t get that through their heads lol.Overall: 8/10 - Because I haven\'t been watching anime for very long, maybe my view is different from a lot of anime viewers but like I said in the intro, I really liked this anime. I felt it had a Slice of Life anime ""vibe"" and was easy to watch while being enjoyable at the same time. If I had to change something about the anime, it would probably be the action and fight scenes. I felt like there wasn\'t enough and the fights they did have were pretty underwhelming if I\'m being unbiased, which I try to be for all my reviews. The anime didn\'t feel rushed and they didn\'t try to cram too many story chapters into the 1st season which is a good thing. It also didn\'t feel like it had a ton of filler either, pretty much everything seemed like it was important or necessary for the story to progress.For me, it was worth the watch. You\'re going to have to make the decision to watch it or not and all I can say is I hope you enjoy the anime and don\'t end up regretting watching it. I hope you enjoyed my review. If you did enjoy it or if you didn\'t enjoy it, let me know if it was helpful and please check out my out reviews. More to come! has the memories of his previous life.

One thing I find some anime do in the OP is spoil something, whether it be the appearance of a certain character or something that\'s less noticeable to the average viewer but for someone who may have watched it a few times will catch a few things as I did while getting ready for this review lol. It can ruin things sometimes but if you have already watched the anime and skipped the OP everytime like I did, watch the OP and pay attention to it because it actually foreshadows a few things that the viewer finds out during the season without ruining anything, in my opinion anyway. I think the SFX were good and sounded realistic I suppose. They were placed in the proper spots and weren\'t too early or late. Also the background music was done well and enhanced the scenes. The background music is best when it adds to the scene it\'s in and doesn\'t detract from it or sound out of place.Characters: 8/10 - I really liked the characters in this anime. The MC was kind of relatable and not super OP from the start. The design of the characters was pretty good and there was a good variety of character models, even the background characters looked different and most of them had faces. I see a lot of anime where they stick a helmet on a background character and then shade half their face so they can just repeat it. I like when the anime doesn\'t feel rushed and they take their time, even on the background. The voice acting for both Japanese and English were done well and I can\'t really think of any bad things about them. I\'ll say that I used to watch just the English Dub anime but lately I have been watching both versions so I can get better with understanding Japanese plus I think Japanese voice actors are great. I mostly watch the dubbed version because I can\'t read the subtitles and follow the action of the characters at the same time for the entire episode lol so I watch English dub first then the original with English subtitles after I\'ve seen all the action.Enjoyment: 8/10 - I really enjoyed this anime when I first watched it and I enjoyed it when I rewatched it before this review. It\'s an easy to watch anime and doesn\'t take a lot of brain power to watch it. I don\'t mean that in a bad way either, it\'s not a high stakes anime like AOT where things that occur in the 1st season can effect things in the final season. I\'m not saying that it can\'t happen later down the line but it would be more of a holy crap moment and not something you see coming a mile away. It\'s super chill for the most part but it also knows when to turn up the intensity when needed. It\'s definitely worth watching if you just want to relax and you enjoy Isekai anime. And try not to compare it to some of the best Isekai like Mushoku Tensei or Reincarnated as a Slime because even though they are similar in the fact they\'re all Isekai but they\'re all completely different types of Isekai and some people can\'t get that through their heads lol.Overall: 8/10 - Because I haven\'t been watching anime for very long, maybe my view is different from a lot of anime viewers but like I said in the intro, I really liked this anime. I felt it had a Slice of Life anime ""vibe"" and was easy to watch while being enjoyable at the same time. If I had to change something about the anime, it would probably be the action and fight scenes. I felt like there wasn\'t enough and the fights they did have were pretty underwhelming if I\'m being unbiased, which I try to be for all my reviews. The anime didn\'t feel rushed and they didn\'t try to cram too many story chapters into the 1st season which is a good thing. It also didn\'t feel like it had a ton of filler either, pretty much everything seemed like it was important or necessary for the story to progress.For me, it was worth the watch. You\'re going to have to make the decision to watch it or not and all I can say is I hope you enjoy the anime and don\'t end up regretting watching it. I hope you enjoyed my review. If you did enjoy it or if you didn\'t enjoy it, let me know if it was helpful and please check out my out reviews. More to come!', 'the problem with Isekai anime these days is that they are being churned out at an extreme rate so some are good and some are trash. This one has a different take on it so I think it is worth watching. However I HIGHLY recommend watching it subtitled rather than dubbed. Even through I watch nearly all the anime I can dubbed, this dub STINKS in comparison.I suppose my favorite episodes are 8 and 9 where the MC goes to his home country and what transpires there. It is a very interesting first arc even if it is a great change from the manga...which I am currently reading. which I am currently reading.', 'this series was good.it followed a standard isekai format, the story i feel could be managed better as it wasn\'t clear how the kingdoms were managed.(a simple map would do better).there were alot of time skips, and i feel it could have been replaced with training arc and worldbuilding instead of giving the mc a ""god granted power"" type of manthe side characters around him are all female (except one) and it should not be like that. instead of a half made harem one or two friends would benefit in the storyand another thing to note is that there is not a good...power scaling. I  mean how powerful is the mc anyways, strong enough to destroy nations? strong as in compared to the generals of nation.the last few episodes were perfect there was good story, nicely paced , and showed some of the mc quality power scaling.

While the series starts off somewhat promising during school portion of the story, it feels like after a while the series forgot that it was an ""isekai"" anime and wanted to tell a revenge plot set in Feudal Japan. Furthermore, near the end of the anime, a lot of relatively important stuff is either left unresolved or introduced but left underdeveloped.Regarding the...characters, most of them are forgettable due to 3 main reasons: the females simply lust after the MC, males typically hate the mc and are often outdone by him, or they\'re neutral and just give the MC stuff for his journey. Yet, the very few characters that are remotely memorable, don\'t stay around for long periods of time. As for the main character, frankly speaking, since I personally am not a loser that needs to project myself on a fictional character to validate myself, I\'m both consciously aware of the fact and annoyed when a self-insert mc is being carried through the narrative via plot armor and plot convenience. For example: Right from the start with no explanation, the MC gets the most powerful spirit companion that suffers from amnesia yet somehow remembers that she\'s the spirit equivalent of the avatar- master of all elements, telekinesis, and tangibility powers. Furthermore, the mc is proficient at anything he does regardless of whether he should be or not to the point of outclassing everyone including assassins, hunters, and a countries worth of soldiers at once. In short, the MC is to predictable because he\'s written to be a self-insert Gary Stu.Regarding the music, the opening and ending songs are okay but the soundtrack overall  was forgettable. Animation wise, it\'s fair but you rarely see anything that truly stands out.Verdict: Unless you wanna kill some time and have nothing better to watch, I recommend skipping this anime because it\'s pretty generic. characters, most of them are forgettable due to 3 main reasons: the females simply lust after the MC, males typically hate the mc and are often outdone by him, or they\'re neutral and just give the MC stuff for his journey.

So i\'m usually pretty satisfied even with the most unoriginal plots and characters.but oh. *oh* fuck. Serei Gensouki left me... Dead. I had hope- the start was...interesting, there was that rift between Haruto and Rio, and that engaged me. But in the end, it was mentioned again like what, twice? It was so irrelevant that I can\'t even remember. The relationships were done surprisingly well, and he didn\'t have a new girl following him around every fucking arc (that\'s what I hated about arifureta it was so. annoying) he didn\'t have girls sleeping with him in bed every episode with a room it was *nice*. And it stayed nice, if I\'m being honest, so I don\'t really have any problems with that.It had hope- It had potential. But *god* I... It was so disappointing that my eyes subconsciously rolled up to my head. Some of the character development just dissappears- like how Latifa suddenly forgot how to fight? She couldn\'t even dodge what happened to all those years of being trained? When we first met her, she could almost match Rio in speed and capability??? And a lot of Rio\'s ""life lessons"" barely even stick to him. His whole ""power up"" is that one scene where his mom dies and haven\'t we already established that he\'s more Haruto than Rio? how is he still that affected. And Rio being able to do things most spirit arts users can\'t? Like how did he erect a whole ass bath. Have we seen the others erect buildings? Absolutely not. It wasn\'t even in his... What was that?? Space cache? Oh what a convenient item to have by the way, can I mention real quick that he never uses the sword given to him? Even at the last episode where he was backed into a corner?And the real disappointment, the thing that actually made me loathe the next season- The fucking ending. It was so unnecessary, and it would provide absolutely NOTHING to the current plot- which was *decent* before little Mii-chan came to fantasy land in her original body. It made me have what I could only call a reverse orgasm. Before the ending, I was so excited for the next season, what mildly dissappointing thing could they throw at us next? And now, I don\'t even wanna see the trailer because for what reason. For WHAT REASON DID THEY HAVE TO THROW THAT IN.Oh, and obligatory ""music is mehhh"" ""the animation was stiff"" I mean I have to agree, but like it was produced by crunchyroll so you can\'t really expect much? They could do better with just a *bit* more effort on the sound quality, but they didn\'t so thats a no from me.tl;dr: it sucks. its your typical isekai. but its not too bad if you enjoy typical isekais. interesting, there was that rift between Haruto and Rio, and that engaged me.

The development at the beginning of the anime was decent; we get some character backstory, some conflict, all that good stuff. Near the end of the anime, they tried to rush through the story too much to the point where the ending felt really weird. It essentially leaves everything on a cliff hanger, like it's preparing for season 2. It's not though, and I can't imagine something like this getting S2. There are some many things unexplained,...so many intricate conflicts in the setting not shown that in order to get the full story, you have to read the light novel.

The production team do be stuffing in your face a bunch of characters you have to remember. Watching this weekly, I sometimes forget who a certain character is.Sound:Lord and behold, Matsuoka is back again voicing the protagonist of a harem. There's nothing wrong with that at all, but he does have a very distinct voice that carries over to other series I watch.

But that isn\'t really my problem its just they just messed with the timeline of events happening, which makes no sense but hey... Its okay.

If you know the source material, it will be an alright watch. For any newcomers who don't know the source material, be in for a good anime to watch/bench with a bit of a cringe. And pretty generic boring first season.The overarching plot is not bad of enjoyment to watch. The show also has some divergence from its original source to make it a bit more light-hearted to expand its demographic reach. The story has a bit of a different approach than most isekais but still has a  good amount of cliches most of isekai harem have.

I'll be straight with you. The music is pretty good but sort of out of place at times. If you were to listen to the music alone, it would be something you would enjoy. But at times it doesn't match the mood/scene when played and feels a bit off. For casual watchers, it shouldn't be too much of an annoyance.

If I were to have just stuck with the anime, I would\'ve given it a 6 overall. As with almost any light novel turned anime series, when you only have twelve episodes to cover so much information, much is removed and the show tends to make much less sense as important plot points tend to be either covered very...lightly, or completely removed. Thus giving the ""generic"" feel to the protagonist. However, reading the source material gives me more positive feelings on the MC within the anime.

Pacing issues suck, though.', 'tl;dr: An isekai that has a lot of good aspects though it doesn’t quite come together all that well until the final arc.Seirei Gensouki is an isekai that’s using a lot of the same tropes as most other isekai, but it has a very different feel to most of them for two reasons. The first is due to how it’s structured. The first three of it’s four arcs are all incredibly distinct from one another. They feature the protagonist, Rio, in different phases of his life, in different regions, and with a completely different set of supporting characters. It’s pretty standard for an isekai protagonist...to be part of a party so not really even having one constant companion is obviously a major change.But this isn’t the story of the journey of a loner either. Rather, Rio ends up staying at least a year in each location and forms close bonds with people living there. The first arc involves him going through elementary school in a fantasy world. He’s different from everyone due to various circumstances and is thus the target of bullying, but he forms a close relationship with his teacher Celia. The second arc involves him going on a journey to his parent’s homeland, but on the way he ends up picking up a beast girl named Latifa so he end up making a detour to drop her off at a village of demi-humans where he stays for a while to train and help get get acclimated. The third involves him reaching his parents homeland, where it goes into background about his past, and thus shows he has strong blood ties to a number of important people.Each of the first three arcs felt reasonably well written on their own. They’re all pretty slow going, but they’re pretty well paced within that context. It skips over really long periods of times with just montages of Rio just living a pretty normal life, but that’s interesting too because each location is so different. I suppose that’s the narratives greatest strength, whenever things start to get even a bit stale it moves on to something completely different. Though, that’s also somewhat of a weakness because there’s a very strong lack of anything overarching. Each of the first three arcs provides some background that helps further flesh out Rio, but it’s more of a side story than anything. It doesn’t feel like there’s any progression, more just a bunch of random tidbits here and there. The lack of any reoccurring characters other than Rio results in no one else getting any proper development or character arcs either. And each arc has a whole bunch of it’s own world building in regards to the location, magical systems, etc. However, the explanation for each is somewhat lacking, and it’s especially lacking in tying them all together. Thus, there’s somewhat of a lack of cohesion to everything.The fourth arc is where things begin to change. In it Rio returns to the location from the first arc, and the focus is once again on Celia. Furthermore, in the run up to that, he finally gains what seems to be a long term companion. However, what’s more interesting than either of those is that it seems to finally be tackling something that’s been a point that’s been hinted at and teased for the entirety of the anime but never really deal with properly. And by that I mean the second reason this anime feels so different from most other isekais, the circumstances of Rio’s reincarnation. It’s common for isekai protagonists to appear in the new world exactly the same as in their original. It’s also common for them to start life again from birth retaining their memories from their previous life. However, Seirei Gensouki has the interesting element of him being reincarnated without any of the memories of his past life, but regaining them right before a critical point.This leads to a number of complications, such as him having somewhat of an identity crisis over who he actually is, though it’s something that isn’t dwelled on that much. There are also very clear hints that he’s not the only one that was isekai’d dispersed throughout the anime. The OP and ED are very egregious in this regard in that this seems to a core aspect of each, though there’s also what seems to be a major misdirect in there so I suppose it’s a bit more complicated than just straight up spoilers. Still, despite all this just kind of being right there in your face the entire anime, the writing seems to refuse to want to actually do anything at all with any of this. However, the final stretch of the final arc suggest that all of this is about to become much more important because it throws in some major isekai style curveballs into the mix, though it ends right before tackling them, resulting in a cliffhanger ending, though a very fun one.The art and animation are pretty solid. The action is somewhat lacking for most of the anime, though the final fight was a noticeable step up. The character designs overall are pretty good, and the variety to them is where it especially excels. The OP is decent in terms of the song and visuals. The ED is really good though, with visuals that feel more like an OP than an ED and a song that’s great. The soundtrack outside of that was solid. To indicate characters are speaking in another language, rather than actually having the voice actors speak in a different language, it seem to warp their speech digitally, which results in it sounding really unnatural and somewhat bizarre. The written language is also somewhat amusing, in that it’s just English in a funny font. There’s also a mini-anime with 6 mini-episodes before the start of the anime hyping it up, and 12 accompanying mini-anime episodes for each main episode. These are somewhat amusing I guess, but nothing too special like the Re:Zero or Overlord ones. to be part of a party so not really even having one constant companion is obviously a major change.But this isn’t the story of the journey of a loner either.

Love was established very early, but took a little too long to come back to, I think. When it did finally, that's when the series ended. This is where my issue with the short series comes in. I'm hoping to find out that there is more coming, but no dice as of yet.I'm really really fond of the show and greatly advocate it to anyone who likes an action anime. It's a little different from what I've normally ventured into and it was a very nice surprise and opportunity to explore something new. it prevented a whole bunch of unnecessary physicality.Rio is a phenomenal lead - strong and humble and he doesn't fight just to fight.

Yuugo: Koushounin,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1246/Yuugo__Koushounin,"[""Generally I fall into the range who is to lazy to write a review, however after stumbling upon this series I am compelled to write one.Yugo the Negotiator is simply amazing. It will keep you at the edge of your seat from start to finish. The series can be broken down into two arcs. Each are is different however the feel is similar (in that they both rock). What I found very interesting was at the beginning (prior to starting the series) I worried that it being only 13 episodes it wouldn't be sufficient time to build a solid story however this anime feels very...complete. Each arc has a solid finish. I would recommend this series to anyone who is eager to watch a series that has a great plot, great characters, will leave you feeling very glad you invested the time into the series, and for those ready to have a good time.This series does have some blood, but the cheer enjoyment is &quot;How is Yugo going to get himself out of this one?&quot; And the best part is, you as the viewers are left dumbfounded till it actually happens. Unlike some series where you can tell how the climax is going to un-fold this series leaves you in suspense till the very last minute.I highly recommend you go out and download the series, as I am positive you will not regret it. complete.

I mean a REALLY obscure series! The only reason I had even heard of it was that it was the favorite anime of an old youtube reviewer named Jaded Otaku, who had a show called ""What\'s Wrong with Anime?"" This guy was a troll LEGEND! His videos are gone because butthurt fanboys flagged all of his videos hundreds of times until Youtube removed them. However, there are still hilarious ""response videos"" of weaboos foaming at the mouth with rage and cursing his name that are still floating around Youtube! For a time he was the king of the...""Elitist"" anime reviewers, kind of like Roriconfan/thatanimesnob except he was funnier and more charismatic. Now for the question: Did this series that was so highly praised by an elite reviewer turn out to be any good? The answer.... not really.Plot and characters: 5/10The plot revolves around a man named Yugo that acts as a high stakes negotiator. This guy can talk his way out of any situation and use his wits, charisma, and psychology to overcome any foe. The premise is extremely interesting and rather unique for an anime. Unfortunately, the execution is rather lacking. The problems with this series are further compounded by the fact that it is divided into 2 arcs with 2 completely different staffs. The first half takes place in Pakistan and is well written, actually did some research, and shows respect for the culture and people of Pakistan. The second half though... sweet buttery JESUS does it suck! Yugo heads to Russia and it becomes the most cliche\', poorly researched, most hilarious portrayals of Russia I have ever seen. The Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons had a FAR more accurate portrayal of Russia and Russians. Let me just tell you a few of the things I found funny. Yugo prepares to journey to Russia by locking himself in a meat locker at 40 degrees below zero, to visit Vladivostok. Judging by the weather in the Japan scenes, this is during the summer or spring. The average temperature during spring/summer in Vladivostok is roughly 20 degrees Celcius or 70 degrees F. Whoops! The plot is that Yugo must stop some evil Russian army guys from recovering the Tsar\'s long lost gold, worth in today\'s value ( read in Dr Evil Voice) 100 BILLION DOLLARS! This would more than double the size of Russia\'s economy in the Yugo world, and allow them to rebuild the Soviet Union! The writers of Yugo season 2 should have spent a little less time sleeping in Economics class. Russia\'s economy is over 2 trillion dollars in nominal GDP and roughly 3.5 trillion by GDP PPP. Russia brings in over 500 billion dollars each year from exports alone, so 100 billion dollars would be a drop in the bucket and nowhere NEAR enough money to rebuild the USSR. The US economy alone is 17 trillion dollars and all of NATO together has an economy of well over 30 trillion. To take back Eastern Europe and rebuild the USSR, Russia would have to defeat NATO, which would require a wee bit more than 100 billion dollars, which is less than the GDP of Angola, a small impoverished African nation. To defeat the Russian Army, Yugo must enlist the help of Russia\'s greatest academic, who is a prostitute because she is too poor to eat without selling her body. Judging from how serious the tone of this series is, the writer of Yugo actually seems to think that Russia\'s top academics are crack whores. Many educated Russians during the 1990s did have to take lower paying jobs or flee the country, but this is just comically absurd! These 3 examples are only the beginning of a HUGE list of unintentionally hilarious bullshit in Yugo. Imagine a writer that used even more crude ethnic stereotypes than Hetalia, but unlike Hetalia was DEAD FUCKING SERIOUS about it! That is what the second half of Yugo is like. It is too bad Jason Douglas is a good voice actor, otherwise Yugo could have become a cult classic from the level of unintentional comedy gold!Art: 5/10The art is also divided between the first half and the 2nd half. The Pakistan Arc had a much higher budget and looks pretty good. The Russia Arc...not so much.Entertainment: 6/10The first half is actually pretty good. It isn\'t spectacular, but certainly not bad. The second half is only entertaining due to the quality of the writing.Overall: 5/10If it had ended with the Pakistan arc, I would have given Yugo a generous 7/10. Yugo did at least have the guts to try a unique premise and go where few anime had gone before. Then act 2 started and everything went to hell! Despite the laughably bad second half, I will still give Yugo a 5/10 to honor both the decent first half and the courage to try such a unique premise.

This series does quite a bit to stand out from many conventional anime titles. First off, Yugo comes off as a crafty and intelligent man who does enough at researching the mentalities and cultural significance that individuals within both countries would have in regards to their personal beliefs. This is essential as his very profession is quite the dangerous one where he puts his life...at risk at investigating the activity of some shady figures within these hostile countries and working out a release for the hostage he is hired to rescue. In addition, the guy knows enough about whatever terrain he enters and prepares thoroughly for it from Pakistan's hot deserts to the frigid cold temperatures of Siberian tundras. Yugo is about on par with Master Keaton in terms of exploration of hostile environments and having a protagonist who is all-around knowledgeable in moving around said countries.Another area that Yugo excels in is its realistic details in covering the culture and beliefs of the countries that the man visits. The show isn't afraid to tackle just how harsh the real-life hardships are for people living in oppressed conditions within Pakistan and Russia, as well as the deeply-engrained beliefs that the people Yugo deals with have. This applies to both the Muslim jihadists in the Pakistan arc and the shady Siberian military branch in the Russia arc. Touchy things such as prostitution, torture, poverty and oppression are the norm in these countries which Yugo is well aware of and often comes to odds with during his jobs. The characters within both arcs are fleshed out enough where you get the sense of how strongly they feel in regards to either their religious beliefs and/ or nationalism.Oddly enough, both arcs to this series were animated by different studios and it does show in regards to color shading and detail. The Pakistan arc had subdued color shading and better polished details in regards to character designs and scenery. This went well with the subdued and tense mood that Yugo gave off while trekking in the country. The Russia arc made use of brighter color shading and noticeably had rougher details in animating characters and scenery.The show isn't without its faults. The resolution to the Russia arc did feel rather contrived considering it went against how complex and well laid-out otherwise that developments within it and the Pakistan arc were. In addition, this is a slow-paced series that takes its time with laying out the developments that Yugo has with prominent characters with a good amount of it being conversation-driven. If you are used to anime with faster pacing and being more action-oriented, then you might not get much enjoyment out of the show.But if you are someone that craves realistic and intelligence-focused titles within your anime, then Yugo the Negotiator is well worth the time to look into. With believable depictions of settings and cultural beliefs within the countries visited by Yugo and the guy knowing well enough to adjust to his surroundings and talk his way into earning the trust of some pretty dangerous characters, this proved to be quite the interesting hidden gem for me to get latched on from Netflix. at risk at investigating the activity of some shady figures within these hostile countries and working out a release for the hostage he is hired to rescue.

The distraught reality in the Middle East that you may have seen on TV or heard rumors about.2. The various acts of inhumanity.3. The current ominous form of the world.4. The chain of power in Russian army.5. The dynamic display...of Russian ruthlessness.The story follows a man called Yugo, a successful negotiator, that works for hire even in life threatening situations. In the first story, Yugo must go to Pakistan to negotiate back a hostage from Muslim rebels. Prepare to witness a genuinely thought out and accurate account of the Middle East. Through Yugo, you enter the mindset of the people there and fully view the beliefs of the Muslim rebels. The army wants to blow the rebels up, but Yugo has to save the hostage. On this epic ride, Yugo ventures alone through unknown land to communicate with the rebels. To negotiate, Yugo must first gain their trust, but being the kind of people they are, Yugo must stand up to their terror and become one with their way of belief. It is a truly fascinating and  brilliant negotiation that is the pinnacle of anime maturity.In the second story, Yugo is hired to negotiate rights to bring a young girl of Russian royalty from Russian soil to Japan. However that’s not about to happen because she is the owner of 1 of 2 rings, the key to unlocking the Russian royalty family’s treasure which the Russian army wants to take for themselves. The other ring, the client gave to Yugo. Within Yugo’s calculations, Yugo knows the Russian army will be after him for the ring. He has to get past the Russian army's ambitious desires if he wants a chance of negotiating her the rights. Truly a splendid display of Russian military ruthlessness as they dictate their power to get the 2nd ring from Yugo and a splendid display of the severity of loyalty among all ranks to the Russian army and flag. The ending was really beautiful, as expected from the royal Russian girl of Russia.For sound, one sentence, watch it dubbed. The dub was an extremely fitting dub, from the voices of Yugo to the Muslim rebels to the Russian army.Overall this anime is a masterpiece with 100% maturity based on real world, real life settings. It is full of hope, strength to live, and human nature themes.  An excellent watch well worth the admiration and praise received. of Russian ruthlessness.The story follows a man called Yugo, a successful negotiator, that works for hire even in life threatening situations.

I only write a review because I'm super surprised that nobody is talking about it. Considering just how good it is, I would at least think there'd be a community online for it but nah. Whoever wrote this has a really good understanding of cultures from around the world. The story follows Yugo as he tries to negotiate throughout the world, and he;s a fine MC, but what really makes this show great is the world it builds. It truly feels like Yugo is actually in Pakistan or Russia and is on a quest to do his job, and everyone...he meets is like many shonen charterers with badass traits, but they are still realistic and feel like they could be real peopleDefinitely give it a watch, this is SUPER slept on he meets is like many shonen charterers with badass traits, but they are still realistic and feel like they could be real peopleDefinitely give it a watch, this is SUPER slept on"", 'It\'s an okay watch but nothing more than that. Writers expect us to think this dude to be top negotiator, but he does as much negotiating as James Bond does gardening. But he is a badass. We are told that constantly and he will even prepare gadgets and gear for some dangerous action but the moment you start thinking about it you realize he did all of that so you can see ho badass he is. No other reason.I\'d love to say characters are great, but in reality we are introduced some characters which do absolutely nothing than appear in one or two episodes and...are just mysteriously capable people who do weird things for this ""negotiator"".Whole thing is just meh. Animation is typical for the period. Characters are okay, from what little we do see them. Story for the most time holds water and then decides to pull a fast one on you where one moment someone will try to kill him and has spent entire episode torturing him but by the end they will be all in love with his character and missing him already before he even left.It\'s watchable and might be okay to kill the time. Don\'t expect high art or quality show. It will leave you thinking you missed 70% of the content somewhere in there. But you didn\'t miss anything, it just was never there in the first place. are just mysteriously capable people who do weird things for this ""negotiator"".Whole thing is just meh.

Zhen Hun Jie 3rd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55790/Zhen_Hun_Jie_3rd_Season,"['A decent continuation of the series. The animation is better than ever, with much better blending of 2D and 3D than in seasons 1 and 2. Obviously, there\'s plenty of fighting. It\'s not quite as moving as 1 and 2, but there are a few special moments. The party gets some more battle companions, and we get to see some of their story.On the downside, the world-building feels more hollow than it started out. It feels like the story is a bunch of random made up stuff to continue the story, without a cohesive overarching mission, sort of like Dragon Ball Z, with its endless...battles. There\'s no real connection of the setting of season 3 to the settings of 1 and 2.This show really falls into the tropes of ""battle shounen"", so if that\'s your thing, then do watch this, otherwise try something else. battles.

Ace wo Nerae!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/311/Ace_wo_Nerae,"[""Animation as any other form of art can't avoid the rule of percentages that supposedly determines what is good amidst the mediocrity (that some would claim is around the 90% of the total).When it comes to old anime as the one object of this review, new factors appear, and the challenge is placed in discerning between what was lacklustre back in the day of its creation and what are the mere consequences of standing the test of time.Aim for the Ace! (Ace wo Nerae!) is one show worth to be highlighted thanks to the apparent simplicity of its premise, and the good mixture between...the sports' department with the constant dramatic situations and the psychological exploration of the characters. The fact of being only 2-cours long makes it from the very beginning way more accessible than some of the long-runners of the time. Aired in 1973, is not only one of the first anime of its genre, but also the first production to came under the name of studio Madhouse, and directed by one of its founders, Osamu Dezaki.The shows under the direction of Dezaki use to be safe bets for us viewers of our time, since they were able to find their strengths in the same limitations of the format that used to work as detriments instead.It is not, nevertheless, the aim of this review to praise this particular work for just being one of the first to make their appearance in this particular scene of both shoujo and sports. Aim for the Ace! is one truly interesting series by itself in spite of its context, with themes and worries that almost haven't aged with the pass of the decades, and that are still current and relatable. There isn't an excess of melodrama either, since the different issues are solved quite naturally, while others are introduced at the same time in one constant cycle of formulation-resolution that avoids dragging a particular problem for too long. The portrayal of its sports aspect shows a progressive and believable evolution.Visually speaking this show is a rarity, way less rough-looking than most TV productions of the end of the 60s and beginning of the 70s. Its peculiar color palette, with a high tendency for pastel colors, Akio Sugino's great work adapting the character designs and the overall good animation for the time are aspects worth to be mentioned.Apparently an obscure show in MAL terms with not even a thousand people rating the entry, it was actually a hit in Japan back in the day, albeit not in its original broadcast. An increased popularity in the following years thanks to retransmittions lead to the creation of Shin Ace wo Nerae! (1978), a remake of the series with updated visuals more alongside other Dezaki shows of the end of the decade. A summary movie for this remake, with new and better animation was also released on the following year. There are also a second and third seasons, released in the late 80s in the form of OVAs, nearly twenty years after the original series. Unfortunately, only the first season (that can be enjoyed as a stand-alone), the film (which I recommend despite the fact it covers the same events), and the first two episodes of the S2 OVAs are currently available with English subtitles [2021 update: both sequel OVAs are finally fully available!].In conclusion, this 26-episode experience is really recommendable for any anime fan that is interested in the history of the medium. Some of the characters and themes of this show have been reformulated by numerous others almost to a fault, what affords the series a constant déjà vu vibe. Ultimately, don't miss it if by any chance you like Gainax's Top wo Nerae!, since the major part of that OVA's story works as a parody of Ace wo Nerae! the sports' department with the constant dramatic situations and the psychological exploration of the characters.

It's a simple enough story - a great coach sees potential in a young student, and trains her to be a strong, courageous person on and off the court. Through hard work and persistence she overcomes her obstacles and grows successful.There is no audiovisual spectacle to be found in TV animation this old, from an era where Japanese animation's budgets, technical background and conventions were relatively limited. The most charitable thing you can say about it is that...it has some stylish design ideas, and a catchy opening theme. I tend to like art that borders on the abstract, so I still give it a decent rating.What I get impacted by every time I rewatch this(and I will go and rewatch an episode every year or two) is the strong storytelling. A lot of the tropes common to modern anime are seen here, in a more innocuous, unexplored form. It doesn't try to subvert anything or throw in huge twists, wacky characters or fantastical elements, it stays in a grounded, ordinary sort of telling, and just builds up your empathy for the characters and their goals with persistence. The simplicity of it is the thing that makes it remain interesting even now.If you want to see the story but would like different takes on it, you have plenty of alternatives: There is a 1979 film remake, a TV drama, and, of course, the original manga. The story does have a plot continuation in the sequel series and OVA, but they serve as more of a coda for fans. it has some stylish design ideas, and a catchy opening theme.

A lot of the tropes common to modern anime are seen here, in a more innocuous, unexplored form. It doesn't try to subvert anything or throw in huge twists, wacky characters or fantastical elements, it stays in a grounded, ordinary sort of telling, and just builds up your empathy for the characters and their goals with persistence. The simplicity of it is the thing that makes it remain interesting even now.If you want to see the story but would like different takes on it, you have plenty of alternatives: There is a 1979 film remake, a TV drama, and, of course, the original manga.

Translated to Aim for the Ace is an underrated 1973\'s anime and that probably brings the first doubt to mind: The animation. Now before we move ahead, I\'ll tackle the animation as quickly as possible so it is easy for animation critics to decide whether to watch it or not.The animation of course is old. It lacks the luster and details, and fluidity of more recent animes. The colors are dull and at times the character features are seriously out of shape. Plus, there is a lot of sequence repetition. However - and this is important, the animation has its positives. The...char features and build are consistent and the facial art style is somewhat unique and at times even attractive. They have repetition, yes - however they do manage to pull of unique sequences when required as well. And as someone who has followed a decent few recent animes, the animation is bearable. It is needed at this point to be understood that it is not an anime which features amazing graphic tennis but a story about a personality and a player strengthening separately and their journey through many hurdles.After having filtered out people who had issues with animation - the question pops up - is the anime good in the rest of the aspects? As far as story goes - it is a present cliche of ""talentless protagonist going the distance to be one of the best"" which wasn\'t as big a cliche then and even if it was, it is executed at a really good pace. You sort of know the ending and direction, but you watch for how it is executed. Each event - which is 1 to 2 episode long, manages well to keep your attention and doesn\'t let the show get too slow and boring or two fast and exciting to put you off.As for characters, well - for one, I love the characters in it. The main chars at least are pretty believable, their cues, expressions, and dialogue truly reflect an average school life. Meaning, moods just don\'t \'appear\' or \'feelings\' don\'t just develop out of nowhere. Plus, the protagonist isn\'t the total cry baby that just loses hope. And if that IS your first impression about her, it does change as the anime progresses. Some may rightly claim that certain chars are 1 dimensional however the anime does hint that they are showing a certain \'aspect\' of their life, or their personality as they wish to show and their intentions, thoughts may be different and/or they may act differently  given different situations. That is NOT shown for every single char, but it did help enough to keep me happy with the chars.There is one issue after watching many recent animes perhaps and it is that there are instances where you can guess which character to pop up to boost/demoralize the protagonist or add tension in the storyline, however unless one is overly critical about such matters, it is something that can be overlooked.The sounds are old, quirky and seem like something my parents might like. But they do manage to compliment the anime considerably and that is their purpose in essence.So over how would I describe it? An anime with old school, yet bearable and at times \'good\' animation, believable progression of a tennis players skill and personality build with certain embarrassing, certain comical, and certain frustrating events that one does face in real. The episodes progress in a well thought manner, nudging you to see further and when I finished it, I was certainly happy to pick this up.It is a recommendation to all people who like sports, and good char development, and rather then looking for an extremely unique story are more satisfied with good execution and story line.Thank you for reading and feedback - positive or negative (not random insults - FEEDBACK) is always welcome! char features and build are consistent and the facial art style is somewhat unique and at times even attractive.

Others have such powerful foundational works that you can still see their DNA in shows made half a century later. Sports anime are very much the latter. The tropes that form the backbone of the genre today can be traced back to shows like Aim for the Ace! Far from feeling like sports anime have left it behind, this 1973 Osamu Dezaki classic is as riveting now as it must have been when first broadcast.Indeed, the king of melodrama raises the tension to breathtaking heights. Though it follows the straightforward story of a girl learning the hard...work and guts it takes to master tennis, the visuals ratchet up the intensity masterfully to mirror the emotions of the characters. At one point Hiromi has hard lessons beaten into her in a tennis court enclosed by barbed wire, giving it the air of a prison camp. Umpires are faceless shadows casting judgement over the girls' fates. Barrages of tennis balls strike people like a hail of machinegun fire. Blood flies. Questions of who will win or lose mingle with fears over whether they will wind up crippled for life from overexerting themselves.It's all interwoven with a solid shojo romance arc and, despite clearly not being a complete adaptation of the manga, reaches a satisfying conclusion with an appropriate final confrontation. work and guts it takes to master tennis, the visuals ratchet up the intensity masterfully to mirror the emotions of the characters.

Osamu Dezaki, the director behind Rose of Versailles and Oniisama e…,  has a directorial style that is notable for using a lot of stills and focusing on dramatic angles of a characters’ personality. I personally am not a fan of his. I think the directing in Ace wo Nerae is artrocious. For a sports show, there is barely any animation in this series AT ALL. When a character hits a ball with their tennis racket, it pans up a still ten times...and then switches over to character making a shocked face or something comparably outrageous.•\tAce wo Nerae did many things that Ashita no Joe did, at the time, except it had much lower quality and worse writing. This series is like the bootleg Ashita no Joe, but with girls and tennis. I appreciate the avant-garde moments of this series, like there’s a terrifying scene where Hiromi is surrounded by a gaggle of faceless girls and there is eerie music droning in a monotonous humーto represent her feelings of social alienation. Moments like that rarely happened though. There are primarily lackadaisical moments of artists not wanting to draw a characters’ body, so they zoom into a stretched out face while dialogue blares in a beat of faux surreality; this technique is used over and over again!•\tThe characters are nothing out of the usual. I think Ace wo Nerae was one of the pioneers of a prodigy versus their wealthy, upper-class rival―hence why Kill la Kill used it in a parodical fashion during a tennis match between Ryuuko and Satsuki. The tropes in this series were very worn and scenes always linger on much longer than they need to be. Unless you want to laugh at the absurdity, this series is a bit of a snooze-fest.•\tThere’s only a small amount of romantic tension is between Takayuki and Hiromi, and it is completely dispersed when her coach tells her to not pursue romantic relationships and the heartbreak leads to Hiromi being able to beat Reika in their last match. That’s a pretty lame motivation for beating a sworn rival. This series carries a very goofy 1970’s vibe, reminiscent of Creamy Mami, and the audio quality is filled with ear-splitting echoes that mirror the original Doraemon (1979).•\tOverall, Ace wo Nerae is very plain compared to Dezaki’s catalog of other series, I thought Oniisama e… was full of flaws, but I would suggest watching that or Rose of Versailles over this series any times of the day, his Golgo 13 OVAs also aren’t the worst thing in the world. Unless you want to get your classic shoujo fill, I wouldn’t suggest this series.

Appleseed (Movie),https://myanimelist.net/anime/54/Appleseed_Movie,"[""--&gt; Intro:Appleseed (AS) tells the story of Deunan and Briaeros, mates on the battlefield. The story revolves around battles, mechas, utopian philosophy and some romance. You will also know about Bioroids, which are cloned humans, but with distinct identities.--&gt; Animation: (10/10)Really, earning a 10 from me is tough, but Appleseed really amazed me in terms of sheer graphic quality. It's a perfect blend of traditional animation, coupled with very well made CG. The backgrounds and environments are extremely detailed and well done. The same quality can be found in the character designs. Just see how detailed Deunan's hair is, or how the general mechas are...done. At one point, you see Deunan resting on a bed. As she drops, you can even see the bed sheets crumpling in very realistic ways. Or the various water and nature scenes, specially rain. They are truly magnificent. AS's animation really deserves applause.--&gt; Sound: (8/10)Not much to say here, since the music score of AS is not really that varied. The action scenes have their BGM and I can say these were well selected. They really highlight the action. Dramatic scenes too have their appropriate music, and here too, it's ok. Not much to say, nothing bad, nothing absolutely noticeable. Character voices are well done. However, Deunan's voice is kind of too &quot;feminine&quot;. Ok, I know she's a girl, but still, after seeing her fight? I'd put a graver voice on her. xD--&gt; Story: (9/10)The story too is really awesome. The plot is consistent, and has lots of twists and turns, until you are told of the final secret, which you really don't expect. The plots flow smoothly, giving details as they flow, and not just flood you at the end. It's an interesting story, very sc-fi like, peppered with a good dose of action. You won't be bored watching it. Maybe at the beginning, when there is quite a lot of talking, but it does not last long. It's a nice story about humans, bioroids, how an utopia functions, how humans can be intolerant, and how the desire for total utopia can be bad. It has some subtle philosophy too, mind you! Overall, I liked.--&gt; Characters: (7/10)Maybe, this is the only point AS deceived me a bit. The characters themselves are interesting to follow, and learn about. Their stories and backgrounds are very plausible. But what I didn't appreciate is Deunan and Briaeros hogging all the screen time. They are present in almost every scene! What about the side characters? In my opinion, they didn't get developed enough. We could have been given more details about their lives and backgrounds. Consider Hitomi. At the end, we still don't know much about her. About her life after work, her relationships and stuff, even if she's the secondary female lead! Even the main characters Deunan and Briaeros didn't get that much of elaboration. The developers of AS should have included a bit more of character elaboration.--&gt; Enjoyment: (8/10)It's not really a light film to just sit there and enjoy. Barely any humor in it. The enjoyment comes from the great storyline and the well-made action scenes. I, personally, really enjoyed it. AS also has a good rewatch value. I have rewatched it 3 times, just for the battle scenes and the story.--&gt; Outro (Overall: 8/10):AS makes a good story, combined with well-made animation and ok-type characters. Therefore, it makes a good watch. Go check it out, you will probably not regret it. done. At one point, you see Deunan resting on a bed.

The internal conflict was a particularly fascinating thing, particularly when you find out who the real enemy is. And the idea that a peaceful society is really a cage may be used a lot, but is still interesting in its own way. However, for people like myself who haven't read the manga beforehand, the history of this distopian universe might be difficult to comprehend, thus decreasing any real enjoyment plot-wise, as you're left wondering &quot;why?&quot; the whole time. All you get is that some global war is going on, and then &quot;bam!&quot; suddenly this &quot;utopia&quot; comes into play, and...the previous fighting doesn't mean a thing.ART: 10/10One thing I can definitely agree to is that Appleseed has some truly fantastic animation. Even if it possessed nothing else, that the art is spectacular is something nobody can deny. The opening sequence was especially eye-catching, with the distopian city design.SOUND: 8/10Being something of a dance music fan, I loved the soundtrack to the movie. Basement Jaxx, Boom Boom Satellites and Paul Oakenfold's work gave me something new to add to my rapidly growing iTunes playlist, and I'm a particular fan of the songs &quot;Good Luck&quot; and &quot;Burns Attack.&quot; They all seemed to tie in well with the scene in which they appeared also.CHARACTER: 3/10Kinda bland, I have to say. They replace character depth with lots of action, and the writers seemed more interested in displaying Deunan's &quot;kick-assery&quot; rather than her personality. There wasn't as much insight into Deunan and Briareos' relationship as I believe there should've been, and while there was obviously some tension due to Briareos' being a cyborg, I still thought that particular aspect could've been portrayed better. Uranus and Hades were interesting in their dislike for bioroids, and Hitomi was a curious choice for Deunan's &quot;best friend.&quot; Otherwise, the stage goes entirely to the Elders, and the choices they made.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 5/10Okay, so, Appleseed is nothing spectacular. Shiny fight scenes, boppy music and pretty animation sequences make it worth the watch for some like myself, though if you're looking for intricate plot and detailed characters it may be best to divert elsewhere. the previous fighting doesn't mean a thing.ART: 10/10One thing I can definitely agree to is that Appleseed has some truly fantastic animation.

The film adaptation was handled by Digital Frontier and the now defunct Micott & Basara. The manga may very well be on the same level as the Ghost in the Shell manga, I don't know since I haven't read it, but the question is whether or not the film is any good.Story:Deunan Knute is an elite soldier during a global war. During one battle a strange group barges in and takes her to Olympus, a Utopian society where humans are living a peaceful coexistence with a new...species that strongly resembles humans but were artificially constructed and have some distinct differences, called “bioroids.” Deunan quickly learns that not everything is as idyllic as it seems. There are some humans who hate the bioroids and she quickly finds herself entangled in the conflict between two factions, one of which is opposed to bioroids existing and the other which wants to safeguard the society that's been built with its peaceful coexistence. Things quickly become more complicated as Deunan starts getting hints that there may be something deeper behind this conflict.The biggest flaw of this film is that the main antagonists' plan isn't actually bad. I can't go into many details since its only revealed in the last ten minutes or so, but as soon as it's revealed all the tension immediately disperses because even if they succeed it won't be all that big of a deal. Another problem is with the ending. There's a huge deus ex moment in order to force a “happy” ending. Yeah, if you can't figure out a way for the characters to get out of a scenario without making a bigger sacrifice than you want them to, either change the scenario or have the ovarian fortitude to have a tragic ending with some major sacrifices. The deus ex route is the worst way to go. Then we have the romantic subplot. In theory, the setup could work. The problem is that our leads have no chemistry. There's none shown through the narrative, the animation or vocal performances. Deunan has more chemistry with the bioroid girl who supposedly can't feel love than with this guy. Hell, she has more chemistry with her pistol. There are also some clunky exposition moments where characters go into information that everyone on screen already knows just because the audience doesn't and there's a bit where they have three major revelations in a short span of time and it just comes across as rushed and clunky.On the positive side, there are some really compelling facets to the world that gets built up in Appleseed. There are also some good ideas behind the various revelations and they could have all really worked if they'd been spread out and developed more instead of clustered together. Aside from the clustered revelations, the pacing works really well and there are a lot of interesting ideas behind the whole thing.Characters:I'll give the film credit for trying to have complex characters, and none of them are badly done, but most of them just don't move beyond bland. Deunan is a pretty good character and there are some interesting things going on with Athena as well. Then you've got characters like Briareos or the elders who are just kind of generic and characters like Hades, Nike, Hitomi or Uranus who have potential but aren't fully realised as characters so it gets largely wasted.Art:The CG in this is kind of stilted and there are a lot of janky movements. There are also some cases of the characters having awkward expressions that don't really match their dialogue. It's vastly superior to the CG in the Galerians OVA, but that isn't saying much. To be fair, it was made in 2004 and you can understand why it looks like cut scenes from a PS2 game since the technology wasn't really there yet, at least I can't think of a purely CG movie from that time that did it better, but it's still pretty awkward.Sound:There are some pretty solid performances. Kobayashi Ai, Kosugi Juurouta and Koyama Mami do particularly well. The music is okay. It's not particularly good, but it works fine.Ho-yay:There are some scenes, particularly early on, where Hitomi and Deunan seem a bit homo-erotic. Which is a bit disturbing given one of the tidbits of information you get later. There's also a scene where Deunan hugs Athena and her hands go right to Athena's bum. I'm not sure if it's a deliberate yuri moment or just an art fail, though. Since the two of them have barely interacted before that point.Final Thoughts:Appleseed is not a bad movie but it's not a good one either. It has some great ideas, but the story is riddled with problems and the characters are largely just mediocre. Maybe the manga's better and features more development for the plot line and characters but for the film I have to give it a 5/10. Tomorrow, I'll continue this week of film reviews with Fusion Reborn. species that strongly resembles humans but were artificially constructed and have some distinct differences, called “bioroids.” Deunan quickly learns that not everything is as idyllic as it seems. There are some humans who hate the bioroids and she quickly finds herself entangled in the conflict between two factions, one of which is opposed to bioroids existing and the other which wants to safeguard the society that's been built with its peaceful coexistence. Things quickly become more complicated as Deunan starts getting hints that there may be something deeper behind this conflict.The biggest flaw of this film is that the main antagonists' plan isn't actually bad. I can't go into many details since its only revealed in the last ten minutes or so, but as soon as it's revealed all the tension immediately disperses because even if they succeed it won't be all that big of a deal. Another problem is with the ending. There's a huge deus ex moment in order to force a “happy” ending. Yeah, if you can't figure out a way for the characters to get out of a scenario without making a bigger sacrifice than you want them to, either change the scenario or have the ovarian fortitude to have a tragic ending with some major sacrifices. The deus ex route is the worst way to go. Then we have the romantic subplot. In theory, the setup could work. The problem is that our leads have no chemistry. There's none shown through the narrative, the animation or vocal performances. Deunan has more chemistry with the bioroid girl who supposedly can't feel love than with this guy. Hell, she has more chemistry with her pistol. There are also some clunky exposition moments where characters go into information that everyone on screen already knows just because the audience doesn't and there's a bit where they have three major revelations in a short span of time and it just comes across as rushed and clunky.On the positive side, there are some really compelling facets to the world that gets built up in Appleseed. There are also some good ideas behind the various revelations and they could have all really worked if they'd been spread out and developed more instead of clustered together. Aside from the clustered revelations, the pacing works really well and there are a lot of interesting ideas behind the whole thing.Characters:I'll give the film credit for trying to have complex characters, and none of them are badly done, but most of them just don't move beyond bland. Deunan is a pretty good character and there are some interesting things going on with Athena as well. Then you've got characters like Briareos or the elders who are just kind of generic and characters like Hades, Nike, Hitomi or Uranus who have potential but aren't fully realised as characters so it gets largely wasted.Art:The CG in this is kind of stilted and there are a lot of janky movements. There are also some cases of the characters having awkward expressions that don't really match their dialogue. It's vastly superior to the CG in the Galerians OVA, but that isn't saying much. To be fair, it was made in 2004 and you can understand why it looks like cut scenes from a PS2 game since the technology wasn't really there yet, at least I can't think of a purely CG movie from that time that did it better, but it's still pretty awkward.Sound:There are some pretty solid performances. Kobayashi Ai, Kosugi Juurouta and Koyama Mami do particularly well. The music is okay. It's not particularly good, but it works fine.Ho-yay:There are some scenes, particularly early on, where Hitomi and Deunan seem a bit homo-erotic. Which is a bit disturbing given one of the tidbits of information you get later. There's also a scene where Deunan hugs Athena and her hands go right to Athena's bum. I'm not sure if it's a deliberate yuri moment or just an art fail, though. Since the two of them have barely interacted before that point.Final Thoughts:Appleseed is not a bad movie but it's not a good one either. It has some great ideas, but the story is riddled with problems and the characters are largely just mediocre. Maybe the manga's better and features more development for the plot line and characters but for the film I have to give it a 5/10. Tomorrow, I'll continue this week of film reviews with Fusion Reborn."", ""Appleseed explores humanity's future, who should decide that fate and the consequences of technology in a Utopia populated by humans and bioroids, artificial humans with suppressed emotions and reproduction.During a spectacular opening battle, the heroine, Deunan, is captured and taken to this Utopia. While this was a really exciting way to captivate the viewer, the battle had absolutely nothing to do with the movie except concrete the idea that Deunan is a superior soldier. Enter her previous partner and lover, Briareos, now in cyborg form. The movie could have explored their back story or the struggle with their current emotions, but they were left...largely undeveloped. All characters were introduced but never really given life, which is a shame because they had great potential.The story line was predictable due largely to obvious foreshadowing. The viewer is always aware that the villain in the forefront is being manipulated behind the scenes. The dialogue tried to express the characters' grand moral resolve, but mostly came off as cheesy.The movie has beautiful choreographed battles, an adept female lead, trendy soundtrack and well executed CGI animation. Appleseed fits the bill if you are looking for a visually stunning, mindless sci-fi action flick. If you are looking for depth, you should probably look elsewhere. largely undeveloped.

Deunan is picked up by members of E.S.W.A.T, an elite special ops unit, and is immediately entrusted with a lot of the most vital secret of Utopia, an attempted, get this, utopian human city. This city is home to a population made up half of human, and half of Bioroids, genetically manufactured being with suppressed emotional states, designed...to keep the peace.However, unlike the 1988 version, which set up a largely morally ambiguous conflict, this 2004 version is much more black and white, and it\'s of detriment to the film. The human uprising perpetrated by the army is one less of legitimate grievances, considering the role humans have in government is substantial this time, and more of a direct power grab. Deunan and her allies stand in the way of the bad guys, as they try to maintain a level of stability in Utopia.Here\'s the problem with Appelseed 2004; it attempts to layer on even more subplots than the original, without really explaining any of them. There is quite a lot going on here; a council of elders overseeing the city hand in hand with a giant computer, a quasi-double-triple-cross by Deunan\'s partner in arms, Briareos. A familial twist with Deunan, and some cruelties committed against her by the very people she is now up against. It all comes too fast and too often, and each plot development is rarely explored nor has its significance justified.This film also suffers from some pretty cheesy, elementary moralizing speeches, that attempt to convey relevance and importance but essentially end up very pedestrian. The exposition in this film leaves a lot left to be desired, because it rarely focuses on what you want to know, instead delivering heavy-handed explanations of things the viewer probably has already realized.The Deunan and Briareos relationship is sorely underutilized. Former lovers, Briareos is now mostly machine on the outside due to injuries sustained in battle, but still retains his personality and ""humanity."" While it would have been cliché, exploring whether or not Deunan\'s romantic interest could exist with a man that looks more machine now could have been fairly compelling. Sadly, it\'s never really explored.All of this combined with plot twists that are predictable, and a very typical - especially to sci-fi - main villain, leaves you feeling like this movie is wasted potential. Still, the main protagonists are solid enough characters to stand on their own, Deunan and Athena the prime minister, in particular. And when the script is not handing them some cheesy speeches, it manages to convey their desperation and struggle well.The 3D animation is also solid if unspectacular, much like the voice acting and soundtrack. It all helps to lend to my belief that the film as a whole is solid, if unspectacular. The Appleseed universe is a very compelling one, and there\'s a lot of good moral conflict to explore. Sadly, this film does not really do that.5/10 to keep the peace.However, unlike the 1988 version, which set up a largely morally ambiguous conflict, this 2004 version is much more black and white, and it\'s of detriment to the film.

It has going for it a wonderful mixture of obvious dedication and craft, high detail, geeky technophilia, memorable and dimensional characters, thoughtful reflection, \'80s nostalgia, labyrinthine plot and excitement that make for a real sci-fi manga classic. Like Shirow Masamune\'s art, his story writing is complex, twisting to the point of being deeply...confusing (a quality I actually like), and has the feel of something created by a highly talented drooling nerd moreso than a polished professional. This is why I like it.This movie is completely different, and has almost none of the endearing, exciting and memorable qualities that make Appleseed one of my favorite comics. It\'s almost like an American action film; the eccentric and personal feel of Shirow\'s artwork is sacrificed for very dark, glossy and hard-feeling cel-shaded 3D that significantly ups the ""dark future"" feel but completely changes the tone of the piece and glosses over many of the personal eccentricities that make Shirow\'s manga art so good and so appropriate for the piece. Much of the plot - many of the good parts, in my opinion - is sacrificed so that a long and complex story can be chopped down to meet the limitations of a feature film. It\'s more than that, though; it\'s an action film. The manga is certainly fun, exciting and violent, but an ""action manga"" it is not; the violence means something. It\'s there for a purpose. In the animation, it\'s really just violence for violence\'s sake. Bri and Deunan have none of the charm and almost none of the character development that underpin the manga, and other favorite characters aren\'t shown at all. The philosophy of the story is more or less completely glossed over, and what comes out is a shallow, meaningless film. The technophilia is very present, but at what cost? Where went the never-ending, wandering plot? The \'80s-tastic big hair? Where are the scenes of quiet reflection, the interpersonal relationships, the confusing developments? This is not the Appleseed I know, which would be less of a problem if the new version were able to live up to the memorable qualities of the original. It doesn\'t.Adapting a long, twisting and philosophical piece of violent cyberpunk manga to feature film has been done before, and successfully - more than successfully. Remember Akira?I wish the creators of this movie - the scriptwriter particularly - had given Akira a closer look. Successfully truncating a story like this one into a movie that retains its magic is a very difficult task, and the creators of the 2004 Appleseed movie failed.

I haven't seen this art style really applied anywhere but Appleseed, which is a shame really, because the blend of CGI and anime art is really quite cool.Story; 7. Admittedly, this is not really the strong point of either of these movies; moreso this one. While I enjoyed it a great deal more than Ex Machina, the story itself was much less developed. It's difficult to explain really, because the premise here is more engaging, however it isn't elaborated on thoroughly enough and the climactic battle scene paled in comparison to numerous scenes...earlier, which made the build up kind of worthless. They had good ideas, they just executed them poorly. And the pacing felt rushed; I wanted more at the end, and sadly there was none.Art; 10. This is probably the high point of the whole Appleseed deal; the art. Unlike CGI films like Advent Children and Resident Evil, Appleseed looks clearly like an anime in many aspects. The characters have the now-traditional doe eyes, impossibly colored hair, and fairly small mouths. However, this traditional anime look was fed through a CG filter, and the end result I think is most closely akin to cel-shaded video games, but much more detailed. And the art served the action well, and all of the characters looked quite cool. Some of the coolest art around, it's a shame no one else really has done anything with it.Sound; 9. The Basement Jaxx are a musical act I have followed for years, so the opening title was a treat. Paul Oakenfold, among others, lent this soundtrack a very befitting cyberpunk feel, and was never used in a distracting manner. Nice work.Character; 7. This should be higher, because I liked nearly all the characters. Hitomi, Deunan, Briareos; they all had awesome character models, and the idea of the continuing romance between a full fledged machine and a human was honestly a sweet idea. But they didn't make this long enough! Therefore, the characters lack a lot of depth, as cool as they all are.Enjoyment/Overall; 8. Appleseed and Appleseed Ex Machina are solid futuristic, scifi thrills. The art is really creative and fun, the music is atmospheric and well placed, and the cast (though undeveloped) is colorful and enjoyable. I'd really like to see a full series come out of these movies, because they have a lot of really wonderful material.

Loved the characters and the art. The anime is very nicely drawn. Music is fantastic. Actually don't have much bad to say. Maybe that the beginning of the movie was a bit slow is the only thing that was not perfect. I like the action parts very much and it is well made. Drama was really done right here. Major plot twist is fitting and it really gives emotion to the whole android/human situation, which is pretty...bad, you understand as the movie goes on. bad, you understand as the movie goes on."", ""Unlike my last review (Evangelion), im going to approach this as a viewer rather than a critic. Ill also stick to the format as its easier. I'll try to stay spoiler-free.Also note I watched the Subbed version, and in Blue-Ray, so consider this when reading.Story:Appleseed comes across as a very intelligent film. Its uses the time of the story to good effect and gives it the freedom to create what they have. But in short, Set in a fiction city called Olympus, its about Humans living together with 'Bioroids' a being that is created from human genetics, but with the ability to be programs. Think...of it as a cyborg, they are organic (including the potential ability to reproduce) but have mechanical elements.Of course, the humans are pissed off and think that Bioroids will attempt to overthrow humanity, but bioroids are not built with emotions of anger towards humans (of sorts) and would prefer to live in harmony with them. But obviously, its not as simple as that.While it has an interesting twist towards the end, the story is just a variation of the Humans & Robots scenario which has been done to death. They could have expanded it a bit further with what 'Appleseed' actually did to do what it does (without giving too much away), as its never quite explained. The romance story between the two main characters, Deunan Knute and Briareos, was also quite weak despite plenty of coverage. The chemestry between them just never seemed to materalise.However, despite its deceptive originality, its very solid. Few plot holes here and there (like the ambush, are we told who they are? Message me for others I spotted), but its a fun take on a decent concept.7/10Art:This is down to personal taste, in my opinion. The art is very cel-shaded esk. and is down to whether you prefer the more abstract art or a realistic look. I wasn't fond of it to start with, but it did grow on me and at times, it did look stunning. But its really a marmite type look. I found it very good, especially in blue ray. The reason it didnt get higher is because it did look a bit jerky with the animation in one or two places.8/10Sound:Its good but nothing spectacular. The music during some of the intense action scenes where very fitting for the specticle, but the more sutle seens could have done a bit better. And the voice acting wasn't great either. I thought there was something wrong with it to start as they sounded like they were standing too far from their mics. And some of them don't fit with the character (Briareos being a prime example). But it does improve as it goes on, so it is redeemed in that sense. But it could have been better overall.7/10Characters:Probably the most important aspect of any show, the characters are vital. In Appleseed, its a bit of a mixed bag. Deunan Knute, the female lead, is sort like an urban soldier and is easily the best character here. She is sensitive and kicks alot of ass, while her character is about the only one that develops are regular pace. It's her that possibly make Appleseed as good as it is (i.e. without her, its pretty pants).The rest of the cast, while are looked into briefly, are not really explained and could just be seen as extras, barring Briareos and Athene (bioroid president of Olympus), which are a bit more involved. Hitomi is OK but she could have been better if they had expanded her interest in the love emotions she was curious about, and a deeper personality. She just seems a bit like a PA to Deunan for the whole film. The rest of the cast, while are likeable, are forgettable and make minor contributions to the overall output.A bit more on Deunan's mother would have been good too, but it is Deunan that is the stand out character in the film. Not quite as charismic and deep as Masamune Shirow's other creation, Mitoko from GitS, she is still badass and redeems an otherwise average-at-best cast.7/10Enjoyment:I found it good fun. If you like action, then Appleseed with wet your appetite for it. It is explosive and very detailed in how the action is crafted, and highlights its stronger points of the film. But the rest is never quite engaging enough to be interesting. Flashbacks make for a change, but its hardly the most exciting of elements and is a bit overused (especially with Deunan's realisation which could have been created a little tighter and polished). If your looking for an overly deep story, then you could try this, but you would find others alot more complex and interesting (GitS, Evangelion, Akira to name a few) elsewhere. IF you like action however, then I'd recommend it.7/10Overall Summary:Its a solid film. Not having seen the original OVA or read the manga, I can't compare, but it is good fun if you like intense action scenes and are a fan of cartoonish/cel-shaded art.

Here we go.Appleseed (2004), when I saw this right after release, was a terrific treasure.  But I need to talk about some other work, which tends to explain why the producers made Appleseed in the format they did.In 2001, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, was released. When this movie came out, and released into the theaters, something important happened. For the first time, an anime movie had been created in the mind of a CG computer, so accurate that the pours on the skin of the actors were visible. The overall details...were breath-taking. The effect this movie had on the movie industry was frightening. Actors in live action material saw their profession disappearing. If this quality could be maintained, live -action movies might eventually give way to CG produced first line products. And in an evolutionary way, see the end of the studio system and Actors Guild, for all time. Believe me, many meetings were held, to determine a strategy, against this new threat.In the wake of this problem, in 2004; Appleseed was released to DVD (and later on Bluray). Remember, to get distribution, in many countries, the Studios had to provide that distribution. So Appleseed needed to be something that did not heavily frighten the Studios, and their attendant Actors Guilds.Appleseed Film Partners decided on a course that had not been tried before. They created a mix of visual styles, in which inanimate objects (from guns to buildings) were fully painted in 3D CGI, while the people were all drawn in a more cartoonist style. It succeeds on virtually every level.Appleseed is not a anime than can be discussed like any other. No clear description is possible. It truly needs to be seen, by an intelligent audience, to be appreciated. A stupid viewer won\'t get what was created.Characters are strong, dynamic. Dialog is read out perfectly, enhancing every scene. The visual effects are a piece of artistic splendor. Even emotional moments are handled with delicacy, and nuance. The battle scenes are plotted well, with a proper back-story, making the battle necessary.I\'ll describe a scene, so you get  the idea. Deunan Knute is confronted by her clear enemy at gun point, and he is telling her that with the destruction of the bioroids, her fathers\' legacy will be erased. The emotions playing across her face, make it absolutely clear that her enemy is not making any friends. Ultimately, in the middle of a rapid exit with her friend, both falling headlong over a railing into the ocean; she takes a mad chance over his shoulder and puts a bullet into her enemy, right between the eyes. With her father\'s gun.Her father was a soldier. She is a soldier. That is romantic nuance.One more scene, and then I\'ll quit. Deunan Knute is confronted by the Elders, seven men so old they need maintenance by the city\'s central computer to live. They have decided they wish to die, so they hatch a grand scheme to eliminate all Mankind via the release of a super-virus. So she tells them; ""... so you\'re going to hand our problems to the next race? We have to believe the future is what we make of it! ...""

The C-130 has specific sound that sounds like a bird twittering while it taxis. They get that exact sound into the soundtrack.

Appleseed was not made for them. It was made for the discerning viewer, that has a desire to soar with the eagles; and to see justice done.That\'s enough. I give this movie, an overall 9, and I would have given it a 9.5, but that rating isn\'t available. were breath-taking. The effect this movie had on the movie industry was frightening. Actors in live action material saw their profession disappearing. If this quality could be maintained, live -action movies might eventually give way to CG produced first line products. And in an evolutionary way, see the end of the studio system and Actors Guild, for all time. Believe me, many meetings were held, to determine a strategy, against this new threat.In the wake of this problem, in 2004; Appleseed was released to DVD (and later on Bluray). Remember, to get distribution, in many countries, the Studios had to provide that distribution. So Appleseed needed to be something that did not heavily frighten the Studios, and their attendant Actors Guilds.Appleseed Film Partners decided on a course that had not been tried before. They created a mix of visual styles, in which inanimate objects (from guns to buildings) were fully painted in 3D CGI, while the people were all drawn in a more cartoonist style. It succeeds on virtually every level.Appleseed is not a anime than can be discussed like any other. No clear description is possible. It truly needs to be seen, by an intelligent audience, to be appreciated. A stupid viewer won\'t get what was created.Characters are strong, dynamic. Dialog is read out perfectly, enhancing every scene. The visual effects are a piece of artistic splendor. Even emotional moments are handled with delicacy, and nuance. The battle scenes are plotted well, with a proper back-story, making the battle necessary.I\'ll describe a scene, so you get  the idea. Deunan Knute is confronted by her clear enemy at gun point, and he is telling her that with the destruction of the bioroids, her fathers\' legacy will be erased. The emotions playing across her face, make it absolutely clear that her enemy is not making any friends. Ultimately, in the middle of a rapid exit with her friend, both falling headlong over a railing into the ocean; she takes a mad chance over his shoulder and puts a bullet into her enemy, right between the eyes. With her father\'s gun.Her father was a soldier. She is a soldier. That is romantic nuance.One more scene, and then I\'ll quit. Deunan Knute is confronted by the Elders, seven men so old they need maintenance by the city\'s central computer to live. They have decided they wish to die, so they hatch a grand scheme to eliminate all Mankind via the release of a super-virus. So she tells them; ""... so you\'re going to hand our problems to the next race? We have to believe the future is what we make of it! ..."" And with that, she plunges headlong into the night, following a super-battle-suit, which catches her, and she begins the ultimate battle for the survival of us all. WOW!Every character has a reason.

There were twists and turns, you weren't quite sure what was coming next and that, to me, is the making of a great story. It did take a bit of time for the story to really get rolling and things do all jump you at the end, but other than that it did well.The character development wasn't as great, but was still good. The main character Deunan developed well; we watched her as she learnt about herself, formed bonds and went through trials. The other characters didn't develop as well as Deunan,...they showed that they had the possibilities for character development, but we don't get to see it.This films let down would be that you don't really get into the thick of things until a fair way through and then it picks up very fast. The slowness in the beginning I found to be slightly unnecessary, it was still enjoyable but being thrown straight into the plot may have left some peoples minds reeling too much.This anime holds some wonderful concepts. Olympia is brilliantly conceived and the plot has been very well thought out. The animation is some of the best I have seen and the music suited scenes perfectly.I will admit that if someone had told me before hand that this featured Mecha I'd have run away screaming. I have a very strong dislike for Mecha but this has shown me that it can actually go past bearable and be great. Right from the opening scene I was smiling, good visuals, hot girl, guns, action and great music. My smile slipped a little when I saw the Mecha but I watched on and I'm glad that I did. This story really shocked me, I didn't think I'd like it but I have fallen for it. There wasn't enough character development for me, but I'm big on that and in a movie it's not really feasible to fit in as much as I would like. It did well though. I would love to see more of the characters.If you've got some time spare, like action and sci-fi as well as a well conceived plot then you must definitely watch this.Nanashi Moriko they showed that they had the possibilities for character development, but we don't get to see it.This films let down would be that you don't really get into the thick of things until a fair way through and then it picks up very fast.

Having of never read any of the mangas, I would not know exactly how faithful it was to the original storylines.Art: Being CGI, the problem is that it looked rather dated. The designs overall were excellent; it was merely that being 4 years old, the shadows, reflections, shading, etc. really showed itself, especially if you watch Appleseed Ex Machina right afterwards. Still, being old enough to...remember when Nvidia was releasing 4000 series cards while ATi was in the 9000s (what a reversal of times), I could remember a time when this would of been considered cutting edge.Sound: I have not yet DLed the actual OST yet, but I enjoyed the inserts very much. The BGM was also well done, usually matching the mood quite well.Character: Like the story, the characters were relatively standard fare, nothing bad, nothing amazingly great. The designs were quite good, personalities were fine.Enjoyment: For unknown reasons, I really enjoyed the film. It was easy stuff to digest, wonderful eyecandy, not much thinking involved, but hardly vapid. There was potential for a true masterpiece, something along the lines of the GitS series, but alas, it was merely standard action stuff, albeit very well done action. remember when Nvidia was releasing 4000 series cards while ATi was in the 9000s (what a reversal of times), I could remember a time when this would of been considered cutting edge.Sound: I have not yet DLed the actual OST yet, but I enjoyed the inserts very much.

A global war has just ended and the world is left as a big wasteland. Deunan Knute, our main heroine, is a very skilled soldier who participated in the global war. Having no knowledge that the war was already over, she was still fighting (with fellow fighters) against androids trying to survive on ruins of what was once cities.She was rescued by E-SWAT (Extra-Special and Weapons Advanced Tactics) members along with Hitomi which is a 2nd gen Bioroid. Bioroids are...like artificially created humans that were based on the DNA of Deunan\'s Father, Carl, effectively making them clones. She was taken to an advanced city called Olympus, Olympus is a Utopian city in the middle of ruins and wastelands.  In a hospital Deunan planning to escape, encounters Briareos, Deunan\'s former lover who is now turned into a cyborg. She then decides to stay and join E-SWAT to accompany Briareos. The plot focuses on the issue of creation of artificial humans or clones.The bioroids are human like, they possess limited emotion making them always act rationally, unlike humans who can sometimes act illogically due to emotion, making them devoid of human error and also some free will. Bioroids may be above humans but they can only live for a very limited amount of time compared to the humans because of their lack of reproductive functions. They cannot bear offspring and must periodically undergo a ""life extension process"".The City of Olympus is a very advanced one (with flying vehicles and other stuff). Half of it\'s population is composed of Humans while the other half is composed of Bioroids. At the middle of the city are two superstructures called Tartarus and Daedalus which provides the city its power (through solar panels installed on both structures). At the top of the structures contain D-tank, a tank containing a virus that is meant to wipe out the bioroids (Humans\' built this for security). At the core of the Tartarus and Daedalus resides the biological supercomputer Gaia which monitors the whole city specially the bioroid and human interactions (maintaining the balance between the two races).Now inside this somewhat peaceful Utopia, tensions and conflicts still exists, specially between bioroids and humans. General Uranus, the leader of the Olympus regular army, is an extremist who sees bioroids as threat to humans. The governing body including the Prime Minister Athena are all composed of bioroids. The highest authority however still belongs to the supercomputer Gaia. The Gaia is accompanied by the council of 7 elders. (Gaia\'s ""decisions"" are based within debates of the computer itself and the 7 elders) These 7 elders provide Gaia\'s only lacking component, emotion. The conflict between humans and bioroids hit its peak when a group of androids destroys the breeding grounds effectively destroying a lot of 3rd generation bioroids and disabling them access for life extensions as well.The story focuses on Deunan and Brioreos\' efforts to save the bioroids (and Hitomi) by searching for the technological data called ""Appleseed"" which will restore all bioroid reproduction functions making them a new race of humans. A lot of plot twists and role reversals is in store, from Deunan\'s mothers\' (Dr. Gilliam Knute) past to Deunan and Brioreos\' relationship towards each other as human and cyborg. Everyone has their own secret schemes and a lot will take you by surprise. The plot is intelligently well made, just what you would expect from Shirow Masamune. The art is good, it is 3D animated and it its well done for its time. The action scenes are detailed and are fluid! If you liked ""Ghost in the shell"" you\'ll surely love this. A true sci-fi classic that\'ll make you think and be amazed of it\'s plot and will also please your eyes with its good and detailed 3D animation.My Personal Rating: 9/10 like artificially created humans that were based on the DNA of Deunan\'s Father, Carl, effectively making them clones.

It is really worthy of it that at it to look.All plot is twirled around very abrupt girl, and she is so abrupt that kills 16 people by means of a knife, at all without having blinked an eye. The general idea of the film proves again to us that people too depend on the emotion therefore its existence is impossible out of the conflicts and out of wars.The love is shown here quite peculiar. He is a cyborg, she is a person. And, apparently, that it is fated not to be...it together. But the love overcomes all barriers. Authors show that the most important is soul. But it is necessary to note that the director covered a little the love line. Too there is a lot of innuendo. In some places I would be desirable to cry ""tell you that you love her! Why is there so much torture? You both suffer!"" Two or three dialogues and the subject line already would exchange cardinally  But it is visible just this innuendo - line of the majority Japanese by the film. Therefore we forgive you, our intrigant :)Work of animators is worthy admiration. Everything is traced very beautiful. Therefore I can safely declare that this film - a holiday for eyes. Besides Japanese didn\'t lose and used a non-standard approach of the animation, which viewer will apprehend positively. They united animation of people and very qualitative and realistic background. And everything together it turned out very much even is tasty. And generally there is a good choice of scenes, foreshortenings and dialogues. Beautiful and worthy film. Unfortunately, in relation to music I can not tell enthusiastic responses. Didn\'t finish a little. In some scenes it would be desirable to hear something tragic, and you hear only boom boom boom.

Shinji Aramaki - man behind such works as... I suppose he previously directed “Part 3” of Megazone. You know: the Weakest Megazone 23 OVA. He directed that. Therefore it comes as no surprise, that this movie is as much of a cliched jumbled mess of a ideas as it is. And don\'t even get me started on the dated CGI that ruins almost every single character design (except Briareos).Appleseed (2004) is a CGI Blockbuster Action Sci-Fi Movie that somehow takes a Simple Story/Concept and ruins much of the...fun or intrigue surrounding it. Perhaps the most telling way that it accomplishes this is by breaking every single rule of ""Show don\'t Tell"" and spoonfeeding every fucking detail in every single conversation possible. That last part might be a little exaggerated, but Jesus Christ, it comes pretty damn close to it.With a Fitting introduction surrounding an opening 6 minute action scene with no context or investment, all filled with dated matrix esq. timelapse sequences. A little after it wastes no time and It quickly ruins Hitomi by turning her from a fun-loving party-girl to a hollow exposition dumping machine. She has one scene that remotely resembles emotion and it’s an ""on-the-nose"" cliched dialogue about ""love"" and ""anger"" instead of the ""show don\'t tell"" from the 1988 Movie with Hitomi trying and failing to flirt with guys, while drunk from the partying.In fact, Most of the Characters just feel like stiff versions of their original counterparts. Deunan is mopy and depressed instead of being a fun-loving badass. Briareos is stiff, unusually bitter and cold for much of the runtime rather than being a Man of Steel Armor with a Heart of Gold. (In the same vain as perhaps Alphonse from FMA.) Athena\'s role in the Movie is confusing and never expounded the same way it was in the Original, despite this movie\'s longer runtime. Hitomi is ruined the most perhaps, going from her bubbly charming personality to this boring CGI husk of a person.The Witty Comedy that gave the Characters a sense of lighthearted fun, likeability and breathing room between the Drama is also GONE! Not even just toned down, it simply isn\'t there. I do not remember there being a single joke. Not even from Hitomi, it makes the characters downright boring. It\'s instead replaced with constant usage of exposition that is placed without any respect to the context of its scenes.Perhaps the Biggest Flaw of this Movie is the lack of Good Villains and a complete Lack of Moral Ambiguity. This is not to say, that every good story needs it, however, when dealing with philosophical themes it fails miserably precisely because of a lack of ambiguity. The Main Villains of this Movie are TERRIBLE. In direct contrast, the villains in the 88 Anime were compelling, their motives were reasonable and understandable. They had a coherent ideology and real sense of purpose. ""DA Ebil Cliched Military"" Villains pale in comparison to \'the Terrorist and the Traitor\' from the first Movie. They have no clear reasons for disliking the Biodroids or the Order of GAAIA, other than ""oh, they\'re just ebil natzeees!"" it\'s ridiculously black-n-white, one-dimensional and plain childish. What this means for the Themes is that it makes them one-sided, simplistic messages that are NOT open to questioning, or disagreement, which ends up becoming a detriment to the conflict and the themes, thereby making them NOT compelling.The Action Scenes all focus on being as bombastic as possible, trying to squeeze as much action into the scene as possible instead of intricately delivering with planning and/or skill. (i,e; the shooting scene near the end of the first movie, or the arrest of the terrorists.) There are only about two scenes that are anything close to providing good action. There is also a considerable lack of stakes (until the very end) which makes it plain boring to watch.Around an hour into the movie, we finally get an effective flashback scene that is done half-decently, right after which we return to the same ""ebil military"", exposition dump, ""tell-don\'t-show"" crap, with 4 plot-twists in quick succession, making the plot feel bloated and overdone, much like the graphics.Speaking of which, the Dated CGI becomes an eye-sore after a while and Janky-looking Character Animation ruins the emotions that the characters are supposed to express. Couple that with the Horrible Soundtrack, with hipster music and compositions that sound like they belong in a 2000s B-movie or low budget video-game.Which is why I am completely lost and confused as to why this is rated higher than the 1988 OVA that did far more with far little. It\'s a shame that adaptation is acknowledged less as it was significantly better. The only thing that the 2004 Film has over the 1988 Film was the Dub. The Dubbing was an improvement, obviously because more modern dubs tend to be better produced, however other than that I could not see a single thing that this Film did even moderately well.4.5/10 (Bad CGI Blockbuster Movie from the Early 2000s, with much of the cliches of that Era.) fun or intrigue surrounding it.

Well, his earlier ""works"".I loved everything about it, from the cell shaded motion capture to the awesome soundtrack.  This is a title I suggest to non anime fans and count alongside Pixar in quality.  Mecha designs are amazingly detailed, the behind the scenes plotting brings the drama to a boil, and we\'re treated to a look at Deunan Knute\'s past that even the manga never gave us.If you haven\'t seen it you should, and pick...up the album too, trust me. up the album too, trust me.', ""This movie is a bland mesh of sub-par action and mediocre CGI.My expectation of this movie was to have a cheap 90s action romp (in the same vein as Predator or True Lies) only with anime and a robot bunny thing.What I got was like 5-7 minutes of meaningless action in a 80 minute movie.  This movie was boring.I'll save you guys time with a quick summary.  There's this blonde chick who's sorta in love with the robot thing, except the robot thing is actually a guy with a prosthetic head.  Does he have a brain?...How does he think?  I don't know.  Then there's this underlying story that's not delved in much detail about how this city's built upon a destroyed city.  And this military guy is bad.  But the military guy only shows up in like the last third of the movie.The art is okay, I guess.  The CGI does mesh okay with the 2D art style, so I didn't have too much issue with it.Don't watch this unless you wanna go to sleep. How does he think?  I don't know.

Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34176/Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Mahou_no_Sho,"['This review will contain significant spoilers to illustrate several lapses of logic within the show.I thought I\'d put in my two cents to this show to help contrast some of the more positive views. Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho (or GoZ as I\'ll refer to it) is in every sense a mediocre fantasy show. It does very little to distinguish itself from it\'s peers of the fantasy genre and has multiple lapses in logic and commonsense.GoZ is a action magic fantasy that follows the story of three characters. Two witches, named Zero and Albus as well as a unnamed mercenary. Zero is a somewhat...special witch as she is the author of the titular Grimoire of Zero that has spread magic into the kingdom in which the GoZ is set. Zero is searching for 13, (and her grimoire) we do not know her reasons for searching for him, who then comes Albus, who is as far as we know is a fairly average young witch who originally was seeking the mercenary\'s head as he is a beastfallen, who\'s bodies apparently hold special and useful properties for witches. Zero resolves the issues and hires the mercenary as her guard. Doesn\'t sound to bad at first. It goes to shit later in the show, when you start asking questions.We learn Albus is apart of a coven or witch group called the Sorcerers of Zero, who we later learn, who\'s members have all signed a blood contract with a mysterious man only referred to as ""Him"". What does that contract entail? Death, if you threaten his safety, you will die. Pretty hefty contract for people to make with a person they\'ve never seen nor met. Lapse in logic: 1, bad writing: 1. So the Sorcerers of Zero are idiots, that much is certain. At least they\'re nice idiots? Not really, the Sorcerers burned a village to the ground for the unjust murder of a kind witch, named Sorena, who you will later learn of. They ignored all innocents and indiscriminately murdered an entire village. Though this has happened in history so I won\'t deduct any points from it, I just thought it\'d nicely illustrate the sort of characters in the Sorcerers Of Zero.Anyways, onto the next issue. Throughout their journey, the trio grows closer. At one point Zero is giving the mercenary a bath, how cute. At that point she takes it upon herself to cast a spell on the mercenary\'s body that will redirect all damages he takes unto her. Yes, she decided all injuries the man / creature she hired to protect her safety shall be redirect to her. Seems a little ironic and counter intuitive. Lapse in logic: 2, bad writing: 2. Sure you can say that it\'s sweet and all, that she cares for him, but frankly it\'s a stupid move, driven by bad writing.Next issue. We learn Thirteen is Zero\'s enemy and throughout the trio\'s encounters we learn Thirteen\'s motive for doing what he\'s doing. Which is indiscriminately murdering witch\'s. He\'s doing it for Zero, but he won\'t listen to Zero who tells him she doesn\'t want this. Until like the third time she verbalizes this in which he magically decides \'oh she was serious. Guess I\'ll stop murdering witches and shack up with Zero and her mercenary."" Lapse in logic: 3, bad writing: 3.And again, next issue. We later learn Albus (which is a man\'s name if you ask me) is actually a girl, and not just any girl, the granddaughter of that good witch who was unjustly murdered. Why is this relevant? Throughout the trio\'s journey Zero reveals she\'s looking for her grimoire and 13. Albus says that the sorcerers have it, and when they arrive to the sorcerers hometown, which has been freshly massacred, says that perhaps Soreana\'s granddaughter had escaped with it. Wait what? That\'s her. Why would she lie to the hero which her group named herself after? Lapse in logic: 4, bad writing: 4.Second to last issue. The world itself. We have plenty of witches in the story who apparently all learned their magic from ""Him"" and the Grimoire of Zero, and if that is the case, why are there witches that predate Zero, such as Sorena. Sure you can just say she popularized or modernized magic, but near the climax of the anime the trio plan to eliminate magic from the kingdom because Zero apparently has the ability to cancel out magic. Talk about plot armor. This also leaves more questions asked. Can Zero cancel all magic? Or just magic based on the Grimoire of Zero? Why can she do this? Can other witches do it? Frankly these things  left the viewer confused. Confused and with unanswered questions Bad Writing: 5.My last major complaint is one that is simply cliche. Throughout the first half of the show we learn that there are two important characters, whom we haven\'t seen. The aforementioned 13, and ""Him"". 13 was a peer and teacher of Zero. ""Him"" is the founder of the Sorcerers of Zero. ""Him"" slaughtered everyone in Zero\'s previous abode to steal the Grimoire of Zero, and followed up by creating basically a cult named the Sorcerers of Zero. If you hadn\'t already figured it out. ""Him"" is 13. I won\'t detail his frankly idiotic master plan, but the fact that ""Him"" and 13 are the same person is comically bad writing: 6. It was visible from not miles away, but light years.Those are my major issues with the story, as for my other issues, let\'s dive into them.The characters. The character\'s are not particularly bad or good, they\'re fairly average. What is however bad about them is their interactions. Almost every dialogue between the major, minor or extra characters fits one of three descriptions. Stupid. Cliche. Contrived. Those three words adequately describe this series\' characters, and story.The story. Routinely leaves questions asked but unanswered. Has several plot holes and previously mentioned fallacies. And to be blunt, is frankly average. Or it would be without all those glaring issues.Art. Average, nothing good, nothing bad. Utterly mediocre.Sound. Same.Overall Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is a bad anime. A very bad anime, with countless issues, more than I\'ve likely identified. If you\'re new to anime or not someone who dives to deeply into things, perhaps this show will be for you, but anyone who likes to dissect content, anyone who is notices little details, or any person who has watched a decent amount of anime. Avoid this flaming pile of shit like the plague. special witch as she is the author of the titular Grimoire of Zero that has spread magic into the kingdom in which the GoZ is set.

Avoid this flaming pile of shit like the plague.', 'Like many shows relating to fantasy, magic, and witchcraft, I can’t say that Zero kara hajimeru Mahou no Sho looks any unique compared to the rest at first glance. I mean, if you look at it carefully, the show’s premise is pretty standard that involves a conflict between human and witches. The additional aspect of beastfallen (cursed humans with animalistic appearances) adds some slight intrigue to the story. But is this show really worth investing time in? Or is it just a show that panders to fans that wants a dose of fantasy in their life?Adapting the light novel of the same name, Zero kara...hajimeru Mahou no Sho (Grimoire of Zero) takes a very high fantasy approach with both its characters and story. The most noticeable character is a beastfallen dubbed as “Mercenary” by the witch Zero. They travel together with Albus, another magician and throughout their journey, they learn much more about each other. Still, the primary goal of their journey is to find the Grimoire of Zero, a very powerful spellbook that has potential to change the world. Now wait a minute. Witches? Magical artifacts? Journey? If anyone has seen enough anime, it wouldn’t be surprising if this show reminds them of fantasy adventures like Hitsugi no Chaika, Spice and Wolf, or even to an extent, Berserk. The fact is, this show appeals to a fantasy adventure while it tries to be a show that stands on its own feet.The first few episodes of the series establishes the formation of the main trio. Zero encounters the beastfallen and is enlisted as her bodyguard. On the other hand, Mercenary shows fear for Zero because of her status as a witch. Throughout the journey, he also learns that she’s much more different than appears to be. Then, there’s Albus, the third member of the group and we learn much more about this young magician’s past. In the meantime, I think what can hook the audience into this show is the character chemistry. At its core, Zero and Mercenary always gets me curious as the two are so different. Yet at the same time, it’s really fun to see how far their relationship develop as they are put into compromising positions. For Albus, the character’s past is explored through the eyes of another character named Holdem. From first glance, I disliked the way his character is portrayed with his arrogance. As time went on however, the show reveals a different side of him that I thought as very appreciating. So in essence, characters in this series shouldn’t be judged on what they appear to be on the surface until we understand them better. If there’s one character that I genuinely dislike though, it would be Thirteen. Trouble always seems to follow with this guy and he stands as a dangerous obstacle during our main characters’ journey. His persona fits within the stereotypical type of antagonist that gives a sour taste. Not to mention, I really can’t stand some of his dialogues as they sound very forced.Now if you’re wondering about the main story, the core of the show still involves the characters’ journey in this fantasy adventure. To be honest, the first half of the show feels like it suffers from pacing problems. I don’t mean that by adaptation standards but just in general as some episodes focuses too much on the characters’ lives. It can actually cause less interest for viewers as by the time I finished watching the 5th episode, it seems far less focused on finding the Grimoire. Still, I would also say that the story does improve later on as some episodes got me much more invested into characters such as Mercenary and Albus. The background story told by Holdem in particular felt like a highlight in this show as it not only gave insight about Albus’ past but also how the world viewed witches in general. While I dislike Thirteen as a character, I do find his role in this show to be very thrilling. The way he plays mind games with Zero and Mercenary adds a different dimension of drama that builds more and more. So in essence, the general flow of the storytelling has slow start but gradually develops as more episodes progresses. It will test the patience of the viewers especially those who are less interested in the characters and more invested into the plot.Adapted by White Fox, it’s not unusual to see that the artwork has some resemblance to other fantasy series. Re:Zero is the first show that comes to mind as Zero has some resemblance to Emilia. However, I would say that Zero is like a dynamite that comes in little packages. She is short but has enormous potential as a witch. Mercenary has the animalistic look with his tiger-like face but barbaric human body. Similarly, Holdem looks like a generic wolf guy you’d expect to see in most fantasy anime. Albus is designed to look fragile and it’s sad to say, but the young magician really doesn’t stand out compared to the other cast members. Still, artwork of the show looks visually appealing if you watch it with a fantasy mindset. On the other hand, I’m not very impressed by the general world building as many places our adventurers’ wanders looks too dull and unoriginal.For a show about fantasy adventure, it occasionally lacks the mystical feel but thankfully with the soundtrack, it retains its credibility on most parts. From my viewpoint, both the OP and ED theme songs are quite colorfully decorated. The ED theme in particular delivers a more charming presence of the main characters between Zero and Mercenary. I’m also impressed by the voice acting of nonhuman characters such as Mercenary and Holdem. In many ways, they sound very human.Ah, Grimoire of Zero. This is a show that some people mistook it for Re:Zero’s second coming at first glance. On paper, it’s a fantasy adventure and one that mixes in humans, witches, and beasts. By storytelling standards, it’s nothing impressive to write home about. However, once I got invested into the characters, the show felt more special at heart. It’s not a golden egg in a treasure chest by any means but is still a fun ride if you’re feeling the will to take. hajimeru Mahou no Sho (Grimoire of Zero) takes a very high fantasy approach with both its characters and story.

I guess I'll be writing it again.  Luckily, I wasn't that far.Grimoire of Zero certainly has brought out mixed feelings among the viewers.  Many people really like or even love the show, while many others, like myself, just like it.  There are also the people who just don't care for it that much.  It's good either way, but it does have its ups and downs.The story is simple.  Zero and Mercenary meet unexpectedly after Mercenary falls from a hill top above where...Zero was camping out when he was being chased by witches, I believe (I actually forget the details concerning his fall from weeks ago).  She forms a contract with him than and promises to turn him into a human, as long as he helps her find the Grimoire of Zero, which is a book she created that is filled with tons of magic spells and has spread far throughout the land.  The book was stolen from her and she want sit back before it falls into the wrong hands.  The two also meet Albus,a young witch in the group, the sorcerers of Zero.  The three of them start their adventure and ht some of their initial walls.  The first half of the show is a lot more character driven, which was a little dull at times because the anime seemed to be concentrating on simple stuff like that instead of on finding the grimoire of Zero and advancing the story.  Luckily, the second half shows more of the conflict surrounding the war that is close to breaking out between humans and witches, and has many plot twists throughout the scenes.  It could be a better story, but at least it was satisfying and ended on a really good note.  The best part about it is that it feels like an old time fantasy adventure due to how the spells are cast and the backgrounds shown. The beastfallen designs make a nice touch though. I'd give a story a 7 since the quality rounds out nicely despite the ups and downs in the story.The art is kind of like the story.  It really makes the show feel like an older style fantasy adventure.  The character designs, backgrounds, and other art pieces are not always the greatest out there, but the category as whole is good.  A few of the background are done really well, especially some that I noticed in the final episode, while some others are just ok.  The clothing is definitely of some typical fantasy designing, but it helps show the character's personalities really well and it is still designed nicely.  The animation is pretty fluid too.  Overall, a 7/10 in deserved.The sound is my favorite part of the show.  I expect a fantasy to have some really good music and Grimoire of Zero doesn't disappoint much in this department.   The opening them is quite good, while sounding silly at the same time; it fits very nicely though with a few of the overall simple themes of the show, and it does have nice visuals.  The background music is more fierce during the battle scenes and the more conflict based scenes.  Other times, it is just some good music that compliments the mood in a good way.  I'll give the category a 7/10.The characters are kind of a difficult area to talk about.  They are not the most special, but they leave an impact.  Thirteen is kind of a basic antagonist and trouble is always around him, but he does a good job at being part of each side of the war he basically started, which is not something many antagonists can pull off.  Zero is a young magician who might easily be the most powerful magician in the world of the show, seeing as how she made the spell book and that action lead to many people throughout the land learning how to use magic.  She doesn't try to control people with force and enormous strength though and she is more kind hearted and it doesn't take a whole lot to please her.  She is kind of cunning though and she interacts very well with Mercenary.  Mercenary is more a tough and rather stern individual until he grows more acquainted with his master, Zero, and breaks out of his shell.  He is different from other beastfallen since he doesn't use his look and or position as a soldier to get what he wants.  He has a simple dream of wanting to open his tavern.  Albus is an ok character, but she doesn't have as much of an impact as the three I mentioned above, and she just kind of seemed to be present at many times without there being a need for her.  I don't think she needed to be incorporated into the main traveling crew as often the way she is, but would fit better if there was more of a use for her early in the story.  The other characters are not really main people so I'll leave out.  Overall, the characters are rather fun to watch and stand out in their own way, despite not being the best out there, so 7/10 it is.My enjoyment earns a 7/10.  I didn't always like every episode as much as another, but overall, I had a fun time watching the anime and some of the scenes were really good.  It has a very satisfying ending too, even though the show has a short run time.  There is more to be discovered in the world, but every main conflict brought about is solved before it ends. Zero was camping out when he was being chased by witches, I believe (I actually forget the details concerning his fall from weeks ago).

Albus is an ok character, but she doesn't have as much of an impact as the three I mentioned above, and she just kind of seemed to be present at many times without there being a need for her.  I don't think she needed to be incorporated into the main traveling crew as often the way she is, but would fit better if there was more of a use for her early in the story.  The other characters are not really main people so I'll leave out.  Overall, the characters are rather fun to watch and stand out in their own way, despite not being the best out there, so 7/10 it is.My enjoyment earns a 7/10.  I didn't always like every episode as much as another, but overall, I had a fun time watching the anime and some of the scenes were really good.  It has a very satisfying ending too, even though the show has a short run time.  There is more to be discovered in the world, but every main conflict brought about is solved before it ends."", ""What starts out as a typical quest to right her own wrongs turns into a more complicated anime after she loses her soup, we are introduced to the initial characters and are shown different parts of the world's state and history. With themes that are similar to Junketsu no Maria, the anime as it is right now is slowly expanding our knowledge of the state of the world. Whilst the story is not unique in any way it is not by any means bad (I'm sure some of the other reviews will beg to differ), meaning it will be more than enough to keep you...interested.

The one bit that I do think they did well for art is probably the characters which are relatively detailed.Music is great, I love the opening. The ending is calm and relaxing (though not exactly my sort of thing) and the bgm is more than capable of sending the mood. That being said due to the lack of action/emotional scenes so far it hasn't had a really good chance to stand out.Characters are your typical op + knowledgeable MC (or heroine depending on how you look at it), your character that isn't happy with the world as it is and is seeking the ability to change himself.

As I mentioned the characters are drawn in great detail and the MC seems to have some sort of backstory we haven't fully explored yet so I am looking forward to it.All in all its a 9 for me, this anime doesn't seem to have made a lot of mistakes but at the same time isn't taking enough risks to really stand out and get a 10 (masterpiece), that being said its more than enjoyable and doesn't let the recent few seasons (which have been great mind you) down. interested.

Only read if you have finished the series. --Story:Regrettably, I had initially believed this show to be a dark horse of the season. However, what I received was not what I had hoped for. Instead of a clever take on the magical fantasy setting, it was a walking stereotype with little to no depth.It has a decent start with the mentioning of beastfallen and witches but quickly goes downhill with the very predictable direction. From the unoriginal yet ""overpowered"" main character, to the useless side character, to the boring villain, to the damsel in distress trope, to the lack...of exploration on magic, to the obvious and highly convenient ""plot twists"" ...Diving into the lack of exploration on magc, it has always been something that piqued my interest as far as I can remember. I just find the subject of ""magic"" to be interesting and limitless in terms of potential with story progression. Combine that with adventure, fantasy, and even witches, then it\'s natural to assume you would see it pretty often, right? I mean, considering its importance to the story, then why is it so little explored in this show? That is not using your strengths to your advantage, and it shows the lack of thought or small preparation in writing. To bring my point full circle, the incompetency in writing continues to be evident due to the poor characterization - which leaves the viewer to become apathetic towards said characters - and the terrible ""plot twists"" - which just ends up feeling anticlimactic to an already unimpressive show. For example, when it was revealed that Albus was a female, it felt as if though they were trying to store value into a character that was otherwise useless and dragging the story down with it.Art:Honestly, it could be better, but this is pretty standard in today\'s times with some relatively low dips in quality here and there. However, that\'s not necessarily a compliment. With numerous anime per season competing against each other, it should be common sense that having ""better than standard art"" be a necessity for relevancy. If not, then it\'s safe to assume proper care wasn\'t given to other aspects of that show as well. With nothing to really capture the attention, then did it have impact in the first place? We, as humans, tend to forget the things in life that are seen as daily routine or events that don\'t make us remember it afterwards, because in the end it becomes just that - irrelevant. I can say with certainty that Grimoire of Zero is not something I will look back on in the future.Sound:Much like the art, the sound was dull and forgettable. Admittedly, the show gave me no reason to listen its soundtracks. In fact, I\'m quite happy to not spend time bothering to do so.Characters:The ultimate sin of a writer is to neglect its characters, which makes sense from my perspective. Why would you bother investing time into a story where you can\'t stand the characters to begin with? Or if the characters do not grow? The person you are going to spend most time with is the character, after all.I will acknowledge the fact that the characters do grow in this anime, but it loses overall impact if I did not care for them at any given time. If the cons outweigh the pros, then it would be deemed as a liability and not an asset; an inconvenience or weakness, not a strength. From the get-go, the poor characterization, as previously stated, left an underwhelming first impression that was never really serious at fixing itself. At what point would you cross the line? Maybe the sudden tone shift where it was time to eat in the middle of a supposedly high-tension fight? It\'s absolutely ridiculous how bad that scene was, in particular. Why should I take it seriously if it refuses to do so? To add insult to injury, 13, specifically, had a questionable motive. Quite frankly, Zero, Albus, and even 13 were poorly written. That\'s 3/4 characters with the most screen time. 25% of that was decent with Youhei, our mercenary beastfallen. His struggle with society and lack of communication with others was notable, but his backstory needed further looking at.To summarize, Zero, Albus, and 13 were liabilities, in my opinion. Rather than bringing something unique to the table, I received unoriginal content with poor excuses of reasoning behind it to boot.The show somehow felt incredibly rushed and could have greatly improved had it taken the time to explore more of its own history, the inner workings of magic itself, and fleshed out its characters more. Also, if it just had better writing in general.Long story short, this was a huge letdown with no redeemable qualities whatsoever. It is quite literally the very definition of ""meh.""

You probably already know that but i\'m just gonna throw it out there. Zero Kara Hajimeru Mahou No Sho is an anime that has been on my ""plan to watch"" list for a long time. In fact, it didn\'t even have a synopsis at that time if I recall.Story 6/10: Story\'s honestly not that great. The beast, Youhei, meets a witch, Zero, and despite his so-called hate for witches, he decides to embark on a quest with her. For a price of course, that being he could finally be turned into a human.As of...now, the pacing is slow. At the end of episode 4, it gets more interesting but the first 3 episodes are basically the building blocks of character development. There is also a bit of action here and there but it doesn\'t last very long.Character 8/10: A unique MC because of him being a beast. You don\'t see those too often. I liked him though. He can be tsundere-ish at times and he seems like someone who is good but chooses to be distant and cold towards others due to the fact that he is aware beasts like him aren\'t treated so well do to their bad history (which is explained throughout the series). Overall, he seems like someone who isn\'t annoying. Thank god.But there is one character who could be annoying at times. And it comes to no surprise that the culprit is the yellow haired kid. Honestly, I would prefer him to not be around but he\'s part of the reason of the MC\'s character development and he isn\'t bad all the time.Moving on to another important character, Zero. She doesn\'t seem unique at all. Naive about the world and somewhat overpowered in combat. But still knows whats up when things go tough. I also find it confusing when some people act perverted at her (something you\'ll find obvious) because she honestly looks like a kid at first glance. Anyways, despite her lack of uniqueness, I didn\'t dislike her at all. But that could change when we get to see more episodes but I hope it doesn\'t. This applies to the rest of the characters too.I also like to mention the relationship between Youhei (beast) and Zero. It isn\'t forced and it just grows smoothly. That is what I like. Romance done right. Rather interesting too.Animation 7/10: Good for 2017. Nothing that felt out of place. Average. Normal. No flaws. No complaints here.Sound 8/10: OP with an adventure tune that we see in alot of action anime and an ED with a calm and relaxing atmosphere that reflects on the relationship between the MC and heroine.

While they are kind of synonyms they have the same difference as normal Alchemy and Alchemy with a Philosopher\'s Stone. The top review of this series makes this (retarded in my opinion) mistake and makes a lot of comments on the fact that the series is stupid because ""how could witches exist before magic if magic was invented by a witch only recently"" (Jaden Smith anyone? No?). Well, it is stated, SEVERAL TIMES, that they used sorcery, not...magic. Damn, the white tiger (I\'m bad with names) even says: ""This magic is very convenient because until now you had to draw circles and make sacrifices"". Also,(this is not a spoiler) regarding Zero\'s ability to negate magic, (now this is a spoiler) SHE GODDAMN SAYS she made mistakes in the Grimoire on purpose in order to be able to be stronger than any other magic user.Anyway, I felt the need to clear that up. Now the review:Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho (Grimoire of Zero) is a fantasy anime. It\'s set in a world where a civil war between witches and normal humans has created countless victims and it\'s currently destroying the nation. The series is centered on Zero, a young witch that revolutionized witchcraft by giving birth to magic and Mercenary, a beastfallen (humans with the appearance and strength of animals), and it follows their adventures to find (the stolen) Zero\'s Grimoire that holds the secrets to magic.The series is sweet, short, and the only complaint I have is that they seemed to go out of their way to produce a loli-ish character (must find a way to appeal to those otakus, amiright?) when the girl needs to be over 15 for the story to make sense. The art isn\'t amazing but I\'m more of a story guy so it didn\'t impact my enjoyment too much. The sound though, it\'s lacking. A good soundtrack would\'ve made this anime A LOT better.All in all, Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is in no way an innovative, never-seen-before anime. The whole fantasy setting has been done so many times it\'s almost impossible to come up with something new. But who cares? Do you never eat the same food twice? I like binge watching fantasy anime with an accent on magic and I feel like this hit the right spot. It doesn\'t even need a second season, it\'s fine as it is!

I want to be able to sing its praises to all who\'ll listen, letting everyone know how worth their time it is to sit down and enjoy it. But I can\'t do that right now. I hope by the end of its run, I can at least say it was a memorable experience.Part of this desire probably stems from Grimoire\'s resemblance to one of my favorite anime of all time, Spice and Wolf. With a similar atmosphere and general vibe, setting (medieval, Europe), and the same dynamic of two travelling companions (which becomes...three in this case, infuriating but I\'ll touch on that in the next segment), on a mutual journey, its first episode left me extremely hopeful for its future. Unfortunately, the crossovers end there.These types of shows rely almost entirely on the two main characters and the interplay between them. Spice and Wolf\'s Holo and Lawrence were such a witty and naturally compatible duo, and played off of one another so well, that entire minutes-long sequences of dialogue felt as ensnaring to watch as any expertly choreographed and explosive fight scene. That level of crisp writing and dialogue is simply not apparent in Grimoire of Zero. Most of our character\'s interactions are trivial in nature and execution, yet the progress in their relationship, and in turn the things they\'re willing to do for one another, speeds up at a disorienting and bizarre pace. All in order to meet the demands of the plot. Strike 1.To make matters worse, Grimoire introduces a practically irrelevant third character into the equation. This addition only serves to cripple the pair\'s ambiance generally, and to this point I simply cannot deduce the value of the decision. One could argue this character brings to us important information about the world of Zero, but I argue that that isn\'t reason enough to introduce him as a mainstay which completely derails any and all flow of the main duo. At most, he should have been a character that departed in the span of an episode after giving us the info we needed. Perhaps if this character was at all interesting, I would let this point go without much contention, but alas. Strike 2.My main gripe with this show, though, is the way in which it handled its very first *real* conflict. Without spoiling, Grimoire set itself up with, intentionally or not, a grand opportunity to introduce some amazing drama in the second half of its cour. We simply didn\'t know enough about our characters true motivations and desires at the time of this conflict, which would have given us as the viewer the awesome experience of sharing the main lead\'s (who is as left in the dark as us) suspicions and doubts as they uncovered the truth. I was extremely excited, thinking back to my excitement after finishing the first episode, ""This is what I\'ve been waiting for!"" Gears turning in my mind, thinking of all the possible permutations available, all leading us to an epic climax. Unfortunately though, Grimoire sinks the ship that hasn\'t even had the opportunity to set sail, by telling us, within 2 minutes of introducing the conflict and in no uncertain terms, who exactly the villain is and who we should be rooting for. This is simply a failure of good writing, especially egregious when the set pieces have fallen into place so nicely. Strike 3.Grimoire has potential. It seems to have all the ingredients needed to make a memorable anime, if only its execution were more refined. In fact, even with all of its downfalls, this is still an enjoyable show.

And there is something to be said for that.', 'These days, witches are regarded as practitioners of magic and act as the female equivalent of wizards in what would be considered as the pop culture norm for magic.  While their original existence no longer has any place in society today, the history of evil witches, people who have made deals with the devil and practice witchcraft still lingers in the ugly recesses of history.  With that said, what would happen if you put both of them together?  To create a world where in a sense, both the meaning of witches in history and pop culture come together?Story: The Grimoire of Zero...story starts us off in the land of Wenias, a place plagued by those who practice magic known as witches and men who born as animal known as Beastfallen.  It is here where we meet a certain beastfallen simply known as ‘Mercenary’ for the entire series (and for the sake of simplification), a self-explanatory character that does the mercenary work of killing witches for hire.  On one trip through the woods, he comes in contact with a little witch by the name of ‘Zero’, who tells him that she is on a journey to find what has been stolen, her book of spells, the Grimoire of Zero.Taking up all twelve episodes of the series to cover just the first book of the original LN series, the adaptation becomes an intriguing story with many facets to its characters, as its main duo of large tiger man and tiny witch protagonists act as a faction-less duo that do practically whatever they want so long as it benefits them and their goals.  We’re given a realistic depiction of the reaction to witches in our own history put into a fantasy setting, which to me is a good way to shape up the main conflict.  As a result, the show allows the audience to view both sides of the main conflict, testing many of the other characters’ morals and actions while providing a good blend of action and humorous character interactions to aid in filling out holes that the main plot leaves behind.Adding to that is characterization.  Personally I feel as though the show does have some imbalance with how it chose to develop its characters.  Due to the nature of the show having two ostracized groups of characters in its society (Beastfallen and Witches), the show primarily focused on the witch characters and the witches’ struggles in society rather than the Beastfallen.  Our main protagonist doesn’t really get the time of day aside from a couple choice moments in order to be ‘developed’.  Aside from that, the rest of the series is devoted to the problems that the witches in Wenias face and their on-going war for freedom from oppression.Despite that problem, the show is one of the most well paced series that I’ve seen in a long while.  Taking account as many details as they could, White Fox managed to create a series that neither felt boring nor too rushed to watch, letting things continue as they went along at an even pace so that every moment felt engaging.  Many times, I felt as though the episodes were too short because I was so engrossed in watching it.While less eventful than the climax and many other sections of the story, the ending manages to cap off the first main arc of the series that acts both as an ending to the entire series while being open-ended enough to welcome a second season if White Fox so chooses to do so.  Not really a big fan of how many things were thrown into exposition, but I guess to develop the whole scope of the story’s events, they had to make a couple things via time skip to make things a lot easier.Overall, despite its imbalance with who and what it chooses to characterize, Grimoire of Zero was a show that was gripping from start to finish.  Having a simple plot that was explored to almost its full extent, the show managed to be both engaging and entertaining to the end while providing good world building that mixed in the central conflict of the series.  Every episode felt too short for me to fully appreciate, and it left me wanting more.  My only complaint really is that there is no second season.  Please White Fox.  Do it.Overview:+ Well-paced story+ Simple, yet effective plot-  Who they characterized was imbalance-  Ending is a bit…uneventful comparativelyCharacters:  As mentioned before, the show’s plethora of characters act as members of one side or one motive while our main characters act as a ‘third’ or ‘faction-less’ group that gets involved with their own sets of goals in mind.The first is Mercenary; the giant fluffy tiger man that despite having a giant FFVII-esque sword, is actually quite soft and fluffy on the inside with a pension for cooking.  Being a Beastfallen, Mercenary is a character that despises witches and dreams of one day curing him of his beast curse and opening up a pub once he’s human.  As a character, Mercenary is very much a character that sits in his own morals but doesn’t act outside of what he isn’t involved in.  As such, he’s less of a by the numbers fantasy protagonist, and more of a ‘does whatever he wants’ kind of guy, which fits into the story perfectly.  He acts as the more grounded character of the duo and gets some significant change once the series starts picking up and his more ‘lone wolf’ demeanor softens up.Then there’s Zero, the tiny white-haired witch who enjoys the simple things in life: food.  Comparatively, Zero is the freer, more airheaded member of the main duo, as she had spent her life in a cave up until her book was stolen, and lacks any kind of basic knowledge of the outside world.  Rather than being a ditzy klutz (mostly), Zero is a calm airhead simply because she doesn’t know anything aside from the intricacies of magic, leading to a majority of the show’s comedic and enjoyable moments due to her hilariously blunt nature and lack of what would widely be considered as ‘common sense’.  As such, she has something of a unique identity that when mixed with her mercenary, creates fun character interactions between two quite likeable characters.For the supporting cast, we’re treated to a myriad of characters who act as players to the bigger stage of the kingdom of Wenias, as most if not all of them have some kind of affiliation to one faction or another in the war for magic.  As such, characters like Albus and the Sorcerers of Zero are clearly defined to think one way while the royal kingdom and its citizens think the other in order to give clear definition on their opinion of the matter and thus easily explain the overall conflict of the scenario.  While less interesting than our main protagonists, the majority of them play their part as the background scenario well, which is the most you could ask for in a series featuring two clearly defined sides.  The only one of the supporting cast that differs from this rule is ‘Thirteen’; a character similar to our main protagonists as he only does what he believes is right/based in his own goals and a compatriot of Zero.Overview:+ Very intriguing main protagonists+ Fitting and clearly defined side castArt: Produced by White Fox, Grimoire of Zero has the clear fantasy look that the studio has used for previous projects in the past (such as Re:Zero, for example)  More or less standard fare in terms of the quality of this day and age, the animation and art quality for the show is good, but not overly amazing or budget breaking.I do however want to bring attention to the various forms of magic used in the show, as the intricate circles and various effects of the spells enhance the art quality to truly feel like a fantasy/magic show.  Additionally, and this is more personal than anything, the character design for Zero is amazing.  It’s the right amount of complexity and really fits with the overall aesthetic of the show.Overview:+ Nice touch on the magic usage+/- Standard artSound: “Hakkensha wa Watashi”, the OP for Grimoire of Zero is a whimsical rock song that helps provide an adventurous tone to the travels of our main characters and contrasts the more serious tone of the magic war in the series.  Personally, I feel like the song itself isn’t all that memorable, but it is a good track that’s been on a few of my own song loops.To contrast, the ED, ""Hajimari no Shirushi” is a laid back piece that relies more on strings and light piano to elevate a sense of wonder in our characters’ journey.  Accompanied by a children’s book graphic, the ED feels a lot better than its OP counterpart, as it has a nice style to it that gives us a nice contrast everything that the show has given us up until this point.Overview:+ Good tracks+ Memorable EDPersonal Enjoyment: At the start of the season, I always handpick about a dozen shows to watch/review for the season.  Some are ‘obligatory’ as I watched and reviewed a previous season of it so it’s only natural that I do the same for subsequent seasons, and others are those that I personally find intriguing.  As a fan of fantasy, I found Grimoire of Zero to be interesting at first glance.  Before I knew it, it had become my most anticipated show of the season.  The overall plot had more to offer than just a simple magic-based story and had a lot of aspects that meshed well with each other to culminate into what we have.  I was so sucked into it that I was left wanting more, and I really, really want a second season of this because I really want to see more of Mercenary and Zero’s travels throughout the world plagued by magic.Did I enjoy this series?I think I may have enjoyed it a bit too much, but you can’t really blame a guy for having a preference, right?  Personally I found Zero to be the highlight of the series.  Her character was always such a joy to have on-screen, and I always appreciate a unique character to help tell the story.What didn’t I like about his series?Albus was really the big stickler for me.  They admittedly do play a big part in the series, but I just kinda found them annoying with their constant, constant preaching for their look on everything while I just sat there wanting to see something else involving Zero.Would I recommend this series?If you’re a fan of fantasy of magic, I would highly recommend watching this.  It has a unique enough identity large enough to completely separate itself from a majority of the cookie-cutter magic-based shows, showing that original ideas really can be successful.  The main characters are interesting, the entire plot is fleshed out, and it has such nice pacing that it feels almost like magic that this kind of even pacing can even exist in this era of rushed adaptations. story starts us off in the land of Wenias, a place plagued by those who practice magic known as witches and men who born as animal known as Beastfallen.  It is here where we meet a certain beastfallen simply known as ‘Mercenary’ for the entire series (and for the sake of simplification), a self-explanatory character that does the mercenary work of killing witches for hire.  On one trip through the woods, he comes in contact with a little witch by the name of ‘Zero’, who tells him that she is on a journey to find what has been stolen, her book of spells, the Grimoire of Zero.Taking up all twelve episodes of the series to cover just the first book of the original LN series, the adaptation becomes an intriguing story with many facets to its characters, as its main duo of large tiger man and tiny witch protagonists act as a faction-less duo that do practically whatever they want so long as it benefits them and their goals.  We’re given a realistic depiction of the reaction to witches in our own history put into a fantasy setting, which to me is a good way to shape up the main conflict.  As a result, the show allows the audience to view both sides of the main conflict, testing many of the other characters’ morals and actions while providing a good blend of action and humorous character interactions to aid in filling out holes that the main plot leaves behind.Adding to that is characterization.  Personally I feel as though the show does have some imbalance with how it chose to develop its characters.  Due to the nature of the show having two ostracized groups of characters in its society (Beastfallen and Witches), the show primarily focused on the witch characters and the witches’ struggles in society rather than the Beastfallen.  Our main protagonist doesn’t really get the time of day aside from a couple choice moments in order to be ‘developed’.  Aside from that, the rest of the series is devoted to the problems that the witches in Wenias face and their on-going war for freedom from oppression.Despite that problem, the show is one of the most well paced series that I’ve seen in a long while.  Taking account as many details as they could, White Fox managed to create a series that neither felt boring nor too rushed to watch, letting things continue as they went along at an even pace so that every moment felt engaging.  Many times, I felt as though the episodes were too short because I was so engrossed in watching it.While less eventful than the climax and many other sections of the story, the ending manages to cap off the first main arc of the series that acts both as an ending to the entire series while being open-ended enough to welcome a second season if White Fox so chooses to do so.  Not really a big fan of how many things were thrown into exposition, but I guess to develop the whole scope of the story’s events, they had to make a couple things via time skip to make things a lot easier.Overall, despite its imbalance with who and what it chooses to characterize, Grimoire of Zero was a show that was gripping from start to finish.  Having a simple plot that was explored to almost its full extent, the show managed to be both engaging and entertaining to the end while providing good world building that mixed in the central conflict of the series.  Every episode felt too short for me to fully appreciate, and it left me wanting more.  My only complaint really is that there is no second season.  Please White Fox.  Do it.Overview:+ Well-paced story+ Simple, yet effective plot-  Who they characterized was imbalance-  Ending is a bit…uneventful comparativelyCharacters:  As mentioned before, the show’s plethora of characters act as members of one side or one motive while our main characters act as a ‘third’ or ‘faction-less’ group that gets involved with their own sets of goals in mind.The first is Mercenary; the giant fluffy tiger man that despite having a giant FFVII-esque sword, is actually quite soft and fluffy on the inside with a pension for cooking.  Being a Beastfallen, Mercenary is a character that despises witches and dreams of one day curing him of his beast curse and opening up a pub once he’s human.  As a character, Mercenary is very much a character that sits in his own morals but doesn’t act outside of what he isn’t involved in.  As such, he’s less of a by the numbers fantasy protagonist, and more of a ‘does whatever he wants’ kind of guy, which fits into the story perfectly.  He acts as the more grounded character of the duo and gets some significant change once the series starts picking up and his more ‘lone wolf’ demeanor softens up.Then there’s Zero, the tiny white-haired witch who enjoys the simple things in life: food.  Comparatively, Zero is the freer, more airheaded member of the main duo, as she had spent her life in a cave up until her book was stolen, and lacks any kind of basic knowledge of the outside world.

Light novel adaptations give a much slower pace in terms of character development, plot, and amusement. Because of such attributes, such anime fails to quickly grab the viewer's amusement when it starts off. However, I do not regret watching this anime, because by about episode 7 or so it becomes interesting.The story is considerably well-planned.

I don't remember seeing any lazy parts of the animation, but the style of the drawings in generally was one of those commonly drawn styles. Because of the commonly drawn style of drawing, one would not particularly watch this anime solely for the art style. For some reason, this art style feels so redundant.Art: 8The voice actresses fit with all of the characters. The tiger sounds like a heavy man, Zero (the girl) sounds like how it should be and such. The OP, ED and OSTs all sound like they are on the good side. Perhaps the voice actors could have put more emotion to their acting, because that is the impression that this anime seems to lack, much like that of other average-looking anime.Sound: 9None of the characters really stuck with me in the first few episodes, but I can see how the author tried to make them feel like relatable characters by the conversations between Zero and the tiger and such. The character development feels slow, so only after a while, the characters started to stick with me. Also, the relationship between the Zero and the mercenary was quite relatable. Towards the end of the anime, all of the characters will be relatable, because they all have some kind of impact towards the entertainment of the anime.Character: 10Overall, this anime was enjoyable because it was worth watching. The theme anime seem to focus on the hierarchy of society and the oppressed. The moral and such is something to watch out for because I guess that is what makes the plot of this anime worth watching and interesting.Enjoyment: 9There were relatable characters, good story, nice voice actors, good art.

I watched this anime slightly overtired and had endless fun, because tigers are great.""Grimoire of Zero"" is about the mercenary Mercenary - yes, we don\'t know his name yet - and Zero. In a world full of magic, in a world of witches and witch burnings, an organization suddenly appears that promises to free the witches from the oppression of humans and avenge the death of a well-known and popular witch. But at the very end of the land,...the tiger man and witch hunter encounters the witch Zero - an incredibly powerful witch in search of her book, which is said to have the power to destroy the world.""Grimoire of Zero"" has charm, without a doubt. But some teething troubles can never be completely avoided and so this anime isn\'t perfect either.And yet it starts very strongly, so strongly in fact that I have nothing to criticize about the first half. But unfortunately this doesn\'t last and the closer the series gets to the finale, the worse it gets. Although it was really only a matter of minor things here.For one thing, I found the series completely predictable. With every story, I try to predict where it\'s going to go and here it really wasn\'t difficult to solve 90% of all the mysteries. Who founded the Wizards of Zero? Who stole the book? Where is Zero\'s missing friend? All important questions that were foreseeable within the first few episodes. Even though I didn\'t feel like the anime really tried to hide the answers, I really missed the big reveal, the bang at the end of the season.Secondly, I found many characters too lax, too lukewarm in their convictions. Here, true villains can simply be convinced with a few words, victims may have difficulties accepting them at first, but they always get along very quickly with their sworn enemies. The fact that the entire kingdom simply tolerates witches after decades of witch hunts, suffering and war - in what utopia would that be possible? Apparently in ""Grimoire of Zero"".I also found it a shame that very little is explained about the world and especially the magic system. We have a genius here who has revolutionized magic, but magic is never really explained. By guessing from a few scenes, you can make some sense of it, but I would have liked a bit more depth. Where does magic come from? What distinguishes witches from humans? What kind of organization is Zero from? How did the kingdom come into being? These are other questions that could have been included at one point or another.I would also have liked to have seen a proper happy ending for Mercenary and Zero, even if I still have to see the sequel.Conclusion: I really had a lot of fun with this series. It\'s obviously not perfect, but what is?

The novel were published in eleven volumes from early '14 to late '17. It has an ongoing manga adaptation and this anime that aired at close to its end. The anime was brought to us by White Fox, the studio that produced such colossal shite as Goblin Slayer & Katanagatari but also brought us some strong anime like Jormungand and Gochuumon wa Usagi desu ka. Let's hope for the best but anticipate the worst with this one. Which is pretty much my modus operandi.Story:Our protagonist is a beastfallen mercenary,...which basically means someone's white tiger fursona. One day he's escaping from a witch when he encounters a young looking witch named Zero. She persuades him to work as her bodyguard while she looks for her stolen grimoire and the compatriot of hers who went out looking for it. His condition is simple, she has to turn him from a fursona to a normal man when it's over. He also won't give her his actual name so she refers to him as Youhei.The big issue with the series is that a lot of the writing is very uneven. Take the meeting between Youhei and Zero. It's established in the events leading up to this that he's terrified of witches but he's won over with very little effort. The same can be said for the resolution for the conflict with Thirteen. Or take Zero's supposed lack of knowledge when it comes to life outside the caves she grew up in. It's an element that comes into play whenever the writer decides to bring it up. For instance, she doesn't know anything about money or commerce but she knows what a sex slave is. What, did she have a teacher in the caves who felt it very important that she know about sex slaves in the event that she wind up in the outside world but felt that understanding the basics of shopping was just useless? Was she taught by Kimura from Azumangah Daioh?For positives, the pacing is pretty well handled. The series also has some interesting ideas which prevent it from getting boring.Characters:The cast isn't very complex. A part of the issue does come from the uneven writing. So, a character will shift but it won't feel like natural development, it'll feel more like they're changing their position because the plot demands it but they're still the same character.The same rather typical character with very little if anything to differentiate them from a list of similar characters. Even their interactions are very under-written with huge shifts in how they'll act towards each other with little or no reason behind it.Art:The artwork is pretty good. The animation flows smoothly. The action sequences are decently handled. The backgrounds include some nice details. You can also credit the series for having some nice character designs.The biggest issue is with the expressions. A character like Thirteen won't change his expression at any point and a lot of times other characters will have awkward expressions given the circumstances. It's almost like White Fox wanted everyone to look vaguely stern at least half the time because they thought it would make things seem more intense.Sound:White Fox got a pretty good cast. Koyasu Takehito, Taichi You, Koyama Tsuyoshi and Hanamori Yumiri all give good performances. Matsuda Akito's music is pretty much typical fare to the point of being boring.Ho-yay:There isn't any to be found.Areas of Improvement:More consistent story-telling. If you want to have Zero win over Youhei in spite of his fear of witches, actually put some effort into making it believable. Same with Thirteen's change of heart.Move beyond the character archetypes. We've seen the hero who acts tough but has a heart of gold. We've seen the naive but powerful heroine. Using archetypes as a base is fine but they need to be expanded on and made into something unique to be interesting.Vary the facial expressions. I know Koyasu is a great actor, but he can't really give a character emotional depth when the art shows them with the same expression at all times. If you want to set a specific tone, both the actors and artists need to work together.Final Thoughts:This one definitely isn't as bad as the worst we've seen from White Fox. It's certainly not as strong as the best either, however. It's a mediocre series where the uneven writing and lack of character depth largely waste the potential of the premise. It's not a series that's particularly infuriating or horrendous with its worst elements but it's also not one that's ever great. It ends up quite middling. I'm giving it a 5/10. which basically means someone's white tiger fursona. One day he's escaping from a witch when he encounters a young looking witch named Zero. She persuades him to work as her bodyguard while she looks for her stolen grimoire and the compatriot of hers who went out looking for it. His condition is simple, she has to turn him from a fursona to a normal man when it's over. He also won't give her his actual name so she refers to him as Youhei.The big issue with the series is that a lot of the writing is very uneven. Take the meeting between Youhei and Zero. It's established in the events leading up to this that he's terrified of witches but he's won over with very little effort. The same can be said for the resolution for the conflict with Thirteen. Or take Zero's supposed lack of knowledge when it comes to life outside the caves she grew up in. It's an element that comes into play whenever the writer decides to bring it up. For instance, she doesn't know anything about money or commerce but she knows what a sex slave is. What, did she have a teacher in the caves who felt it very important that she know about sex slaves in the event that she wind up in the outside world but felt that understanding the basics of shopping was just useless? Was she taught by Kimura from Azumangah Daioh?For positives, the pacing is pretty well handled. The series also has some interesting ideas which prevent it from getting boring.Characters:The cast isn't very complex. A part of the issue does come from the uneven writing. So, a character will shift but it won't feel like natural development, it'll feel more like they're changing their position because the plot demands it but they're still the same character.The same rather typical character with very little if anything to differentiate them from a list of similar characters. Even their interactions are very under-written with huge shifts in how they'll act towards each other with little or no reason behind it.Art:The artwork is pretty good. The animation flows smoothly. The action sequences are decently handled. The backgrounds include some nice details. You can also credit the series for having some nice character designs.The biggest issue is with the expressions. A character like Thirteen won't change his expression at any point and a lot of times other characters will have awkward expressions given the circumstances. It's almost like White Fox wanted everyone to look vaguely stern at least half the time because they thought it would make things seem more intense.Sound:White Fox got a pretty good cast. Koyasu Takehito, Taichi You, Koyama Tsuyoshi and Hanamori Yumiri all give good performances. Matsuda Akito's music is pretty much typical fare to the point of being boring.Ho-yay:There isn't any to be found.Areas of Improvement:More consistent story-telling. If you want to have Zero win over Youhei in spite of his fear of witches, actually put some effort into making it believable. Same with Thirteen's change of heart.Move beyond the character archetypes. We've seen the hero who acts tough but has a heart of gold. We've seen the naive but powerful heroine. Using archetypes as a base is fine but they need to be expanded on and made into something unique to be interesting.Vary the facial expressions.

The depth and lore this anime has at first is something you would want in every fantasy anime. It takes place in the medieval time place where it's basically about witches being hunted. The premise of this kind of story is already sounds interesting and starts of great until we get the ending. I would have given the story an 8 if it wasn't because of the ending. To be honest if 13 stayed a villain until the very end I would have like things better. Characters were very big for me. I...think the reason I was enjoying this anime so much was because of its characters. Zero personality was just something I want one female character in every anime to have. Mercenary was also someone I enjoyed with his tsun attitude.

It\'s concentrated around a few characters with some support cast who only appear once-twice for a couple of minutes and disappear.This means that we need to have some proper development of both the characters themselves and the relationships between them. Both parts are very limited and shallow simply following a formulaic path of an average plotline. There is nothing special here, at all. Sure, maybe someone will be amused by ""uwu she is sleeping on a furry"" part, but...it worked mostly as comedy.2. The bland experience.Since the story doesn\'t have much comedy beyond the creepy tailor and some gags in the opening episodes, there are also no decent tragic/dramatic episodes to make you as a viewer have any emotional connection. It\'s just bland, it has no flavor. The unimaginative backstory that could have been at least executed well, but tastes like stale bread.3. Plotline is rather simple, but is ""confusing"" and stupid for no reason.Honestly it\'s just a bunch of nonsense of Witches doing nobody knows what with nobody knows what goals exactly, Kingdom that simply views them as insane = burn them at the stakes (and it makes sense). A lot of generic talks about ""revenge"" and ""revolts"" but it\'s basically meaningless.You have beastmen who are hated because legend says witches created them/or they carry sins to be born that way.And yet Grimoire isn\'t going all the way with those ideas, doesn\'t explore them and has nothing to bring at the table. It ends up been - Yeah I\'ve seen this many times before.Grimoire has some very decent art when it gives you World exposition through history which is drawn in a Medieval style and that elevates the show somewhat.To sum it up, if I were to try and review it a couple of days later I\'m sure I would\'ve forgotten about this show all together and it\'s one of the typical cases of ""short Youtube cuts are more curious than the whole thing"".

I'd like to leave a review here. My ranking system is explained on my profile.Story -7/10The story was a typical conflict between different groups. The story had nothing very special to it. The main twist was decent but was predictable due to certain shots from earlier in the anime. The story was slightly better than most anime with the premise due to the involvement of Beastfallen, a certain race which is treated as inferior to humans (Revealing more about them would spoil the plot.).

I cannot fully reveal WHY the 5 rating (which to me is not mediocre but fair) without giving some spoilers.. You have been warned :DOh,english is not my native language. I am sorry for all grammatical or syntax errors.First read the synopsis..Ahh… it really felt like this anime had a great scope and world building but it really felt short in the end. Basically we follow three main characters – Mercenary (a beastfallen); Zero (a witch) and Albus (another witch who was hunting the Mercenary – we all know...that beastfall hate witches).What were their goals?-\tZero, is a witch (not affliated with anyone) that wrote a book – Grimoire of Zero – that was used to spread magic throughout the land. Btw first plot-hole Magic already was used before??-\tMercenary was going throughout the land killing witches-\tAlbus (a regular guy who was part of Sorcerers of Zero)There is a war going on – In one side we have the Empire who abhors Magic; in the other we have the Sorcerers of Zero (witches) who started a war after the Empire killed Sorena (a witch accused of starting a plague) and then we’ve got some Rogue Witches (who basically are against them all but we never see them...)We also have some mysterious character called ""Him"" that teach the Sorcerers of Zero magic (through the Grimoire of Zero) and we also have a guy called Thirteen who is a witch but fights for the Empire.In the beginning of the anime we’ve got Zero - a young teen who is trying to find the book she created. She finds a beastfallen that she calls Mercenary and employ him as a bodyguard. Later we meet Albus who is hunting the Mercenary Albus is later captured by the Mercenary and Zero but  then becomes their companion rather than prisoner.As they travel throughout the land they arrive at a city where Albus says it’s the residence of the Grimoire of Zero. They found everyone dead and Albus says that maybe Sorena’s Grandaughter escape with it – well SPOILER ALERT – She is Sorena’s granddaughter SO why would she say that??This some plot hole but there are so many of them… the all 13 and Him plot is rather bad.... Any normal person would immediatally knew that 13 was Him. After all it is said that 13 stole the Grimoire of Zero, but it was ""Him"" that teaches the Sorcerers of Zero with the book 13 stole (yeah right...) Oh... And ""Him"" ask that each sorcerer of zero to commit their souls to him – (so if they try to kill him or if he dies they all died)Then we\'ve got the actions by 13? Well in the end we learn that 13 is killing all witches because he wants Zero to rule the land. What? So why did he first kill everyone with whom they live with, then teach people magic,  created a coven called the sorcerers of Zero and then join the other side to start a war? I really didn’t understand that… this is some bad writing right there…. And why is not Zero upset that 13 killed all her friends where she lived with?Then there are other inconsistencies – Zero hires Mercenary to help him and then in some episode she makes a curse on him that says that everything that happens to him will get back to her – Why? If she loves him or cares for him and he being a tank is not a idiotic move? There is no real purpose for this… Who was the bodyguard of who?Then we\'ve got Holden - another beastfallen. They first fight with him in the city because he had some woman captured. Later on we learn that he was the bodyguard of Albus - SO WHY THE HECK WAS HE DOING THAT? Were these woman related in any way to Albus disappearance? It made no purpose or sense...""Characters""- Well, the Mercenary is the only one with redeeming qualities. We learn more about his drama and conflicts because beastfallen are not well receive within the human world; but they also hunt witches because they blame them for their curse state. It\'s like an outcast...Zero – Well a young girl that creates the Grimoire of Zero and is searching for it in the open world where she had never gone before.  She doesn’t evolve that much in terms of characters – except – in terms of connecting to people. She has some comic reliefs throughout the season. But is she a good girl? She knows 13 killed all her friends from beneath the mountain but she is not even upset. She doesn\'t try to punish 13 after he started a war in her name...Albus – A boy who turns out to be a girl and Sorena’s granddaughter and the leader of the pack called Sorcerers of Zero. Yeah that\'s it...Thirteen – the main antagonist who basically kill thousands of people, so Zero could rule the land. He fought for both sides and play some seriously mind tricks on everyone (except when Zero tells him in the last episode that when she wrote the Grimoire of Zero she made some mistakes on purpose so no-one could beat her – what?) Another plot hole – So Thirteen only knows magic because of the Grimoire of Zero? Does he not knew before?Then in the end how do they resolve everything? Well basically Albus has eliminating magic throughout the land. In the beginning he starts doing just that – so my question is – every magician could do that or just him/her?Afterwards it’s Zero, the Mercenary, Albus, Holdem (Albus bodyguard) and Thirteen (now a good guy) do that thing and Zero eliminates magic. Could she do that as well? And to all magic or only the magic  based on Grimoire of Zero?Enfin, I cannot say what to I think about his... I try to love the world but it felt short. It was badly written with some plot holes I cannot forgive.Will there be a second season? I doubt it. There is room for that but I don\'t think it will get it.Btw, in the beginning I had put a rating of 7 but as I watch the last three episodes I got so disappointed. that beastfall hate witches).What were their goals?-\tZero, is a witch (not affliated with anyone) that wrote a book – Grimoire of Zero – that was used to spread magic throughout the land.

Okay, from the very beginning it doesn\'t proclaims itself as something totally new. The setting is meh. The show manages to convey world\'s history in a poor way. How many times did you see a world with witches (magicians, special ability users, ninjas, gamers, hamsters) and those who hunt them? One way or another... I\'ve encountered it myself dozens times. Overused troops are present here in quite a number. I had a vague sensation of secondariness...in everything.It begins with an union of the beast and the girl. I have to admit this part is quite cute and pleasant to observe. The anime should have concentrate on a relationship of Mercenary and Zero more on my opinion. I think everything else was unwanted. Every time the anime would turn to some action part or to some other storylines, I\'d found myself rather bored. It would turn out even more interesting if it were a slice of life anime within a fantasy world. Unfortunately, it\'s not. Honestly, sometimes I had to endure watching it. Reaching the end, it becomes more and more dull.Visual part is just okay... But again, fight scenes are just not good. It wasn\'t properly explained in the show how they use magic. I often questioned myself what are those circles and stripes around them when they cast powerful spells, for example. Why they change colors etc.I don\'t like they way they were drawn. It\'s unsystematic.On the other hand ordinary scenes are quite decent.I liked the op and the ed. I can\'t say anything more about OST-s probably because they were quite ordinary to remember them.Voices of Zero and Mercenary make a good match to their characters. Dialogue parts between them were truly good.Personally, I\'m prone to like characters which interact with each other like the beast and the witch did. That\'s cocky and nice.However... there were another useless characters to my greatest pity. Albus is way too commonplace type of character. Furthermore, it\'s the type which annoys me.The antagonist here made me even more irritated. I can\'t even find proper words to express my ""facepalmness\' of him. It\'s not like I had some hopes for him. But I didn\'t expect him to turn out ""a villain because of circumstances with good intentions"" type. Stupid.Don\'t you dare to complain it to Spice and Wolf. I\'m a bit surprised there are people who compare them. It\'s on completely different levels.As a conclusion, I can say Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho sure had some potential.

I think it suffers from the same things a lot of the 12 episode series out there do. Basically, the world was fairly well developed, the characters seemed interesting and had room to fill out their history. The plot was intriguing, with mysteries to solve. Then you get to the last couple episodes, and the whole thing kind of vomits up all of the answers and exposition you never wanted, combined with a rushed ending that magically ties up all of the loose ends but really leaves...a lot of holes in logic. It even feels like the writing takes a hit in those last couple episodes, like they either didn't have time to polish the script, or they were too rushed to cram in exposition and it hurt the dialogue. Ah well, it's still an enjoyable watch, it's just too bad it didn't have more time to flesh out the story and let it wrap up at a natural pace. a lot of holes in logic.

It\'s not that there are underlying mechanisms to magic in the world that are slowly revealed, or there are hidden motivations to the characters, it\'s just that everything in the show is either outright stupid , self contradictory or both. Toss in a really good helping of ""STFU IT\'S BECAUSE I SAY SO"", logic, and you have...a story line that makes you want to hit your head into a wall until your brain stops working.OK the world makes no sense, been there done that, hows the story line ? It\'s putrid garbage. Plot elements drop out of nowhere and fall into the protagonists hands. The big mystery i(LOL) s something you solve the moment it\'s revealed, by the time you get to the end you are wondering how the heck are these people so stupid.The above wouldn\'t be unforgivable. It works perfectly well in screwball comedies, romcoms, porn etc. This isn\'t any of those things. It\'s an adventure with a mystery/plot, and an element of romance and it\'s pure fail.Well maybe it\'s saved by the characters ??  NOPE !!! not a chance. The characters have traits that get flipped on and off like light switches. I hate you, I love you, I hate you like a blinky fricking light. Oh sorry, I just repeatedly attempted to kill you, so I could cut you up for your parts, no hard feelings ? Lets be besties !!!! Smile cute cute. Youhei, was the arguably the most believable/realatable character there but even he falls flat.Last chances for this anime ? Art/Music/Sound. I caught the dub so bear that in mind, the voice acting for the most part was below average. Just didn\'t hit emotional notes well at all. The music and art were OK nothing special, and certainly not enough to save the anime.Do yourself a favor with this one and just give it a pass. a story line that makes you want to hit your head into a wall until your brain stops working.OK the world makes no sense, been there done that, hows the story line ?

Spoilers ahead!)I hope to one day write my own novel.While writing reviews, analyses, and essays is my forte, I have always had a keen interest in fiction. Whether completely imaginary like the Harry Potter series or closer to realism like 1984, the approach involves a different mindset that is fun to indulge. Creating witty dialogue. Describing scenery. Forming logical plotlines. It’s much different than articulating how an anime accomplished its goals or basing events off a personal set of ideas.Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho features a novel of sorts – the Grimoire of Zero –...written by one of its characters. In some sense, it contains the purely fictional (to us at any rate). Sadly, it doesn’t contain the solution for the show’s lagging performance.STORYZero kara opens with witches at the stake and a huge white tiger-man fending off a few bounty hunters. After escaping the city, he, by chance, encounters a powerful female sorcerer just trying to enjoy some soup. She offers him the miracle he has always dreamed of: to turn back into a human. He must only act as her bodyguard while they search for her all-important book that, in the wrong hands, could destroy the world. After a finger-blood oath between the two, the witch-hating Mercenary and the “wagahai”-saying Zero begin their adventure in earnest.Said adventure certainly contains the right elements to achieve narrative strength. The fantasy setting. The writing chops. The noticeable themes. Unfortunately for Zero kara, it takes these elements, attempts to form some magic with them, and ultimately summons a lackluster tale despite its many possibilities.Lacking begins when it tackles the fantasy that drives the setting. The anime takes place in a world that resembles Medieval times with an extra helping of magic and beast men (known as “beastfallen”). To the show’s credit, it does try to build its world at times. For instance, as the characters investigate the carnage following the sacking of the village of Latette, Zero describes some of the spells used and what they can do. The anime also highlights the tensions between the different political and warring factions, including beastfallen, sorcerers, and regular humans.Yet the show’s delivery of this information isn’t always sound. For the first three episodes (and never again afterwards), a narrator spews out relevant details to get the audience up to speed rather than letting them learn of it through more natural means. Then, in episode six, the characters do almost nothing but talk with and at each other about the current situation. Again, this info is necessary to create a believable, connected world, but the method behind its creation doesn’t go for anything enticing.Furthermore, Zero kara doesn’t deliver enough. Despite everything going on, the anime never really goes out of its way to build a finer, more nuanced world for its characters to run around in. The knights hardly interact with the sorcerers, losing out on potential quarrels and insight. Minimal exploration of different areas keeps the kingdom itself either too isolated or too disparate as well.Beyond the fantasy setting, Zero kara also has some clout with its writing chops. Quite regularly, the anime demonstrates a clear grasp of creating plot points and following through on them in a logical, fair manner.Take the magic potion that Thirteen gives to Mercenary to nullify his beastfallen self. It not only symbolizes his conviction to stay true to the quest that got him here but also it becomes the item that frees Zero from her magical prison later on.Or how about those blood contracts near the very beginning of the season. They form the basis for Thirteen’s scheme when he reveals that his death as “Him” will kill every Sorcerer of Zero and rogue witch out there presently.Zero’s tattered robe that she trades for a better set of stylish clothes counts, too. It gets used as part of a tracking spell that was in turn introduced back in the second episode of the season with Mercenary’s fur and the undercover witch.Can’t forget about the “curse” placed upon Mercenary by Zero either, for it pops up in quadruple fashion. Once when Mercenary is shot with an arrow. Once when Thirteen stops the guards from attacking him. Once when the giant dude bites Mercenary’s arm. Once when Mercenary blocks Zero’s mega attack to stop her from accidentally killing Thirteen and subsequently herself.Not to mention the cool idea of Zero purposefully writing the spells in the Grimoire of Zero incorrectly, a detail that the audience can potentially catch onto when noticing her chants during her duel with Thirteen.Truth be told, none of these examples stand out as exceptional in terms of impact or intrigue. But they no doubt stand as evidence for the anime’s respectable writing choices.However, it must be noted that several of Zero kara’s story beats belittle the progression made instead. Biggest among them? The entire plot predicated by the fact that Thirteen essentially didn’t talk with and ask Zero about what she really wants. Plus, the tension involved throughout the last conflict lacks weight. Thirteen already used his rat familiar to coerce his followers to fight, yet he apparently cannot undo his decree despite their devoutness.Smaller writing oddities affect the show as well. The convenient forced-teleportation spell after triggering a specific word seems too easy to push things where they need to go. A strange decision to cut the dramatic scene following Zero’s near death has no place. The group managing to traverse the entire kingdom in a strangely timely manner when placing the five mega-magic circles raises an eyebrow. With all the respect the writing deserves, it still foregoes some of it of its own accord when it commits to these weirder, weaker choices.After the setting and the writing, the themes also try their hand. They dabble in morality through perspectives on racism and mindsets. One of the best scenes from the season follows these throughputs well. In episode seven, a young lady humors Mercenary, tricking him to have him help drive away other beastfallen at their establishment (or, as she and he put it, “It is what it is”).These moments are few and far between, though. Indeed, Zero kara often misses out on a more balanced view of these topics, portraying each group involved as mostly negative rather than reaching for a middle ground. Serena was a kind sorcerer as was that old man who let Holdem walk free. Yet the constant misbehavior of the beastfallen. The current sorcerers almost never using their powers for good. The on-the-nose lines yelled by various villagers about the witches and their evil ways. Everything adds up to misbalance the anime’s thematic presence.Altogether, the setting, writing, and themes are all there for the show to capitalize on. Unfortunately, that doesn’t exactly happen even with its best efforts, leaving the narrative without an option to summon further refinement.ART & ANIMATIONFor the most part, Zero kara gets the job done with its visuals. On an artistic level, the locations do little else besides fit where the characters are and what they are doing. E.g., traveling through a forest, visiting a busy city. They aren’t explored to any large degree, and the details present do not invite anything of interest to look at. Most likely a byproduct of the anime’s lack of world-building drive.Nevertheless, the show displays at a semi-infrequent rate key shots that argue a lot more in its favor. A faraway view of the kingdom’s capital with a mountainous backdrop. The crew’s bonfire illuminates their lonely spot during the forest’s dark night; it eventually gives way to them overlooking a section of the forest as a rainbow arcs overhead. A somewhat top-down shot of Zero’s cavernous “home” as ominous red lighting fills the air. Again, these shots are by no means around all the time let alone to a noticeable extent. But, when they do appear, one has to at least appreciate their detail.For the rest of the anime’s production and animation, it goes back to that serviceable state. It rarely tries for anything fancy in its scene composition or techniques in general. The most adventurous it gets is in episode six. Thirteen and Mercenary hold a private conversation, and a neat rotating-camera trick simulates the former’s hypnosis of the latter. All the while, the centralized glass vial housing the magic potion he desires reflects their faces.Otherwise, a couple of rotated frames here and a few magic uses there counteract the weird charging close-ups of Holdem in his duel with Mercenary and the disregard for any interesting imagery overall.The character designs likewise follow suit. Albus is designed to look like a teenage boy, so her looks do conceal her true nature, but the tradeoff is extreme plainness. Thirteen’s black cloak, dark purple eyes, unkempt hair, and angled face translate well into an evil aura, but his demeanor and slowness strip away any intimidation. Mercenary and Zero do fair a bit better, though. Mercenary’s large build, rogue outfit, and white fur both mirror and complement Zero’s small build, sorcery attire, and white hair, making their designs a fun, dichotomous duo.In all, the visuals remain consistent in their meager delivery. Not that that hurts the anime, but it doesn’t help it out either.CHARACTERSMercenary, Zero, Albus, and Thirteen. As the four main characters of Zero kara, they contribute to this anime in various ways. They also vary in their efficacy, too, putting their group in a questionable spot right alongside most of the other parts to this anime.Mercenary stands the tallest among the group both within the show and in an analytical sense. With fangs, fur, and ferocity, he embodies the beastfallen moniker. His white coat coats his fervent dislike for witches, and his big build and even bigger sword makes him a force during any fight. Yet beneath his rough exterior, a softness of heart guides his path.For, while he may frown upon Zero and Albus for their sorcery and their actions, he looks out for their well-being. He makes them soup. He finds them lodgings. He protects them to the best of his ability. He’s no saint, but he clearly strives for what is at least morally good. A statement reinforced by his honesty when dealing with Zero’s priceless gems in episode three.Although, his kindness towards them is somewhat out of a desire of his own: to be a full-fledged human. This conflict arises out of a few interspersed scenes. In a flashback, he attacks and kills a gang of bandits who were terrorizing his village to obtain his head. Another occurs in his arrested freefall where he remembers how he and other beastfallen were mainly expendable losses in war, and his prowess and violence earned him the nickname “The Black Beast of Death” as well as jeers for his demise.So, when Zero crosses that path of his, and her sincere words match those of his mother’s from when he was a kid, he accepts her offer with his own style of oath. What follows, then, is his journey alongside that which (and witch) he hates, experiencing troubles of a physical and mental nature as he fends off baddies and learns more about the magical world (and people) around him.Come the end of episode six, however, it is clear that the seeds of doubt still stir in his soul. He (unwillingly) raises his blade against Zero, forcing their separation and his contemplation. Nevertheless, she keeps him alive thanks to her powers and keeps him sane thanks to her reaffirmation of the softness within him. The latter especially, for he nearly succumbs to the beastfallen desire of eating flesh that the show alludes to a few times throughout the season. Thankfully, his memories (albeit neither extensive nor moving) of their time together stay his fangs.Now with a clearer mind, he knows what he must do. He works with Holdem to save Albus from her untimely fate. He scales the side of a cliff and climbs the outside of a castle to reach Zero and to tell her that what little brains he has were enough to convince himself that he had to be there for her despite his doubts. He even takes part in the final magic ritual (but not before a playful prod), indicating that, by this point, he has overcome his disdain for those arts to at least some miniscule extent.Zero kara gives Mercenary a rather appreciable arc to his character – except it flubs his finale. With his journey complete, he doesn’t receive his desire to become a human. He doesn’t get to settle down as an inn proprietor like he wanted to either. The audience doesn’t even get to learn his real name, missing out on a neat full-circle writing chance right at the end.Rather, the anime doubles down thrice. One, the beast part of soul is fused even tighter to him after the ritual. Two, he continues traveling with Zero. And three, he actively refuses to give his true name or learn Zero’s, saying, “Well, maybe it won’t be so bad if I’m a beastfallen a little while longer,” a statement that contradicts his base motivations. In short, this open-endedness to his arc stops him from being a solid character and closer to barely a competent one.Arguably, his line there follows a theme on being comfortable in one’s skin (or, in this case, fur). But that was never really a talking point of the show. Instead, what it focused on most was that of indirect loneliness. The audience sees it handily with Mercenary. As a beastfallen, he’s ostracized to some extent, he is belittled, and he cannot get along with humans or witches.Zero experiences such indirect loneliness as well. In fact, almost her entire character stems from this idea. It’s obvious from her interactions in the city and with Mercenary that, despite her skills, she doesn’t have a grasp on how regular life and normal society works. Seemingly because she has been kept in a cave for most of her life, knowing only faded pages for friends and an occasional peeking sun to keep her company. She explains as such periodically, too.As such, her connection to Mercenary means a lot to her since he’s one of the only people – beastfallen or otherwise – that she has ever bonded with. Unfortunately, Zero kara does not go too out of its way to build their relationship.That’s partly because of Albus, a necessary evil in this show. She basically represents the “other side,” the counterpoint to much of the plot’s discussion about the warring factions. She either introduces or says a line of thinking that relates to the sorcerers’ camp, and the anime proceeds to highlight why her naïve worldview isn’t as black-and-white as she may believe. Furthermore, without Serena around anymore, and realizing that her newfound friends do not necessarily agree with her stances, she as well goes through that same indirect loneliness.However, with her inclusion, she severely detracts from that key component of Zero kara: Zero and Mercenary’s relationship. With this third wheel constantly around and spinning, the two main characters of the anime hardly have any scenes just together to make their connection worthwhile.Not to mention that Zero is simply not a compelling character on her own, and the anime itself sidelines her for a sizable chunk of the last half of the season. This sidelining mirrors her time in the caves and coincides with that indirect loneliness, so it does make sense on a writing level. However, the anime spends very little time addressing her thoughts and her actions while in captivity to make it worth the time. So, when her climactic scene with Mercenary in the castle tower arrives, it’s nice in concept, but the foundation for it doesn’t exist or at the minimum doesn’t have the support required to elevate it to a strong level.Then there’s Thirteen, the weakest of the four. He appears roughly halfway through the season as a quasi-evil dude. Simultaneously, he acts as Zero’s caretaker and teacher (or to her, “brother”) during her cave times and, after his leave, a zealot to the cause of granting her the world that (he thought) she desires. Where she viewed magic as a tool that would benefit everyone, Thirteen saw that it would be nothing else besides a weapon for the common simpleton.His thinking somewhat comes true when his secret ploy upholds the inevitable abuse and misuse of this magic. As for his actual character, it does not uphold as well. Because of the mystery that surrounds him on a plot level, he never receives enough attention. There’s no tangible context to his rise as “Him.” His admiration of Serena has little to no basis. His feuds with Albus and Holdem do not have the necessary room to grow. He doesn’t relate to that indirect loneliness as well as the others. Just a weak character all in all.Overall, on the total execution scale, Mercenary rises above Zero, Albus, and Thirteen. But when Mercenary does not attain anything higher than competency, the cast here do not deserve much praise whatsoever.MUSIC & SOUNDAlthough last in order, the ending track wins first. Titled “Hajimari no Shirushi,” delicate piano keys and light acoustic strings calm the audience in their simple, gentle flow. Soft vocals accompany the instrumentals, upping the calmness of the piece that much more. The melodic pace moves the song along in a nice way, and the rise in tone changes its structure without taking anything away from that calming feel.Opposite the ED, the opening track heads for the back of the pact. Immediately, the sound of this piece is entirely unfitting. It would be appropriate for a story aimed at something slightly whimsical rather than serious like Zero kara. The vocals aren’t shabby, and the beat has a catchiness to it, but the punk-rock body of the song simply detracts from the established direction of the content itself.Tsuyoshi Koyama as Mercenary likewise hurts the show’s chances. To start, his voice for the white-furred beastfallen does not go deep enough to match his build. The delivery of his lines lacks emotion, too. And roars sound less like a ferocious tiger and more like a guy frustrated from stubbing his toe on a nearby table. Not that his performance is a total failure – it just didn’t embody the main character in full.Less frustrating is the rest of the original soundtrack. While it has lively songs like the one that plays when the group enter Formicum, the OST mostly sticks with mystery vibes and everyday tunes instead. Deliberate piano keys. Calm trumpets. Reminiscent wind instruments. Wild yet reserved violin strings. These tracks are all rather simple in design, but they support the anime well enough throughout the season.With the ED and the OST on one side, and the OP and the VA performances on the other side, “split” just about sums up Zero kara’s audio outing.ENJOYMENTMy initial impression of this anime was not favorable. I hardly liked anything that it set out to do: the bland characters, the plot direction, the different details at each turn. Just a whole lot of me shaking my head at its repeated, failed attempts to pull me in.Lo and behold, revisiting the show anew with fresh eyes and a fresh mind did not change my thoughts.Those characters? Mercenary is not funny or cool or interesting or nuanced. The best he can do is take up a lot of space on-screen as he complains out loud. Zero says “Wagahai” a lot, but her formality cannot distract from the fact that the pebbles on the sidewalk have more intrigue about them than she does. Thirteen is thirteen times too boring. And don’t even get me started on Albus, for I only need one simple word to describe her: annoying.That plot? Let’s just let Thirteen live as an innocent among us despite him literally prolonging a war that killed hundreds if not thousands of beastfallen, witches, and humans. Holdem kept a bunch of women as slaves, but we’ll forget about that whole aside I suppose. I couldn’t care less about the twist that Albus is Sorena’s granddaughter because I couldn’t care less about her.These extra details? Magic battles and usage were not entertaining. Mercenary and Holdem run through a crowd of people that somehow grows in size the longer they sprint. That one guy who got attacked at the secret hideout for the Sorcerers of Zero needlessly died because they stood around and did not bother to heal him.Admittedly, I’m being rather harsh right now on the anime. To its credit, it never really gets worse as each episode rolls along. Nothing that it presents is outright horrible or ill-conceived, and I can tell effort exists within this project. Yet because it remains consistent in a mired, mediocre state for nearly its entire run, the small grievances I have just pile up to the point that I cannot personally perceive it in a positive position.Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho does have something to show for itself, but so many of its decisions drag it down. The story and characters include a lot of that pushback, but the serviceable and questionable audiovisual elements don’t do a whole lot in return. Fiction or no, it writes out a lagging novel all the same.SUMMARYStory: Fine, the setting, the writing, and the themes have definite clout, but they each have a bunch of problems regarding exploration, nuance, and balance that ultimately affect the narrative’s executionArt & Animation: Fine, the visuals involved get the job done, nothing more and nothing lessCharacters: Bad, Mercenary’s open-ended arc leaves him as competent rather than solid, Zero is neither compelling nor connected, Albus is a necessary evil, Thirteen misses the mark, but at least a theme on indirect loneliness can be found among themMusic & Sound: Fine, an unfitting OP counteracts a nice ED, not all the VA performances pass, and the OST works, albeit in a very simple fashionEnjoyment: Terrible, boring characters, lame plot, and uninteresting detailsFinal Score: 3/10 written by one of its characters.

He scales the side of a cliff and climbs the outside of a castle to reach Zero and to tell her that what little brains he has were enough to convince himself that he had to be there for her despite his doubts. He even takes part in the final magic ritual (but not before a playful prod), indicating that, by this point, he has overcome his disdain for those arts to at least some miniscule extent.Zero kara gives Mercenary a rather appreciable arc to his character – except it flubs his finale. With his journey complete, he doesn’t receive his desire to become a human. He doesn’t get to settle down as an inn proprietor like he wanted to either. The audience doesn’t even get to learn his real name, missing out on a neat full-circle writing chance right at the end.Rather, the anime doubles down thrice. One, the beast part of soul is fused even tighter to him after the ritual. Two, he continues traveling with Zero. And three, he actively refuses to give his true name or learn Zero’s, saying, “Well, maybe it won’t be so bad if I’m a beastfallen a little while longer,” a statement that contradicts his base motivations. In short, this open-endedness to his arc stops him from being a solid character and closer to barely a competent one.Arguably, his line there follows a theme on being comfortable in one’s skin (or, in this case, fur). But that was never really a talking point of the show. Instead, what it focused on most was that of indirect loneliness. The audience sees it handily with Mercenary. As a beastfallen, he’s ostracized to some extent, he is belittled, and he cannot get along with humans or witches.Zero experiences such indirect loneliness as well. In fact, almost her entire character stems from this idea. It’s obvious from her interactions in the city and with Mercenary that, despite her skills, she doesn’t have a grasp on how regular life and normal society works. Seemingly because she has been kept in a cave for most of her life, knowing only faded pages for friends and an occasional peeking sun to keep her company. She explains as such periodically, too.As such, her connection to Mercenary means a lot to her since he’s one of the only people – beastfallen or otherwise – that she has ever bonded with. Unfortunately, Zero kara does not go too out of its way to build their relationship.That’s partly because of Albus, a necessary evil in this show. She basically represents the “other side,” the counterpoint to much of the plot’s discussion about the warring factions. She either introduces or says a line of thinking that relates to the sorcerers’ camp, and the anime proceeds to highlight why her naïve worldview isn’t as black-and-white as she may believe. Furthermore, without Serena around anymore, and realizing that her newfound friends do not necessarily agree with her stances, she as well goes through that same indirect loneliness.However, with her inclusion, she severely detracts from that key component of Zero kara: Zero and Mercenary’s relationship. With this third wheel constantly around and spinning, the two main characters of the anime hardly have any scenes just together to make their connection worthwhile.Not to mention that Zero is simply not a compelling character on her own, and the anime itself sidelines her for a sizable chunk of the last half of the season. This sidelining mirrors her time in the caves and coincides with that indirect loneliness, so it does make sense on a writing level. However, the anime spends very little time addressing her thoughts and her actions while in captivity to make it worth the time. So, when her climactic scene with Mercenary in the castle tower arrives, it’s nice in concept, but the foundation for it doesn’t exist or at the minimum doesn’t have the support required to elevate it to a strong level.Then there’s Thirteen, the weakest of the four. He appears roughly halfway through the season as a quasi-evil dude. Simultaneously, he acts as Zero’s caretaker and teacher (or to her, “brother”) during her cave times and, after his leave, a zealot to the cause of granting her the world that (he thought) she desires. Where she viewed magic as a tool that would benefit everyone, Thirteen saw that it would be nothing else besides a weapon for the common simpleton.His thinking somewhat comes true when his secret ploy upholds the inevitable abuse and misuse of this magic. As for his actual character, it does not uphold as well. Because of the mystery that surrounds him on a plot level, he never receives enough attention. There’s no tangible context to his rise as “Him.” His admiration of Serena has little to no basis. His feuds with Albus and Holdem do not have the necessary room to grow. He doesn’t relate to that indirect loneliness as well as the others. Just a weak character all in all.Overall, on the total execution scale, Mercenary rises above Zero, Albus, and Thirteen. But when Mercenary does not attain anything higher than competency, the cast here do not deserve much praise whatsoever.MUSIC & SOUNDAlthough last in order, the ending track wins first. Titled “Hajimari no Shirushi,” delicate piano keys and light acoustic strings calm the audience in their simple, gentle flow. Soft vocals accompany the instrumentals, upping the calmness of the piece that much more. The melodic pace moves the song along in a nice way, and the rise in tone changes its structure without taking anything away from that calming feel.Opposite the ED, the opening track heads for the back of the pact. Immediately, the sound of this piece is entirely unfitting. It would be appropriate for a story aimed at something slightly whimsical rather than serious like Zero kara. The vocals aren’t shabby, and the beat has a catchiness to it, but the punk-rock body of the song simply detracts from the established direction of the content itself.Tsuyoshi Koyama as Mercenary likewise hurts the show’s chances. To start, his voice for the white-furred beastfallen does not go deep enough to match his build. The delivery of his lines lacks emotion, too. And roars sound less like a ferocious tiger and more like a guy frustrated from stubbing his toe on a nearby table. Not that his performance is a total failure – it just didn’t embody the main character in full.Less frustrating is the rest of the original soundtrack. While it has lively songs like the one that plays when the group enter Formicum, the OST mostly sticks with mystery vibes and everyday tunes instead. Deliberate piano keys. Calm trumpets. Reminiscent wind instruments. Wild yet reserved violin strings. These tracks are all rather simple in design, but they support the anime well enough throughout the season.With the ED and the OST on one side, and the OP and the VA performances on the other side, “split” just about sums up Zero kara’s audio outing.ENJOYMENTMy initial impression of this anime was not favorable. I hardly liked anything that it set out to do: the bland characters, the plot direction, the different details at each turn. Just a whole lot of me shaking my head at its repeated, failed attempts to pull me in.Lo and behold, revisiting the show anew with fresh eyes and a fresh mind did not change my thoughts.Those characters? Mercenary is not funny or cool or interesting or nuanced. The best he can do is take up a lot of space on-screen as he complains out loud. Zero says “Wagahai” a lot, but her formality cannot distract from the fact that the pebbles on the sidewalk have more intrigue about them than she does. Thirteen is thirteen times too boring. And don’t even get me started on Albus, for I only need one simple word to describe her: annoying.That plot? Let’s just let Thirteen live as an innocent among us despite him literally prolonging a war that killed hundreds if not thousands of beastfallen, witches, and humans. Holdem kept a bunch of women as slaves, but we’ll forget about that whole aside I suppose. I couldn’t care less about the twist that Albus is Sorena’s granddaughter because I couldn’t care less about her.These extra details? Magic battles and usage were not entertaining. Mercenary and Holdem run through a crowd of people that somehow grows in size the longer they sprint. That one guy who got attacked at the secret hideout for the Sorcerers of Zero needlessly died because they stood around and did not bother to heal him.Admittedly, I’m being rather harsh right now on the anime. To its credit, it never really gets worse as each episode rolls along. Nothing that it presents is outright horrible or ill-conceived, and I can tell effort exists within this project. Yet because it remains consistent in a mired, mediocre state for nearly its entire run, the small grievances I have just pile up to the point that I cannot personally perceive it in a positive position.Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho does have something to show for itself, but so many of its decisions drag it down. The story and characters include a lot of that pushback, but the serviceable and questionable audiovisual elements don’t do a whole lot in return. Fiction or no, it writes out a lagging novel all the same.SUMMARYStory: Fine, the setting, the writing, and the themes have definite clout, but they each have a bunch of problems regarding exploration, nuance, and balance that ultimately affect the narrative’s executionArt & Animation: Fine, the visuals involved get the job done, nothing more and nothing lessCharacters: Bad, Mercenary’s open-ended arc leaves him as competent rather than solid, Zero is neither compelling nor connected, Albus is a necessary evil, Thirteen misses the mark, but at least a theme on indirect loneliness can be found among themMusic & Sound: Fine, an unfitting OP counteracts a nice ED, not all the VA performances pass, and the OST works, albeit in a very simple fashionEnjoyment: Terrible, boring characters, lame plot, and uninteresting detailsFinal Score: 3/10', 'I think many reviews didn\'t do justice to this piece of work. Hence I created an account to write for this review.My first thought after I finished the show was : It makes me remember Spice and Wolf.-------------There is a reason why this show has a rating 7.2 or above 7 while the reviews has mixed feelings about it.1) The plot and characters are standard and nothing special.

There was some plot twist there and there, but it was mostly predictable anyway. I have nothing much to say about the story.

The heroine, Zero's art was done by Shimakaze's (Kancolle) artist and I'm a big fan of Shimakaze. So naturally I liked the design. I'm not a furry, but Mercenary was well designed. I love the opening. Period. The voice actors did a great job. Although most of the characters...were well-written. Their interactions were mostly cliches.

While it is not good, it did have a few things in it that at least made it enjoyable (bearable for others) at times to watch.Story: 5The sorest disappointment of this show is its story. As a huge fantasy fan, I was drawn in by the witch versus humans plot; but alas, the writers failed to pull it off. Their two biggest sins being a lack of focus and plenty of plot holes. Such as how long the war has been going...on, the nature of witches as a species, why did the story move in that direction, minimal effort was put into world building, etc. A lot of this could be forgiven as long as it didn\'t inhibit how the audience felt towards the show - which it did. The story distorted which side to root for without achieving an effective grey area. It\'s like the writers were trying to make the story morally ambiguous at times but they did it in such a sloppy way that they just confused the audience about how they should feel. Luckily, the story didn\'t do anything that made me livid (such as constant misunderstandings)- mainly wasted potential due to mediocre ideas and slopping execution of good ones. However, the traveling and subdued parts of the story were enjoyable. These moments felt a lot like Spice and Wolf at times and provided the most entertainment in the show.Art: 7The art was pleasant enough. Nothing fantastic or distracting, but the character designs were nice to look at. Thankfully, there were no still shots. My chief complaint though would be the lack of magical action scenes. I\'m fine if the anime is not meant to be a fighting anime. But when the story dictates that the characters will have to fight at times and the world has magic, then how come I can count on one hand how many fight scenes involved the protagonists using magic? A magic show without magic fight scenes is wasted potential. However, when they do have these scenes, the magic looks really nice.Sound: 7The OP and ED were not obnoxious and they fit the show well. The OST was not stand-alone fantastic but it served its purpose well. Other than Zero, the seiyuu were average but fit their characters. Zero\'s seiyuu I thought did an above average job.Character: 6Zero was the best character out of the cast so it was enjoyable to watch her interact with her Mercenary. Her teasing nature and noble air stood out to me. But like the other characters, the writers don\'t develop her much. As for the rest, they weren\'t terrible but not memorable characters. They had to potential to be memorable, but the writers just got lazy and didn\'t develop them much. I would have scored it higher if they didn\'t use the ""introduced as a corrupt villain but is actually a good guy at heart"" cliche.Enjoyment: 8Since I\'m a Spice and Wolf fan, I enjoyed some of the banter and fantasy-feel in this show. This is chiefly because I liked Zero\'s character though. I was disappointed by the lack of follow through, but nothing made me hate the show. It was short and story-driven enough to avoid boredom (even though the storytelling made it hard for me to care about what was happening) so I found fulfillment in watching it.Overall: 6I would have given it a higher score, but the story really hurt my impression of this show (especially in the second half.)

That's not to say the opening is bad but I feel that a heroic fantasy theme would have suited the opening a lot better, though...ending song is really nice.One of my favourite character design are Mercenary & Zero. Though some some characters had bland design like Holdem. In the earliest trailer back in late 2016, his outfit was originally green but got changed to red so I think green would have suited him better because it goes well with his nobility background.I like how the characters interact with each other & what they learn from each other.I recommend this anime to those who likes to watch an anime that has a nice fantasy & with a more mature background & characters like Mercenary that are bit realistic instead being all fan service.

Although not all of the light novels has been translated on that site but it is a good site to read & hopefully in the future it will get an official release & a 2nd season. ending song is really nice.One of my favourite character design are Mercenary & Zero. Though some some characters had bland design like Holdem.

I really appreciated that they went with a more classical fantasy (and classical whitches) and even though it didnt feel particularly well done, or interesting it was a nice breeze of fresh air with all the by the numbers isekai and game-like settings.Another big plus to me, was the super cute sequence at the very end...right before the end credits. The music, and visuals were super nice and it really made me regret breezing through this show as fast as I did.Cons-The character designs were ok nothing special and the characters themselves were pretty boring and standard. The biggest problem byfar is that alot of these characters have pretty standard troupes except for the fact that maybe they wanted them to feel more realistic so its insanely watered down meaning one of the few character traits they have is barely shown and insanely underplayed making them feel super boring.Art, sound, and such werent very interesting and just like the character designs were passable and fine nothing particularly good though.Story- Kinda bad, it felt super lackluster at times and if they had more humor or entertaining characters that coulda fixed that by filling up time and made each episode feel more eventful or entertaining. right before the end credits.

The opening premise in itself as well as it\'s main duo was what grabbed LA\'s attention for the anime and even then Zero and Mercenary\'s relationship (not-so romantic more like master and bodyguard) does develop ALOT in this anime be it through their trials and tribulations in their journey or their relationship being hindered by third parties. The other characters that have focus are Holdem voiced by Masayuki Katou who has beef with Mercenary and Albus voiced by You Taichi (a female seiyuu...HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM) who tags along with Mercenary and Zero who too wants to find the Grimoire of Zero. If anything the more interesting of the two is Holdem from his evolution from jerk who won\'t leave Mercenary alone to a quite noble person by the end of it, Albus on the other hand does become an important piece in the plot but quite early on, he\'s nothing but an annoyance in Zero and Mercenary\'s travels. Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho also has the added benefit of giving us world-building from all the subjects of fantastic racism as well as how the magic works given us through Zero and you know that LA loves when an anime does go into it\'s lore and how some spells work...however like it\'s edge on it\'s racism issues, the lore of magics in Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho also gets forgotten over time.So as much as LA is praising (kinda?) Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho, there are some obvious flaws LA purposely left out and some becomes vastly apparent. For one, you\'d think the anime would take a more action-orientated approach however for the first half it\'s more mystery and slice of life of all things that mixes in into this anime and to it\'s defence, the slice of life elements helps grow Zero and Mercenary (as well as Albus) both individually and their master and bodyguard relationship and explores a bit of world-building here and there, but aside from a few key points within those times...it just ""almost"" feels like filler until the major arc kicks it into high gear. Next is the more apparent one of plot holes and some plot twist within Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho not making sense in a ways (this revolves around Albus for one and our boring major villain) to the point it feels like the anime is making it up on the spot and covering it\'s tracks just for surprise value. Lastly is our boring major villain 13 voiced by Takehito Koyasu who is pretty much at the centre of the problems in this anime. From his quite confusing motivations (especially towards Zero) to his grand plan being utterly foiled by Zero by the end of it in a such an anti-climactic way, on that note, because of Zero\'s importance, she is essentially an extremely OP main character facading as a weak witch. 13 is probably the reason also for shifting focus from it\'s fantastic racism (from both fronts of the witches and beastfallen) to the more typical good vs. bad routine we\'ve seen time and again and again LA will mention that 13\'s ""defeat"" is anticlimactic to say the least.In terms of animation by White Fox, the animation is quite decent all things considered with some animation derps or dips in quality (though rare or blink before you miss it type), LA did like the character designs but was more favourable to Zero\'s attire by her end costume of the anime. The backgrounding was typical fair for a fantasy anime, but overall decent enough animation but not much praiseworthy.However in the voice acting department, LA will honestly say that LA was NOT expecting Yumiri Hanamori to sound like she did as Zero, for those who don\'t know, LA first noticed Yumiri Hanamori as the ditzy moe main lead Tsumujikaze Koyori from Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume to another ditzy moe main lead An Hanakoizumi from Anne Happy to have vocals like this as Zero!, seriously LA was surprised it was Yumiri Hanamori. To that the minor voice cast (however minimal) was decent but quite obviously...Yumiri Hanamori was a definite highlight in terms of voice acting in Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho.Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is one of those shows where yes it does have some major flaws at hand especially concerning it\'s tone and plot but does outweighing it\'s strengths of character interactions, unique main characters and it\'s edge on it\'s take on fantastic racism balance things out?.......for LA. No, ok trust LA this is an ""ok"" anime but it\'s flaws just outweigh strengths for LA to say it\'s a show to invest in, if only the first quarter. Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is ok, but collapsed in on itself when it was trying to get serious and anticlimaxes and plot holes arose as a result. Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho is the dark horse of the Spring 2017 that pretty much fell and tripped even by it\'s halfway point and it pains LA to even say that... is extremely apparent and Zero, a recluse witch in which Mercenary stumbles upon to begin their journey to find the titular ""Grimoire of Zero"".

All three characters are pretty likeable and especially in the first 3-4 episodes they show some good chemistry and its enjoyable see them traveling through the world.But this is where the positive aspects almost end.The story is the biggest weakness. At the moment...when the plot starts to get going the quality of the show goes downhill.Every reveal is so blatantly obvious that it's almost surprising that they really went for it. The plot isn't creative but it's far worse that it's presented in such an uninspired way.Character development is not really existent. Our protagonists stay the same throughout the whole season with no notable changes.The writing isn't consistent. Character traits are only shown when the plot need them. Otherwise they are forgotten pretty quickly. The show tries to introduce some questions about morality but because the plot is so predictable you already know how the authors will resolve these conflicts.Visuals are ok, I guess.Don't get me wrong. The show isn't complete garbage and it won't hurt your eyes but if you are hoping for innovative story twists, character development or even tension then this show is going to disappoint you. If you love the genre and you can deal with a generic and uninspired story, you can give it a try. when the plot starts to get going the quality of the show goes downhill.Every reveal is so blatantly obvious that it's almost surprising that they really went for it.

Armitage III: Poly-Matrix,https://myanimelist.net/anime/493/Armitage_III__Poly-Matrix,"['Considered to be a classic cyberpunk anime, it introduced a wave of cyberpunk and anime fans when this movie was released in 1995. However, it got overshadowed by Ghost In The Shell, which in the US became such a well-known anime movie but Armitage III had strong popularity in Japan, so that kinda counts. Armitage III Poly-Matrix is a must-see anime film for all cyberpunk and anime fans who missed this gem a long time ago.Welcome to the year 2046. The Earth became overpopulated and therefore, mankind created a colonization in Mars with the help of first type"" androids and built the city of Saint...Lowell. Seventy years later, the city is inhabited by humans and ""Second-type"" androids, which are improvements over the first type and this new robots talk and react like real humans. On the space-port, a man named Ross Sylllibus arrives on Mars to meet his new partner, a young woman named Naomi Armitage, which for a partner she does know how to dress up nicely. However, all hell goes down when Armitage stops a man with a briefcase that she shot down and in the case, they find the body of a country singer named Kelly McCannon, which turns out that she\'s a ""third-type"" robot, able to act like a human but in a more advanced realistic way. Now humanity loses faith on the robots and now hellbent on destroying every last one of them, Armitage and Ross must now stop the man that\'s committing these murders and discover the secret of the ""third-type"" robots.As you probably know by now, the story is the main selling-point of this movie and why people love it so much. It asks the question of why did mankind create robots when in reality they want them dead cause robots are becoming smarter than their creators. Did we wanted to create robots for our miserable enjoyment, to treat them like slaves, to make us feel better or to have them do our dirty work for them on the city? While it doesn\'t go too deep, it still talks about the issues with man\'s relation with machine and the fear that machines will become stronger creatures than man itself, kind like The Terminator. The 2 main characters are charming and to my surprise, they are well developed. Armitage is a woman who is different from the rest of us but doesn\'t care about it cause she just wants man and machines to live together in the city and will do anything to protect her kind. Ross Syllibus is also a great character. He\'s a cop who lost trust on robots since his beloved one was murdered by a robot but in the end, he learns that not all robots are programmed to be killers and has faith that both kinds can live in harmony. The side characters are just boring, minus one character that I won\'t spoil here. They are useless and throughout this movie, they do nothing despite that there are riots in the city and no other cop does a damn thing about it.The animation by AIC, the animation company that worked on Oh My Goddess and Inspector Gadget, looks phenomenal for a  1995 anime film. The cyberpunk look is impressive, giving it a Blade-Runner inspiration style, and the water color art is beautifully rendered in the background. The English voice acting is good but you have to get used to them in order to appreciate it. Elizabeth Barkley starts off strong as Armitage and she gives a top-notch performance out of her character. Kiefer Sutherland starts weak as Ross cause he sounds bored at times but in the second half of the series, he does improve a bit more than the beginning of the film. The music is fantastic and it gives you chills on your spine on how well the music is composed here.Armitage III: Poly Matrix is a fantastic anime that should be watched by everyone. The story and themes are excellent, the 2 main characters are well-developed, the action is excellent, the animation is top-notch and the music is phenomenal. It\'s a great addition to the cyberpunk genre and I do hope that someone remake this film to a new generation of cyberpunks fans... In a good way of course. Lowell.

In a good way of course.', ""A product of the early 90's cyber-punk craze, Armitage the Third, like many other cyber-punk movies of the time, focused on robot/human relations and questions about what constituted as being human.The artwork is hand drawn in painstaking detail, as CGI was in it's infancy at the time, so the background artwork is very rich and complex. The main characters in the American dub were voiced by people who were A-list stars at the time, so you can expect great voice acting.One last word of warning though: Like many cyber-punk movies of the time, nudity and ultra-violence is prevalent throughout the movie. Certain naughty bits appear...on screen with no warning at all. on screen with no warning at all."", ""Trying not to be biased here, because time has changed my tastes somewhat and other opinions have made me think about it harder than I originally did, so this is tainted.  Probably not the right word, but we'll roll with that.On the surface we have a standard cyberpunk cop story set on Mars, with Naomi Armitage meeting her new partner, Ross Syllabus.  He's a cyborg with a deep disdain for electronic lifeforms, and it turns out she is secretly the next big step in that direction.And looking back this where it's issues lie.  An android capable of human conception?...Is it even possible?  OR necessary?  Add some odd interpretations of feminism and it's not the best write looking back.  It was okay even though I never realized it was very flawed.But it was a gateway title for me.  One of the first I'd seen and it stuck in my memory because of that.  I like the style, the soundtrack is good, and it was future spacey enough that I paid money for it when I had no way to get money.So warts and all, it's worth a watch.

Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch R2 Picture Drama,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5163/Code_Geass__Hangyaku_no_Lelouch_R2_Picture_Drama,"[""It's the same as the first series picture drama but a bit better.It follows the strory of the R2 series, like little stories between episodes, the sound keeps the same ground as in the first picture drama.What's best in this picture drama is the art, it has improved a lot and it has a lot more animation in it!Overall i enjoyed this one very much, the stories are very good and it show us the background and thoughts of the characters very well as in the first picture drama. "", 'For those who’s wondering whether to watch these picture dramas, I have written short summaries for each episode:1. Sad and edgy Suzaku2. Kallen and C.C chat (happens before r2)3. Student council “handmade dress party”4. Kallen, C.C. and the Chinese Federation5. At Clovis’ casino6. Pyjama party—with all the cool girls and the white-haired loli7. Rolo: the Story (offers insight into his character)8. C.C and Cécile discuss ”da future and stuff”...9. In the present (Bittersweet extension of r2 ending. Must watch.)Like the first picture drama, stationary images are used, the sequences are fully dubbed (voice acted) and they are around 5 minutes each. 9.

This and the fact that those are shorts really give wrong impression about what this picture drama is.So, what it is then? Just as first season\'s specials, those are short stories focused around R2 story, with some telling about things from past and last episode happening after R2 epilogue. The reason why I\'m saying to ignore genres is how meaningful this special is. While there is some fanservice, all episode add to the main story and are on the serious side. Some also hit in the feels.Just as the title says, it\'s a picture...drama. In other words still frames with voice (and subs) telling story. It\'s worth mentioning that art is far better than in previous picture drama - here all episodes use same drawing style and move ""panels"" through screen for better effects. It looks less like random collection of leftover frames put together into something and more like actual work of art.Personally I really liked the way it looked and didn\'t have any problems with it not being full animation.Characters and music are from main series, so there is no reason to comment on that.I really recommend watching it to anyone who enjoyed both seasons of Code Geass. Even if you generally don\'t like picture dramas, I encourage you to give it a try - it\'s worth it. drama. In other words still frames with voice (and subs) telling story.
